FT  23 APR 93 / Castro keeps observers guessing over successor: The last
months have offered insights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the Cuban economy in a state of collapse following the end of economic
support from the Soviet Union, many observers believe the subject of Fidel
Castro's successor is out of the president's hands.
But for those who believe Mr Castro will be able to hand over power
peacefully, the last few months have provided some interesting material.
First, Mr Castro indicated he might step down in five years' time. Then he
appointed as foreign minister last month the inexperienced Mr Roberto
Robaina, a possible sign that the 37-year-old former leader of the Union of
Young Communists is being groomed for leadership.
Mr Castro, recently re-elected as president of Cuba's council of state for a
further five years, indicated he had made no decision on his retirement,
only that he hoped it would not be necessary for him to be president after
his new term. These public musings to foreign journalists have, however,
been played down in Cuba's domestic media.
The Cuban leader, now 66, has spoken repeatedly of the need to
'reinvigorate' the revolution, suggesting that younger leaders are needed.
Mr Robaina, who will be 42 at the end of the president's current term, fits
the bill.
Although he has flirted with cosmetic changes to policy, Mr Robaina's public
ideology is almost identical to Mr Castro's. He has, however, attempted to
modernise the image of the party, for example by organising pop concerts in
an attempt to keep young Cubans faithful.
Should the foreign minister falter in the race or fall out of favour, Mr
Castro has several options. One is Mr Carlos Lage, architect of the economic
policies with which the government has been fighting the setbacks of the
last two years. Mr Lage, 42, has hinted at some moderation in economic
policy, and has been pushing foreign investment in the Cuban economy.
The losers now appear to be Mr Raul Castro, the president's brother who is
the first vice-president and the armed forces minister, and Mr Ricardo
Alarcon, former foreign minister who is now president of the National
Assembly. If President Castro favours youth, both of these men are likely to
be overlooked. Mr Alarcon will be 60 in five years, while the younger Castro
will be 66.
President Castro may also be concerned that, were he to leave office without
identifying a successor, pretenders to the presidency or the army could be
drawn into a fight, defeating his hopes for a seamless transition.
Although Cuba's campaign to attract foreign investment represents a big
about-turn in economic policy, Mr Castro's ideological rhetoric remains much
the same. He continues to argue that Cuba will not abandon the socialism of
the revolution despite heavy foreign economic pressure.
He has said, however, that if his departure from office would lead the US to
lift its crippling 30-year embargo, he would go immediately.
US government officials say that barring a reversal of policy by President
Bill Clinton, the dismantling of the embargo and normalisation of relations
between Washington and Havana would depend on more than Mr Castro's stepping
aside.
Loosening the Cuban Communist party's grip on the country and the
installation of a popularly elected government through multi-party voting is
the required minimum.
While some observers argue that the worst of Cuba's economic problems
following the end of Soviet support are over and that the economy is showing
signs of a modest recovery, the country still faces shortages of food and
other basic supplies which have been compounded by damage from the recent
storms.
Despite all the setbacks, Mr Castro remains truculent - Cuba, he says, will
successfully battle its political enemies and natural disasters, in order to
protect socialism.

FT  23 APR 93 / Help on way for industry in Argentina: Menem to unveil big
loans and tax package next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is to introduce an ambitious support programme for its industry,
battered by heavy import competition and declining prices.
Details of the package are not clear yet, but President Carlos Menem is
expected to announce on May 1 measures including Dollars 4.5bn in loans for
industry and agriculture and elimination of several taxes, especially a 1
per cent tax on corporate assets.
The package will also include a 'modification' in trade policy. This could
include stricter enforcement of 'fair trade' regulations, such as
anti-dumping rules, as well as a new shift in import tariffs that were last
adjusted upwards last October.
The package coincides with alarm over Argentina's widening trade deficit.
Private economists now expect the deficit to rise to Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn
this year, after a Dollars 2.87bn trade gap in 1992. Originally, the
government had promised the deficit would fall by half this year.
An Economy Ministry official denied the measures implied a softening of
Argentina's free market policies. He said the Dollars 4.5bn loans 'are not
incentives or tax exemptions or anything like that. They are directed at
companies that have put their house in order.'
The government's main objective was to increase companies' international
competitiveness by reducing their operating costs and thus releasing
pressure on an already overvalued currency, he said. Companies would borrow
from the state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina at better terms than from
private banks. This would force the banking system to lend more to
capital-starved industry and less to consumers.
However, no firm figures are available on the cost of this package. Some
economists claim the government's budget surplus is under great pressure.
But officials say Argentina easily met IMF targets that called for a Dollars
950m budget surplus in the first quarter.

FT  23 APR 93 / Alabama's governor guilty of funds fraud

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Guy Hunt of Alabama was removed from office yesterday after being
found guilty of diverting to his personal use money raised for his inaugural
ceremonies, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Hunt - who will be replaced by a Democrat, Lieutenant Governor Jim Folsom
 -was Alabama's first Republican governor since the reconstruction period
after the civil war. He faces up to 10 years in prison, but could be
reinstated if the conviction were overturned on appeal.
A Montgomery jury found Mr Hunt guilty of violating the state ethics law by
using Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 130,000 from a fund intended to help pay for
his 1987 inauguration to buy personal property and pay off personal debts.
Mr Hunt said he had used the money properly to pay off debts from his
unsuccessful 1978 campaign for governor.

FT  23 APR 93 / Ukraine alters key nuclear clause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday revived fears of a resurgence of nuclear
tension in eastern Europe when it put into question the country's commitment
to become a non-nuclear state.
In a closed session, the deputies in the Kiev parliament changed a key
clause in a draft on military doctrine which read that Ukraine would in
future become a non-nuclear state to read that nuclear weapons would stay on
its territory for a 'transitional period', according to deputies after the
session last night.
Ukraine has 176 strategic nuclear missiles in its possession and under its
control - in spite of repeated demands by Russia that it allow these
missiles, part of the forward Soviet nuclear force, to remain under complete
Russian control.
The country has also so far refused to sign either the Start 1 or Start 2
treaties - a refusal which is jeopardising Russia's ratification of Start 2.
The ultimate decision and technical means to fire the missiles remain in
Moscow. However, Russian security analysts said this week that Ukraine was
capable of developing its own command and control system rapidly in a short
period.
Despite the change, the draft doctrine fell some 37 votes short of being
adopted when put to a vote of the deputies. According to Mr Stepan Khmara, a
nationalist deputy, the draft was turned down because of continued
dissatisfaction that it was 'too mild'.
Earlier, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, had told a noisy
chamber that the country must sign Start 1 and claim non-nuclear status.
At the same time, Mr Kravchuk said that Ukraine had the right to expect
greater compensation from the west for destroying the weapons. A senior
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that 'if the US had given
money for this before, we wouldn't be having such debates today'.
Ukraine has asked for Dollars 2bn to help liquidate its nuclear weapon
stock.
Parliament is due to return to the issue of the military doctrine next
month. However, even liberal deputies were last night forecasting that the
likely trend in the parliament was towards retention of nuclear force for
the foreseeable future.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (36): POSTScript

<TEXT>
HAS THE smaller companies revival really begun in earnest? There were
certainly signs of a revival in the first quarter of 1993, and that makes
the short-term returns from the smaller company funds for once look
respectable. Notice how the average smaller company unit trust has produced
the same return over one year that it has over five.
It is normally good news for collective fund managers when smaller companies
start to outperform their larger rivals. For a start, it makes it a lot
easier to beat the indices, which are dominated by the largest stocks.
Secondly, the market in small company shares is a lot less efficient (fewer
analysts look at the stocks) and there is thus greater potential for the
smart fund manager to find a bargain.
Over the very long term, smaller companies have been shown to produce
superior returns. But the specific risk of investing in an individual small
company is very high - many are dependent on the prospects of a single
product or customer. The argument for investing via a collective fund is
thus all the stronger.
Unfortunately, as all too often happens, the discovery of the 'small company
effect' altered the rules. Investors piled into small companies in 1986 and
1987, pushing many shares to ridiculous levels. When the crash of October
1987 arrived, it proved impossible to sell the small company holdings. On
top of the problem of unwilling shareholders, small companies were then hit
by high interest rates and the recession. The result was four consecutive
years of small company underperformance, something which had never happened
before in the period since 1955, according to Hoare Govett.
Now at last, with low interest rates and signs of economic recovery,
investor interest is returning to those small companies which have survived
the last few years.
Among the investment trusts which specialise in the field, the one that
stands out is Foreign &amp; Colonial Small Companies. It is first (out of 16) in
the sector over five years, and is also top over three years, second over
two years and third over one year. The result of this fine record is that
the shares trade at net asset value, and so the investor who buys now faces
the risk of a discount widening.
Among the unit trusts in the sector, Edinburgh UK Smaller Companies stands
out as having a top-four performance over all periods from one year to 10
years. Lazard UK Small Companies Growth is also in the top quartile (best 25
per cent) over those periods.
Turning to the trusts with a shorter history, Baillie Gifford UK Smaller
Companies, Royal Life UK Emerging Companies, S&amp;W Smaller Securities and
Thornton UK Smaller Companies have all shown consistently good relative
performance records.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (33): The risk now
is of living too long - And the rising cost of old age means the family home
is ceasing to be an inheritance / Long-Term Care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PEOPLE USED to need insurance against the financial consequences of dying
too soon. Now, the danger of living too long looks greater. Illnesses which
half a century ago would probably have killed people now succeed only in
incapacitating them.
The result, according to the Office of Population and Census, is that the
number of pensioners will increase by 50 per cent in the first 30 years of
the next century, when there will be 79 dependants for every 100 people of
working age. In 1991 there were 63.
So people can now expect to have a much longer retirement. That ought to be
good news for everyone. However, the chances are much greater that the last
years will be spent in expensive long-term care.
The price of long-term care is rising much more quickly than most other
prices, and this is costing the country a lot of money - around Pounds 6.5bn
in 1991, according to Commercial Union.
Average weekly prices for private residential homes rose to Pounds 209 in
1991 from Pounds 190 in 1990, according to Laing's Review of Private Health
Care. However, this conceals regional variations - in Greater London the
figure increased from Pounds 255 to Pounds 282, while in Wales it increased
from Pounds 176 to Pounds 192. Social security to pay for long-term care is
means-tested, and is limited to those with savings (including the value of
their home) of Pounds 8,000 or less.
In most cases, the costs are being addressed by selling off an asset whose
value is falling - the house. According to an estimate prepared for PPP
Lifetime by Chris Hamnett, of Nuffield College, Oxford, property worth
around Pounds 2.5bn is sold to finance long-term care each year.
This does nothing to improve the spirits of the nation's heirs, and so the
search is on for a less painful way of financing long-term care. More
long-term saving and less spending for today looks, regrettably, as though
it could be essential.
Not surprisingly, the insurance industry has spotted the opportunity, and is
now busily looking for products which will work. It is also trying, so far
without success, to persuade the government to help out with some tax
reliefs.
None of the long-term care packages launched so far is identical to any
other. However, they fall into three classes:
Insurance
Insurers are always nervous about taking on risks as potentially vast as
this, particularly when there is little or no claims experience to go on.
However, Commercial Union, followed by Aetna, MGI Prime and PPP have all
done so, while BUPA, another massive player in the health market, has made
clear its intention to follow suit in some form.
The policies all work by defining a set number of Activities of Daily Living
(ADLs). Once the policyholder is unable to perform a pre-defined number of
ADLs (and they include such tasks as being able to walk, eat, or use the
toilet unaided), then the policy will start paying for care.
Some plans take a much more direct interest in the provision of care, and
make payments to the nursing home (this is the approach taken by PPP, for
example), while others make a payment direct to the patient. MGI Prime
provides a larger list of ADLs than the others, while Aetna's contract is a
unit-linked life policy, which allows an investment element - an attractive
option for those who are nervous that they may never need to claim.
These policies are expensive, and should be viewed, according to Sandy
Johnstone, of CU, as insurance against a risk. They form a part of a
financial planning package, he says, but are no substitute for other
long-term savings: they are an addition.
PPP Lifetime's premiums give an idea of the sums involved, and the need to
start sooner rather than later. A 30 year-old man can cover weekly nursing
home fees of Pounds 323 with a monthly premium of Pounds 30, and this figure
does not increase by the age of 40. At 50, cover for weekly fees of Pounds
300 will cost just under Pounds 32 per week, while those starting at 60 will
need to pay Pounds 44.78 (for men) and Pounds 45.07 (for women).
Pensions
One product on the market allows you to sacrifice some of your income in the
early years of retirement in return for sharply increased payments, should
you become incapacitated and require long-term care. Cannon Lincoln offers
the Oasis Plus annuity, where your initial income on retirement is reduced
by 10 per cent, compared with a normal annuity. If you reach 85, or when you
become unable to look after yourself (defined by using ADLs), the pension
will escalate by at least 50 per cent. If you choose a level annuity, and
retire at 50, this increase could be 300 per cent for men and 250 per cent
for women. However, Cannon Lincoln does not usually offer one of the highest
annuity rates.
Ease-of-payment packages
These are purely financial options, making no attempt to manage the care at
the point where it is provided. If a relative is about to go into a home,
careful financial planning techniques can convert a lump of capital,
possibly taken from the sale of a house, into a higher income.
Two special packages on the market come from Pearl and Clerical Medical.
Both buy an annuity, back-to-back with an investment which aims to grow
sufficiently to replace the capital spent on the annuity. Pearl offers a
with-profits bond, while Clerical Medical backs the annuity with unit
trusts. Both of these plans make sense, although there is nothing to stop
you shopping around for the best annuity, while trying to pick your
favourite investment for growth.
While government and industry try to wrestle with the problem, two messages
become coldly clear.
First, whatever products emerge in the coming years, long-term saving is
important and should be started as soon as possible. This means
tax-efficient collective vehicles, such as unit and investment trust Peps,
as well as pensions.
Second, the notion that the family house can be relied on as an inheritance
has to be abandoned. It cannot. The money people earn during their career
may now only just be enough to last them for the rest of their lives.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): Royalty on a
plate, is it a mug's game? - Not if your expectations are modest, for the
value of monarchic memorabilia depends largely on rarity in a field of mass
production / Alternative Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORTUNES of the royal family, both literal and philosophical, may be on
the wane at the moment but this should not affect its appeal to collectors
of royal memorabilia. Indeed, since scarcity is the best friend of value, it
could make this an even more desirable area for modest investment.
For example, the second wedding of the Princess Royal, in December, was a
quick and quiet affair, an almost invisible event compared with her first
trip to the altar, which had taken place at Westminster Abbey amid media
glare.
As a result, the companies involved in the Pounds 10m business of royal
memorabilia had little time to get their act together. Only one mug, priced
at Pounds 19.99, or Pounds 39.95 in a grand edition of 1,000, was readily
available to celebrate the occasion.
But in 100 years' time this mug, especially in its limited edition, will be
more valuable than the mass of objects produced to mark her earlier,
grander, wedding. For the price of royal commemorative ware is determined
partly by the popularity of the person honoured, but above all by rarity.
Objects made in vast numbers acquire little value, and since mid-Victorian
times transfer-printing, plus speedy transportation, have ensured that
events like the jubilees of Queen Victoria, and the births, weddings,
coronations and deaths of her heirs, have been commemorated by the
manufacture of millions upon millions of items of celebratory memorabilia by
all the leading potteries of the day. Much of it has been treasured and
preserved, further reducing its rarity.
This makes it a popular collecting field, with prices well within the range
of virtually everyone, but anathema to the speculative investor. Prices have
risen steadily, if unspectacularly, in the past 20 years, stimulated by
increasing media coverage of the doings of the royal family; but a
Staffordshire cup and saucer, marketed to celebrate Queen Victoria's
jubilee, can usually be acquired for less than Pounds 50, and a coronation
mug of King George V1 and Queen Elizabeth for less than Pounds 30.
A popular misconception is that items celebrating the coronation of King
Edward VIII are rare, because he was never actually crowned. But the
potteries were on-stream for months before the event, and the Commemorative
Collectors Society has estimated that there are more than 400 separate
designs for his coronation souvenirs. A simple mug goes for about Pounds 50,
depending on its condition. Even with the slogan 'Abdicated' printed across
it, the value is only marginally greater. More valuable would be a mug
commemorating his birth in 1894: a rare example might make Pounds 500.
This is still a market dominated by enthusiastic amateurs. Unfortunately, if
you are mercenary enough to regard commemorative wares as an investment, the
best tip is to collect limited-numbered editions by the most respectable
potteries, like Royal Doulton and Wedgwood, and hide them away for a
generation inside their original packaging.
But beware: there are many ceramics manufacturers churning out mugs or
plates, claiming that they are an edition limited to 100 days of firing at a
pottery - yet within that time, many millions of items can be produced. The
limited editions promoted through advertisements provide a collecting,
rather than an investment, opportunity - except for the potter: items
selling for Pounds 60 can cost less than Pounds 1 to manufacture.
Most items of royal memorabilia sell for less than Pounds 200. But this is a
vast field and there are related pieces which can sell for many thousands of
pounds. At the extreme, a late 17th century Delftware plate, with portraits
of King Charles II and his Queen, would be valued at over Pounds 10,000,
depending on its condition. This is perhaps a different market, appealing to
the (mainly) American collectors of early English pottery. The mid-18th
century Jacobite wine glasses, with a prayer on the rim preserving the
health of Bonnie Prince Charlie, could be much more, up to Pounds 30,000.
Indeed, some of the most sought-after items of royal memorabilia could be
construed as anti-royalist. With echoes of modern times, there was a
dreadful row at the coronation of King George IV. His estranged wife
Caroline attempted to be crowned, too, and attracted much public sympathy
and a mass of commemorative ware. A three-inch-high jug which carries a
personal thought, 'Protect my mother', along with a portrait of the Queen
and 'God save Queen Caroline', could sell for over Pounds 400.
It was the long reign of Queen Victoria which brought commemorative ware
into every home in the country. Most collectors concentrate on a particular
subject, pottery, or personality, and Victoria appeals to all three groups.
The quality of the pieces marketed is extremely variable, but the more
primitive often have the most charm. A mug produced in Swansea in 1838 to
mark her accession shows her looking very young, with ringlets and a daring
decolletage. It is rare and sells for over Pounds 1,000 when it appears on
the market.
At the other extreme, Victoria's diamond jubilee was greeted with the
release of millions of mugs, which were often given to school children,
sometimes with the uplifting slogan, 'The Queen's earliest resolve - I will
be good'. These go for nearer Pounds 30.
Memorabilia about Prince Albert is rare, because the Queen's grief at his
early death was respected and little was released. This improves the value
of anything available. There are collectors of death mugs and plates. A
plate marking the passing of Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV,
might make up to Pounds 500; a mug tolling the death of William IV would be
Pounds 250.
There are collectors of everything. Of ceramics celebrating royal births, or
royal visits, whether to Canada or to Cardiff. Of biscuits tins, cigarette
boxes, lead models, tiles, tea-towels featuring the royal family. Among the
most valuable items are gifts specially created by the leading 19th century
potters for presentation to members of the royal family at special events,
like the opening of a town hall or railway station. One or two copies were
always made as stand-bys, and when these appear at auction they go for well
over Pounds 1000.
Collecting royal commemorative items is like travelling down a vast and
crowded highway, but one with many interesting side roads. And it is a
market that is constantly expanding. It takes about five years for the few
interesting items to appreciate in value, and it is often hard to predict
what collectors will fight over.
Most recently, a mug of the Prince of Wales, with a massive ear for a
handle, caught the fancy, and now sells for up to Pounds 20. But most
collectors are keen buyers, rather than speculative sellers. It is a big,
happy market for everyone.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Crusader
against life's unfairness - Disclosure is the means by which an ex-insurer
would reform the industry / Hindsight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOEL JOFFE, one of the most eloquent advocates of reform of the life
assurance industry, benefits more from hindsight than most people.
He was a founding director of Allied Dunbar, now the UK's biggest
unit-linked life assurance company; and, with colleagues Sir Mark Weinberg
and Sir Sydney Lipworth, helped to revolutionise the life industry during
the 1960s and 1970s. He retired as deputy chairman only two years ago.
What has moved him to change tack? 'I felt very strongly about the consumer
getting a fair deal and knowing what the pitfalls with products were. I
tried within the industry to change things. Back in 1985, when regulation
was being considered, I submitted a paper which says exactly what I'm saying
now.'
He certainly does not feel that the consumer is getting a fair deal at
present, and his views seem to be getting across.
His submission is believed by many to have had a big impact on the Office of
Fair Trading, whose report published last month sent shock-waves through the
life assurance industry. Its main provisions recommended that companies
should disclose far more about the underlying costs of life assurance
policies.
Mr Joffe supported that report, and gave his reasons in evidence to the
House of Commons select committee on social security.
He said: 'Life insurers are very generous in explaining the benefits of
policies to the consumer in order to sell them, but they are very reticent
about the drawbacks.'
One serious example is the surrender value. This jargon term refers to the
amount of money that policyholders will receive if they stop paying premiums
before a policy has matured. The MPs' attention was directed towards
statistics compiled by the OFT, which showed how badly policyholders were
penalised if they surrendered a 25-year policy after 20 years - when 80 per
cent of the premiums would already have been paid.
The OFT figures for the UK's 20 largest life companies showed that the
20-year surrender value was on average 57 per cent lower than the maturity
value. This varied widely between companies, with total reductions varying
from 47.1 per cent at best to 70.3 per cent at worst. Differences in final
maturity values were much less marked.
According to Mr Joffe: 'The reason is self-evident. The insurance company
wants to sell the policy in the first place by projecting these quite
attractive maturity values, but doesn't draw the attention of the consumer
to the fact that, if they cancel it, they get back about half of what they
would get if they took out the same plan with another company.'
Mr Joffe has argued his case with skills in advocacy honed in a rather more
dangerous environment. As a young lawyer in South Africa, he defended Nelson
Mandela at the Rivonia trial of 1962. He left the country soon afterwards,
because he and his wife did not feel happy to bring up children there.
That assignment required rather more courage than his current crusade
against life insurers. 'They removed my passport, and I didn't enjoy having
the special branch outside my office and my phone tapped. With the British
life industry you get accustomed to being attacked verbally, but in South
Africa you were more bothered about being attacked physically. I feel
happier dealing with the words.'
Disclosure is the main weapon Mr Joffe would use to force the industry into
line, but he also has some other positive proposals. He believes that the
current problem of 'regulatory arbitrage' must be stopped. The Financial
Services Act established a regime of self-regulation, which meant that banks
and building societies could choose their own regulator.
The industry is trying to form a new unified body called the Personal
Investment Authority. But, as self-regulation is being maintained, no
individual company can be forced to join it. This is the problem of
regulatory arbitrage, which allows companies effectively to choose the
softest regulator.
Mr Joffe would like to give the PIA a chance of success, but, he told the
MPs: 'If it doesn't, there's an urgent need for statutory regulation, which
would replace the PIA with a system probably along the lines of Oftel or
Ofgas, which would be able to take firm action to ensure that the consumer
gets a fair deal. I am hopeful for the PIA, but I am not optimistic.'
Another reform he is aiming for is an examination for sales agents,
administered by a central body. This would allow professional-type
qualifications, and would ensure competent sales people. 'That might lead to
more objective advice aimed at high quality sales which endure, rather than
the high quantity sales encouraged by many life offices at present.'
He does not enjoy his campaign, which is motivated primarily by a sense of
justice. But Mr Joffe, now aged 60, has other crusades which do give him
great pleasure. For the past six years he has been chairman of the executive
committee of Oxfam, the famine relief charity, and he is in the process of
setting up an NHS Trust in Swindon, where he lives.
While at Allied Dunbar, he worked from within to make it one of Britain's
most socially responsible companies. He was a member of the working party
which founded the Per Cent Club with Sir Mark Weinberg, and Lord Laing of
United Biscuits as joint chairmen. Members of the Per Cent Club are
companies which give at least 0.5 per cent of their profits to charity.
Given all his criticism of the industry, and scepticism about sales methods,
it may seem surprising that he feels that life insurance salesmen are not
the main culprits. Instead, he holds to the belief which informed the Per
Cent Club that company directors have a heavy social duty, particularly when
dealing with the public's savings.
His words, coming from a man who once sat on the board of one of the land's
most powerful insurers, should be marked well: 'The people who bear the
responsibility are the boards of management of insurance companies. It's
they who invent the remuneration systems, it's they who push for selling
regardless of quality, and it's they who are responsible for the design of
the products and the literature.'

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Make the most
of slow recovery - As recession keeps the spotlight on gilts and other
fixed-interest securities, the wisest approach for many is through
collective funds / The experts' panel / Bond Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY commentators are currently urging investors to consider bonds, because
of the high and fixed returns they offer.
But how should they do it? It is possible to buy bonds direct, via the Post
Office. But many investors might prefer to rely on the expertise of a
professional, and gain exposure to the sector via a bond fund.
Accordingly, we asked our experts to select bond funds, either UK or
internationally-based, which they would recommend to the private investor.
David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott: 'Given the dramatic fall in UK interest
rates in the past nine months, attention has become focused on alternative
investments that offer a high level of income, together with a lower degree
of investment risk than that associated with the equity market.
'International bonds and fixed-interest securities offer investors the
opportunity to secure high rates of interest, and, unlike cash, provide the
prospect for capital growth as interest rates fall.
'The background for bond funds is generally agreed to be quite positive.
Most of the world's major economies have either negative or slow economic
growth, and low inflation. Thus reductions in interest rates to boost
economic recovery are one option still open to governments worldwide. As a
sterling investor, now that the pound is outside the exchange rate
mechanism, the potential for currency gains is undoubtedly higher.
'As with all investments, however, it is important to determine the level of
investment risk you are prepared to take. It is vitally important to retain
a prudent balance between equity, fixed interest and cash deposits within a
portfolio.
'Since the majority of gilt-edged stocks are now trading 'above par',
investors may care to consider gilt funds in order not to lock into a
capital loss at maturity date. My own preferred gilt funds at present are:
Whittingdale Gilt Income Fund and Kleinwort Benson's offshore Gilt Fund.
'Given that many of the major world economies are still in recession, and
recovery is believed to be lagging the UK by six to nine months, I believe
that there are considerable opportunities available for investors within the
international bond market. The majority of international, fixed-interest and
bond funds are based offshore, but in the last 12 months there have been
some 30-plus UK authorised onshore international bond and fixed-interest
funds launched.
'My current recommendations are: Mercury Global Bond Fund and Baring Global
Bond Trust (both onshore); and offshore, Baring International Bond Fund and
Hambros Emma Sterling Bond.
'Deposit rates in the UK have fallen dramatically over the last couple of
years, and many savers will have suffered a huge cut in their deposit
income. I would suggest that clients should, therefore, be looking at
opportunities that fixed-interest and global bond funds offer. In many cases
they have consistently outperformed building society investments, even
during times of high interest rates, and they currently provide an extremely
competitive yield.'
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services: 'Investors in the UK are still
under-weight in gilts and bond funds. Whilst many investors buy gilts
direct, the most frequently chosen route for international bonds is a bond
fund via a unit trust, because of the management element, ease of dealing,
known costs and quantifiable performance.
'International bond funds also give investors an exposure to other
currencies as well as other economies.
'In addition to the choice between gilts and international bond funds, there
is the further complication that there are both onshore and offshore funds.
'In my selection of authorised gilts and fixed-interest funds, I have also
included preference funds, simply because one of the top-performing funds in
the long, medium and short term is Commercial Union's Preference Income
fund. In the medium term, my selection would include Whittingdale's Short
Dated Gilt fund, Abbey's Gilt and Fixed Interest fund and Henderson's Fixed
Interest fund.
'Over the long term, many of the offshore gilt-edged funds have not
performed as well as their onshore cousins, although Foreign &amp; Colonial's
Sterling Bond fund, TSB's Gilt Edged fund and Guinness Global Sterling Gilt
fund all merit inclusion in the medium term.
'When looking at the international bond funds over the long term, there is
little to choose between the onshore performance of Save &amp; Prosper's
International and Abbey's Worldwide Bond fund when compared with their
offshore competitors of GT's Bond and Baring International's Bond funds.
Over the medium term, however, the offshore funds have performed better,
with Baring's International Bond being consistently the pick of the bunch.
'As someone once said, 'you pay your money and you pick your bond', but with
interest rates in Europe set to fall further and the possibility of further
falls in sterling, international bonds remain my favourites. The pedigree of
GT and Baring, coupled with their performance, make these two funds
outstanding.'
James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe: 'Probably the most fundamental reason
for looking at bonds and bond funds is that, at a time when yields are as
good or better than cash, and there is no upward pressure on interest rates,
bonds seem a very good and secure complement to cash.
'However, because low interest rates have been with us for a while, the
market has already moved to a large extent. Buying a gilt for the high yield
implies that, ultimately, the investor will suffer a capital loss on
redemption. At the longer end of the market, where the differential between
running and redemption yields is not so great, the investor runs the risk of
being locked into a fixed income for a long term - when (eventually) rising
inflation may begin to bite.
'Foreign bonds - in particular, European ones - appear to offer rather more.
Their interest rates are still on the way down, and there is still some room
for gain as well as an attractive yield. However, buying overseas bonds,
taking into account the currency risk etc., becomes incredibly difficult for
the private investor. It can also be a little expensive and, getting up to
the minute advice is not easy. So, despite my dislike for collective funds
in general, I have to confess that we have been moving clients into managed
bond and currency funds for a while.
'We like companies such as Guinness Flight and Hambros. GF offers funds
which invest almost entirely in bonds, and their long-term performance has
been quite impressive. They are also able to offer a portfolio of funds
which will produce a monthly income from fixed interest vehicles.
'Both GF and Hambros offer a range of funds denominated in specific
currencies and dealing in specific markets. They also offer broadly-based
managed funds in sterling, which I think are the most suitable, and long
term investments for most investors.
My preference is for the Hambros EMMA Managed fund, which is rather unusual
in that it combines currencies with bonds and is global in nature. For our
clients, with commission rebated, the cost of getting into the fund is only
0.86 per cent. The fund has grown by 26 per cent over the past year, and by
nearly 95 per cent over the past five years. The past year has obviously
been a particularly good one, but I think the bonds/currency market will
remain attractive. The fund is managed offshore, as are many of the GF ones.
GF also, though, have a range of UK-based unit trusts which are very
attractive.
Presently, the yield on these funds compares reasonably well with
straightforward sterling deposits. My particular preference for the currency
and bond mix, relates to the reason for buying management in the first
place.
Ultimately, there will be a time when one should move out of bonds. Interest
rates will rise again one day and, when they do, investors will be better
served by a fund manager who has gradually reduced his exposure to bonds in
favour of cash. A fund manager whose remit is to make money solely in the
bond market might not have this option.'

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Income with a
chance of growth - Management teams are pursuing the double in a variety of
ways / What's New?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST INVESTORS have simple desires: high income plus guaranteed capital
gains with low risk.
They look to investment managers to provide as much as possible of this
implausible combination - preferably in one tax-free package. The variety of
ways in which companies respond has been fully reflected in the latest
products to reach the market.
Framlington's Quarterly Income Pep has an estimated yield of 5.4 per cent
annually tax-free. Based on a unit trust investing in a mix of equities,
including investment trusts, as well as bonds and convertibles, it will aim
to produce income in excess of the yield on the FT-A All-Share index.
Investors will also have a chance of capital growth, because of the
predominantly equity-based nature of the investment.
Framlington's charges on the Pep are an initial 5 per cent and an annual 1.5
per cent. Income is to be paid out on the 9th days of January, April, July
and October, beginning on July 9 this year.
CITIBANK LIFE's Global Market Bonus bond is a non-qualifying,
single-premium, whole life assurance policy linked to a fund run by
Schroder, offering investors protection against losses and a quarterly
lock-in of any capital gains achieved.
Each quarter, Schroder will pick three or more indices from a list that
includes Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Hong Kong,
Singapore, the UK and the US. Using derivative contracts, the managers will
aim to maximise capital growth without loss. Any gains made are to be added
to the value of the fund by way of an increased unit price.
The minimum investment in the bond is Pounds 3,000, and the charges are 5
per cent initially and 1 per cent annually. Brokers are to be paid 4.5 per
cent commission on the bonds. Bondholders who cash in during each of the
first three years will be charged 3 per cent, 2 per cent and 1 per cent
respectively.
GENERAL PORTFOLIO Life, possibly the only French-owned company to use a Duke
of Wellington silhouette as its logo, has launched a new series of its
Maximum Income Account, a single-premium insurance bond investing in
A1-rated banks, building societies and short-term fixed-rate bonds.
At launch, the MIA was offering an interest rate of 5.15 per cent on the
minimum investment of Pounds 10,000, rising to 5.36 per cent net on
investments of Pounds 50,000 and above. After the first three months,
investors can make withdrawals on demand without penalty.
General Portfolio notes that, unlike building society interest, income from
an insurance bond such as the MIA is not grossed up for the purposes of
assessing higher-rate tax. Under present tax rules, higher-rate taxpayers
can cash in up to 5 per cent of the original investment free of tax for up
to 20 years, using tax deferral allowances. Any excess over 5 per cent would
be taxed at the holder's highest rate but less the basic rate.
CATER ALLEN in Jersey has added an 'overnight account' to its offshore range
of accounts.
This is a deposit account with penalty-free access which pays interest gross
at 0.625 of a percentage point below the overnight rate for wholesale money.
During March, for example, the wholesale overnight rate ranged from 4.75 per
cent to 6.375 per cent.
The minimum deposit is either Pounds 50,000 in sterling or the equivalent in
dollars, Deutsche Marks, Ecus, French or Swiss francs, Spanish pesetas or
yen.
LLOYDS BANK's unit trust arm is targeting investors with Pounds 20,000 or
more, making this the minimum investment for two fund-of-fund type trusts,
called the Growth Portfolio and the Income Portfolio.
Investing in between five and 16 trusts, Growth Portfolio, the higher risk
of the two, will aim for capital growth by buying into trusts invested in
Britain and abroad, some based offshore.
The Income Portfolio will hold high-income UK unit trusts, offshore funds,
gilts and cash, and will pay out income each quarter.
The charges on both are 6 per cent initially and 0.5 per cent annually, in
addition to the annual charges on the underlying trusts.
SAVE &amp; PROSPER will launch in May a high-income bond that will guarantee a
high level of net income, partly by drawing on a capital amount put into the
bond.
Earlier this month, details were still being finalised, but, as an example,
S&amp;P said that an investor who chose to take 8 per cent guaranteed net annual
income from the bond would get back a guaranteed minimum of 60 per cent of
his capital after five years if the FT-SE 100 index had either remained
static or fallen over that period.
He would get back his capital in full after five years if the index had
risen by 4.58 per cent annually or 25 per cent in total over the period.
However, despite the guarantees on income and capital, S&amp;P has deliberately
avoided any precise commitment on what investors who cash in before the end
of the five-year term will receive.
Product development manager Mike Hayhurst said the group had been tempted
not to offer any surrender values at all, but had been obliged to do so by
market forces: the fact that competitors offered them. All S&amp;P says is that
the surrender value prior to the five-year mark will be based mainly on the
level of the FT-SE 100 at the time the bond is cashed in.
'We intend this as a five-year product,' said Mr Hayhurst, 'we don't
currently intend to penalise anyone.' He added that the few investors who
had so far cashed in S&amp;P's guaranteed stock market bond, launched last
November, had all received the market value of the bond in line with the
index at the time.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (28): Disappointment for Pep-pickers - And with so many UK
income trusts close to asset value, investors should be cautious / UK Income
Trusts
</HEADLINE>

FALLING INTEREST rates have given an enormous boost to the popularity of the
UK income growth sector.
British investors, traditionally suspicious of equities, have started to
desert the building society in search of alternative sources of income. The
result is that many UK income trusts stand either at a premium, or at a very
small discount to net assets.
A trust which can yield 5 per cent gross can appear highly attractive when
held in a personal equity plan, where income is tax-free. Furthermore, the
stock market rally of late 1992 and early 1993 brought investors substantial
capital gains.
Over the year to February 26, the average trust in the sector returned a
whopping 34.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market, with net income
reinvested). Falling discounts have obviously given a boost to long-term
share price performance figures.
But the chancellor's change to the tax treatment of dividends gives
investment trusts offering a Pep a particular problem.
Investment trusts tend to make additional charges on their Peps, because
plans do cost money to administer, and normal trust fees are quite low.
For basic-rate taxpayers, this extra charge may make some Peps unattractive,
compared with holding the trusts directly. Guinness Flight acted promptly to
cut the annual management charge on its Temple Bar Pep from 1 per cent to
0.75 per cent.
Jack Springman, a director of Temple Bar, commented: 'Peps remain highly
attractive for higher-rate taxpayers, but to ensure that the Temple Bar
Investment Trust Pep remains attractive to basic-rate taxpayers, Guinness
Flight has cut the Pep's annual management charge.'
TR City of London makes an additional annual charge of 1 per cent plus VAT
(1.175 per cent in total) on Peps. It is planning to reduce this charge to
0.5 per cent on Peps worth more than Pounds 6,000. The reduced charge will
only apply to that element of a Pep which is above Pounds 6,000 - so it will
only start to benefit investors when their Peps grow.
But what about investments that are below Pounds 6,000? At the end of March,
TR City was yielding 4.8 per cent. The advance corporation tax (ACT) change
in the Budget might well reduce this gross yield to 4.5 per cent. So take an
investor with Pounds 3,000 in the plan: his tax saving would be Pounds 27.
But the annual charge would be Pounds 35.25; so he would be Pounds 8.25
worse off inside the Pep than outside.
Of course, the investor would still have the capital gains tax shelter, and
the prospect of a lower annual charge should his Pounds 3,000 grow to more
than Pounds 6,000. He might also narrow the gap if the income of the trust
grew faster than its assets. However, the CGT shelter may be of limited use,
because few basic-rate taxpayers make enough capital gains.
While TR City of London is a trust with an excellent long-term record (it
has delivered 25 consecutive annual increases in dividend), the basic-rate
taxpayer who cannot afford a full Pounds 6,000 investment should consider
whether or not he is better off buying it via the conventional savings
scheme than via the Pep.
For higher-rate taxpayers, the benefits of Peps should still be very clear.
On a Pounds 6,000 investment in TR City, the tax savings is Pounds 108 per
annum, well above the Pounds 35.25 charge.
Leaving aside the income argument, the UK trusts have produced some very
impressive net asset value performances. In the 10 years to March 1, for
example, figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies show
that NAV total return from the UK income sector was 459.6 per cent, compared
with 419.6 per cent from the international general trusts and 453.6 per cent
from Japan.
Lowland, a small trust run by Henderson, has the best NAV return, with 652.6
per cent, followed by TR City (535.1 per cent) and Murray Income (520.1 per
cent). In share price total-return terms, the same three are top, except
with even better figures: Lowland's growth, for example, is 819.6 per cent.
Such growth figures are unlikely to be repeated. Most commentators would
agree that dividend growth in the 1990s will be a lot lower than in the
1980s; some trusts may even need to dip into reserves to maintain their
pay-outs.
In short, investors should examine their trust selection carefully. With so
many UK income trusts close to asset value, it may be worth looking round at
trusts in less fashionable sectors which are standing at wider discounts.
Income trusts may well issue new shares, via rights issues and placings, to
take advantage of times when they stand at a premium. This is a sensible
move, because it is so difficult to launch a new trust, but it can backfire:
if the manager overestimates demand, then a discount could quickly appear.
The sector faces plenty of opportunities in the new low-interest arena, but
plenty of challenges too.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (27): Small companies are still tempting - The cycle
points to a few more good years before they peak / The US Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EARLIEST investment trusts turned their gaze across the Atlantic. Most
of them have now evolved into large international general trusts, but
several investment trusts still aim to provide a specialist vehicle for
investing in the US.
Such vehicles are now in demand. When Foreign &amp; Colonial launched a new US
Smaller Companies investment trust last month, it was oversubscribed by 13
per cent. F&amp;C's arrival brought the number of US specialist trusts to six.
What had sparked interest in the sector?
As ever, an element of this is a reaction to recent performance. Over the
past two years, the US has performed strongly, particularly in the smaller
companies sector. Analysts believed that the US, having led the world into
the economic recession, would lead the way out of it again - an assumption
which looks plausible - and Wall Street's recent performance has been
founded on this assumption.
Currency has provided an extra plus for British investment trust investors,
following the sharp post-Black Wednesday strengthening of the dollar against
sterling. In the six months from the beginning of September last year, the
average increase for North American investment trusts was 71.12 per cent,
according to Micropal. Over 1992 as a whole, this effect was less marked,
but the S&amp;P 500 still rose by 29.1 per cent in sterling terms, compared with
only 4.5 per cent in dollar terms.
Most of the dollar's rise now seems to be in the past, although some
analysts believe there may be a slight further appreciation. The sector's
out-performance was also helped by an erosion of discounts - for example,
that of Fleming American fell from 11.8 per cent to 7.1 per cent during
1992. That erosion may have been caused by investors piling in during August
and September, buying the trusts as an easy form of exposure to the
undervalued dollar.
That suggests that the recent performance is not quite the strong 'sell'
indicator that it at first appears. Technical factors concerning moves in
exchange rates and discounts are unlikely to be repeated, but the chances of
a rise fuelled by underlying value of the trusts' net assets seem strong.
In which US sectors should the funds be investing? The out-performance of
smaller companies last year was marked. According to Robert Fleming, the S&amp;P
500, measuring Wall Street's largest stocks by market capitalisation, rose
by only 4.5 per cent last year, while the Frank Russell 2000 Index, covering
companies ranked from 1001 down to 3000 in market capitalisation, rose a
much stronger 24.6 per cent.
Analysts point out that indices have been pushed by outstanding performances
from a handful of companies - for example, in the computer world, the giant
IBM, one of the biggest companies in the US, has fallen sharply, while two
'small' companies, Microsoft and Intel, have risen very strongly.
But interest still centres on smaller companies. According to James Findlay,
fund manager of F&amp;C's new trust: 'We expect the US smaller companies sector
to out-perform in the future because of low valuations compared to US larger
companies. The dollar is getting stronger, and the US domestic economy is
improving, while international economies are getting weaker.'
He points to the chances of out-performance which the vast range of smaller
companies in the US always represents.
With so many to choose from, the big Wall Street firms allow many to remain
under-researched and so under-valued. This assists F&amp;C's approach, which is
strictly 'value'-orientated, seeking stocks which look cheap in proportion
to their earnings prospects.
A similar line comes from Fleming American, which has made a heavy strategic
shift into smaller capitalisation stocks. Smaller companies now make up 28
per cent of the trust's portfolio.
Part of the reason for this is cyclical. Smaller companies' prices have
moved in a seven-year cycle, according to John Haynes, Fleming American's
fund manager. Seven years of smaller company under-performance of larger
companies ended only two years ago. Smaller companies' added volatility, and
troubles of America's corporate giants, should mean that the run on smaller
stocks should have a while to go. As the chart shows, smaller companies look
as though they could have a few more years of outperformance before peaking.
If all this confuses you, then you are not alone. America's economy had been
in turmoil, anyway, before President Clinton arrived and promised to shake
everything up further. But the judgment of Ian Macfarlane, manager of EFM's
American Investment Trust, the biggest in the sector, gives food for
thought. 'We've been trying to look at operating profits to try to make some
sense of what's going on, and the main story is that corporate America is
recovering.'
Hopes are now high that Clinton's drastic stimulation and budget reduction
programme will nudge America's newly strengthened companies into
full-blooded recovery. Those who agree may well be tempted by the
speculative opportunities available in the US - particularly those in
smaller companies. But such investments should not be made the bedrock of a
portfolio.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (26): Be precise in your briefing - Tell your manager
exactly what you are trying to achieve, and remember, if you demand a high
income, you can't expect capital growth as well / Portfolio Services

THERE IS a bewildering variety of investment trusts for the investor to
choose from. So it is only natural that many people decide to take advice
from an expert.
A number of groups offer services designed to help investors though the
investment trust market.
Some offer straightforward guidance. South Bristol Investment, for example,
will give advice on the trusts which will best suit the individual
investor's needs. It will then steer investors towards the cheapest way of
dealing in the trust. Investors require a minimum of Pounds 10,000 to
qualify for the service, which has a fee of 0.5 per cent of the amount
invested.
At the other end of the scale, some managers take total control of your
money, making buy and sell decisions on your behalf. Fees for this service
are higher. Whether it is worth paying extra, of course, depends on the
manager's success in selecting the right stocks. In a sense, you are paying
two sets of fees, because the manager of the underlying investment trust is
also getting his whack.
On the other hand, a good manager can put together a set of trusts which
precisely meet your needs, whether it be a regular income or steady capital
growth.
Many private-client stockbrokers will steer their smaller clients - those
with less than Pounds 50,000 - towards investment and unit trusts, simply
because that is the only way of getting a reasonably diversified portfolio.
Gerrard Vivian Gray operates a discretionary service, which requires a
Pounds 20,000 minimum. Investors are sent valuations and a full report twice
a year. There is an initial charge of 2 per cent, and an annual fee of 1 per
cent (VAT is added to both). Stockbroking commission is 1.5 per cent on
deals of less than Pounds 7,500, and this reduces to 0.75 per cent above
that figure. Investors have a choice of four different portfolios:
Growth and Income is a mainstream portfolio that offers a yield similar to
that on the FT Investment Trust Index.
High Income aims for a yield 1.5 times that on the All-Share, and invests in
income shares and high-yielding conventional trusts.
Low-risk Growth invests in the zero shares of split-capital trusts and other
reduced-risk securities such as Kleinwort's Endowment Policy Trust.
Higher Risk portfolio is more actively managed, and currently holds capital
shares, smaller company and emerging markets funds.
A monthly income facility is available via the low-risk or high-income
portfolios for an additional annual fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT. With the
low-risk portfolio, capital growth is converted into income, which may be
tax-efficient for those who do not use up their annual Pounds 5,800 capital
gains tax allowance.
Capel-Cure Asset Management offers a similar service with a Pounds 15,000
minimum and three portfolios to choose from - Capital Growth, Income and
Balanced. Split-trust shares are used within these portfolios, but only on a
cautious basis.
The initial fee for the service is 3 per cent plus VAT, with an annual fee
of 1 per cent plus VAT. Commissions are 1.5 per cent on purchases, and 1 per
cent on sales.
It is difficult to judge the success of these services, because the managers
rightly argue that each portfolio has to be tailored to meet the needs of
the individual investor.
Gerrard Vivian Gray has figures for 'model portfolios' which roughly conform
to its four key types: all, bar high income, have outperformed the FT
All-Share in capital terms over the past two years. However, these figures
do not allow for the effect of the annual fee.
Investors can look at alternative products managed by the same group, such
as unit trusts, to try to gauge the company's investment skills. Indeed,
there are unit trusts that invest in investment trusts, and these are an
obvious alternative to a portfolio service - the average fund in the sector
gave investors a 67 per cent return in the five years to March 1, according
to Finstat.
In the end, however, there is always an element of risk; there is no
guarantee that managers who have done well in the past will do so in the
future.
You can protect yourself by telling the manager precisely what you are
trying to achieve - income, capital gains or whatever - and choosing the
portfolio that best meets your needs.
But your expectations must be realistic. If you demand a high income from
your portfolio manager, you cannot expect capital growth as well. And if
world stock markets fall suddenly, as they did in 1987, no portfolio of
investment trusts can be safe.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (25): A useful means to a fixed gain - But there is still
some risk attached to them, because you are exposed to the stock market, and
investors will need to know the professional vocabulary / Zero-Dividend
Preference Shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
IF YOU want to zero in on a fixed target for growth, zero-dividend
preference investment trust shares may be the answer. However, they may not
be quite the perfect answer they once seemed.
Zeros can be offered only as part of a split-capital investment trust, which
has a specific date on which it will be wound up. On that date, the zeros
will have first call on the assets - hence the phrase 'preference shares'.
No other shareholders will be paid until the zeros have been repaid in full.
At the beginning of the trust's life, a redemption value is fixed for the
zeros. No income is paid on them (in most trusts, any income generated by
the fund is paid to income shareholders). That means that all the return you
receive on a zero will be taxed as capital gain. If, like most people in the
UK, you do not pay capital gains tax, this allows zeros to offer a tax-free
return.
As the zeros typically account for only about a third of the trust's capital
structure, it is possible to offer a high redemption value without requiring
the portfolio to grow very much. That fixed redemption value also allows
investors to use zeros as a vehicle to speculate on interest-rate moves. As
with other fixed-interest securities, the price of zeros should go up when
interest rates come down.
The gearing effect is crucial to the success of zeros, and can be explained
using the following crude example. If the zeros account for a third of the
capital structure, then they can offer to triple their value by redemption
without requiring any growth at all from the underlying portfolio in which
the trust invests.
In this example, the holders of the other classes of share might be a little
peeved if the fund managers do not deliver a little extra growth, and the
gearing structure usually works much more subtly. So much more subtly, in
fact, that some analysts began to express concern that the zeros would not
be able to deliver on redemption.
In October last year, with the market still yet to pick up after Black
Wednesday, Philip Middleton, investment trust analyst with Smith New Court,
issued a report sardonically entitled 'Noddy Buys A Zero'. In it, he said:
'The market in these shares still seems relatively inefficient. Insufficient
attention is given to portfolio yield on the underlying assets. In addition,
the market does not seem to have priced into the valuation of many shares
the substantial risk that zeros will not be repaid in full. There remain
some very attractive shares, but also some very overvalued ones.'
The rise in the market since then has done much to shore up zeros, but
Middleton's criticism still stands. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at
Credit Lyonnais Laing, says:
'I have been very critical of these in the past, but I'm less worried about
them now. Fortunately the equity markets have proved once again that they do
have the capacity to outperform.'
He, and Hamish Buchan, of County NatWest, suggest that the underlying
portfolios in which split-capital investment trusts invest can only be
ignored at the investor's peril.
If you want to invest in zeros, you will need to be armed with the following
vocabulary.
Gross redemption yield. This expresses, as an annualised compound interest
rate, the return you will get by buying at today's price and then holding on
to the zeros until they are redeemed. It assumes that the redemption price
is met.
This yield can, therefore, be compared directly with the rates of return on
offer from fixed-rate deposits, to show what kind of value is on offer.
According to Walls, the average gross redemption yield on offer from the
sector has shifted from 9.8 per cent last year to 8.7 per cent. He regards
this as offering better value, given the performance of the rest of the
economy.
Cover. The cover expresses the degree of security you have. It expresses the
total value of the trust's portfolio as a percentage of the amount needed to
pay the redemption amount in full. Any zero with cover of more than 100 per
cent thus already has enough assets to meet redemptions - the portfolio
would need to go down before redemptions were in danger.
Again, the market recovery has rather come to the rescue. According to
Walls, average cover rose from 118 per cent to 123 per cent as the market
took off at the beginning of this year.
Hurdle rate. This provides another measure of the zero's chances of being
redeemed in full, by measuring the annualised rate of return the trust needs
to achieve to repay the zeros in full. For any zero with more than 100 per
cent cover, the hurdle rate will be negative. No trusts require an
unrealistic hurdle rate - as of March 16, the day of the Budget, only four
zeros required a rate of more than 2 per cent, and the highest was 4.9 per
cent.
Zeros with high gross redemption yields may appear attractive, but often, as
Buchan points out, this is just a risk premium. And all of these factors are
generated ultimately by the underlying performance of the fund.
Zeros are useful financial instruments. A fixed gain, free of income tax,
has obvious uses for school fees planning, for example. But when you buy a
zero you are still exposing yourself to the stock market.

INCOME SHARES of split-capital investment trusts are just one of the victims
of chancellor Norman Lamont's Budget.
His decision to lower advance corporation tax from 25 per cent to 20 per
cent has the effect of reducing the income of pension and other
non-taxpaying funds like personal equity plans (Peps). They are now only
able to reclaim 20 per cent of the notional tax paid on dividend income
instead of 25 per cent.
Nigel Sidebottom, associate director of brokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, says:
'Split-level income shares - particularly those with very high flat yields
and annuity characteristics - provide virtually all their return to
shareholders in the form of income. Pension funds holding these shares will,
as a result, suffer significant reduction in returns.'
If this is to be avoided, companies will have to change their dividend
policy to cushion shareholders from part of their loss, but this may prove
difficult at a time when many companies have low dividend cover - the amount
by which pay-outs are covered by profits.
The upshot, according to Mr Sidebottom, is that 'this will reduce the
attraction of high-yielding income shares to gross funds, encouraging them
to switch to alternative investments which may offer the potential for
better returns.
'The attraction of high-yielding income shares within Peps is similarly
reduced. Lower-yielding income shares, where little or no loss of capital is
expected, will now be relatively more attractive than very high yielding
annuity-type shares.'
It remains to be seen whether the Budget changes will dent the revived
popularity of income shares after the disappointing trading during most of
1992. Lower dividend payments, which in turn generated less revenue for the
shares, were the main cause of flagging interest in income shares last year,
according to SG Warburg Securities.
Once the UK left the exchange rate mechanism last September, the
accompanying fall in interest rates led to a rise in income share yields,
contributing to renewed interest in income shares, particularly as returns
from the building society have diminished.
When Schroder launched its split fund in March, demand for the income shares
was so great that that it was obliged to increase the size of the trust and
buy large amounts of the other classes of share itself.
However, income shares have had bad publicity recently, and the main reason
has been 'misconceptions, ignorance and misplaced arithmetic logic,'
according to Greig Middleton, stockbrokers.
The main problem appears to have been caused by an inability to
differentiate between the different types of income share, which has
resulted, in some cases, in disappointment and panic.
There are basically two very different types of income share: conventional
and geared.
Conventional income shares have a fixed repayment price, payable on
maturity. There are two main variations: the 'traditional' and the 'annuity'
type. Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities,
describes the traditional type as a kind of bond: 'You pay me Pounds 1 and I
will pay back Pounds 1. In the meantime, you are entitled to the dividend
income stream.'
This sounds straightforward enough. The problem is that, in the initial
years of the trust's life, the trading price of the traditional shares may
rise well above this maturity value, because of the attractions of the high
income. But as the maturity date approaches, the trading price will steadily
decline towards the repayment value.
For example, the income shares of M&amp;G's Dual Income trust will be repaid at
100p in 1996 when the trust is wound up. But you would have to buy them at
325p in the last week of March, if you wanted the yield of 27 per cent.
The danger for private investors is that, not realising this, they may buy
the shares at the peak price, only to find that the capital value will
steadily deteriorate.
The annuity-type also has a fixed repayment price, but it is miniscule,
usually 0.1p. Mr Aaron describes this type as 'you pay me Pounds 1, I give
you back a penny, but in the meantime, you get a high yield.' Once again,
the risk to private investors is that they may buy these shares without
realising that their capital will fall to virtually nil when the trust is
wound up.
Conventional income shares, therefore, offer a measure of certainty, because
you know the price that will be paid on maturity (provided, of course, the
assets of the trust are sufficient to meet this bill).
But the second category of income share - known as ordinary, or geared,
income shares - is far more volatile. These are usually one class of capital
in a trust which otherwise has zero-coupon preference shares.
Ordinary shares take all the dividends of the trust but, in return for
taking the trust's income, holders of the zero-dividend shares have prior
claim on a trust's capital. So holders of the income shares will be entitled
to the assets of the trust only after the zeros have been repaid.
Thus the repayment value is highly dependent on the extent to which the
trust's assets grow. 'The trusts do require some growth before the ordinary
income shares pay back their share price,' said Mr Aaron. 'In most cases,
the average of the sector is 5 per cent growth per annum. So the assets must
grow by that amount for you to get back your share price.'
Income shares fell by 2 to 3 per cent after the Budget, because of the ACT
changes, according to Mr Sidebottom, but until then ordinary income shares
had been enjoying a revival on the back of a strong stock market
performance.
However, Mr Sidebottom warns: 'These are high-risk investments. You could
lose all your capital. They are volatile investments. For example, the share
price of ordinary income shares in Sphere has fallen from a peak of 47p down
to 12p, and are now back up to about 19p.'
If you know what you are buying, income shares have their attractions,
particularly within a Pep; but you should take expert advice to guide you in
this complex area.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (23): A classic ploy in a bull market - Their worth lies
in a healthy rate of asset growth, but a repeat of their strong 1980s
performance is unlikely / Capital Shares
</HEADLINE>

CAPITAL SHARES of split investment trusts are traditionally branded as risky
and volatile. Their sudden revival in the year to March follows a period of
weakness which will have done nothing to reverse this image.
The idea behind early split-level trusts was that one class of investor
would receive all the income of the trust, while the others - holders of
capital shares - would reap all the capital growth.
Recent split-capital trusts have a more complicated structure with the
addition of zero dividend preference shares, which have first claim on the
assets of the trust at wind-up.
Capital shares receive the remaining assets of the trust but, unlike zeros,
they do not have a fixed redemption value. Their worth to investors
therefore lies in a healthy rate of asset growth to bring a good return, and
it is for this reason that they are regarded as classic bull-market ploy.
Since most capital shares are geared - a modest rise in a trust's assets can
have a major effect on their value - their strong performance over the past
year is intertwined with the revival of the UK stock market.
They have outperformed other classes of split-trust shares in the year to
March. The average growth of investment trust capital shares was 11.6 per
cent over the period, according to Finstat, but the difference between the
top- and bottom-performing shares underlines that this is an average.
Capital shares of Mezzanine Capital rose 105 per cent during that period,
while those of Exmoor Dual Capital trust dropped by just under 40 per cent.
The recent push by capital shares is reflected in the performance of
Exeter's Capital Growth unit trust, which invests exclusively in investment
trust capital shares. It was top of the UK equity growth sector in the month
to March 1 after languishing near the bottom of the sector in the
three-years to March 1.
Hargreaves Lansdown launched a managed portfolio service of investment trust
capital shares - the Geared Growth Portfolio - in March, on the back of this
recent performance.
'Capital shares are cheap by historical standards, and by buying now while
prices are low, investors have scope for enormous returns,' says Hargreaves
Lansdown, which believes the UK market is entering a new growth cycle which
stands to benefit capital shares above others.
Since capital shares pay no income, the only tax liability is to capital
gains tax, which many people find adequately covered by their capital gains
tax allowance, currently of Pounds 5,800. 'Capital shares are attractive,
because the market does not price in their tax efficiency,' said Nigel
Sidebottom, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray.
Most capital shares appear to be on a deep discount to net asset value
(NAV). However, this is an area for caution. The convention is to quote the
discount, compared with the current claims of other classes of share, such
as zeros. But the demands of the zeros rise every year. A more realistic
approach would be to compare the price of the capital shares with the assets
left after the zeros have been repaid at their wind-up price. Shares which
seem to be at a discount by one method, may be on a premium by the other.
As an example, Scottish National appears to be on a discount of about 60 per
cent to current NAV, but is so highly geared that assets would have to grow
by at least 6 per cent per annum in order to pay back its debt on wind up in
1998, according to Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at S G Warburg
Securities. It is, on the more conservative valuation method, trading at a
premium.
'Look at the expected net returns,' says Mr Sidebottom, who favours
Throgmorton Dual capital shares. 'If you buy today at its price of 383p,
when the trust winds up in 1999, you will get the current asset value which
probably represents a return of 7 per cent compound per annum.'
However, Mr Sidebottom believes that even highly geared capital shares can
be attractive if they are cheap enough.
Capital shares had a very good record in the early 1980s bull market - the
average return was 479 per cent over 10 years, compared with 246 per cent on
the FT-All Share, according to Mr Aaron, but this has been during a period
of high inflation which pushes up the market.
If you subscribe to the view that, despite having left the exchange rate
mechanism, we will be in a low-inflation environment for a prolonged period,
the market - and capital shares - are unlikely to reach the same heights of
performance as over the last decade.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (22): Iron out the market's bumps - Many experts see
trusts as an alternative to life products. But the Budget has diminished
Peps / Savings Schemes and Personal Equity Plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVINGS SCHEMES and personal equity plans offer private investors the safest
entry into the world of investment trusts. To judge by the sales figures,
many people have realised this.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies says that Pounds 115.5m was
invested in savings schemes last year. The sharp drop in investor confidence
during the summer meant that this was lower than 1991's Pounds 119.5m, but
it still shows a vast increase on the Pounds 89,504 taken in 1984, when the
first savings scheme was launched by Foreign &amp; Colonial.
The total invested in savings schemes since their inception now stands at
Pounds 430m. However, this is still rather less than the billions which have
been invested in life assurance endowment policies.
Can this be justified? Many advisers believe that investment trusts have the
edge, over both life assurance products and unit trusts.
Tony Shepherd, of Shepherd Associates, says: 'We use investment trust
savings schemes because investment trusts generally are fairly broadly
based, as opposed to unit trusts where you would need several to get a
spread.'
He adds that those who already have a wide portfolio of UK equities might be
better off feeding money into international unit trusts.
The arguments for investment trusts over endowments are stronger, and less
subtle. As Shepherd puts it: 'Endowments are inflexible, they have very high
charges and they are paying for commission in advance. Also, given the state
of the with-profits market, it's very difficult to know which life companies
will produce the goods in 10 years' time.'
He admits that life assurance-linked maximum investment plans can be good
value if held for the full 10 years, but they have to be held this long.
Investment trust savings schemes can be surrendered at any time without
penalty. According to Shepherd: 'Why commit yourself to anything when you
don't have to?'
Investment trust savings schemes are straightforward - you organise a
standing order with your bank, which then pays money regularly into a
specially organised account. This then buys and holds the shares.
Buying the shares through regular savings, rather than in one lump sum, is
safer for small investors, as it eliminates the hazards of timing. Buying in
instalments avoids the risk that you will buy only at the top of the market,
and improves the chances that you will buy at least some of the shares when
their prices are low. This way, volatile share prices can be turned to your
advantage.
However, if the share price rises steadily and consistently, without
fluctuation, you would get better value from investing in a lump sum.
Once you have established that you need an investment trust savings scheme,
you need to choose a trust. This will depend on two factors:
Performance. As all the advertisements dutifully tell you, past performance
is no guarantee of future results. But it does allow some well-educated
guesses. International General and UK Income are the main sectors which
attract interest from advisers, as these have the largest and broadest based
portfolios, with a lengthy track record.
The figures in the table, provided by Micropal, show the results of
investing Pounds 100 per month since the beginning of 1988. Charges for sale
of the trusts are not included, but investment is shown with net, rather
than gross income reinvested. On these assumptions, the average trust in
both sectors managed to increase the money invested by about 50 per cent.
The strongest performers, Bankers and Personal Assets in the International
General sector, both came close to producing double the total amount of
money invested - very creditable performance for a five-year period,
particularly as this included 1990, when the UK stock market sustained
losses ahead of the Gulf War.
Peps became available at the beginning of 1988, so it would have been
possible to have income reinvested gross (although the rules have restricted
the amount which can be invested in international trusts). Pep investment
would avoid capital gains tax, although no capital gains tax would in fact
have been payable at this level of saving after five years.
Charges. Performance may not be predictable in advance, but charges are.
Typically, these will include some combination of stockbroking commission,
and charges on purchase or sale. Some will charge for share certificates.
The majority of schemes do not have a stockbroking commission; and none,
with the exception of the split-capital TR Technology, charges more than
0.25 per cent. Charges on sale or transfer are typically Pounds 10 or Pounds
15, although again some management groups do not levy a charge. Companies
which stand out, according to the AITC, are Dunedin, Finsbury and Ivory &amp;
Sime, all of which charge no stockbroking commission, and levy no other
charges. With any savings scheme it is vital that you check the level of
charges before starting the payments.
Peps
Quarterly Review readers will know by now the advantages of personal equity
plans - they allow you to reinvest income gross, and shelter you from
capital gains tax (not a vital issue for most small investors).
However, the advantages of a Pep were reduced by the changes to advance
corporation tax (ACT) in the Budget. For basic-rate taxpayers, the tax
saving was cut by a quarter. On an investment of Pounds 6,000 in a trust
yielding 4 per cent, the tax benefit drops from Pounds 60 to Pounds 45 in
the first year. Higher-rate taxpayers still save 40 per cent in tax, but
their income from a Pep is cut by 6.25 per cent.
More than ever, charges will determine whether a Pep is worthwhile. Many
basic-rate taxpayers may find that trusts with additional tax charges are
unattractive.
It is worth shopping around for a cheap 'self-select' Pep provider, but the
companies themselves also offer their own schemes. Typically, there is an
initial charge, of between 0.5 and 5 per cent, plus an annual charge, and a
charge for dealing (which first-time investment trust investors may well not
need to do). Among the trusts listed, Alliance Trust stands out, with no
initial or annual charge, and a dealing charge of 0.15 per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (21): Education is needed if a few mishaps are not to
taint the sector - Since new trust launches these days are either
geographical specialists or have a split-capital structure, the worry is
that small investors may buy without fully realising what they are getting
</HEADLINE>

INVESTMENT TRUSTS are enjoying a revival. For too long, they were the
neglected smaller brother of unit trusts. But press publicity about their
merits, a marketing drive that belied their fusty image and some helpful tax
changes have enabled them to be rediscovered.
But there are some who worry that, in the process of attracting the private
investor, the industry has had to sell part of its soul. Rather than the
good old-fashioned international general fund, new trust launches these days
are either geographical specialists or have a split-capital structure.
The problem is the discount. Shares in most investment trusts trade at a
discount to their net asset values. There is little point, therefore, in
buying shares in a new issue at a price which, after costs, will stand at a
premium to net asset value, if existing trusts are available at a discount.
This factor makes it difficult to launch a trust in a field which is already
well supplied, such as the general trust.
But institutional investors do not have the in-house expertise to cover all
the world's stock markets. Thus they will be willing to subscribe to a fund
based in, say, Taiwan where the manager can offer added value. And as such
funds are often the only way of investing in such markets, they can
sometimes stand at a premium to assets.
Private investors are willing to buy shares in a split-capital trust,
because the different securities can have tax advantages (zero-dividend
preference shares are taxed on a capital-gains, rather than an income,
basis, for example). Because of the demand created, many split funds stand
at a premium to assets.
The potential problem is that, while both geographical and split funds can
be highly attractive, they have a different risk profile from the
traditional investment trust.
Income shares, for example, come in three different flavours. Some have a
set (although not guaranteed) repayment value; some have a repayment value
which will vary in line with the manager's success in growing the assets of
the trust; and others will have no repayment value at all.
Each type of share will have its attractions, depending on the investor's
need for income, tax position, attitude to risk, and so on. The worry is
that small investors might invest in such shares without being fully aware
of what they are buying. This problem was highlighted when two fund
management groups wrote to investors to warn them of the dangers of
reinvesting the income from income shares.
Unless the industry works hard to educate the public, the danger is that a
few examples of unhappy investors might turn into bad publicity for the
industry as a whole.
A further problem for split-capital investors is that the different classes
can be subject to fashion. A good example was the launch of the Schroder
Split fund, where the managers were swamped with demand for the income
shares but had to buy up hefty chunks of the zero and capital shares to
maintain the integrity of the structure.
Thus investors could find that, although the stock market is rising, their
particular class of security is falling in price because of a change in
sentiment. Again, this could lead to disillusionment and a reaction against
the whole sector.
One final point, made by investment trust analyst Robin Angus of NatWest
Securities Ltd, is that the needs of the various classes of investors may
restrict the manager's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.
'Conventionally-structured trusts are investment-driven, while split-capital
trusts are structure-driven,' he says.
Geographical specialist trusts also have their dangers for small investors,
because many are highly volatile. In addition, trusts can slip from a
premium to a discount as the particular market falls from fashion; and there
is also a currency risk if sterling rises against the currency of the
country concerned.
The international general trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial and Scottish
Mortgage, are not, of course, without risk, but they do avoid some of the
dangers revealed above. They have a wide geographical spread, which protects
them against a sharp fall in any one market - and they have a simple capital
structure. Over the years, many have produced excellent records of capital
and dividend growth.
Given that the Budget restricted the tax credit on personal equity plans to
20 per cent - and given that many investment trust Peps impose additional
charges - it may well be that, for a basic-rate taxpayer, a conventional
savings scheme into an international general trust is just as good as some
Peps.
If a trust yields 4 per cent, then the income tax saving to a basic-rate
taxpayer who invests the full Pounds 6,000 in a Pep is Pounds 45 in the
first year (few basic-rate taxpayers are likely to pay capital gains tax).
That can easily be eaten up by charges. Higher rate taxpayers should still
find the Pep an advantageous investment.
Some international trusts have had a lot of success in promoting themselves
via savings schemes, and the discount has narrowed. But while split-capital
trusts may be the fashion of the moment, there is still work for the
industry to do. By singing the praises of those trusts which still stand at
a discount, the industry can serve both the small investor and the trusts'
existing shareholders.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): A portfolio
for his final curtain - In his work, John Nickson courts wealthy donors to
obtain finance for operatic productions. Meanwhile, his own investments,
entrusted to a fee-charging financial adviser, pursue capital growth for his
retirement / Serious riches

OPERA-GOERS awaiting the overture to Verdi's Rigoletto at the London
Coliseum last August had an unscheduled surprise.
Before the orchestra launched into the opera, a man appeared on the stage,
illuminated by the beam of one spotlight, and spent two minutes asking the
audience to contribute towards the sponsorship of a new production of a
little-known Janacek opera, The Adventures of Mr Broucek. Forms for
donations had been placed on every seat.
That sponsorship appeal raised Pounds 102,000, all in small donations of up
to Pounds 400 from individual members of the public, making it the most
successful such venture yet attempted in London. John Nickson, the English
National Opera's head of corporate affairs, was the figure on the stage.
Most of his work, which involves raising finance for the company's
productions, requires him to deal with people who are able to make much
greater donations. Very wealthy, and equally discreet, donors, convinced
both of ENO's artistic merit and of its ability to spend money efficiently,
have been the key to the company's survival. One even donated Pounds 1m
anonymously.
Mr Nickson's own finances are not in the same stratosphere. However, based
on an inheritance, he is currently using a broad range of investments to
ensure a comfortable retirement, after a career which has been characterised
by much artistic buccaneering and a refusal to let finance get in the way.
That means an eclectic selection of investments. One of the most apparently
outlandish is in a privately managed and held Business Expansion Scheme,
which owns a large house in Bromley, Kent. Mr Nickson has never set eyes on
it, and points out ruefully that he and the other investors bought at the
top of the market.
However, the advantages of a 'do-it-yourself' BES are clear. There are no
sponsors to pay, no hidden costs or dubious managerial 'incentives', and all
the investors can easily see what their investment is worth. It also, of
course, brought in a hefty dose of top-rate tax relief.
On Murray Noble's advice, he also invested a large chunk of his portfolio in
zero-dividend preference shares of investment trusts. These allowed for
secure capital growth, which would be taxed as capital gain rather than
income.
However, the falling interest-rate climate of the past two years has put a
strain on investment for growth, as well as investment for income. After
sterling had left the European exchange rate mechanism, Murray Noble became
nervous that the level of cover for the projected maturity pay-outs on each
zero had been eroded, and sold all but one of them.
The money has been moved from there into two European bond funds, managed by
Global Asset Management and Clerical Medical International.
Mr Nickson admits that he did need to hold on tight before effectively
investing in Deutsche Marks, but at the moment things look promising.
European bond prices should rise in response to lower German interest rates,
allowing a quick capital gain.
Mr Nickson's current preoccupation with retirement and capital growth
follows a youth (he is now 46) during which, he admits, his philosophy was
to 'live for today'.
He went from the public school of Giggleswick, in Yorkshire, where he was
taught drama by Russell Harty, to University College, London. On coming of
age he received a small legacy, much of which he spent on a five-bedroom
house just off Clapham Common, in South London. His income at this point
came from letting to his friends ('not the most sensible thing in the
world'), plus his brief 'deeply unsuccessful' career as an actor.
While working at Shanklin Rep, on the Isle of Wight, 'I discovered that I
was one of the worst actors on the British stage, and wisely decided to
retire from the stage and become a manager.'
However, there was no direct road from Shanklin to the Coliseum. After three
years in a stage-management partnership, he sold the house in Clapham (for a
healthy profit), bought a flat in Holland Park, and left Britain on the
hippy trail, spending five months in Bali. 'I came back pretty broke with no
pension, just living for the day.'
He then found work in the box office of the Cambridge Theatre, in London,
and then as a fund raiser for the London branch of the Samaritans. Within
five months, he was busy organising a ball at which the then relatively
obscure Dame Edna Everage was to star.
Then he had a heart attack. He was 29. After five weeks in hospital he made
an unsuccessful attempt to return to work, but had to abandon it. His
capital was now being eaten away, and he needed to look around for work.
He found it in the relative calm of the British Council. Here, in the early
1980s, he set up the council's first press office, and had an experience
which was to repeat itself at ENO: 'We had to change our policy from bashing
the government and go out and find some alternative money instead.'
He stayed at the British Council for 12 years, accumulating an enviable
Civil Service pension, and moving to a large house in London's Little
Venice. He also spent the years prior to 1987 piling into investment bonds
managed by Scottish Equitable, on the advice of Robert Noble-Warren.
'We had quite a dizzy time in the run-up to Black Monday. We didn't do too
badly, because we'd switched out of the worst sectors in time, so it wasn't
the disaster it could have been.'
In 1989, came the opportunity to move to the ENO. A longstanding
opera-lover, Mr Nickson had already been involved in raising substantial
corporate sponsorship for an ENO tour of the then Soviet Union backed by the
British Council.
He had no intention of turning the job down. But the move was dreadful for
his retirement prospects. He will still get a pension from the British
Council, but ENO has no pension scheme at all.
Since making the move, he has been putting the maximum allowable into
personal pensions.
These were first put into with-profits versions from Standard Life and
Scottish Equitable, and are now going into a Scottish Equitable unit-linked
pension run by Murray Noble, reflecting the company's concern with the state
of the with-profits market.
Now, all that remains is to put his all into the job.
His office, in a cramped house just around the corner from the entrance to
the Coliseum, is surrounded by practice rooms, and the voices of visiting
mezzo sopranos and contraltos reverberate through the walls. This is not
like most businesses.
'It's like a business to the extent that we have to be sensitive to the
market. But we have a subsidy to fulfil certain non-commercial objectives,
which are principally to make opera accessible to the widest possible
public.'
ENO has not been immune from the recession, with attendances down 15 per
cent from the peak in 1988-89, and increases in the government grant lower
than inflation.
But corporate sponsorship, usually tied to the hospitality facilities which
lurk in the Coliseum's winding corridors, is holding up. Sixteen of the last
19 ENO productions have been sponsored, by such companies as National Power,
United Airlines, Guinness, TSB and KPMG Management Consultants.
But, as the emotive on-stage appeal on behalf of Mr Broucek suggested - 'If
I don't appear to believe in what I'm representing, then why should people
support it?' - Mr Nickson has put the emphasis on raising more money from
opera-loving individuals. Donations from this source have risen from Pounds
190,000 three years ago to Pounds 550,000, despite the recession.
And what of the heart attack which nearly claimed his life before he was 30?
'It isn't something I think about at all. If you are lucky enough not to
have too much damage, you have got to turn your back on it and race for
life.'

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): A modest lift
for cash funds - Reduction in tax credit means that basic-rate payers will
earn more / Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not a great Budget for unit trusts. They hoped that the Chancellor
would allow gilts and gilt funds to qualify for personal equity plan status.
Instead, they saw a cut in the tax credit on dividends which reduced the
attractions of equities to higher-rate taxpayers and of Peps to everyone.
At least, cash unit trusts received a modest boost from the changes. They
earn interest in the money markets, which they receive gross, and then pay
out a net rate after deduction of corporation tax.
The Budget reduced this corporation tax in two steps: from 25 per cent to
22.5 per cent, in 1993-94; and to 20 per cent in 1994-95. This corporation
tax payment is regarded as having met the tax liability of a basic-rate
taxpayer.
So the effect is that basic-rate taxpayers will suffer lower tax deductions
on their cash unit trust holdings than they will on their other
interest-bearing deposits, which will still be taxed at 25 per cent.
Higher-rate taxpayers will not benefit from the change, and will suffer
slightly in 1993-94.
For basic-rate taxpayers, the net yield on a cash trust currently yielding 6
per cent gross will rise from 4.5 per cent to 4.65 per cent in 1993-94, and
to 4.8 per cent in 1994-95.
Utilities plus bonds for a 7 per cent yield
CAZENOVE's Utility and Bond fund, launched in February, offers a low-cost
way for investors to get income.
The fund will have the majority of its investments in utility stocks, such
as telecoms, gas and water; and the minority in bonds. The result will be a
yield of 7 per cent, after a low annual charge of 0.5 per cent.
The initial charge is also low, at 0.2 per cent, which means the bid-offer
spread on the trust is just 2 per cent, well below the industry average. The
fund can be held in personal equity plan form, for a further initial charge
of Pounds 35, equivalent to a total initial charge of 0.8 per cent for Pep
investors. Dividends are payable twice a year.
Although sold by few independent financial advisers (the charges were too
low to permit payment of commission), the Cazenove funds raised an
encouraging Pounds 25m on launch. It may herald a new era of good value
funds for the private investor.
Two rival funds, from Fidelity &amp; M&amp;G, also offering bond-equity mixes were
launched at the same time.
The Budget's ACT change gave a slight boost to bond-equity funds, because of
the more favourable tax treatment of bonds vis-a-vis equities for basic-rate
taxpayers. Fidelity says the yield on its fund was slightly enhanced by the
change.
Options will help to deliver a high income
HYPO FOREIGN &amp; Colonial has launched a new unit trust which was so unusual
that it may need a year or two before it can be shown to work. The trust
offers to pay investors an income of 10 per cent if held in a personal
equity plan.
The income is so high because, in addition to holding shares and cash
deposits, the trust will sell options against its holdings. The premiums
earned by selling the options are the key to the trust's high income.
By selling options, the trust is effectively giving up its right to benefit
from much of the stock market's growth. What remains to be seen is whether
the trust can deliver its income without losing any capital at all.
Certainly, one cannot expect much in the way of income growth; premiums will
not rise in the way that dividends do.
Having said all that, if the fund can deliver what it promises without
capital losses, then many investors may find the prospect of 10 per cent
income highly attractive.
Institutions still hold the biggest stake
THE UNIT trust industry is breaking records, as buoyant stock markets and
declining interest rates have boosted sales and pushed up funds under
management.
By end February, the total of funds invested was Pounds 69.2bn. Gross sales
in February were Pounds 1.3bn, the highest since February 1987. Net
investment (after allowing for repurchases from investors) was Pounds
590.7m.
However, institutional investment still provides the bulk of net sales.
There is some question over whether this will continue. The Budget changes
to ACT made it less tax-efficient for life companies to invest in unit
trusts.
Such is the level of institutional investment that an increase in private
investor interest could not take up the slack. However, retail buying will
continue to be strong while there is little difference between returns on
building society accounts and equity dividend yields.
One of the most encouraging signs for the industry is that the number of
unitholder accounts, which had been falling steadily since 1987, has started
to rise again.
Substantial payment likely as Wessex is wound up
THE WESSEX UK Growth Trust is being wound up by the trustees, Royal Bank of
Scotland. The trust was originally suspended in February when the regulators
detected financial strains at the manager Wessex Asset Management.
The trustees were unable to find a replacement manager, and the Securities
and Investments Board accordingly agreed to the winding up of the scheme.
Wessex was a small trust, with just Pounds 500,000 in assets. In early
April, the Royal Bank anticipated making a substantial interim payment to
investors, with the balance on completion of the winding-up.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): Equities or
bonds? Inflation holds the key - If the investment climate really has
suffered a sea change, there are deep implications for portfolios / Strategy
for the nineties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD THE private investor be buying bonds or equities for the 1990s? If
you examine investment history, there appears to be no contest.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Equity-Gilt Study has produced investment
statistics for the period from 1918-93. The average nominal return on
equities over the whole period has been 11.8 per cent, compared with 6.4 per
cent from gilts. But the difference is even more stark in real (after
inflation) terms: 7.3 per cent per annum from shares, and just 1.2 per cent
from gilts.
But could the 1990s be different? There are some who argue that they will
be. The key element is inflation. Because the repayment value of a bond is
fixed in nominal terms, rising prices destroy the value of the bondholder's
capital.
Equities, however, tend to rise in line with inflation. The reason is that
inflation represents the increase in the prices of goods made by companies.
If margins stay the same, then, as prices rise, corporate profits will
increase in line.
In the inter-war period, inflation was not much of a problem. Gilts provided
real returns of over 5 per cent per annum. This was the era of the so-called
'yield gap', when shares were expected to offer a higher yield than gilts,
because they represented greater risk.
But after the second world war, the so-called 'cult of the equity'
developed, for a variety of reasons. Pension funds, offering benefits based
on final salaries, decided that equities were the best way of matching their
liabilities; inflation became an endemic, rather than occasional, problem;
institutional, rather than private, investors dominated the market and,
because of their larger portfolios, could brush aside the risk that
individual companies might go wrong.
In the past 20 years, gilts have often yielded twice as much as equities.
Institutional portfolios have come to be concentrated in shares, with the
proportion of gilts falling sharply.
But the 1990s, some argue, will be an era of low economic growth and low
inflation - and that should be good for bonds.
But why should inflation stay low? One argument is that the 1980s boom was
caused by excessive borrowing, and that the 1990s will see the hangover as
the world has to repay that debt. Economic growth will be slow as consumers
divert funds away from consumption and into debt repayment. Some even
believe that the 1990s are the 'downwave' of a 60-year economic cycle, and
will thus be as depressed as the 1930s.
Bonds certainly have their attractions. The recent falls in short-term UK
interest rates have led to what, in the jargon, is called a
'positively-sloping yield curve' - which, in practical terms, means that
bond yields are higher than the returns available from short-term building
society accounts.
Bond returns are also fixed, provided that you hold the issue till maturity.
That measure of certainty can be highly attractive to the private investor.
Furthermore, bonds offer a higher degree of security than equities - if a
company goes bust, then bondholders must be repaid before shareholders. And
gilts, of course, are issued by the government.
Indeed, in Europe and the US, it is quite common for private investors to
hold bonds as a substantial proportion of their portfolio. It could be time
for Britain to catch up.
But there are dangers awaiting those who decide to invest in bonds.
Inflation may be higher than is currently expected - especially in the light
of the devaluation of the pound and the rising budget deficit, both of which
normally lead to upward pressure on prices.
Most commentators would agree that the 'low inflation' argument is much less
convincing now that Britain is free of the constraints of the exchange rate
mechanism. And the budget deficit inevitably means a sharp increase in the
supply of gilts, which might depress gilt prices.
Furthermore, many gilts are trading at above face value. This means that
investors who hold them till maturity are trading higher immediate income
for long-term capital loss - not a very efficient strategy in terms of the
UK tax system. Profits on gilts are free of capital gains tax, but the
corollary is that losses cannot be offset against other gains elsewhere.
Income on gilts is fully taxable.
What about the prospects for equities? The equity bulls would point to the
BZW figures which show that low inflation is very good for the share market
 -the highest real returns on equities have occurred in years when inflation
was between 0 and 2 per cent.
As more and more of the world opens up to capitalism, some would argue that,
far from being stuck in depression, we are entering a 'golden age' in which
the resources of underdeveloped or communist countries will be unleashed.
Sir John Templeton, one of the grand old men of fund management, declared at
the end of 1991 that 'the next 10 years will be the most prosperous in world
history'. He expects the world standard of living to quadruple over the next
40 years.
Certainly, stock markets normally do well as economies move out of
recession. The question is whether world markets, and in particular the US
and the UK, have anticipated so much of the recovery that there is no profit
left for those who invest now.
After analysing all these factors, BZW concluded in January that, while
equities would continue to out-perform bonds in the 1990s, the gap would be
closer than before. Real returns, they forecast, would be around 6.5 per
cent per annum for equities and 3.5 per cent for bonds. The Budget change in
ACT, by reducing the tax credit on dividends, also tilted the equation away
from equities and towards bonds.
Many private investors currently have too much in the building society and
too little in either bonds or equities. So the answer may be to opt for a
diversified portfolio including both classes of asset. The greater the
investor's caution, the greater the proportion in bonds; the bigger the fear
of inflation, the more should be in equities.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): No regrets
over missed opportunity in Japan - Now the four agree on basic equity
indicators, though they differ in their attitudes to bonds / The
Professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HINDSIGHT SHOWS that our professionals would have reaped greatest gains over
the first quarter of 1993 by putting funds into Japanese equities, which
rose by more than 20 per cent in sterling terms.
All conceded that they missed the opportunity, but none mourned the loss.
Even now, only one is edging tentatively back into the market.
Instead, they were satisfied with gains on the quarter ranging from 6 per
cent to 11 per cent, and probably slept more easily at night without an
unpredictable Japanese market to worry about.
There remain strong agreements on the fundamental constellation of
investment indicators: the dollar and the yen are set to continue
strengthening; recession in Germany and Japan continue to cast a long
shadow; the US and UK equity markets are expensive and need careful stock
selection. In Europe, Germany gets a universal cold shoulder, while the
markets to favour are France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
All wax enthusiastic about the smaller Asian markets: 'It is difficult not
to get carried away in describing prospects in 1993 and beyond,' comments
Paul Myners. Tim Howe has even dipped a toe into the long neglected
Australian market - 'the purest commodity play' - in expectation of rising
commodity prices.
Of course, the war of words between China and Britain over the future of
Hong Kong led to some nail biting over this key regional market, though at
the end of the quarter, with the Hang Seng index 18.3 per cent higher, only
Japan reported a stronger performance.
Douglas McDougall exudes the greatest confidence here: 'We believe the
outlook for Hong Kong depends on developments within China itself, and that
the favourable momentum of recent years will be sustained as China continues
to liberalise its economy.'
Attitudes about bonds remain mixed. Howard Beaufort detects a 'particularly
favourable environment for high quality international bonds'; Douglas
McDougall is comfortable to move from French to UK bonds because of higher
yields; but Paul Myners is busily transferring into equities, and is
'delighted to have no exposure to conventional gilts'.
Douglas McDougall (Baillie Gifford) has used 5 per cent of his 20 per cent
in European equities to lift his UK equity holding to 45 per cent, where
'signs of recovery are becoming more clear'. He says: 'Budget and trade
deficits remain worries. But profits are likely to rise quite strongly this
year and in 1994.' He believes the UK market is not cheap 'but compares well
with most other markets'.
Mr McDougall says the continental European markets look expensive compared
with the UK, as does the US equity market. He remains 'most optimistic' and
'most overweight' in the small Pacific markets.
The only other change to his portfolio is to reap a currency gain by selling
his 7 1/2 per cent holding in French bonds and buying UK gilts instead.
Paul Myners (Gartmore) is diluting his US bonds by 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per
cent, and his European bond holding from 10 per cent to 4 per cent, keeping
this last tranche in French bonds only.
Instead, he is acquiring a 5 per cent holding in large capitalisation US
equities, boosting his overall equity holding in the US to 15 per cent. Of
this, two thirds is in large capitalisation stocks, and one third in small
companies.
He is using the 6 per cent raised from selling European bonds to buy three
equal equity stakes in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands - a clear
modification of his view in December that Europe's equity markets look 'more
and more like an economic disaster'. Mr Myners remains clear that Germany
offers 'very poor value at present'.
Of his 50 per cent UK equity holding, one fifth is now in small companies,
which, he says, are 'still undervalued'.
Howard Beaufort (Newton Investment Management) has boosted his UK equity
holdings by 4 per cent to 48 per cent, funding the shift by taking profits
on US equities, which now stand at 6 per cent of the portfolio: 'Even
against a background of the UK market continuing to move sideways, investors
will continue to achieve an attractive return through the concentration in
stocks of high quality companies, able to make progress in a weak business
environment because of enduring competitive advantages.'
He remains confident about his continental European equity holdings, which
are buoyed by lower interest rates, low inflation, and recovery prospects in
1994. He emphasises that many are global in their operations, so not heavily
influenced by recession across Europe.
Mr Beaufort retains his 20 per cent cash and bond holding, confident of the
'benign environment' for financial markets.
Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) has trimmed his UK equity holdings from 65
per cent to 62 per cent of the portfolio, adding a little to his equity
holdings on the continent of Europe, and acquiring a new 2 per cent holding
in Australia.
'The investment in Australia is already proving rewarding,' he says.
In the UK, he is reducing exposure to second- and third-liners after 'sharp
price rises' in the first quarter, reinvesting profits in market leaders. He
expects the upside to be limited in the UK by the weight of rights issues
and new issues on the market.
On the continent, Mr Howe sees stock selection as critical, favouring
France, Holland and Switzerland. In the US, he feels that recovery will
underpin the market, though he has taken some profits.
He remains active in Asia, even 'tentatively investing' back into Japan,
where he feels 'the market could surprise investors with the speed of its
turn around'.
Like his fellow professionals, Mr Howe's bond holdings are focused on
France. He has opted to take some profits on his US bonds, but feels that
long-dated UK gilts 'should rise a little'.
This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise, to see how
four professional fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf
of a hypothetical client - for instance, a wealthy individual or a small
self-administered pension fund.
The managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years
or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started in October
1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning of this
month, and will be reviewed at the end of June.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Interest-rate
prospects divide investors - Venturing further along the yield curve may
lift returns, but it also risks exposure to inflation / Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH AS much as Pounds 50bn of gilts to sell in the new financial year, the
government is keen to encourage greater participation by retail investors,
at a time when the current low level of deposit rates has made the quest for
higher returns more urgent for many investors.
Last month, the Bank of England published a * guide for the small investor,
designed to explain the workings of the market. In addition, the government
has increased the maximum that can be invested in gilts via the National
Savings Stock Register at the Post Office from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
25,000, and has expanded the range of gilts available to retail investors to
include all stocks.
However, the strong rally in the gilts market in the first quarter of the
year has brought gilt yields at the short end of the market down to
relatively low levels. Five-year gilts are currently yielding around 6 3/4
per cent, around the same level as deposit rates.
Some investors are now being tempted to venture further along the yield
curve and buy longer-dated gilts, in order to improve returns, given that,
unlike many other markets, the gilts market still has a positive yield curve
(that is, yields rise in line with the lengthening of maturity).
Ten-year gilts offer yields one percentage point higher than five-year
gilts, and even longer maturities carry greater rewards. However, investors
buying longer-dated gilts are also risking exposure to potential increases
in inflation.
The UK bond market is currently divided between bulls and bears.
Although five-year yields have fallen substantially, investors who believe
that there is a further one point cut in base rates to come could still
decide to position themselves to benefit from a rally. The September short
sterling futures contract on the London International Financial Futures &amp;
Options Exchange reflects expectations of  1/4 point cut in the base rate by
September, suggesting that the market has not discounted the full effect of
any further cut.
'At the moment the market is assuming that rate cuts are off the agenda, but
there is a residual feeling that there is still a point to come off,' said
Peter Fellner, a bond economist at NatWest Capital Markets.
The bulls believe that there is room for another rate cut to 5 per cent, and
that the slender economic recovery in the UK economy will not spark
inflationary pressure. With the headline rate of inflation at 1.8 per cent,
yields are relatively attractive. The bulls believe that, even in an
economic recovery, core inflation will remain under control at below 3 per
cent. If long-term inflation is held down, the prospect of gaining a higher
yield from longer-dated gilts is attractive.
But the bond market bears argue that the gilts market is at the end of an
extremely strong rally, that base rates have hit their lows and will start
to creep up again as the economic recovery gathers speed. In this scenario,
the UK could end up with a core inflation rate of 4-5 per cent. Further,
there is some scepticism about the government's ability to meet its enlarged
funding needs, without yields being forced up.
Last summer, following John Major's election win, there was widespread talk
that the gilts market was set to become a core component of investment
portfolios around the world, like Bunds and US Treasuries. Such hopes were
dashed when sterling came under pressure and then was pushed out of the
exchange rate mechanism, leaving some foreign investors badly burnt by the
currency, not for the first time.
Although the news that overseas investors bought Pounds 1bn of gilts in
February, the largest monthly total in nearly two years, brought some
renewed hopes that foreign demand could help support the market, the buying
appears to have been largely speculative, sparked by the weakness of
sterling, and unlikely to be sustained.
Chancellor Norman Lamont's easing of the funding rule, to allow holdings of
gilts by banks and building societies to count towards the borrowing
requirement, in last month's Budget is expected to have only a marginal
effect.
With large budget deficits projected for several years, the government needs
to attract fresh money. Its eagerness to attract retail investors to the
market - particularly given pressure to keep down the volume of national
savings certificates - is understandable, but should perhaps be viewed with
some caution.
Fund managers themselves are finding the gilts market a tough call
currently. 'In view of the tighter fiscal stance over the medium term, there
is a 50/50 chance of one last base rate cut by year-end before interest
rates begin to ratchet up again,' according to fund managers at Julius Baer
Investments.
The promise of bond markets at the start of the year has been fulfilled in
the first quarter, perhaps to a greater degree than some had expected. With
recovery already under way in the US, and the UK apparently in tow, there is
an argument for looking at markets whose economies are still declining, such
as the Bund market.
Some UK retail investors are turning again to the index-linked gilts market,
which has the attraction of offering fixed real yields.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Out of the
shower to splash out on Norcros - With a rise of more than 64 per cent after
18 months, the portfolio draws confidence from the success of its
speculation in Burlington / Equities, Building a Portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON

<TEXT>
I WAS taking a shower when I suddenly thought of a highly speculative
investment. I was delighted with my newly-installed Triton electric shower
which replaced an old gas-heated system.
Triton is owned by Norcros, and in that company's November statement (for
the half-year to September 30, 1992), the chairman, Julian Sheffield, stated
that the company 'continues to reap the rewards' from Triton's 'strong
market position.'
However, he also reported that half-year pre-tax profits had fallen from
Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 5.6m, with earnings per share down from 3p to 2.5p. He
warned: 'It is unlikely that we will see any significant improvement in
trading conditions during the second half-year.'
So why buy the shares? Because Mr Sheffield also said the company 'should
benefit from our continuing cost-reduction and productivity improvement
programme.' I also feel that lower interest rates should reduce the
company's borrowing costs. But the main attraction is Norcros's takeover
potential.
Earlier this month, MB-Caradon sold its 25 per cent stake in the packaging
company, Carnaud Metalbox for Pounds 473m. Analysts immediately started
speculating as to which companies in the building materials sector might be
on the receiving end of the now cash-rich MB-Caradon. Most overlooked
Norcros, which is listed in the Other Industrials sector - yet it has much
in common with MB-Caradon.
For example, Norcros not only owns Triton showers but also Crittall windows.
MB-Caradon owns Mira showers and Everest windows. Norcros owns Crosby Sarek
doors, H&amp;R Johnson tiles - plus tile-adhesive companies and an innovative
print and packaging division.
With a share price of 158p, Norcros has a market capitalisation of Pounds
214.7m. Even if MB-Caradon had to pay 200p-225p to gain control of Norcros,
it could easily afford it and the benefits of cross-promotion of products
worldwide could be tremendous. My personal pension scheme has therefore
taken a modest stake in Norcros.
However, the review's portfolio cannot be too speculative. Norcros is due to
report its full-year figures in early June. What if they are disappointing?
In 1992, the shares were as low as 62p, which shows how far they might fall
 -especially if the company does not attract a predator. The share price
could also be dragged down by a general dip in the market. Thus, I am only
investing Pounds 4,740 of the portfolio's cash to buy 3,000 Norcros shares.
I will also set a stop-loss level of 138p-140p.
One of the reasons I feel the portfolio is ready for Norcros is that its
speculation in Burlington Group has proved so successful. In October, it
bought 8,000 Burlington shares for 11.5p each, in the hope that the company
would attract the attention of an entrepreneur, since, at that level,
Burlington had a market capitalisation of under Pounds 2m; it was thus a
relatively cheap stock market vehicle for anyone wanting to expand their
business interests. I stated that, in the absence of any bid rumours, the
portfolio would sell its shares if they reached 23p-25p.
The shares shot up to 17p after my October article but subsequently fell
back to 13p before powering upwards again. When the shares reached 27p on
March 26, I thought that, surely, a large stakeholder would be revealed. But
nothing was announced, and so the portfolio sold half its shareholding.
Thus, an initial Pounds 920 investment in that company has produced cash of
Pounds 1,080, so the portfolio's remaining 4,000 Burlington shares have
effectively cost it nothing. It can therefore take a more relaxed view
should the shares fall back and no predator appear.
In his February, 1993, statement in Burlington's 1992 annual report, Mr DC
Marshall, chairman, commented that at the year-end Burlington's net asset
value was 18.1p per share.
The portfolio would therefore consider buying up to 20,000 more Burlington
shares if their price fell back again to around 13p-15p (my personal pension
scheme has been buying and selling shares in Burlington since 1989).
The benefit of patience and stop-loss levels can be seen with the
portfolio's experience with Fisons. In the summer issue of the Review, I
felt Fisons shares could eventually recover, and so I bought 1,000 at 168p
in August with a stop-loss level of 130p. In January this year, when Fisons
were over 230p, I stated that the stop-loss limit would be raised to 200p as
I still took a cautious view of the company and its takeover prospects. In
March, Fisons fell to that 200p level and the portfolio disposed of its
entire holding at a profit.
The portfolio retains its investment in Pentland, and has benefited from
that company's surprise payment earlier this month of a 12p-per-share
dividend in order to distribute to shareholders the majority of the Pounds
47.3m exceptional profit which the company made from currency gains
associated with its aborted bid for Adidas. I regard Pentland as a good
long-term investment, and have high hopes for its Speedo swimwear and Pony
sports shoes brand. Pony could eventually be as well known as Reebok.
If the shares fell back to their 1992 low of 94p, the portfolio would
consider buying another 2,000. (My personal pension scheme has a holding in
Pentland.)
In the last Review, I mentioned a number of companies which I was monitoring
with a possible view to a purchase for the portfolio. I liked Allied
Colloids but was hoping the shares would fall to 200p-210p in order to make
a purchase. Like Meggitt (target price 75p-80p), Renishaw (240p-250p), EIS
(355p) and William Ransom (40p-45p), Allied Colloids did not fall within the
portfolio's buying range.
Having reconsidered all these companies' prospects, I have revised the
levels at which the portfolio will make a purchase. The portfolio will
therefore buy 1,000 Allied Colloid shares if a general market drop causes
them to fall to around 215p.
The revised purchase level for 2,000 shares in Meggitt, a well-run
engineering group, will be 80p-85p. Another international engineering
company, EIS Group, will be bought (750 shares) if they fall back to 400p -
but a stop-loss level of 350p would also be set. Renishaw would be purchased
(1,000 shares) if they fell to 250p-260p, with a stop-loss level of 200p.
In the last Review, I stated that the portfolio would consider buying 5,000
shares in William Ransom (in which my pension scheme has a small holding) if
the shares fell to around 40p-45p. They, too, did not fall, but I feel the
company has good prospects, so the portfolio will buy 3,000 shares at 52p
each and will consider buying a further 2,000 if the share price falls back
to the 40p-45p level, although a stop-loss limit of 35p would be set.
One of the reasons I like William Ransom is that it is involved in the
extraction of plant material for the health care, food, beverage and
cosmetic industries. I feel this is an area of activity that could be due
for a boom. Last year, I read a news report which stated that scientists at
universities at Vienna and Innsbruck had demonstrated that lavender oil can
help combat stress. I feel that some enterprising pharmaceutical company
ought to be developing all sorts of treatments involving lavender oil -
already used by some aromatherapists to treat drug addicts.
I hope that William Ransom could then supply the necessary ingredients.
Meanwhile, as a well-managed, profitable company with a wide spread of plant
extract expertise - and with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 8.1m -
it has considerable appeal. If the shares fall, I will have to sniff some
lavender to calm down]
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Three new ways
for serious investors to slice up the market - Measurement of UK equities'
performance has become increasingly complex. But the ordinary saver should
try to keep life simple / Equities, The UK Indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
YOU STRUGGLE along with the old stock market indices for years, and then
suddenly three new ones come along almost together.
That must be how it appears to the average private investor, who has seen
the FT-SE SmallCap index appear from the beginning of this year to join the
FT-SE Mid 250 and the FT-SE 350 which first appeared last October.
The result is that there is now a formidable range of indices published each
day in the FT, covering just the UK equity market, let alone the markets
overseas.
Apart from the three new ones, there are the venerable FT 30-Share (or
Ordinary Share) Index, the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index and also the UK
Index published as part of the FT-Actuaries World Index series.
If that is not enough, the All-Share is divided into more than 40 different
sector indices, and the FT-SE 350 is split into 35 separate industry baskets
(although only four of these are regularly published in the Financial
Times).
Stock market indices go back a long way. Charles Dow began publishing an
average of New York-traded railroad stocks back in 1884, and 12 years later
he devised his Dow Jones Industrial Average which is still the most popular
measure of the ups and downs of Wall Street.
In the UK, the London and Cambridge Economic Service also started an
industrial index at the end of the 19th century, though only monthly; and
the actuarial profession got into the index business in 1928 with a monthly
Actuaries Index. But it was 1935 before the Financial Times began publishing
a daily index.
It was found that a stock market index was a potent marketing tool, drawing
attention to the market and enabling investors to grasp a single number
rather than cope with a confusing jumble of share prices all moving in
different ways.
However, for decades there were serious technological limitations. Charles
Dow used a crude average of stock prices because it was easy to calculate,
but this was a bit like averaging apples and oranges. The British actuaries
had a better structure, but could only calculate the numbers once a month.
The FT-30 used a more sophisticated geometrical model, in which adjusted
share prices were multiplied together, which could be done fairly quickly
using log tables. This proved perfectly adequate for day-to-day movements in
normal circumstances. Eventually it was being calculated hourly by hand.
However, the 30-Share Index had one or two quirks. If a constituent went
bust, the whole index would collapse to zero; so weak companies had to be
whisked out of the index before too much damage was done.
Moreover, the construction of the index made it inevitable that over the
long term it would rise more slowly than the total value of shares on the
stock exchange (that is, the aggregate market capitalisation). It was a good
tool for measuring short-term movements, but not the long-term performance
of actual portfolios.
By the early 1960s, advances in technology made it possible to attempt
something much more ambitious. The actuaries and the FT joined to launch the
FT-Actuaries series. This highly sophisticated set of indices, in which the
constituents are weighted according to their market capitalisation, and
which therefore behaves like a real portfolio, has set the pattern for
almost all subsequent indices, both in the UK and internationally.
More recently information technology has developed at an accelerating pace.
Share prices no longer have to be individually collected (at one time they
were chalked on a board by a man touring the jobbers' pitches on the floor
of the Stock Exchange), but are continually fed into a computer network. So
the 'real time', or minute-by-minute, index has become practicable. The FT
30-Share Index is now calculated this way.
Stock market indices have therefore now moved into a third stage of
development. Whereas the first was to publicise overall market movements and
the second was to provide benchmarks for portfolio performance, the third is
to provide the raw material for so-called derivative products such as
futures and options, and for the quantitative (or computer-based) techniques
used by modern professional investment managers.
The first of these indices, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index,
was launched in 1984 and was the UK's pioneering real-time index. Based on
the 100 biggest stocks in terms of market valuation (updated each quarter),
it was designed to be the basis for futures and options contracts.
The very latest indices reflect the desire of sophisticated investors to
slice up the stock market in different ways, according to the sizes of the
companies. It has long been accepted that the chemicals sector, say, might
move differently from the life insurance sector. Now, investors keep track
of big companies, as opposed to small companies or even mid-sized companies.
But it would be ambitious of private investors to attempt to keep up with
all this. The amateur investor will be much happier with a single index that
he knows and understands. He or she should be cautious about the complex
matrix of sector and size indices that provide great scope for the
computer-based boffin, but may provide no clear message about whether the
market is going up or down or is just churning in what the buffs call a
'sector rotation'.
Probably Charles Dow would have found it all rather hard going, too.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): What they show
 -Equities / The UK Indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT Ordinary (30-Share) Index:
Based on 30 blue-chip shares, it is the oldest of the well-known indices and
still a sensitive guide to the day-to-day movements of the stock market.
FT-SE 100 Index:
A capitalisation-weighted index based on the top 100 London-listed stocks,
the 'Footsie 100' is a widely quoted measure of short-term movements.
However, it does not include smaller companies' shares. It is available
minute-by-minute from 8.30 to 4.30, and can be found in your home on BBC and
Channel 4 teletext.
FT-SE Mid 250 Index:
Like the Footsie 100, but covers the next 250 companies ranked by market
value. It is designed to reflect the performance of shares in the middle of
the market. It is calculated minute-by-minute, but may only be found on
professional information services such as the Stock Exchange's Topic.
FT-SE Actuaries 350 Index:
Includes all 350 constituents of the 100 and 250 indices. It is continuously
calculated, and is divided into industry baskets. Covering 92 per cent of
market value, rather than the 72 per cent represented by the Footsie 100, it
gives a better guide to the performance of the market as a whole.
FT-Actuaries All-Share Index:
Published daily since 1962, and well established as the professional
investor's benchmark for medium-term and long-term portfolio performance.
This index has this year been extended to cover about 800, rather than 650,
stocks. It now covers about 98 per cent of the UK market, in terms of value.
It is calculated each evening after the market close, and has many groups
and sub-sections.
FT-SE SmallCap Index:
An innovation for 1993, the SmallCap Index's constituents consist of all
those companies within the All-Share but not large enough to be within the
350. Like the All-Share it is worked out once a day. It is a benchmark for
smaller company funds, including certain unit trusts and investment trusts,
and is liable to show significantly different movements from the indices of
market leaders.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Irish banks
are top performers as Europe's revival continues - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'EUROPEAN markets have reminded us forcefully in the past six months that
the relationship between interest rates and equities is far from
mechanical,' said Robert Fleming Securities, in a recent strategy report.
Illustrating this view, the first quarter of 1993 extended the re-awakening
in Continental bourses, which had begun late last October as they awaited a
Bundesbank interest rate cut.
In the three months to end-March, Europe, excluding the UK, gained 9.53 per
cent in sterling terms, as measured by the FT-A World Indices, against a
9.33 per cent rise in the final quarter of 1992.
This year, however, has given Euro-investors an object lesson in choice.
Individual countries have been moved by fiscal and political considerations;
currencies have reflected the argument between the high-interest-rate and
devaluation camps.
Once those choices had been made, industrial sectors were still divided
between defensive and cyclical plays; and individual companies moved both
with and against their sector trends.
The two biggest continental markets produced above-average gains in sterling
terms. France registered a 12.8 per cent appreciation on the quarter.
Germany balanced its increasingly painful recession against the slow easing
of Bundesbank fiscal policy, to show a rise of 11.03 per cent, but was
fairly subdued in March as the Russian political crisis developed.
Elsewhere, it would have been nice to have domestic currency available.
Ireland and Finland, in local currency terms, were the top European
performers in the World Index series in the quarter, with gains of 27 and 26
per cent respectively.
The Irish punt was devalued on February 1, but this represented a limited
cut in value. Even in sterling terms, Ireland leads the pack with a 19 per
cent gain.
Interest rate cuts have been the key. Ireland's short-term facility rate,
cut by 0.75 of a percentage point on April 2, had by then been reduced eight
times since February 1.
There were big rewards at corporate level. The country's two big banks,
Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, combined domestic interest rate
sensitivity with strong recovery prospects in the US. These two stocks,
individually, were the best performers in Europe, outside the UK, as
measured by the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, with rises of 49 and 48 per cent.
Finland's recovery, an extension of its gains in the final quarter of 1992,
combined the linked effects of devaluation, interest rate cuts and a feeling
that the bottom of the recession had been reached. However, devaluation had
the opposite effect on the value of existing holdings in foreign currency
terms - the Helsinki market lost half of its gains on that score, rising
only 12.97 per cent in terms of sterling.
Its Nordic neighbour, Sweden, offered a stark contrast, with a first-quarter
fall in equities of nearly 4 per cent in sterling terms. The country had a
couple of exciting weeks in February after Ericsson, the telecommunications
giant, issued better than expected 1992 results; indeed, Ericsson ran high
in the individual lists last quarter, with its B shares up 44.6 per cent.
Since then, however, a crisis of confidence in the economy has led to
heightened political risk, and this has kept major houses out of the market
for the time being.
Italy, with its scandal-ridden politics putting ever increasing pressure on
the lira, saw its equity market rise only 1.45 per cent in sterling terms in
the quarter. This is one country, too, where sector selection, linked with
interest rate and general economic
G258
cycles, did not make the usual amount of sense.
Two of Italy's big banks, Credito Italiano and BCI, ranked bottom and third
bottom among Eurotrack 100 constituents over the quarter, with falls of
20.09, and 10.34 respectively. The time to have bought these stocks was in
the second half of last year, when privatisation fever inflamed the Milan
stock market. Within six months there were gains of 91.53, and 56.31 per
cent respectively.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Strong
government support helps the Tokyo market to recover - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A bleak 1992, the Tokyo stock market closed the first quarter on a
firm note, helped by strong government support, dubbed the 'price-keeping
operation'.
The leading Nikkei average of 225 stocks defied persistent rumours of a
pre-book closing crash, and finally finished up 9.8 per cent on the quarter,
ending the financial year to March at 18,591.45.
A widespread fear prevailed during the beginning of the quarter, that the
market might face a large bout of selling by investors who wanted to realise
profits ahead of the financial year-end.
The banks, which face a sharp fall in profits, due to bad loan exposure,
were expected to unload some of their long-term stock holdings in order to
prop up earnings figures, as were life assurers, which hold heavy losses on
international bond investments.
Industrial companies, which were enthusiastic investors in the stock market
during the late 1980s, were also seen as potential sellers, because many
expressed the need to liquidate loss-making stock portfolios.
However, continued buying of shares by public funds, including postal
savings and social welfare money, flowed into the market, eventually
reassuring even the most pessimistic investor. The government alleviated
fears by telling banks and life insurance companies not to sell shares to
realise profits.
The support by public funds was a part of a salvage plan for the ailing
market which, at 14,309.41, had last August been at its lowest level for six
years. The government allocated an extra Y1,120bn to be invested in the
stock market.
Another support for Japanese shares has been the sharp rise in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, the country's most widely held stock.
After sliding steadily for five years, the semi-privatised telecom company
surged 53.5 per cent during the three months to March, on hints by
government officials of a hike in call rates, and talk of public investment
projects in a new telecommunications infrastructure.
NTT symbolised the woes of Japanese investors, many of whom had invested in
stocks for the first time when the government sold its first tranche in
February 1987 for Y1.19m a share. After a peak of Y3.18m, the issue plunged
on the fall in the Tokyo stock market and concerns over the company's
business prospects, and hit an all time low of Y453,000 last August.
The recovery of NTT, hopes of an additional fiscal package, low interest
rates - all these have changed the outlook for share prices; and while the
overall economy still shows evidence of continued weakness, the market has
surged on high trading volumes.
Foreign investors, led by US and UK pension funds, were active. But while
analysts are expecting the Nikkei to rise above 21,000, and the Tokyo market
may offer higher returns than the US or Hong Kong markets in the medium
term, some investors fear that the recent surge may be a 'mini-bubble',
induced by low interest rates. The second quarter may see some profit-taking
as investors await corporate profit announcements in mid-May, for the year
that ended in March.
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, the Australian market
surged ahead, with the All Ordinaries Index rising 7.6 per cent on the
quarter, to 1,667.4. The strengthening of the currency has boosted the bond
market, and the rise in gold prices and the re-election of Mr Paul Keating
also provided underlying support.
G260
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index showed surprising resilience to the
current political turmoil created by disagreement with China. After falling
sharply in February, the stock market has recovered, and the index closed up
15.9 per cent at 6,388.86.
The Straits Times Index of the Singapore stock market received a boost from
a reduction in corporate tax rates to 27 per cent, and finished the quarter
at 1,668.30, up 9.4 per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): US investors
fear higher interest rates and the return of inflation - Equities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US STOCK markets put in a solid performance during the first quarter. Daily
trading volume hit record levels, as did the main stock indices at one stage
or another. By the end of the three months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
had gained 3.8 per cent to stand at 3,435.11 - about 40 points short of its
all-time high, set in mid-March.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tracked the Dow closely, rising 3.7 per cent
in the quarter, to end at 451.67. The disappointment was in secondary
stocks, with the Nasdaq composite posting a gain of only 1.9 per cent,
ending the period at 690.13.
It was low interest rates that provided the fuel for the markets' advance.
Although gross domestic product had grown by a surprisingly strong 4.8 per
cent in the final three months of 1992, economic growth for early 1993 was
expected to be modest, and relatively inflation-free. These expectations,
coupled with surprise at President Clinton's willingness to tackle the
budget deficit, pushed US interest rates to historic lows.
Over the three months, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped from
an early-January high of just under 7.5 per cent to around 6.7 per cent -
the lowest yield in the issue's history. Short-term market rates also fell
sharply.
It was low rates that forced so many investors to move their money out of
poor-yielding short-term financial instruments, like bank certificates of
deposit and money-market funds, and put them into equities, either directly,
or through mutual funds, which attracted record amounts of cash during the
quarter.
Earnings, however, did play a part in the markets' progress. Generally,
companies reported solid, and sometimes better-than-expected profits for the
final quarter of 1992, including the big three auto manufacturers, whose
fortunes continued to improve steadily.
But some big names ran into trouble. The most notable was IBM, which had a
miserable quarter after losing billions of dollars and announcing the first
round of genuinely compulsory layoffs in its history. At least the
appointment of a new chairman, former RJR Nabisco chief Louis Gerstner,
meant that the period ended on an upbeat note. Several other beleagured
blue-chip companies also brought in new management during the quarter,
including American Express and Westinghouse Electric.
As always, share prices did not move upward in a straight line. The biggest
reversal came in mid-February, when President Clinton's pre-budget warning
of tax increases spooked investors, who feared the hikes would hurt the
economy. They were also unhappy at the lack of spending cuts in the
administration's economic plan. In two days, the Dow fell more than 100
points.
Equities quickly recovered their composure, thanks primarily to the
sustained rally in the bond market, which was pushing yields to record lows.
The quarter ended, however, with the markets in a subdued mood. Investors
are worried that interest rates may soon be heading up, that inflation may
pick up again soon (because of rising commodity prices and the weak dollar);
and they are confused about the state of the economic recovery, which seemed
to slowing - quite possibly under the weight of the Clinton tax increases.
Canada: The index of 300 leading issues on the Toronto Stock Exchange rose
7.5 per cent in the quarter. Growing confidence in the outlook for the
economy, heavy demand for forestry stocks (plus the fact that Canadian
shares fell so far during the recent recession and therefore had more ground
to recover), explained the strong
G259
performance. The news that prime minister Brian Mulroney would step down
this summer had little impact on the market.
Mexico: share prices barely moved, with the Prices and Quotations Index
gaining less than 1 per cent in the quarter to end at 1,771.71. Concern
about the economic and trade policies of the new US administration, coupled
with higher domestic interest rates and disappointing economic growth, held
the market back.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Shares ignore
hesitant Bundesbank - Star performers in the first quarter were Europe
(excluding the UK), the Pacific region, and South Africa, where the return
in sterling terms was more than 20 per cent / Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MOST EQUITY markets ignored any forebodings associated with the Ides of
March, and chose that month to reach their highest points for the first
quarter of the year.
Of the 24 national markets that make up the FT-Actuaries World Index, 23
(the exception was Sweden) showed a positive total return for sterling-based
investors. Eighteen had their high in March. Norway, with a return of 14.2
per cent, hit its high on Ides day itself, March 15.
During the quarter, Europe (excluding the UK), the Pacific region and South
Africa were the star performers. The return, in sterling terms, in the local
South African market was more than 20 per cent, partly because the JSE Gold
Index rose by some 50 per cent, but also because of a recovery in the rand.
Tokyo ended the quarter with a return of more than 19 per cent for sterling
holders, the pay-off being only marginally less for US dollar investors. But
a caveat is needed. The Nikkei average crossed the 19,000 mark on March 29,
more than 12 per cent higher on the quarter, yet at just about the same
level as in March last year.
Those who invested in Tokyo in the heady days of late 1992 are still nursing
sizeable losses, but short-term holders are laughing and may be considering
taking profits. A few optimists are hoping for more heady days, and trading
in early April was encouraging.
In Europe, most fund managers also had happy days, although some leading
houses only went overweight (against the FT world index) as the quarter
progressed. The investment theory now is that the US was first into
recession and is first coming out, with lower interest rates driving up Wall
Street. Europe, on the other hand, was last into recession, and share prices
have started to anticipate falling interest rates, despite a hesitant
Bundesbank.
Europe as a whole has produced disappointing results for investors over the
past three years, but many fund managers think its time has come, despite
continued weak economic data. France and Germany had, respectively, a total
sterling return in the first quarter of almost 14 and 12 per cent.
Belgium, ignoring a minor government crisis, did even better at 16.7 per
cent; while Norway, the Netherlands and Spain were all around 14 per cent
higher in sterling terms. Ireland, which finally followed sterling down with
a 10 per cent currency devaluation, but stayed inside the ERM, returned more
than 20 per cent.
Italy, on the other hand, struggled with its equity and currency levels,
burdened by an avalanche of scandals that seemingly touched all political
parties and most of the country's major state companies. In FT index terms,
the market returned just over 2 per cent to sterling-based investors, but an
impressive 10 per cent (in the circumstances) in local terms. Sweden had
half that for local investors, but a negative return for dollar and sterling
holders.
Investors on Wall Street didn't do too well in the quarter, the sterling
total return being under 5 per cent and almost a point less in dollar terms.
Many analysts think that much of the anticipated good US economic news is
already in equity prices, and that the market looks fully valued for the
immediate future. Canada yielded over 8 per cent.
The quarter's return in the UK market was thin, at 3.2 per cent, although,
on balance, shares in medium-sized British companies did better than the
average of the FT-SE 100 index, and a lot of selective stock-picking is now
under way. In the larger UK stocks, the scope for significant dividend
increases seems poor.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Faith, hope and
cyclicals - Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market proved not too bad a bargain for investors in the first
three months of the year, though its performance does not bear too close
scrutiny.
Measured by the FT-A All-Share index, shares showed a total return of 4.6
per cent, outstripping the return on cash and comparing satisfactorily with
that on conventional UK government bonds. But this looks less impressive
when set against the 9.8 per cent return from the FT-World ex-UK index.
More significantly, the return on the All-Share was considerably better than
the 2.6 per cent on the FT-SE 100 stocks list, but was strongly outperformed
by returns on both the FT-SE Mid 250 (9.5 per cent) and the FT-SE SmallCap
(14.8 per cent).
What these statistics are saying is that faith in a recovery in the domestic
economy has proved justified in the cyclical stocks, which are often
relatively small businesses and can be expected to feel the upturn first.
But recovery has not so far proved strong enough, or fast enough, to support
the general optimism that was displayed around Christmas.
Best-performing sectors have been: capital goods, which have responded to
such signs as there have been of a wider economic recovery; and, perhaps
surprisingly, the financial group. Tumbling interest rates last autumn have
lifted some of the worst of the bad-debt worries from the banks. Merchant
banks benefited similarly, and were also helped by a rights issue flow of
nearly Pounds 3bn over the quarter.
But brewers, food retailers, stores and hotels have all seen prospects of a
revival in consumer and leisure spending repeatedly offered, and then
snatched away again.
While the last cut in base rates, on January 25, helped to revive the stock
market from a setback which had taken it to nearly 4 per cent below the
reading on New Year's Eve, it raised, but did not satisfy, hopes that John
Major's government was putting economic recovery top of its list of
priorities.
The outlook for corporate earnings and dividends has been clouded by the
Budget changes in advance corporation tax and in treatment of dividends
accorded to overseas earnings. These changes threaten a fall in equity
returns to domestic pension funds, which casts a cloud over current market
valuations.
Even the fund manager who read the UK market right has had to contend with
some vicious developments. The worst has been the savage under-performance
of the pharmaceuticals sector, notably Glaxo which, according to NatWest
Securities, reduced the FT-A All-Share performance by 1.2 per cent.
Problems started with doubts about the new healthcare policies likely to be
introduced by the Clinton administration, expanded into wider concern about
the future for Zantac, the group's wonder drug, and culminated in an
unexpected shake-up in the boardroom. By the end of the quarter, the health
and household (pharmaceutical) sector was showing a disastrous minus-14.6
per cent return, and matters have deteriorated as both Wellcome and Fisons
have hit trouble.
Unfortunately, these are all core stocks in most managed portfolios, which
is why not all, or perhaps not many, fund managers were able to match
overall market returns. The laurels seem to have gone in the first quarter
of 1993 to the private investors who, according to Sharelink, the Birmingham
stockbroker which dominates the private client business, have been buyers of
the smaller stocks that have led the market.
However, the second quarter has opened with better news on the domestic
housing market, generally agreed as a necessary primer for a wider recovery,
and also in car sales.
Forecasts for the UK stock market this year remain fairly restrained. Nomura
Research, the market's super-bull, still expects to see the FT-SE 100 index
at 3,500 within 12 months; but most forecasters stop short at 3,000, and
some a good way short of that.

THAT WASN'T at all what I'd expected,' said Alison, as she and John were
shown out of the office of Quills, the solicitors. 'I always thought that
making a Will was easy.'
They had just spent two rather dispiriting hours with Mr Knibb, the probate
partner, who had left them with a lot of things to think about.
John, too, had been taken aback. He had thought that all he had to do was
fill in a form obtainable at a stationers. But he was beginning to realise
that a Will should be tailor-made for individual circumstances, and that it
could be used to achieve tax savings.
First, they had been asked to list their assets, with approximate values.
Apparently, the reason was to assess the impact of inheritance tax. Whatever
they left to each other would be free of tax, but on the second death
everything, apart from the first Pounds 150,000, would be taxed at 40 per
cent.
Even in the current market, the Plowshares' house, jointly owned, must be
worth Pounds 250,000, or Pounds 125,000 each, with the Pounds 30,000
mortgage covered by an endowment policy. Shares, building society deposits
and Peps worked out at Pounds 53,000 for John and Pounds 54,000 for Alison,
after the small gifts that she had recently made to their children.
It was more difficult to estimate the value of the house contents and then
to split that value according to ownership. Most things were jointly owned,
but the bureau bookcase which Alison had been left by her grandfather must
be hers, and the 18th century architectural drawings collected by John were
his, and these now had a substantial value. They finally managed to arrive
at a figure of Pounds 50,000 for John and Pounds 20,000 for Alison.
John was dismayed to hear that his interest in his partnership was relevant,
but relieved to learn that only last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer
had introduced a relief of 100 per cent for certain business interests,
including partnership interests.
With the help of Mr Knibb's calculator, they experienced a strange mixture
of gratification and alarm when they discovered that they had total taxable
assets of Pounds 228,000 for John and Pounds 199,000 for Alison. A final
flourish on the redoubtable calculator revealed an ultimate inheritance tax
bill of about Pounds 111,000.
Debts, funeral expenses and pre-death tax bills, let alone the costs of
administering the estate, might require that an immediate Pounds 120,000 be
drawn from the estate. But shares, Peps and building society deposits would
realise only Pounds 107,000, leaving a considerable shortfall. Therefore
something would have to be sold immediately, most likely the house and its
contents, or John's share in his business.
This appeared to put paid to Alison's ideas of leaving the house to the
children. But Mr Knibb, who annoyingly believed himself well-versed in human
nature, felt the children would wish to sell the house anyway.
However, he did reveal that, even at John's and Alison's ages, 'joint life
and last survivor' insurance was relatively cheap and could be written in
trust for the children, so that the policy proceeds would themselves escape
taxation.
He took their dates of birth and promised to furnish them with a quotation,
explaining that any commission he might receive from the insurance taken out
would be paid over to the Plowshares, under Law Society rules.
Mr Knibb suggested two other ways of mitigating the ultimate tax bill. They
could each give away Pounds 3,000 each year, and any larger gifts would be
free of tax if they survived seven years from the date of the gift. But here
there were practical problems: they could not afford to give away much in
the way of cash or shares; and Mr Knibb explained that, while a gift of
house or contents would be possible, the seven-year period would not start
running until they had excluded themselves from any benefit from the gifted
assets. Also, a gift would trigger a capital gains tax charge where tax
would have been payable on a sale. The idea of buying a house for Toby when
he went to university receded. However, gifts made by the survivor after the
first death would be free of tax after seven years.
Alternatively, their Wills could be drawn so that they took advantage of the
'nil rate band' of Pounds 150,000 on the first death as well, saving Pounds
60,000 in tax. This would involve each leaving the first Pounds 150,000 or a
lesser amount away from the survivor.
But this also had complications. Since the survivor would need the liquid
assets, the Pounds 150,000 would have to be found out of the house and the
'joint tenancy' under which the house was held would have to be turned into
a 'tenancy in common', otherwise the survivor would still inherit by
'operation of law', no matter what the Will might say.
This route seemed sensible, until Mr Knibb pointed out that, where children
share ownership of a house with a surviving parent, pressure might be
brought to sell, perhaps by sons- or daughters-in-law. On hearing this, both
John and Alison suppressed a small shudder at the thought of Lucy's charming
but unreliable boyfriend Tom having influence over the fate of either of
them.
Until now, Mr Knibb had been a man with a problem for every solution, but at
last he came up with an answer. They should each leave a 'discretionary
legacy' to the value of the unused nil-rate band. Their executors, the
survivor and one other, would have power, during the period of two years
after the first death, to decide how much should go to Toby and Lucy in the
light of circumstances at that time, and for tax purposes that would be
treated as if it were in the original Will. The balance would go to the
survivor, who would have to survive a 30-day period to cover the risk of
John and Alison being killed together. The survivor could also subsequently
make additional gifts to Lucy and Toby.
'I agree that it was helpful,' said Alison, as they arrived home, 'but we
haven't signed anything yet - it doesn't feel that we have actually achieved
anything.'
John reminded her that Mr Knibb was preparing a draft Will under which each
would leave a nil rate band discretionary legacy, with the balance of their
estates going to the survivor, conditional upon surviving 30 days, and in
default everything would go to Toby and Lucy equally at 25.
If no age was specified, apparently they would inherit at 18, which John and
Alison felt was far too soon. It merely remained for them to decide whether
to ask John's business partner, or perhaps Mr Knibb himself, to act as the
second executor.
This episode of the Plowshares was written with the assistance of Michael
Hayes, head of tax and financial planning at Macfarlanes.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Contracting
out? There are new rules, and still more to come - To encourage employees to
stay out of Serps, the government plans to switch from the present flat-rate
rebate to an age-related system / Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW TERMS for contracting out of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme
(Serps) came into effect earlier this month.
People who are contracted out, and also their employers, receive a rebate in
their National Insurance contributions, either in the form of a lower
contribution payment if the individual is a member of an occupational
final-salary scheme, or payment of an amount equal to the combined rebate
into an Appropriate Personal Pension (APP) or a Company Money Purchase
Pension (Comp) scheme.
Under the new terms, the combined rebate has been reduced from 5.8 per cent
to 4.8 per cent of a person's earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a
week (Pounds 2,912 and Pounds 21,840 a year).
In addition, an incentive payment of 1 per cent of this earnings band will
be made to everyone aged 30 or over who has contracted out of Serps through
an APP, but not to people who have contracted out through a Comp scheme. The
previous incentive payment of 2 per cent of earnings applied to both APPs
and Comps.
Employees who contracted out of Serps in 1988 or later, on what were then
very favourable terms, now need to consider whether to continue to contract
out under less favourable terms or to rejoin Serps.
Indeed, those with APPs should, by now, have been contacted either by the
intermediary who arranged the contract or by the life company which issued
the contract, acting on behalf of the intermediary, to remind them of the
position and, if required, to arrange a review.
Lautro and Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisations, have issued guidance
notes to their members on how to advise clients about contracting out. They
require their members (company representatives and independent financial
advisers respectively) first to review the situation of each member, and
then to take account of certain factors in addition to age and sex.
In 1988, under the old terms, it was relatively straightforward for
intermediaries to advise clients on contracting out. If they were below the
pivotal age (then, around 47 for men and 42 for women) it was financially
advantageous to contract out; otherwise it was preferable to remain in
Serps.
Under the new terms, it is not so simple. Factors listed by Lautro and
Fimbra include:
Earnings. It is not generally advisable to contract out employees on low
earnings.
Career Prospects. Employees with good prospects may be better off out of
Serps, while those with limited prospects should stay in.
Existing pension provision, or opportunities for a company pension. Use
these facilities.
Employee's tax position. The basic tax credit on the employee's rebate is
invested in the personal pension, while higher-rate tax can be reclaimed.
There is no tax credit or relief on NI contributions paid by the employee.
Loss of rights to Serps benefits. Serps provides a guaranteed pension in
terms of an employee's earnings, plus spouse's benefits. There are no such
guarantees with a personal pension.
However, the most important factor is the proposed change from the present
flat-rate rebate to an age-related system. Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior
pensions minister, has confirmed that this will happen in 1996, and a White
Paper is imminent.
The NI rebate for a particular year represents the cost of providing, on a
personal accumulation basis, the Serps benefit for an employee for that year
on certain earnings growth, investment and annuity assumptions. Since the
Serps benefit is fixed in terms of the employee's earnings for the year, the
cost of providing that benefit increases as the employee nears state pension
age.
Thus the rebates on an age-related system start at a low rate for young
employees and increase steadily with their age. The table shows the age-
(and sex-) related rebate scale published by the Government Actuary that
would currently apply - though the new system will be based solely on the
period to state pension age, with no separate scales for men and women.
Until now, the rebate has been an average figure based on all employees. As
such, younger employees qualified for a higher rebate than was required to
provide the Serps benefit, while older employees received less - hence, it
was financially favourable for younger employees to contract out of Serps
and for older employees to rejoin or stay in.
If the assumptions used in obtaining an age-related rebate are financially
neutral, then it should be immaterial whether an employee, of whatever age,
stays in or opts out of Serps.
If employees consider that the life company can achieve a higher investment
return than assumed in the rebate calculations, they will be better off
contracting out. On the other hand, if they prefer their pension to be
guaranteed, they would be better off in Serps.
It is difficult to see how intermediaries can give best advice to clients
this year on contracting out without taking 1996 into account. Best advice
now may not be best advice then.
It would certainly not be in the client's interest, having contracted out in
1988, to go back into Serps in 1993 only to come out again in 1996 - if only
because of the charges incurred each time.
It would appear that the way out of this impasse is for intermediaries to
explain the overall situation; then, for clients, if they prefer personal
pensions to Serps, for whatever reason, to remain contracted out.
Indeed, Miss Widdecombe is quite frank about the reason for switching to an
age-related rebate system - to keep employees contracted out.
However, from 1996 onwards it could well be that intermediaries will
concentrate on older employees, with a higher rebate applied to higher
earnings, and ignore younger employees where the rebate will be small - a
reversal of the present situation.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): A tax blow to
equity investors - Change in ACT is likely to boost bonds / The Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR's alteration to advance corporation tax (ACT) and the
taxation of dividends was one of the more significant, and more complex,
measures in the Budget.
Private investors who are higher-rate taxpayers may suffer particularly. But
the details of the change are difficult to grasp.
The key factor to understand is that companies do not pay gross dividends at
all. They pay shareholders a net dividend and send a sum to the Inland
Revenue, which is regarded as meeting the tax liability of investors. This
sum is an advance payment against the company's corporation tax liability -
hence the name 'advance corporation tax'.
The Budget change reduces the amount that companies must pay in advance.
This helps their cash flow, although they still have to pay the same
corporation tax bill in the end.
But what the chancellor is giving with one hand, he is more than taking away
with the other. Non-taxpayers are entitled to reclaim the tax paid by the
company, and this tax credit was previously set at 25 per cent. The budget
reduced the credit to 20 per cent.
The effect can be seen in the table. Assume a net dividend of 7.5p. Under
the old system, this would be grossed up to 10p for tax purposes.
Non-taxpayers would thus be able to reclaim 2.5p in tax.
Under the new system the dividend is only grossed up to 9.375p (since
9.375p, minus 20 per cent, is 7.5p). The effect is to reduce the tax credit
to 1.875p and to cut the non-taxpayer's dividend income by 6.25 per cent.
For the vast majority of basic-rate taxpayers, the effect will be neutral,
since basic rate tax on dividend income has been cut to 20 per cent. They
will still receive the net dividend of 7.5p.
Higher-rate taxpayers will face an extra tax charge (the difference between
20 per cent and 40 per cent). The effect will be to reduce their net
dividends by 6.25 per cent.
Holders of personal equity plans (Peps) will also suffer. They count as
non-taxpayers, so will incur a cut of 6.25 per cent in dividend income. The
effect is most marked on basic-rate taxpayers, because the change affects
them inside a Pep but not outside. This may make some of those Peps with
additional charges unattractive.
Higher-rate taxpayers are 6.25 per cent worse off, both inside and outside a
Pep. So the tax advantage of a Pep remains the same; but, since the overall
dividend return of a Pep has fallen, the attractions of a Pep, relative to
non-equity investments, is reduced.
Since, for most Pep investors, it is the income tax saving which represents
the prime benefit, this change is important.
Debate in the City has concentrated on whether equities have become less
attractive overall. Pension funds, which are non-taxpayers, would certainly
appear to suffer. But some companies may be able to increase their net
dividends in order to leave their investors no worse off. Other measures
which the chancellor has taken on ACT will benefit those companies with high
overseas earnings.
But overall the measure seems to boost bonds at the expense of equities;
and, within the field of equities, to favour capital gain at the expense of
income.
The BES: investors will still be allowed to borrow
Non-recourse loans, which allowed BES investors to make a safe exit from
their investment after only six months, were stamped out. Mr Lamont twisted
the knife by making the measure retrospective to the midnight before the
Budget.
The new legislation disallows tax relief on any BES shares issued after the
deadline if loans are secured against them. Note that this does not affect
loans secured on any BES shares issued before the deadline.
Tax relief will also be allowed to investors who hold on to shares in a BES
company which originally offered a loan facility, if they maintain their
investment for the full five years. It is the exercise, rather than the
offer, of the loan which is disallowed.
After the Budget, the Inland Revenue clarified this ruling slightly. The
prohibition on loans will not apply when the lender has recourse against a
broad range of the borrower's assets and not just the BES shares. However,
BES shares must not be specified as 'all or part of the security', according
to the Revenue. This should allow those who have a sudden change for the
worse in their financial circumstances to borrow.
Investors will still be allowed to borrow to fund a BES investment. The
Revenue simply intends to prohibit loans which are tied by the lender to the
offer of BES shares.
Once the full statutes are available, it is a fair bet that BES sponsors
will look for a new way around the rules, and allow investors to exit from
their investment early. In the meantime, the BES returns to its old ground
rules. The scheme will now run until the end of 1993, and any investments
taken out will have to be maintained for at least five years if they are to
receive tax relief.
Income tax: value of marriage allowance to fall
The lower rate tax band of 20 per cent introduced by the Chancellor last
year has been extended from the first Pounds 2,000 of income to Pounds
2,500, increasing taxpayers' income by Pounds 25 for the 1993-94 tax year.
It will be extended to Pounds 3,000 next tax year.
However, Lamont chose not to implement the traditional measure of increasing
personal allowances in line with inflation. The Pounds 150,000 threshold for
inheritance tax and Pounds 5,800 for capital gains tax also remained
unchanged. The married couple's allowance was also frozen and from April
1994, the extent of its relief will be curtailed. Tax relief will be
restricted to 20 per cent instead of at the taxpayer's marginal rate.
This means that the maximum value of the allowance will be reduced to Pounds
344 instead of the previous Pounds 430 to a basic-rate taxpayer and Pounds
688 for someone in the higher-rate band. Married people aged 65 and above
will see their allowance increased by Pounds 200 in 1994-95, to compensate
for most of the loss.
Stamp-duty: a sweetener for first-time buyers
The announcement that mortgage interest tax relief would be reduced was
sweetened by the immediate doubling of the threshold for stamp duty from
Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000.
The stamp duty measure is intended to help first-time buyers and those at
the bottom end of the housing market. Someone who buys a house for Pounds
60,000 or less will therefore save Pounds 600. However, from April 1994, the
rate at which Miras will be given will be restricted to 20 per cent instead
of 25 per cent. At mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent, the maximum loss will be
just under Pounds 120 a year.
National Savings: holdings limits on certificates raised
The First Option Bond was reintroduced, to further the Chancellor's
intention that National Savings should make an 'important contribution' to
government funding. The new rate of 4.75 per cent net on a Pounds 1,000
minimum is competitive but not yet high enough to cause panic among the
building societies. The limit for index-linked National Savings certificates
was doubled to Pounds 10,000, and holding limits for most other National
Savings products were also raised.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Ten things to
do if it happens to you - The blow of losing a job is harsh, but steps can
be taken to protect your financial position. For instance, even executives
and professionals should not omit to sign on for state benefits / Redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO a quarter of the UK workforce has experienced unemployment since it
began to rise in early 1990, and half of the unemployed are homeowners.
These were among the findings of an FT analysis of government data,
published earlier this year.
Increasingly, those who lose their jobs are middle-class professionals and
executives. But many have found redundancy a mixed blessing, allowing them
to embark on new careers. The blow of redundancy is harsh, but financially
it may be one of the better ways of leaving work. Steps can be taken to
soften its impact, and to protect your financial position during what can be
a traumatic period.
There are a number of essential areas to address. Here are ten of them:
1. Your employment contract
Check the terms and conditions of your contract of employment, so that you
can be sure that your minimum pay-off terms agree with the contract. Look
for points to exploit as a negotiating tool with your employer. If your
contract does not mention outplacement services, see if your employer will
agree to pay for them, or at least for financial counselling.
Statutory redundancy pay is the legal minimum payment for employees who have
been made redundant. You must have been in in full-time work for two years
or part-time work for five years to qualify. The payment is calculated on
the length of service with the company and the salary received at the time
based on a maximum weekly wage.
Many professionals or executives will receive considerably more than the
statutory minimum, because their employer will give them a golden handshake.
2. Tax measures
Redundancy payments are tax-free up to a limit of Pounds 30,000, provided
your conditions of service do not say that you are entitled to them. Your
employer has to deduct tax under the pay-as-you-earn system on amounts above
this before paying it to you.
For this reason, it is tax-efficient to pay the excess into your company
pension scheme, subject to the allowable limit. Your employer has to do this
before you leave, so you should ask him whether this is possible when you
are informed that you are being made redundant.
If you are a higher-rate taxpayer and are being made redundant near the end
of the tax year, Peter Smith, of financial advisers Hill Martin, suggests
asking your employer to make your termination date fall into the next tax
year. Since your income is likely to be lower the following year, the excess
on Pounds 30,000 would be taxed at the lower rate.
Those who have worked overseas for their employer may be eligible for extra
tax exemption, and should seek advice about this.
If your employer asks you not to turn up for work during your notice period
and pays you instead, this payment is tax-free subject to the Pounds 30,000
maximum, as long as your contract does not state that payment in lieu of
notice is an alternative to serving the notice period. However, pay for
holiday owed is taxable.
Sometimes, an employer may want the employee to stay on to help with winding
up their area of work. The employer may offer a retention payment in
addition to any redundancy compensation. Although this will usually be taxed
as ordinary earnings, accountants Ernst &amp; Young say that, in some cases, the
redundancy package may be structured in such a way that the payment falls
within it.
3. State benefits
Sign on for unemployment benefit immediately after leaving, to ensure that
National Insurance contributions are automatically credited to you. Claims
cannot be backdated.
You may also be entitled to income support, or to sickness benefit instead
of unemployment benefit. This is a complicated area, and you should contact
the Department of Social Security, or a financial adviser, to make sure you
are obtaining your full entitlements.
4. Draw up a budget
This should be based on a period of at least six months, and include all
financial commitments such as mortgage payments, insurance premiums and
living expenses. The cash flow is good discipline, but will also be needed
if you have to ask your bank manager for a loan or creditors to reschedule
debts.
5. Contact your creditors
Inform your bank manager, mortgage lender and any other creditors of your
changed financial circumstances. Be wary of their financial advice, because
it will most likely be given by agents tied to a single insurance company.
If you envisage difficulties meeting your mortgage payments, tell your
lender. The number of repossessions fell last year from their 1991 peak,
mainly because of a policy of 'forbearance' by lenders. The problem may be
eased in the case of a repayment mortgage by lengthening the term of the
mortgage or temporarily suspending capital repayments. Remember that
interest payments will mount up.
There is less flexibility with an endowment mortgage, and your lender may
suggest conversion to a repayment mortgage. Resist surrendering an endowment
policy, particularly in its early years, because you may get back less than
the premiums paid on it. If you have no choice, find out what the surrender
value would be and see if you can get a better deal at auction or by selling
it to a marketmaker. Another alternative is to make the policy 'paid up' by
paying no more and waiting for the amount invested to mature.
6. Reduce debts
Credit card bills are a needlessly expensive way of borrowing, especially if
you have been given a lump sum and can afford to pay off these bills. The
same applies to overdrafts. If you have a sizeable pay-off, consider
reducing the size of your mortgage.
7. Insurance
If life and medical insurance were provided by your company, you will need
new cover. Before you leave, ask whether you can retain membership of the
company's medical scheme. Some employers are also prepared to pay life
assurance for up to six months after redundancy.
8. Pensions
If you have a company scheme, the broad alternatives are to leave it with
your former employer or to transfer to a personal pension. If you expect to
be in employment again soon, another option is to transfer from your old
scheme to the new company.
These are important decisions which should not be made in haste. Begin by
asking your employer what the transfer value of the pension would be, and
check what the benefits are for leaving the pension with the company as a
'frozen' or 'deferred' pension, because some schemes are more generous than
others. If you have less than five years of service with the employer, you
may find that you cannot leave the pension with the company. Take
independent financial advice in this complicated area.
9. Investing the pay-off
Do not be hurried into any quick decisions about investments. Put your
redundancy pay in a high-interest instant access building society account
until you have a clearer idea of your future plans. It is not a good idea to
tie up such money for a long period in case you suddenly need it.
10. Seek financial advice
It is easy to think that you may not need financial help, but if you have
been given a lump sum and do not know what your long-term plans are,
financial planning, preferably with the help of a fee-based adviser, is
essential. If the amount paid to you is sizeable, you may want to invest it
to produce income or you may be able to afford to pay off your mortgage. The
decision will depend on your other sources of income and your tax status.
Names and addresses of fee-based advisers can be obtained from Money
Management magazine or from the Institute of Financial Planning, which both
keep registers of fee-based advisers.

to take advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW MUCH might you expect to pay for fee-based financial advice?
The Institute of Financial Planning says that the average charge per hour is
Pounds 80, but 30 per cent of fee-based advisers charge less than Pounds 70
an hour. In total, 66 per cent of fee-based advisers charge no more than
Pounds 100 an hour. Only 2.8 per cent charge more than Pounds 100 an hour.
VAT is payable on fees.
Usually, the first meeting will be free with both parties 'getting to know'
each other. If you decide to take your finances to the adviser, hourly
charges will come in, so it is important to ask how many hours work your
affairs are likely to take.
If you are leaving a portfolio in the hands of the adviser, you can expect
to be charged 1 per cent of the investment annually. Paying Pounds 2,000 on
a Pounds 200,000 investment may sound high but it gives the adviser an
incentive to make the investment grow.
Sometimes fee-charging advisers rebate commission to the client, when it
cannot be reinvested. Tax can be a problem, because commission is paid as an
income to the adviser who then has to pay income tax on it. The income tax
liability is then passed to the consumer.
Each adviser will have their own remuneration system, so ask them how they
structure their charges and the amount you might expect to pay before the
first meeting. Make sure that you do not end up paying fees and commission -
that is the worst of both worlds.

FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Savings
deposits feel the draught - UK interest rates have slipped so far that
higher-rate taxpayers are not keeping up with underlying inflation / Keynote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT FOR the first time, the stock market hare thought it a good idea in the
first three months of the year to allow the tortoise-like British economy to
catch up. Fortunately, investors found that the economy had not entirely
quit the race, and was plodding slowly forwards.
In the circumstances of emergence from recession, the UK equity market
action centred on lower grade recovery stocks, and the premium on quality
began to crumble. It became a 'buy Asda, sell Sainsbury' sort of quarter.
Entering the year on a high point, the markets looked to lower interest
rates and economic revival for sustenance, but were always fearful of a
torrent of indigestible new issues from both the public and private sectors.
There was the lurking threat of chancellor Norman Lamont, busily plotting a
package of high borrowings and rising taxation for his March Budget.
In the event, the pluses and minuses largely cancelled out. There was a
one-point cut in base rates to 6 per cent on January 26, and although the
move was clumsily handled, and upset the sterling exchange rate, share
prices went ahead.
The FT-SE Index of the 100 top shares, having ended 1992 at 2846.5, hit a
new all-time peak of 2873.8 on February 3, and after a pause for breath went
on to a further high of 2957.3 on March 8. But the Footsie failed to mount a
serious assault on the 3,000 level and relapsed over the remainder of March,
to finish within about 1 per cent of where it had begun, at 2878.7.
That was by no means a complete picture of the UK stock market, however. The
new indices of middle-sized and small capitalisation companies showed that,
while some of the leaders might have been struggling, there was ample
strength elsewhere. The FT-SE Mid 250 rose 9 per cent during the three-month
period, while the FT-SE SmallCap put on more like 13 per cent. During the
first quarter of the year it paid to think small.
Moreover it paid to think recovery. Among the 100 Footsie constituents,
battered companies like British Steel, Asda and British Petroleum led the
way. The biggest losers included Glaxo, Wellcome and, yes, Sainsbury. Over
the long term, Sainsbury shareholders have nothing at all to complain about,
but they may reflect that, had they switched to Asda at the turn of the
year, they would have been nearly 50 per cent better off by the end of
March. You don't get many better special offers than that.
Behind the ups and downs of the equity market lay similar movements in
government securities. The yield on long-term gilt-edged bonds began the
year at 8 3/4 per cent, trended strongly downwards to 8 1/4 per cent by
early March, then jumped back up to 8 1/2 per cent. The problem here was the
Budget on March 16, unveiling a borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn for the
1993-94 financial year.
The Budget had another nasty element, this time a rather slow-burning one.
Norman Lamont introduced an obscure change in the rules on advance
corporation tax, which was cut from 25 to 20 per cent. This, he said, would
help companies. But, through a parallel reduction in the tax credit on
dividends, it also had the effect of clobbering tax-exempt investors,
ranging from giant pension funds to modest holders of personal equity plans.
Their gross income from UK dividends will fall by 6 1/4 per cent. Investors
scratched their heads over the implications, and the stock market finished
the quarter in a subdued mood.
In theory, the budget deficit is there to stimulate growth in the economy -
that is why Norman Lamont deferred his main tax increases until 1994-95 and
beyond. But if there is a miscalculation here the public sector could begin
to 'crowd out' the requirements of companies and individuals.
Could overseas stock markets offer better pickings in these conditions?
Certainly the pound sterling version of the FT-Actuaries World Index
outpaced the Footsie in the first quarter, putting on 9 per cent.
The surprise national winner with a 19 per cent gain was Japan,
unfortunately a market which British investors have largely been frightened
out of. Elsewhere Hong Kong continued to perform for those with strong
enough nerves to accept the risks of Chinese politics. But Wall Street, up 4
per cent, once again proved disappointingly sluggish.
Back home, the pressures from the budget deficit are also becoming obvious
in the savings deposit market, where interest rates on premium accounts have
slipped to around 4 per cent after standard-rate tax. In fact, at these
levels higher-rate taxpayers are no longer keeping up with underlying
inflation, which steadied at just under 3 1/2 per cent during the quarter
(although the headline rate, which is temporarily reduced by falls in
mortgage rates, dropped to a 26-year low of 1.7 per cent for January).
Building societies have been bristling over the renewed competition from
National Savings, where the chancellor unveiled a freshened-up range of
products after last month's Budget. They included the controversial First
Option Bond, which had been introduced and then withdrawn last year when it
proved uncomfortably hot for the building societies to compete against.
After a couple of dismal years, the building societies are sniffing a decent
upturn in their mortgage business. There may not be a significant
improvement in house prices - although they rose by nearly 1 per cent
between December and March, according to the Nationwide Index - but the
volume of house transactions could easily rise sharply, having collapsed
from 2.15m in 1988 to 1.14m last year.
If so, the building societies are going to need more funds, and they may
have to pay higher rates to savers to get them, perhaps negating, as far as
borrowers are concerned, any further fall in short-term money market rates.
But in the housing market, as elsewhere, the shadow of the recession is
gradually lifting. Industrial production and retail sales have begun to pick
up. Company order books are filling up again. For investors there have been
opportunities, but caution has been unrewarded, rather it has actually paid
you to be a little bit off your trolley.

FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Amber Day stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philip Green signalled the end of his association with Amber Day, the
former chairman and chief executive selling the bulk of his 8.1 per cent
stake to what is believed to be a single institutional investor.
The 9.25m shares, representing 7.6 per cent of the issued ordinary capital,
went through as an agency cross at 83.5p. Amber Day moved ahead 6 to 85p in
total turnover of 19m.
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings rose 25 to 1307p
after two securities houses recommended buying the stock following recent
weakness.
NatWest Securities moved the stock on to the buy list from a previous 'long
term outperform' stance, arguing that the shares had underperformed by 14
per cent so far this year. Also, Smith New Court analyst Mr Richard Dale
reiterated his buy recommendation.
Dollar weakness and continuing concern over the price of tobacco in the US
following the announcement by Philip Morris on Wednesday that first-quarter
cigarette volume was down by 1.1 per cent from a year ago hit BAT
Industries, which slid a further 11 to 869p.
RTZ shares bounced following recent weakness as copper prices recovered
slightly from a 5 1/2 -year low earlier this week. The stock moved forward
19 to 650p on healthy turnover of 4.2m shares.
Royal Bank of Scotland strengthened in heavy turnover after an agency cross
and positive comments from one broker ahead of half-year results scheduled
for May 5. Panmure Gordon forecasts profits of at least Pounds 58m.
Also, there was impetus from an agency cross of 2.5m shares, traded at 269p
a share, a premium to the market price. The underlying shares closed 8
higher at 270p on trading volume of 12m.
Royal Insurance added 11 at 329p as the chairman said that first-quarter
results would show an improvement over the same period in 1992.
Insurance broker CE Heath fell 12 to 313p after announcing that it is to sue
two rival brokers over insurance losses incurred by its Australian
underwriting subsidiary. Heath announced that the losses will badly affect
profits when the group reports full year results next month.
Interim results from Albert Fisher came in at the top end of market
expectations, although an initial surge in the shares was clouded by a
downbeat statement from the group's chairman.
Mr Stephen Walls said margins continued under pressure and the economic
recovery made no impact on the group's business. Most analysts left full
year forecasts unchanged. The shares slipped 2 to 69p in turnover of 1m.
Other food manufacturers stocks were muted, although some that had been
under pressure took the opportunity to catch up. Cadbury-Schweppes, which
had been worried by talk of an imminent cash call, rose 9 to 482p and Booker
gained the same to 380p. Associated British Foods shrugged off earlier
comment over its results to climb 3 to 484p.
Disappointing results from William Low hit the shares, off 17 at 209p.
Board changes at Alexon, one of the sector's favourite bid targets, lifted
the stock 6 to 89p.
News that Austin Reed, the upmarket clothes retailer, proposed transforming
'A' ordinary non-voting shares into voting shares, in a move to broaden its
shareholder base, sent both sets of shares surging. The ordinary stock ended
47 ahead at 235p and the 'A' 25 up at 132p.
Continued recovery talk helped stores. WH Smith 'A' rose 15 to 450p,
Storehouse 3 to 205p, Ratners 1 1/2 to 18 1/4 p, Lloyds Chemists 11 to 310p
and Dixons 6 to 218p.
Pharmaceuticals stocks were weaker as sellers appeared in the US. Glaxo's
rise slowed to a gain of only 3 at 602p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' shed 4 to
464p and Wellcome, which had been helped 11 higher by a Panmure Gordon buy
note and heavy overnight activity from one US brokerage, failed to get
sufficient support in London and closed 4 off at 760p.
Construction shares were in demand again as the recovery story continued to
inspire investors. South-east housebuilder Berkeley Group firmed 7 to 420p,
AMEC 6 to 93p, Tilbury Douglas 10 to 508p and Wilson Bowden 16 to 450p.
Building materials group Tarmac was up just a half-penny at 141 1/2 p after
Goldman Sachs was said to have downgraded its profits forecast. The US-owned
broker was also believed to have upgraded its forecast in BPB Industries,
ahead 4 at 229p.
In a firm drinks sector, Grand Metropolitan added 9 at 429p and Bass slipped
5 to 554p as Kleinwort Benson advised a switch, the broker fretting about
domestic price competition.
Turnover in aero engine maker Rolls-Royce rose to 10m and the shares gained
6 1/2 at 132 1/2 p as two brokers recommended the stock. UBS issued a buy
circular and Henderson Crosthwaite said an increase in passenger traffic
would lead to a rise in spares sales in the key summer months.
Henderson also favours British Aerospace, whose shares broke through the
300p barrier for the first time in several weeks to end 11 stronger at 309p,
their highest this year.
Demand continued for Smiths Industries, which reported figures on Wednesday
and the shares put on another 6 to 353p. In a buoyant metals sector, British
Steel finished the session 2 1/2 better at 93 3/4 p with volume reaching
16m.
The release of UK car production figures showing a 19-year high boosted
several component manufacturers. These included GKN, 5 up at 462p, and Lucas
Industries, still attracting bid talk and which added 2 1/2 at 137p.
Textile group Yorklyde jumped 25 to 408p as it revealed raised full year
profits of Pounds 2.2m and an improved dividend along with an upbeat
statement.
The oil majors were weak on worries ahead of first-quarter figures in early
May.
Active trade in US airline stocks that followed better than expected results
from American Airlines boosted dealing in British Airways, which firmed 5 to
289p in volume of 2.2m.

<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in ICI shares continued yesterday as the stock was marked higher in
early trading following an overnight gain in the US. The stock was the best
performer in percentage terms among the top 100 FT-SE Index companies,
climbing 52 to 1288p on unusually heavy turnover of 7.7m. The shares were
helped by news from ICI's bioscience arm Zeneca that first-quarter results
were better than a year ago.
Transatlantic dealers in London said a recent recommendation from US
brokerage PaineWebber was still driving the shares, and another US house,
Morgan Stanley, had joined Goldman Sachs and PaineWebber on the bid.
However, they added that sellers were beginning to appear in London as the
stock hit the 1280p level.

FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas rises on MMC optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MEETING with the official gas regulator caught the imagination of several
oil analysts yesterday and led to a sharp rise in British Gas shares.
Several analysts decided that Sir James Mackinnon, the Ofgas regulator, was
taking a more conciliatory view on the company's place within the industry.
Nevertheless, Mr Nick Antill of company broker Hoare Govett said that how
ever placatory Sir James might have appeared, future rulings were now out of
his hands and under the auspices of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
That more cautious attitude to the meeting prompted profit-taking at the
upper levels, and after being 9 higher at one stage the shares were taken
back to close 7 1/2 up at 311p on heavy turnover of 13m.
There were also suggestions that agency broker James Capel had issued a buy
recommendation on Gas. The house denied the rumour but said that it was
bullish on the meeting.

FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buying lifts equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is gathering momentum,
a reduction in German interest rates and a sharp upward move by Wall Street
combined to drive London share prices higher yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished 11.5 up at 2,881.1, extending its rise over the
past four days to 56.7. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has tended to lag
behind the 100 index in recent weeks, outperformed the senior index, posting
a gain of 19.8 at 3,135.7.
The trading session was enlivened by reports of further heavy overseas
buying interest, mainly reflecting switching operations out of other
European markets and into the London market.
Turnover in UK equities expanded rapidly during a hectic session which saw
more than 703m shares traded, well ahead of recent levels which have been
exaggerated by a number of exceptionally large placings and bought deals.
Activity was boosted by at least four programme trades, two of which were
said to have been substantial in size. All the trades were described as
evenly balanced on the buy and sell side. Consumer stocks, notably the food
retailers, were heavily represented in one of the trading programmes.
Share prices began the session in subdued fashion ahead of the March
unemployment figures and average earnings numbers for February, expected
mid-morning, and news from the Bundesbank meeting, expected shortly after
lunch. The Footsie 100 opened around three points higher at 2,872.8 and made
heavy weather of moving up to 2,874.3 immediately following the economic
data. The 26,000 fall in umemployment during March, the second successive
decline, against expectations of a rise of around 35,000, and a marked
slowing in the increase in UK average earnings were accompanied by good news
on housing sales and car production.
Then, news that the Bundesbank had cut its discount rate by a quarter of a
percentage point and its Lombard rate by half a point came as a pleasant
surprise to the market.
The combination of encouraging pointers and a strong opening performance by
Wall Street saw the Footsie 100 reach the day's peak of 2,881.2 before
easing off and staging another good run just before the close.
Some traders cautioned that the market was running out of steam above the
2,880 level, citing the argument that there will be a number of big calls on
institutional cash in the next few months, notably BT III. Other
marketmakers, however, remain convinced that there is still considerable
upside in the equity market, with the possible added bonus of takeover
activity.
Mr Richard Jeffreys, economist at stockbroker Charterhouse Tilney, said:
'The impact of earnings growth will drive the market sharply better later
this year.' Mr Ian Harnett, at SGST, commented: 'The momentum is with the
market at the moment, it looks like onwards and upwards in the short term.'
Oil shares were among the market's poorest performers, reacting to renewed
selling on Wall Street overnight. But British Gas gained ground in high
volume after Sir James Mackinnon, the gas industry regulator, addressed the
London Oil Analysts Group in London on Wednesday evening.
CE Heath, the insurance broker, came under fire after the profits warning.

FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BETTER than forecast unemployment figures, together with the unexpected
reduction in German interest rates, boosted trading activity in the
derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
It was a subdued opening in the futures as the June contract on the FT-SE
100 Index started trading at 2,892. Dealing remained uneventful until the
11.30am release of the pleasing unemployment figures. This sent June
advancing to the day's high of 2,900, the first time the contract has traded
at that level in several sessions.
However, this proved a resistance point and the contract came off the top on
profit-taking and a feeling that a cut in German rates was unlikely.
June drifted to the day's low of 2,877 over the lunchtime period. The
announcement of a German rate reduction from the Bundesbank took dealers by
surprise and led to renewed buying of the contract.
It ended at 2,893, up 5 from the previous close and 6 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash of around 7. Volume came to 9,539 lots.
The traded options were also busy and saw total turnover of 31,052
contracts. Business in the FT-SE 100 option amounted to 6,298 lots, although
that in the Euro FT-SE option was more modest at 1,249.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with 5,158 contracts transacted,
followed by Land Securities with 2,010.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late selling reverses rise on
earnings news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER posting early gains amid a number of strong earnings reports, a burst
of late selling and heavy losses in transportation shares left US stock
markets lower on balance yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,429.17,
well off its high for the day of 3,471.05. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 lost 4.17 at 439.46 and the Nasdaq composite ended 0.53 easier at
663.51. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to a hefty 310.4m shares.
Trading opened against a background of conflicting factors, including the
cut in German interest rates, news of a rise in US weekly jobless claims,
and falling bond prices. The German rate cut had little impact on market
sentiment, primarily because the Bundesbank's move failed to give the dollar
a lasting boost.
The news of a 26,000 rise in weekly jobless claims was worrying, but
investors shrugged it off, and shares rose steadily for most of the day.
Soon after 2pm, however, prices turned around, and fell into negative
territory just before the close. Throughout the day, attention was primarily
focused on corporate earnings.
The day's main feature was Caterpillar, which jumped Dollars 5 3/8 to
Dollars 67 5/8 in busy trading after the company bounced back from a big
loss in the first quarter last year to post a net profit of Dollars 34m in
the wake of stronger demand in the US market and improved margins. The
earnings were better than analysts had expected, and prompted several
brokerage houses to upgrade their ratings and raise their earnings estimates
for the company.
Among other stocks to advance on news of improved earnings were Dow
Chemical, which climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 in volume of 2m shares
after the company reported net income of Dollars 1.47 a share, up from 65
cents a share a year earlier.
Airline issues relinquished part of Wednesday's big gains as some investors
took the opportunity to book some quick profits. USAir retreated Dollars 2
to Dollars 22 1/4 , AMR Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/8 , UAL Dollars 2 7/8
to Dollars 146 7/8 and Delta Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 . Delta
announced a net loss of Dollars 134m in the third fiscal quarter after
taking an Dollars 82.5m restructuring charge.
Also in the transportation sector, Consolidated Rail dropped Dollars 5 1/2
to Dollars 51 3/4 after reporting higher than expected quarterly worker
injury costs.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications moved forward Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 49 on news of better earnings.
Canada
THE TORONTO market was directionless again yesterday but in further active
trading. The TSE 300 Index gained 2.1 at 3,665.7 and advances held a modest
lead over declines by 381 to 316. Volume rose to 77m shares (valued at
CDollars 650.8m) from Wednesday's 72.6m.
Among the sub-indices, seven were lower and seven were higher. The gold
shares sector recorded the day's biggest change, up 2.07 per cent, while the
energy group put on 1.24 per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba's move takes bourses by
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's cut in the discount and Lombard rates took markets by
surprise and there was a consensus among analysts that Germany might now
move a little more quickly in lowering interest rates, writes Our Markets
Staff.
The feeling that the German economy is in an even worse state than observers
had believed gives added strength to this view and some analysts are looking
for a substantial cut in the repo next week.
FRANKFURT edged down during the session but there were strong gains in the
post bourse after the rate cut was announced. The DAX index closed down 0.13
to 1,666.74 in turnover of DM5.9bn.
In post bourse trading, banks gained on hopes that lower interest rates
would help profit margins. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok at James Capel said that
insurance companies, which held large bund portfolios were also
beneficiaries of the rate cut.
However, some analysts doubt that the equity rally will last, as monetary
easing itself indicated that the central bank remained pessimistic over the
economy. Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said that while the cut spurred
activity by dealers in after market trading, genuine investors remained
inactive.
Volkswagen rose DM10 to DM331, after a presentation in London on Wednesday,
while Daimler-Benz advanced DM8 to DM575 and BMW gained DM2.5 to DM480.
PARIS regained some of the week's losses although activity was reported to
have been unenthusiastic ahead of today's end of the account. The CAC-40
index rose 12.50 to 1,944.46, but off the day's high of 1,955.10, in
turnover of FFr3.6bn.
There is a view in some quarters that with many institutions already heavily
overweight in France there is unlikely to be a rush to buy at present.
Investors are also waiting for the privatisation programme to get underway.
Peugeot strengthened FFr5 to FFr542 after its 1992 results came much in line
with expectations and hopes of a better performance in 1993. Suez dipped
FFr7.70 to FFr303.80 after a negative analysts meeting on Wednesday while
Lafarge slipped FFr11 or 3 per cent to FFr338.90 as investors reacted to its
terms for taking control of Asland of Spain.
MILAN decided that two days of slide was enough and prices picked up as
efforts continued to decide on the future shape of the Italian political
scene. The Comit index rose 10.03 or 1.9 per cent to 528.20.
The Bank of Italy's move to cut its discount and Lombard rates came after
the market had closed. The decision surprised analysts who had not expected
any movement in Italian rates until after the formation of a new government.
The bourse was led higher by Fiat which fixed L350 or 5.4 per cent higher at
L6,760 before easing to L6,745 after hours. The rise followed continued
speculation that the carmaker planned a strategic accord with Renault and
several buy recommendations.
Companies in the Ligresti group also put in a strong showing. Premafin, the
holding company, rose L390 or 8.2 per cent to fix at L5,140 and rose L5,300
after-hours while Grassetto, the construction group, rose L310 or 5.6 per
cent to L5,810. Analysts suggested that the rises were the result of the
continuing restructuring of the group.
ZURICH had a mixed day and the SMI index finished little changed, down 0.8
at 2,177.3. Prices picked up briefly in the immediate aftermath of the
Bundesbank's announcement before easing back.
Sulzer was actively traded, falling another SFr14 to SFr750 after
Wednesday's press conference. Ascom continued to add to the previous day's
6.6 per cent rise, finishing SFr40 ahead at SFr1,490.
Adia, planning a capital reconstruction, rose SFr10 or 8.7 per cent, to
SFr124. Danzas rose SFr700 or 8.9 per cent to SFr8,500; the transport group
plans a share split and capital increase to make its shares more marketable.
AMSTERDAM came off its intraday high with a close in the CBS Tendency index
of 111.3, up 0.6. Some analysts commented that the market was beginning to
look a little tired after a startling first quarter. MADRID erased early
losses after the Bundesbank's move and the general share index gained 1.62
to 244.07. SCANDINAVIAN markets, with the exception of Norway, all rose.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo continues slide as
Singapore returns to peak
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE profit-taking, coupled with futures sales as a hedge against the yen's
extended advance against the dollar, pushed equity prices lower for a fifth
consecutive session in light volume, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 181.70 down at 19,591.31, after an intraday low of
19,557.78 and a high of 20,116.86. The broader Topix index of all first
section stocks lost 9.53 to 1,523.03, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 2.00 to 1,202.15.
Volume was estimated at 380m shares, compared with Wednesday's 395m. Losers
outpaced advances by 721 to 318, with 133 issues unchanged.
Foreign exchange considerations again dominated equity trading in Tokyo.
Market participants sold and bought shares in tandem with the rise and fall
of the yen, which finally settled at Y110.20 to the dollar. While
uncertainties about the stability of the yen remain, investors are expected
to continue to take profits.
Chart analysts predict that the Nikkei will test its 25-day moving average
of 19,493.44 in the short term. Below this level, however, buy orders from
government-managed public funds are likely to serve as a support for share
prices.
Mr Shigeru Akiba, director of yen equity trading at UBS Securities, said
afternoon sales of futures contracts triggered arbitrage-related selling
that pressured the cash market.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the Tokyo market, receded
Y44,000 to Y893,000, the first time it has settled below Y900,000 since
March 31.
NTT-related shares also moved into negative territory. Fujikura, the
electric wire and cable manufacturer, dropped Y37 to Y911, while Mitsubishi
Cable declined Y24 to Y686.
Profit-taking pushed the high-technology sector lower. NEC fell Y16 to Y921,
Mitsubishi Electric Y10 to Y548 and Hitachi Y7 to Y822. Motor-related shares
lost ground. Honda weakened Y80 to Y1,410, while Toyota shed Y10 to Y1,630.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 83.57 to end at 21,450.22 in volume of
27.9m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets turned in a mostly strong performance. Recent strength
in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur has been attributed to portfolio adjustment on
expectations that the Morgan Stanley Capital index, presently combining the
two markets, will be split at the beginning of next month, some analysts
said.
SINGAPORE returned to its record-setting ways as low interest rates
continued to boost liquidity. Buyers focused on laggard small-capital stocks
and warrants, and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.15 to 1,773.21.
KUALA LUMPUR ended its four-day rally with a dip in the composite index of
0.25 to 691.45.
TAIWAN surged ahead as the government was poised to tighten the Copyright
Law, in a move to avoid trade retaliation by the US, which had been
demanding stricter controls on protecting intellectual property rights.
The weighted index advanced 149.06, or 3.3 per cent, to 4,631.69. Turnover
fell to TDollars 14.7bn from TDollars 31.4bn.
SEOUL rewrote its 20-month high, the composite index rising 4.01 to 735.57
in volume of 61.3m shares. Electronics and other blue chip sectors led the
rise.
NEW ZEALAND closed near to an all-time peak, with the advance fuelled by
continuing strong interest in forestry shares.
The NZSE-40 index climbed 22.19, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,627.12 in strong
turnover of NZDollars 48m. The 1,627.31 historic high of the 2 1/2 -year old
index was set on February 16.
Foreign buying was again concentrated on forestry stocks, which are
benefiting from lumber price increases.
MANILA rose as investors tried to shake off fears caused by the government's
takeover of the board of directors of market leader PLDT. The composite
index moved ahead 7.94 to 1,540.70 as PLDT fell 15 pesos to 945 pesos.
AUSTRALIA was higher, with banks, especially Westpac, attracting interest.
The All Ordinaries index finished 11.5 up at 1,705.4.
HONG KONG eased on volatile futures-led activity, as Sino-British talks
opened in Beijing. The Hang Seng index ended 9.15 down at 6,759.24 in
turnover of HKDollars 6.3bn, against Wednesday's HKDollars 4.3bn.
While prices started higher on hopes of better relations between Beijing and
London, afternoon futures-led selling eroded the gains.
BOMBAY fell to a 15-month low, depressed by expectations of disappointing
company results. The BSE index shed 30.55 to 2,158.96.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Dublin enjoys thrills of the
roller-coaster - Falling interest rates and overseas demand are driving
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish stock market has had all the thrills of a ride on a funfair roller
coaster over the past six months, and all the unpredictability of Irish
weather.
The cries of alarm and dire predictions of deepening gloom in the autumn of
last year, as the market plunged to a four-year low, have since been
replaced by squeals of delight and forecasts of better to come as the ISEQ
overall index bottomed out and has since climbed rapidly to a three-year
high.
It has gained 30 per cent since the end of December, half of that in March
alone, and a remarkable 45 per cent since the four-year low last October,
making Dublin one of the world's best performing markets this year to date.
It eased 2.47 yesterday to 1,554.27.
The crucial turning point was the punt's devaluation at the end of January
and the steady fall in interest rates since then, which has brought a burst
of optimism flooding through analysts' forecasts.
Financial stocks such as Bank of Ireland and AIB have bounced back
particularly strongly, the sector advancing 38 per cent in the year to date;
while food shares such as Avonmore, Waterford, and Golden Vale have also
outperformed the market as a whole, as has the blue chip construction stock
CRH and a number of second line industrials.
The ERM crisis in the autumn of last year, which threw the Irish currency
into crisis and interest rates soaring, had been particularly depressing for
the financial stocks and for companies trading into the UK. But with that
cloud now lifted, recovery has been strong, with the potential for more to
come.
Mr John Horgan, head of research at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin, comments:
'The market is still 20 per cent below its all-time high and price-earnings
multiples are 13 for 1993, while they are 17 in the US and 15 in the UK.'
He says a promising economic outlook over the next two years, combined with
favourable technical factors, 'could mean that there is still some 15 to 20
per cent to go and could make this year an exceptionally good one for the
market'.
Two technical factors are particularly significant. From May 1, Irish stocks
will be included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, which
will serve to attract additional US funds into the market. Secondly, when
Dublin money market rates were very high in January, there were heavy
redemptions of unit-linked funds, making the Irish institutions forced
sellers.
That position has now been reversed, and Irish institutions will again be
net buyers of stock at the same time as there are few expectations of any of
the leading Irish stocks coming to the market with new issues in the months
ahead, keeping supply of paper tight, while demand remains firm.
A more cautious note is being sounded by Davy stockbrokers in Dublin. They
say much of the bull market of the past two months has been driven by
overseas buying, and those stocks which have attracted most interest 'no
longer look unduly cheap by international comparisons . . . we find it
difficult to see how the market as a whole can push significantly ahead from
these levels without inducing some overseas profit-taking'.
Further ahead, however, Davy is forecasting that interest rates will fall a
further 2 to 3 percentage points to around 6 per cent in 1994 and GNP growth
will recover to 4 per cent next year, 'which should be sufficient to allow
the market to make further and significant gains on a 12 to 18-month view'.
Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy, says: 'We remain strategic
bulls. There is a very benign picture of the economy emerging over the next
18 months.'
Mr David Kingston, chief executive of Irish Life, Ireland's largest fund
manager, is also bullish and says he is 'generally optimistic that interest
rates will continue to fall over the next two years'.
Under such a scenario, overall earnings growth in the Irish market is
forecast to be in the region of 20 per cent over the next two years, giving
a 1994 p/e forecast of around 11 which will continue to offer bargains for
those that like the thrill of Dublin's roller-coaster ride.

FT  23 APR 93 / Money Markets: A day of surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of lower int-erest rates across Europe increased sharply
yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised dealers by cutting its discount
rate by 25 basis points, writes James Blitz.
The cut in the discount rate to 7.25 per cent was hailed as having strong
implications for future Bundesbank policy, implying concern about the state
of the German economy.
Dealers started the European day believing Wednesday's figures for M3
monetary supply growth in Germany - which were far higher than the market
had expected - had made an easing in monetary policy unlikely.
One clue to the Bundes-bank's change of heart, however, was the dramatic
fall in German call money at the start of yesterday's trading. The overnight
rate of interest dropped from about 8.10 per cent to 7.80 per cent because
of the high liquidity in the market.
Unbeknown to dealers, Wednesday's injection of a net DM5.8bn of liquidity
may have been part of a Bundesbank strategy to ease officially posted rates:
the proximity of call money to the interest rate floor made a cut in the
discount rate more likely.
The Bundesbank did not announce a fixed rate repo for next week. However,
there were strong expectations that the repo rate - whether variable or
fixed - would come down to reflect the new structure of market rates.
The Bundesbank's cut was followed by a sharp climb in Euromark futures. The
June contract rose 16 basis points on the day to close at 92.78. The June
French franc con-tract gained 16 basis points, ending at 91.97. One-month
French francs dropped more than 40 basis points from their peak of the day
to around 8.80 per cent.
Expectations of another reduction in UK base rates diminished sharply
yesterday after the unemployment figures for March registered a net drop on
the month for the second time running.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment declined by 26,000. The June short sterling
contract fell 16 basis points to a low of 93.80. However, the news from
Germany lifted it back up to a close of 93.91.
Sterling cash markets were more muted. Three-month money finished unchanged
at 6 per cent. A shortage of Pounds 1.3bn in the discount market pushed the
overnight lending rate up to 7.5 per cent at one stage.

FT  23 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Astonishment over rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR and leading European currencies performed strongly against the
D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank astonished dealers by lowering the
effective floor to German money market rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to reduce its Lombard rate by 50 basis points to
8.50 per cent had been anticipated by some marketmakers. But the cut in the
discount rate - from 7.50 per cent to 7.25 per cent - took almost the whole
market by surprise.
The shock was all the greater because agencies originally reported that
there was no change in Bundesbank rates, and only corrected their news
flashes three minutes later. One dealer talked of substantial gains and
losses in dollar/D-Mark trading in the intervening period.
The cut in rates helped the dollar rise in the European afternoon to peak at
DM1.6135, although it later slipped to end only slightly up on the day at
DM1.6065. The dollar's modest rise was surprising, considering that this was
the third easing in official German rates in 10 weeks. However, the US
currency remains capped by the 4 percentage-point differential between
short-term US and German rates. In New York trading it fell a pfennig to end
at DM1.5965.
The impact of the Bundesbank's move was felt far more keenly inside the
European exchange rate mechanism.
In the European morning, both the French franc and the Spanish peseta had
come under pressure on expectations that the Bundesbank would leave policy
unchanged at its council meeting.
The French franc weakened beyond the FFr3.38 level against the D-Mark for
the first time in some weeks. The peseta also declined sharply, bottoming
out at Pta72.78 to the D-Mark, forcing the Bank of Spain to raise its daily
intervention rate by 65 basis points to 14.0 per cent and to intervene in
the market by buying its currency.
The German discount rate cut helped the franc in afternoon trading to a
close of FFr3.374 per D-Mark. But the peseta remained weak, closing at
Pta72.54 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta72.37. It was some 74 basis points
above the weakest currency in the ERM grid last night, a full percentage
point below its level of 10 days ago.
Both the Bundesbank move and the UK unemployment figures helped sterling to
close at DM2.4875 against the D-Mark, 2 1/4 pfennigs ahead on the day. The
currency rose a striking 0.8 percentage points against its exchange rate
index to end at 80.7.
The drop in seasonally adjusted unemployment by 26,000 took the markets by
surprise, and underlined the views of those who think the UK economy may be
in the midst of an upturn. Mr David Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in
London, believes the critical level for the pound is DM2.49: 'If it breaks
through that, we should see DM2.52.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese renege on wool
contracts as prices dive

<TEXT>
THE CRISIS in Australia's wool market deepened this week, with prices
hitting a new low and the biggest overseas buyers starting to renege on
earlier contracts.
The wool market indicator, the weighted average of auction prices of 15 wool
categories, yesterday fell to ADollars 3.96 a kilogram, the first time the
indicator has dropped below the the ADollars 4 mark.
Brokers said that Chinese and Korean buyers, who were buying strongly
earlier this week, yesterday kept away from the market.
Meanwhile, a delegation from the Australian Council of Wool Exporters has
flown to China, the biggest importer of Australian wool, to try to persuade
individual buyers to stop reneging on wool purchases contracted when prices
were higher.
Government officials say that the extent of losses from dishonoured
contracts is not known but the Chinese buyers' action is giving 'cause for
concern' in the government. The Wool Export Council has asked the federal
government to put pressure on the Chinese government.
The council's Mr Don Booth said that the Chinese buyers' action was totally
unacceptable and warned that it would diminish their country's standing in
the international wool market.
Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries minister, is expected to propose to
the cabinet next week an emergency aid package to wool growers, including
interest rate subsidies and generous debt re-scheduling arrangements.

FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia's BHP set to join
mineral sands big league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROKEN HILL Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, seems to have found a
way to join the relatively few groups that control the world's mineral sands
industry. It may play the major role in developing a project in Mozambique.
It has signed a deal with Kenmare Resources, a small Irish exploration
company, which could lead to BHP spending an estimated USDollars 24.11m to
earn a 75 per cent share inthe Congolone project, near Angoche on the
northern coast of Mozambique.
BHP already owns 100 per cent of the Beenup mineral sands project in Western
Australia but has made it clear in the past that it was planning to get
bigger in the mineral sands business or get out. Some observers calculate
that a combination of Congolone and Beenup would give BHP more than 20 per
cent of the market for titanium dioxide, produced from ilmenite and a key
ingredient in the production of pigments for paint, paper and plastics.
Mr Michael Carvill, Kenmare's managing director, said BHP had already spent
a year and a quarter working on the project but there was a long way to go
before the Australian group could decide to take the project into
production.
A scheme to process ilmenite to produce 500,000 tonnes a year of titanium
slag in Mozambique, using the ample and cheap power from that country's
Cabora Bassa dam, was being considered, but it would require more tax
incentives than the Mozambique government was offering at present, given
that similar projects elsewhere had cost Dollars 300m.
The very earliest a development decision could be made was 1997, said Mr
Carvill, and it would then take another two years for output to begin.
BHP and Elkem, the Norwegian group, have finalised their strategic alliance
in the manganese business - manganese is essential in the production of some
steels.
BHP, the world's third-largest producer of manganese ore, will secure a
long-term market for production from its Groote Eylandt mine in the Northern
Territory, and fluctuations in Elkem's manganese operations - it is the
world's largest independent producer of manganese alloys - will be evened
out.
Groote Eylandt Manganese Sales, a company 51 per cent owned by BHP and the
rest by Elkem, will supply ore from the mine at production cost to two
manganese alloy production plants in Norway, previously owned by Elkem but
now also put into a joint company, Elkem Mangan, 51 per cent owned by Elkem
and 49 per cent by BHP.

FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium can recycling reaches
record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALUMINIUM industry's determined efforts to promote can recycling as one
of the few forms of used packaging that can generate a decent income for
collectors are paying off.
Aluminium can recycling rates in Europe and the US reached record levels
last year. In Europe the rate rose from 21 per cent in 1991 to 25 per cent
while the US rate jumped from 62.5 per cent to 67.9 per cent.
Big money was involved. The US Aluminum Association estimates that the
industry paid out Dollars 968m for used cans, money that went back into
local economies to benefit individuals, schools, churches, scout troops and
so on.
However, the industry also benefits - and not only from giving itself a
'green' image. Cans provide cheaper metal because they can be recycled on a
'closed loop' system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again), because
they save as much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new
aluminium and because the capital cost of a recycling plant is only
one-tenth of that for a smelter.
According to Aluminium Can Recycling Europe (Acre), at least 39,595 tonnes
of aluminium cans were recycled in Europe last year, up from 32,350 tonnes.
The European industry has set itself a target of recycling 50 per cent of
all aluminium cans by the mid-1990s at a time when aluminium's share of the
beverage can market is also growing rapidly - it reached 51 per cent in
1992. Sweden, which has a mandatory deposit scheme, had the highest
recycling rate last year, 86 per cent, followed by Iceland, 75 per cent, and
Switzerland, 68 per cent.
Mr Alexander Wirtz of Acre, says that 'cash for aluminium cans' machines in
Switzerland today are even found high up in the Alps next to ski huts.
The recycling rate in Austria jumped from 25 per cent to 40 per cent last
year and there were steady increases in Ireland (11 to 16 per cent), Italy
(15 to 18 per cent), Greece (26 to 29 per cent) and the UK (11 to 16 per
cent.)
Efforts to promote further growth and to provide the necessary collection
infrastructure are being co-ordinated by Acre, which was formed in 1984 by
Alcan of Canada, Pechiney of France and VAW of Germany. Alcoa and Reynolds
of the US, joined in 1988, and Alusuisse-Lonza (Switzerland), Hydro
Aluminium (Norway) and Elval (Greece) agreed to provide support in their
domestic markets.

FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low prices snuff out tobacco
hopes - Tony Hawkins on a stunning setback for Zimbabwean growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING GROWN possibly the best flue-cured tobacco crop in the country's
history, Zimbabwean farmers have been stunned by depressed prices on the
Harare auction floors.
When the tobacco sales opened last week growers were optimistic that prices
would open in the region of USDollars 1.50 a kilogram and hopeful that
during the season they would average Dollars 2 a kg. But on the first day
the price averaged Dollars 1.29. falling below Dollars 1 on the third day
and sliding still further this week to average only Dollars 1.05 during the
first week of the sales. That was 34 per cent down on last year's opening
price of Dollars 1.60 a kilogram for what was a low quality, high-nicotine,
drought-stressed crop.
Growers had been warned that the global supply-demand balance had shifted
against them and that prices this year would come under pressure, but no-one
expected so dramatic a decline, especially given the sharp improvement in
the quality of tobacco on offer. 'We are shell-shocked,' said an industry
official this week.
There is no single explanation for this. Global recession, higher taxes on
smoking, cigarette price wars in the US and EC and the increased
availability of some grades, especially filler tobaccos, have all
contributed to thin order books. The Brazilian crop is up nearly 10 per cent
at 400m kg, but, unlike Zimbabwe, the quality is poor.
Zimbabwe's farmers are highly critical of the government's monetary policy,
which they say has killed the speculation that would normally have resulted
in heavy buying by the merchants.
They have a point. Repeated government promises to curb public spending and
reduce the budget deficit have come to nothing and economists expect the
1992-93 budget deficit to exceed 12 per cent of GDP or roughly double the
target in Zimbabwe's structural adjustment programme.
In an effort to meet credit ceilings agreed with the IMF, while also
accommodating the government's borrowing requirements, the Reserve (central)
Bank of Zimbabwe, which in December promised lower interest rates, has been
forced to allow money market rates to rise. Merchants are therefore faced
with the choice of paying upwards of 40 per cent interest to buy and hold
speculative tobacco or borrow offshore at much lower rates, carrying the
foreign exchange risk of further Zimbabwe dollar devaluation as well as the
probability of being unable to sell and move the tobacco before the loan is
repaid in 180 days.
The result has been market stalemate; merchants awaiting orders from the
manufacturers who traditionally only show their hand in the market in the
second half of May or even later, while the growers, indignant at being
forced to 'give' their tobacco away at bargain basement prices are
withdrawing from the market in the hope that prices will soon recover.
Caught in the middle is the monopoly auction floor company, Tobacco Sales,
with too much tobacco to store as a result of confident pre-season bookings
and subsequent large-scale tearing of tickets, thereby rejecting sales, by
growers. At the same time farmers are scrambling to cancel next month's
bookings and hold their tobacco back in the hope that when the manufacturers
see the quality of the leaf they will start buying heavily.
Watching gloomily from the sidelines are the banks. They had hoped for
buoyant sales, both to boost national export earnings and to ease market
liquidity as tobacco growers repaid their loans.
It is estimated that the break-even price for a tobacco farmer is in the
region of Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.60 a kilogram, depending on the yield
achieved. After last year's disastrous drought, when the banks were forced
to carry a large number of their customers, a second successive season of
loan roll-overs would push up lending rates once again.
With less than 2 per cent of the crop having been sold, it is far too early
even to begin to guess what the price will average this season. Were the
authorities to open a tobacco window at the central bank to finance
speculative buying, this might give prices a modest boost. Merchants play
this down, however, stressing that the real problem is not the liquidity
crunch at home so much as weak global demand.
Last year the industry produced 201m kg of tobacco, which sold at an average
price of Dollars 1.62 a kg, only half the Dollars 3.25 achieved in the 1991
boom. Current forecasts point to a crop of at least 205m kg this year with
price estimates for the season ranging from Dollars 1.40 from the
doom-merchants to the optimists' Dollars 1.75. Unless market conditions
change radically in the next two months, the probability must be that the
1993 crop will earn little more than last year's Dollars 326m, less than the
Dollars 350m achieved in 1990 and substantially below the record Dollars
553m enjoyed in 1991.
With tobacco accounting for 40 per cent of export earnings last year, and
with mining and industrial exports suffering at the hand of world recession,
another year of depressed prices would deflate the dwindling hopes of a
significant economic recovery in 1993.
In any event, tobacco exports this year will be sharply lower than in 1992
because the foreign sales in the first half the year will be dominated by
last year's poor quality low-priced leaf. But a second successive year of
low prices would delay Zimbabwe's export recovery by at least 12 months as
well as reversing the trend towards increased tobacco production if growers
came to accept that the 1991 boom really was no more than a flash in the
pan.

COPPER'S price recovery was halted in late trading at the London Metal
Exchange yesterday when forward, producer-related, hedge selling and fresh
Chinese selling took the three months price back to Dollars 1,865 a tonne.
Final business was at Dollars 1,868 a tonne, still up Dollars 10 on the day.
Earlier Wednesday's recovery from 5 1/2 -year lows had been continued,
lifting the price to Dollars 1,920 a tonne at one stage. Traders noted that,
while the market was heavily oversold, there was strong reluctance to test
resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne. The ALUMINIUM market suffered a
technical breakdown around Wednesday's closing level of Dollars 1,125 a
tonne for three months metal and this was followed by option-related selling
and the triggering of stop-loss selling orders, which forced prices down to
Dollars 1,105 at one stage. The market ended at Dollars 1,110 a tonne, down
Dollars 12 from Wednesday's kerb close. COCOA futures held on to small gains
scored early in the day as the market continued to trade in a narrow range.
'What this market needs is some convincing fundamental news,' said one
trader.

following a combination of sharply lower overall production and a restricted
premium for white over raw sugar, according to the latest market report from
Czarnikow, the London trade house.
Total production is now forecast to reach only 3.84m tonnes, compared with
initial expectations of 5.5m tonnes. By April 15 only two of the country's
46 mills were still crushing cane.
Last year Thailand exported 1.3m tonnes of white sugar, but the figure could
fall to only 410,000 tonnes this year, the report suggests. Despite a recent
recovery in the white sugar premium to about Dollars 55 a tonne from Dollars
35 a tonne, 'in view of the reduction in the overall supply, it is not
likely that Thai millers will be in a position to revise and enlarge their
remelting programmes for white sugar'.
Remelting is necessary to produce white sugar from raw cane sugar.
In spite of the recent retreat in world sugar prices from three-year highs,
Czarnikow suggests that the market outlook has moved from the prospect of an
increase in stocks to one of a drawdown of around 2m tonnes.
'Although there are ample stocks carried forward from past seasons, it is
clear that periods of temporary supply shortages may occur from time to time
this year. It will therefore fall to the world price to provide the
necessary stimulus to attract supplies out of domestic carry forward stock
and into world trade.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Optimism remains high on Yemeni
oil - Explorers are confident of further discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP US, Canadian and French oil executives remain optimistic over Yemen's
potential for development despite problems stemming from the country's
political uncertainty.
'With 60 to 70 per cent of Yemen yet to be explored, it would be premature
to estimate the country's ultimate potential,' says Mr Ray Irani, chairman
of both the US and Canadian Occidental Petroleum Corporation. 'Top notch
companies are now combing the land and there are bound to be more
discoveries.'
Oil in commercial quantities was first discovered in Yemen by the
Dallas-based Hunt Oil Company in 1984 and exports began in 1987. Hunt's
production had been as high as 210,000 barrels a day of, but depletion of
the 1bn-barrel of reserve has brought the figure down to 180,000 b/d.
Yemen's production is expected to rise to 300,000 b/d in September when
CanOxy's new fields in Al-Maseela come on stream. 'We expected to pump
120,000 barrels a day by the end of September,' says Mr James B. Taylor,
executive vice-president and chief operating officer of the Calgary-based
company, which has been operating in Yemen since 1987 and has drilled 37
exploratory wells, 28 of them successfully.
'That is a 76 per cent success ratio, a phenomenal success, almost unheard
of elsewhere,' Mr Taylor says.
CanOxy's reserves are now estimated at 1.5bn barrels, of which some 460m are
potentially recoverable.
Other companies are also begining to report significant discoveries - Total
of France recently announced a 12,000 b/d find in its Shabwa concession,
which is adjacent to CanOxy's field in Al-Maseela. But problems are also
being discovered. Two weeks ago hostile Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped six Total
employees at gunpoint and released them only after the company agreed to
provide 85 jobs for the tribe.
Last July other armed tribesmen kidnapped Hunt's general manager along with
six other employees to use as bargaining chips in a dispute with the
government. All seven were later released unharmed.
Hunt, Total, Royal/Dutch Shell, Arco and other companies operating in the
country have meanwhile been faced with continued hostility as tribesmen
threaten employees and hijack company vehicles in broad daylight.
Most observers attribute such difficulties to the country's economic and
political problems. Already one of the world's poorest countries, Yemen
suffered particular hardship when Saudi Arabia expelled some 1m Yemeni
workers and their families during the Gulf war. Since then it has suffered
inflation at nearly 200 per cent and a 36 per cent unemployment rate.

FT  23 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Cut in Lombard rate puts life back into
European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOND markets across Europe sprang back to life following the Bundesbank's
decision to cut German interest rates yesterday. The German central bank
announced a  1/2 point cut in the Lombard rate, taking it down to 8.5 per
cent, and a  1/4 point lowering of the discount rate to 7.25 per cent.
The relief was all the greater because dealers said some news agencies
initially mistakenly reported that there had been no change in German rates.
That false alarm briefly sent the bund futures contract down to 95.58,
compared with the opening 95.73.
This was rapidly reversed after news of the cuts came through, and the bund
futures contract closed at the day's high of 96.28.
Trading volumes were very heavy, with about 94,000 futures contracts traded.
The change in mood followed a couple of weeks of pessimism, culminating in
disappointment at the first-quarter M3 money supply expansion and at the
German finance minister's warning on the budget deficit earlier this week.
The interest rate cuts were all the more unexpected in the wake of a tiny
reduction in the repo rate on Wednesday.
Next week's repo rate is expected to be cut by at least 25 basis points from
the current 8.09 per cent, and one economist was looking for it to come down
to 7 per cent by the end of June and 6 per cent or less by the end of the
year.
The interpretation put on the Bundesbank's action was that it was
acknowledging the serious weakness in the real economy.
Italy, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands followed suit with interest rate
cuts. Among the rallying bond markets, Italy gained more than a point.
On the Paris-based Matif exchange, the futures contract gained about half a
point as the Bundesbank's move raised hopes of another cut in French
interest rates, possibly as soon as the beginning of next week.
The Spanish market also rallied, particularly at the long end, although
dealers said the peseta remained under pressure.
THE UK government bond market ended the day a little lower, although the
German news led to some recovery after the market had been punctured by the
surprisingly good UK unemployment figures.
A second month's fall in the jobless was taken as a sign that the economy
had turned the corner, ruling out hopes of a further cut in interest rates
and raising concern about inflationary pressure later in the year.
At one stage, the 10 to 15-year bonds were down more than a point and the
futures contract was down by a similar amount. After the Bundesbank came to
the rescue, bonds at most maturities recovered to end down by only a quarter
point.
However, because of nervousness ahead of next Wednesday's auction, one
analyst said some downside risk remained. For example, if today's retail
sales figures indicate a further strengthening of the economy, selling
pressure could again be exerted.
US TREASURY prices were little changed late yesterday, after early losses at
the long end, as dealers and investors in the US Treasury market mostly
ignored a cut in German interest rates and a rise in weekly jobless claims.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was steady at 104
27/32 , yielding 6.742 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was
slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 3.705 per cent.
Normally, the Bundesbank's decision to cut German interest rates would be
bullish for US bonds. In theory, lower German rates should help lift the
dollar, making US assets (including government securities), a more
attractive investment to foreigners.
However, yesterday the dollar did not rally particularly strongly on the
Bundesbank's move, leaving Treasury investors with little cause for
celebration. The news that weekly unemployment insurance claims rose 26,000
also failed to stir much interest, although the data confirmed that the
labour market was still struggling to keep up with the economic recovery.
Early trading was dominated by selling in the futures market, which hit
longer-dated prices. Two dealers unloaded June Treasury bond contracts just
before the jobs numbers were released.
The long end was pressured by a newspaper report that said Mr George Soros,
the influential US money manager, was turning bearish on US bonds.
Prices recovered their lost ground later in the session amid some
short-covering and reports of buying by the Federal Reserve on behalf of a
foreign central bank.
JAPANESE cash bonds and futures responded positively to yet another record
high for the yen against the dollar and to the fifth consecutive day's fall
in the Nikkei average index.
The June futures contract rose to 109.53 from 109.30, trading in a range of
109.14 to 109.60. The yield on the benchmark 145 due 2002 moved from 4.22
per cent to 4.15 per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Lucas enters US private
market to raise Dollars 116m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the international engineering group, is raising Dollars
116m of 12-year money through the US private placement market. The car and
aerospace components group is the latest in a stream of UK companies to tap
the US private placement market for funds because of the ease of obtaining
relatively cheap, long-term financing.
The bonds, which have a 6.95 per cent coupon, are issued by the US
subsidiary and guaranteed by Lucas, the parent company. The company has
received commitments for Dollars 116m.
Mr Edward Freeborn, director of corporate finance, said the company chose to
use the US private placement market because it was very efficient.
He added that it would have been more expensive for the company to tap the
Eurobond market, and less easy to obtain such long-term financing from UK
banks.
'US (interest) rates for corporate borrowers are at an 18-year low, and this
placement usefully lengthens our average debt maturity,' said Mr Freeborn.
The funds will be used to refinance the group's higher cost debt, mainly
borrowings with a maturity of less than one year.
Lucas had its long-term debt rating lowered from A- to BBB+ by IBCA earlier
this year.
The deal was managed in the US by Wertheim Schroder, who managed a previous
issue for Lucas in March 1992, a Dollars 100m 12-year deal.
Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director of Wertheim Schroder, pointed out
that banks in the UK are unwilling to lend money at maturities of more than
five years, while companies with a credit rating below AA cannot access the
Eurobond market easily.
Lucas's bonds are being placed with US life insurance companies which want
to lock into long-term fixed rate investments at an attractive margin over
US Treasury bonds.

200m debenture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH LAND, the UK property company, issued Pounds 200m of 35-year
debenture stock yesterday. The funds will be used for general corporate
purposes, which could include the repayment of the group's more expensive
debt, the acquisition of new properties, or further capital expenditure on
existing properties.
The Pounds 200m First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2028 has a 9 3/8 per cent
coupon and was issued at a spread of 90 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2017, with an issue price of 99.403. By late afternoon, the bid
price was 99.5, while the spread was unchanged, according to SG Warburg
Securities, joint lead manager for the deal with NatWest Capital Markets.
The 35-year debenture increases the weighted average maturity of BL's
outstanding debt to about 16 years.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Bonds: French franc sector generates interest
as currency stabilises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc sector of the Eurobond market continued to draw issuers
yesterday as borrowers were keen to take advantage of the new-found
stability of the French currency as well as the prospect of falling interest
rates.
The EIB and Credit Local de France both launched FFr2bn bond issues
yesterday. The EIB bond, lead-managed by CCF, has a 6.75 per cent coupon and
matures in 1998.
Priced at 10 basis points over the 1998 government bond, the spread widened
out to 12 basis points by late afternoon because of the strong rally in the
government bond market, the lead manager said.
However, CCF pointed out that the sector remained an attractive one as the
recent general election result had led to stability of the currency while
yesterday's cut in German interest rates had raised hopes that the Bank of
France would be able to follow suit soon.
Peninsula &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O) launched a Pounds 150m 10-year
convertible bond issue with a 7.25 per cent coupon.
The deal was seen as aggressively priced. UBS, the lead managers, said the
bonds, which were launched at par, later traded at 100 3/8 .
The Republic of Iceland also tapped the sterling sector with a Pounds 100m
8.75 per cent 10-year bond with a coupon of 8.75 per cent - the country's
biggest public bond issue.
Iceland has not tapped the sterling market since 1981 when it issued a
35-year bond. Last year, it tapped the Eurobond market with a DM225m issue.
Yesterday's deal was launched at a yield spread of 90 basis points over the
8 per cent 10-year gilt, and the spread narrowed to 88 basis points on the
bid side, according to JP Morgan, the lead manager. Demand for the bonds
came mainly from the UK, and about a quarter of the issue was placed in
continental Europe.
Mitsubishi Corp Finance tapped the Euroyen sector with a 4.5 per cent Y30bn
four-year deal led by Morgan Stanley. The lead manager said the proceeds
would be swapped into floating rate yen and the funds would be used for
general corporate purposes such as paying off maturing debt.
Mitsubishi Corp Finance, which has been preparing to launch its bond issue
for some time, went ahead yesterday because of what it sees as the
favourable market conditions - in particular the international demand for
yen assets and low interest rates.
Yesterday saw the launch of the first Chinese deal in the Euromarkets - a
Dollars 150m floating rate note from Guangdong International Trust &amp;
Investment Corporation (Gitic), a development arm of the government of
China's fastest-growing province. The issue, led by Union Bank of
Switzerland, had a five-year maturity and is priced at 55 basis points over
six-month Libor.

IN SPITE of the slump in consumer spending, Japanese women are still

Kao, the country's leading household products manufacturer, writes Charles
Leadbeater.
Yesterday, it reported a 17 per cent increase in group pre-tax profits to
Y45.32bn (Dollars 408m) for the year to the end of March from Y38.62bn a
year earlier. Consolidated sales rose by 5.7 per cent to Y771.27bn from

Group earnings per share fell 7.6 per cent to Y34.07 from Y36.87 reflecting
an increase in the number of outstanding shares following a one-for-10 stock
split during the year.
The directors set the final dividend at Y5 a share, making an unchanged Y10
for the year.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Carrier's crucial timetable for
recovery - James Whittington reports on Middle East Airlines' struggle to
return to profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEBANON'S Middle East Airlines (MEA), once a successful carrier, has during
the past 15 years been associated only with hijackings and terrorism.
Severely affected by the protracted fighting and repeated closures of Beirut
International Airport during Lebanon's civil war, the privately-owned
carrier was frequently victim of hijacking militias seeking international
exposure.
Now hostilities are over and the government led by Saudi-Lebanese prime
minister Mr Rafik Al Hariri is determined to rebuild the country. As a
consequence, MEA is looking to regain some of its former status.
Mr Abdel Hamid Fakhoury, appointed the airline's chairman in June last year
and reportedly close to Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, says: 'We are in a
period of transition. During the war, our main policy was that of survival.
We had to continue. Having survived, we can now look at building on what we
have.'
With a low level of debt of about Dollars 50m, Mr Fakhoury says that the
airline's 'conservative policy' during the war has paid off. Its fleet
remains substantially the same as that in 1975, with three Boeing 747s and
eleven Boeing 707s. In 1992, it leased two Airbus A310-200s from KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines. This contract runs for three years and grants MEA the option
to buy the aircraft.
Despite a 28 per cent reduction in the number of employees in 1981, MEA is
still the biggest private employer in the country, with 3,873 staff.
The carrier's ownership is split between the majority state-owned Intra
Investment Company, which has a 62 per cent stake, and Air France which owns
28 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is half owned by employees and half
by Lebanese investors. Shareholders in Intra include Lebanon's central bank,
the National Bank of Kuwait, and the governments of Qatar and Kuwait.
MEA services 37 destinations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Last
year, it carried 701,805 passengers, which compares with more than 1.1m in
1975 when Lebanon attracted peak numbers of tourists. Unprofitable flights
to Ankara and Dacca have recently been stopped and the airline's overall net
losses last year were cut to Dollars 5.2m, from Dollars 10m in 1991.
Having suffered accumulated losses of more than Dollars 200m since 1976, Mr
Fakhoury is confident that the airline's lossmaking days are over. 'We hope
to break even this year for the first time since 1975,' he says.
His confidence is reflected by a high level of business optimism in Beirut.
Mr Al Hariri, who is himself a dollar billionaire, seems to have instilled
faith among the Lebanese business community and with foreign aid now
starting to flow into Beirut's reconstruction programme, the city is
beginning to shake off its image as one of the most dangerous places in the
world.
As an indication of this, the Arab Aircraft Carrier Organisation (AACO)
decided to return its headquarters to Beirut at its annual conference
earlier this month.
Mr Fakhoury explains that MEA's policy is firstly to serve the large number
of Lebanese expatriates scattered around the world, and secondly to
recapture the booming tourist trade of the 1960s and early 1970s.
A central objective of the airline's comeback strategy is to regain its
routes to the US. These were stopped in June 1985 after a TWA airliner on an
Athens-Rome flight was hijacked by members of Hizbollah, the Islamic
fundamentalist group, and ordered to fly to Beirut.
Mr Fakhoury says: 'There is continual dialogue between our government and
the US, but so far the response has been, 'give it more time'.' MEA hopes
that when the US rescinds the ban, other important routes will be granted,
such as one to Canada and Australia.
'One of the basic characteristics of this country is that we have a large
number of Lebanese spread all over the world. MEA could make profits on this
market alone, if we are given access to them,' he says.
In anticipation of increased passenger traffic, the government plans to
expand the state-owned Beirut International Airport. Modernisation of the
airport's facilities is already under way. Having been frozen for most of
the past 18 years by the civil war, much of the airport's aviation
technology is out of date.
Plans for expansion include a terminal capable of handling a flow of 6m
passengers a year and a third 3,500-metre runway. In 1992, 21 foreign
airlines used the airport, including Air France, KLM and Alitalia, and the
airport handled about 1m passengers. Tourist traffic today, however,
according to Mr Fakhoury, is negligible.
Funds required to rehabilitate and develop the airport will be allocated by
Lebanon's Council of Development and Reconstruction (CDR), charged by the
government to oversee the reconstruction of the country.
The CDR is seeking Dollars 5bn in foreign aid and private investment for the
reconstruction of Beirut city, including the airport. 'If finance is
forthcoming, development should take no more than two years,' says Mr
Fakhoury.
MEA's future hinges on whether this timescale can be met and this depends on
Mr Hariri's ability to deliver. The government faces a Herculean challenge
in its plans for reconstruction and stabilising an economy awash with
corruption, unemployment, poverty and mismanagement.
The country's politics remain volatile, and regional stability is far from
guaranteed. While MEA attempts to improve its tarnished image abroad, many
potential passengers are likely to wait and see before booking a flight.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Seven-Eleven Japan advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN-Eleven Japan, the country's largest convenience store operator,
yesterday reported a 9.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, one of the
best financial performances this year by a leading retailer.
While most Japanese retailers, especially luxury department stores, have
been hit hard by the downturn in consumer spending, Seven-Eleven announced
increases in its profits, sales and dividends.
Seven-Eleven runs an extensive network of 24-hour, local convenience stores,
which sell food and household items. The contrast between its improved
financial performance and the sharp deterioration in the performance of
leading department stores is an indicator of how consumer spending is
shifting from luxury brands to basic goods.
The group's pre-tax profit rose by 9.7 per cent to Y85,160m (Dollars 767m)
for the year to the end of February on overall sales growth of 11.8 per cent
to Y181,962m. The company said it was increasing its final dividend by Y0.5
per share to Y34, up Y2 from last year.
Denny's Japan, the fast-food restaurant chain, reported a 19.1 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits in the year to the end of February, largely because lower
interest rates lowered its non-operating income and it had fewer customers.
Denny's pre-tax profits were Y6.46bn, compared with Y7.99bn in the previous
year. Sales rose by 0.6 per cent to Y85.48bn, from Y85bn the year before.
Both Seven-Eleven and Denny's are affiliated with Ito-Yokado, Japan's
largest supermarket operator. The slump in the Japanese economy was the main
factor behind Ito-Yokado reporting its first ever fall in consolidated
pre-tax profits.
Ito-Yokado, said consolidated pre-tax profit, covering the parent group and
58 subsidiaries, for the year to the end of February, was 11.1 per cent down
at Y181,121m. The parent company's unconsolidated pre-tax profit rose by 0.4
per cent to Y97.51bn on sales of Y1,511.55bn, up 3.6 per cent on the year

cut capital spending

TOKYO Steel Manufacturing, a medium-sized Japanese steelmaker, yesterday
reported a 51.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y28.5bn (Dollars 257m)
for the year ending in March, as larger steelmakers announced cuts in
capital spending for this year.
Sales slipped 4.8 per cent to Y203.3bn following a sharp fall in demand from
the private construction industry, which has been seriously bruised by a
surplus of office and apartments in the two largest cities, Tokyo and Osaka.
The company also reported that weakening demand led to tougher price
competition among Japanese makers. Larger makers export about 20 per cent of
their production, but Tokyo Steel depends for about 90 per cent of its sales
on a still-weakening domestic market.
Tokyo Steel hopes that a Y13,200bn economic package announced last week will
stimulate orders for public works projects, and is confident that the
private construction market will recover later this year.
But, for the year ending next March, the company expects a 13 per cent fall
in sales to Y177bn, and a pre-tax profit of only Y3bn.
Meanwhile, Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, announced a 15 per
cent cut to Y170bn in capital spending planned for this year, while NKK,
another leading maker, said its outlays would fall 29 per cent to Y145bn.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Rise of 21% in per share
earnings at Citic Pacific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CITIC Pacific, the Beijing-controlled conglomerate in Hong Kong, yesterday
posted a 200 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m)
from HKDollars 332.9m in 1991 on turnover of HKDollars 8.3bn, up from
HKDollars 118m.
The directors declared a final dividend of 22 cents a share making 30.2
cents for the year - up 25 per cent on 1991.
Comparisons with the past are difficult because Citic underwent a large
change in 1992, acquiring Hang Chong, a large trading company. The figures
also include a first time contribution from Citic's 12.5 per cent interest
in Cathay Pacific and 46 per cent of Dragon Air.
During the year Citic also acquired a 12 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom,
interests in two mainland Chinese power stations and a share in a waste
disposal plant in Hong Kong.
Earnings per share - a better guide to Citic's management of its assets -
grew by 21 per cent to 87.4 cents, from 72 cents in 1991.
Mr Larry Yung, chairman, said Citic would continue to acquire more assets
and raise more cash but only as long as two pre-conditions were met - 'that
per share earnings will not be diluted and that the interests of small
shareholders will be protected.'
Da Chong Hong, which distributes Nissan cars, moved aggressively into
mainland China last year. Citic said that sales to China, which analysts put
at more than 12,000, accounted for 54 per cent of its total car sales last
year.
Da Chong Hong also plans to manage a confectionery and food manufacturing
plant in Shanghai and has signed an agreement with Isuzu of Japan to produce
trucks and vans in Sichuan.
Profits from Dragon Air - the Cathay/Citic joint venture airline which took
over Cathay's China routes - doubled last year. Jardine Fleming estimated
that Dragon produced a profit of more than HKDollars 200m.

period
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MCDONALD'S Corporation, the world's largest hamburger chain, yesterday
posted a 16 per cent improvement in first-quarter net earnings to Dollars
218.3m on sales which rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.24bn.
In the same period of 1992, the company earned Dollars 187.4m on sales of
Dollars 4.92bn. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent in the latest quarter to
57 cents from 51 cents.
Revenues, which are less than sales because of franchising agreements, were
2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.65bn in the 1993 quarter. Operating income
advanced 5 per cent to Dollars 411.4m from Dollars 393.2m a year ago.
The Illinois-based company said earnings growth was constrained by bad
weather worldwide, weaker foreign currencies and 'the loss of one day, since
1992 was a leap year'.
McDonald's said its performance in 1993 'will keep us on the track of
achieving teens growth in earnings as measured over a five-year-period of
time'.
On Wall Street, shares in the company fell Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars
46 7/8 .
US sales grew 6 per cent in the quarter, while overseas sales were up 7 per
cent.
The company plans to extend its share purchase programme this year by
Dollars 200m, above the previously announced Dollars 500m.

reservations system

<TEXT>
CANADA'S Competition Tribunal said it had no jurisdiction to allow PWA,
parent company of Canadian Airlines, to break its contract to use the Gemini
computerised reservations system and switch to American Airlines' Sabre
system.
The tribunal says it expected the issue to go the Federal Court of Canada,
and PWA immediately confirmed it would take this step.
PWA and Air Canada were founder-owners of Gemini in July 1989. Both carriers
merged their own systems into Gemini to gain efficiency.
PWA applied to the Competition Tribunal to have the contract declared void
on anti-competition grounds, but the tribunal said allowing Canadian to
transfer to Sabre would not lessen competition.
Reuter adds: Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, said the carrier would continue to
work with AMR to complete the proposed alliance.
AMR has said it would invest CDollars 246m in Canadian for a 25 per cent
voting stake, provided Canadian switched from Gemini to Sabre.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Amdahl to cut another 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMDAHL, one of IBM's largest competitors in the mainframe computer market,
said it would cut its workforce by another 1,000, in addition to the 1,000
jobs already cut over the past six months.
The company employs about 8,500 people, about 5,000 of them in California.
The reduction will be completed in late May.
Amdahl said it needed to consolidate its operations in view of 'erratic'
markets.
The company said that demand for its mainframe computers and related
products dropped sharply in last year's third quarter, only to surge in the
fourth and then decline significantly in early 1993.
Last month, Amdahl warned that its first-quarter results, due to be released
next week, would be considerably below analysts' estimates. Last week, IBM
also reported a 'high double-digit' decline in sales of mainframe computers
and related data storage devices in its latest quarterly report.
Amdahl said excess production capacity within the industry has contributed
to severe price competition recently. In contrast to the problems of Amdahl
and IBM, EMC, the leading manufacturer of disk arrays, a lower-cost
alternative to traditional mainframe data storage systems, yesterday
reported strong sales and earnings for its first quarter. EMC said that
sales increased to Dollars 130.7m from Dollars 65.7m , while income for the
quarter was Dollars 14.9m, or 32 cents a share, up from Dollars 5.2m, or 13
cents.
IBM Personal Software Products division has named Mr William Rich as general
manager in charge of worldwide sales and marketing, Reuter reports.
Mr David Proctor has been named vice-president of products. He was formerly
president of Xerox Computer Services. Proctor will be based in Austin,
Texas.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Delta Air trims deficit to
Dollars 133.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday unveiled an
after-tax loss of Dollars 133.9m for the three months to end-March, only
slightly lower than the deficit of Dollars 151.6m in the same period of
1992.
The third-quarter results contained an operating loss of Dollars 178.6m
(Dollars 199.3m).
Contained in the operating and after-tax losses was an Dollars 82.5m
'restructuring charge' related to the decision to return certain Airbus jets
to the lessors and to temporarily lay-off 600 pilots. Excluding this charge,
Delta would have made an operating loss of Dollars 96m, and a net loss of
Dollars 81.7m.
Delta's figures came one day after American Airlines had cheered the entire
US airline sector with better-than-expected first-quarter results, and
hinted that profitability could be in sight.
Delta's result, although showing improvement year-on-year, caused airline
shares generally to weaken. Delta's own stock was down Dollars 1 5/8 at
Dollars 57 5/8 at the close in New York. The stock of AMR, the parent
company of American, initially held its own but fell Dollars 1 1/8 by the
close to stand at Dollars 70 1/8 .
Delta said it regarded the results as 'disappointing', although it noted
they did reflect 'continuing improvements in unit revenues and unit costs'.
Operating revenues rose by 4 per cent year-on-year, to Dollars 2.93bn, while
total operating expenses were Dollars 3.105bn (Dollars 3.014bn).
The third-quarter figures mean Delta is now posting a Dollars 367m loss
after tax for the first nine months, against a Dollars 326.2m deficit at the
same stage in 1992. Nine-month revenues stand at Dollars 8.87bn, compared
with Dollars 8.01bn.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Higher US gas prices offset
lower revenues at Texaco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER US prices for crude and natural gas contributed to surprisingly
strong first-quarter earnings from Texaco, the US energy group, in spite of
lower revenues. The company also benefited from improved product margins in
Latin America and cost-cutting.
Excluding charges of Dollars 300m for accounting changes last year,
first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars 278m, or 97 cents a
share, from Dollars 232m, or 80 cents. The company reported a net loss of
Dollars 68m, or 36 cents, in the 1992 quarter, including the charges.
Revenues slipped to Dollars 8.5bn in the first three months of 1993, from
Dollars 8.6bn the previous year.
On Wall Street, shares in Texaco firmed Dollars  3/4 to stand at Dollars 63
5/8 at the close.
Mr Alfred DeCrane, who recently replaced Mr James Kinnear as chief
executive, said: 'Texaco has been able to contain its costs and expenses and
maintain its operational competitiveness through improvements in its
business processes.'
Higher prices for crude oil and natural gas, and lower operating expenses,
helped Texaco's operating earnings from domestic exploration and production
soar to Dollars 133m, from Dollars 86m a year ago.
Earnings from US manufacturing and marketing fell to Dollars 53m, from
Dollars 78m last year, reflecting a glut of supply which depressed refinery
margins on the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast. In contrast, Texaco's
west coast operations had improved margins.
International exploration and production profits slipped to Dollars 79m in
the 1993 quarter, from Dollars 102m. Last year's earnings benefited from
currency gains of Dollars 29m from lower UK deferred taxes.
Stronger margins in Latin America and the Caltex operating area lifted
Texaco's international manufacturing and marketing earnings to Dollars 123m
from Dollars 81m.
Texaco's petrochemical operations lost Dollars 7m in the 1993 quarter,
compared with earnings of Dollars 8m a year earlier.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica income up 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKAMERICA Corporation, which last year completed its takeover of the
troubled Security Pacific bank, yesterday reported a 60 per cent jump in its
first-quarter 1993 net income, to Dollars 484m, or Dollars 1.19 per share.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, said the results reflected the continuing
effects of weakness in the California economy and other key markets.
'These economic weaknesses remain a source of concern. However, improvements
in the more controllable aspects of our business, such as expenses and
credit quality, have helped to mitigate the effects of the soft economy,' he
explained.
The bank underscored the fact that its non-performing assets and the size of
assets to be disposed of declined during the first three months of 1993.
Non-performing assets declined by Dollars 205m in the quarter. Assets
pending disposal declined by Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 2.59bn.
Net credit losses in the quarter were Dollars 303m, down from Dollars 501m
in the fourth quarter of 1992, but higher than the Dollars 219m of the first
quarter of last year. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 235m, against Dollars
230m a year ago.
Net interest income for the quarter was Dollars 1.843bn, down by 5 per cent
from the last quarter of 1992, but much improved on the Dollars 1.231bn of a
year ago - before the merger with Security Pacific.
Non-interest income was Dollars 1.089bn in the quarter, 8 per cent higher
than the previous quarter and nearly twice the Dollars 596m of a year ago.
BankAmerica's shares closed was Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 48 1/2 in New
York.
Bank of Boston reported a first-quarter Dollars 67m net profit, against
Dollars 57m. Non-performing assets were Dollars 597m, down 53 per cent on
last year.

earnings beat forecast

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Caterpillar, the construction equipment group, soared yesterday
after it reported higher-than-expected first quarter earnings.
The company made Dollars 34m, or 34 cents a share, compared with a loss
before special accounting items of Dollars 132m, or Dollars 1.31 a share, in
the same period of last year when the business was hit by a combination of
US recession and a bitter employees' strike.
The strong performance was due mainly to a 44 per cent increase in group
sales in the US market as dealers built up inventory in expectations of
higher 1993 sales.
Caterpillar shares closed at a 52-week high of Dollars 67 5/8 , up Dollars 5
3/8 , on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said other factors behind the improvement included im-proved
margins from better prices and lower cost levels.
Sales and revenues in the quarter totalled Dollars 2.7bn, up Dollars 514m,
or 24 per cent, from last year.
The company said physical sales volume of machinery and engines rose 19 per
cent in the quarter, particularly in the US, due to both the inventory
build-up and poor sales volume last year because of the strike and low
customer demand.
Sales outside the US totalled Dollars 1.24bn, 8 per cent higher than the
same period of last year, despite the recession in continental Europe and
Japan. Caterpillar said that economic recovery had begun in the UK and its
sales there were now above the levels of a year ago.
The company said it had revised upward its 1993 economic forecast for the
US, but the outlook for Europe had deteriorated, with virtually no real
growth expected.
It forecast that worldwide company sales would improve moderately in 1993,
with a higher percentage of US sales than previously expect-ed.
Caterpillar said its results would be highly dependent on the strength of
growth in the US, the severity of recession in Europe and economic and
political conditions in Brazil where it has large operations.

AMERICAN Express, the US travel and financial services group that has been
buffeted by management upheavals and losses in its credit card business,
yesterday disclosed Dollars 243m, or 48 cents per share, of net income for
the first quarter of 1993, down from Dollars 274m in the same quarter of
1992.
The Shearson Lehman Brothers subsidiary, part of which is being sold to Mr
Sandy Weill's Primerica financial services group, suffered a net loss of
Dollars 451m in the quarter, compared with a Dollars 71m profit a year ago.
Revenues were 14.4 per cent higher at Dollars 2.27bn.
The Lehman Brothers investment banking portion of SLB - which will remain
part of American Express for the time being - had net income of Dollars
54.5m in the quarter, up from Dollars 26.9m a year ago.
American Express said net profit was struck after taking a Dollars 630m
write-off on its pending sale of the Shearson Lehman Brothers retail and
asset management businesses plus a reserve provision of Dollars 100m related
to non-core businesses and gains on asset disposals. These gains included
Dollars 165m on the sale of the Boston Company and Dollars 433m on reduction
of ownership of the First Data Corporation subsidiary.
The core travel related services division had 68 per cent better
first-quarter net income of Dollars 211m. TRS revenues declined by 5.6 per
cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.34bn, largely due to discount rate
reductions, the sale of certain insurance lines and a decline in
international volumes.
The IDS financial services division had Dollars 74m of net income, up by 21
per cent. Revenues were 7.5 per cent higher at Dollars 742m.
The American Express Bank had Dollars 15m of first-quarter net income, down
from Dollars 17.7m a year ago. Revenues declined by 11.3 per cent to Dollars
294.8m.
American Express said its net income before gains on asset sales and
accounting changes was Dollars 375m, up from Dollars 249m a year ago.
On Wall Street, American Express shares was down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 28
1/8.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Allied Signal lifted by
productivity gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALLIED Signal, the high-technology group which has enjoyed strong earnings
growth since the arrival of a new chairman in 1991, yesterday reported a 22
per cent rise in first-quarter net income, helped by strong productivity
gains.
The group made Dollars 149m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, compared with Dollars
122m, or 87 cents, on a like-for-like basis in the same period of 1992, when
it took an accounting charge leading to a Dollars 1.1bn net loss.
Sales dipped 2.6 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn.
Mr Lawrence Bossidy, chairman, said: 'Despite first-quarter weakness
throughout the aerospace industry and severe recession in Europe, operating
margin expanded to 8.2 per cent from 6.1 per cent, while return on equity
remained about 26 per cent'.
He added that the gains were driven primarily by a 5.7 per cent increase in
productivity.
The engineered materials business saw net income rise 37 per cent, to
Dollars 67m, on sales which were 10 per cent higher than the previous year.
Automotive income was up 35 per cent at Dollars 42m on marginally higher
sales, with lower European revenues more than offset by North America.
Aerospace net income rose 9 per cent to Dollars 49m despite an 11 per cent
drop in sales.

INCO (Indonesia), which is majority-owned by Inco, the Canadian mining
company, yesterday announced a 31 per cent fall in net profits to USDollars
5.42m for the first quarter compared with the year-earlier, period, writes
William Keeling in Jakarta.
The company's mine in Sulawesi is among the world's lowest-cost producers,
and the results underscore the effect of low nickel prices on producers'
bottom lines.
While Inco (Indonesia) announced a fall in year-on-year first-quarter sales
to Dollars 39.95m from Dollars 41.41m, no figures were released for
production or sales volumes, or for actual realised price of nickel in the
first three months.
'From quarter to quarter, results can be delayed due to shipping schedules.
Until we get the full breakdown of figures, it's difficult to judge the
company's performance,' noted one foreign broker.

<TEXT>
COMINCO, the Canadian mining, metals and fertilisers group, posted a loss of
CDollars 36.8m (USDollars 29.2m), or 47 cents a share, for the first quarter
because of poor prices.
This compared with a loss of CDollars 4.9m, or 7 cents, in the
correspondingquar-ter of 1992. Sales were CDollars 291.5m, against CDollars
329m a year earlier.
The lower Canadian dollar only partly offset sharply lower base metal
prices, Cominco said. Mining and integrated metals operations showed an
operating loss of CDollars 22.2m, compared with an operating profit of
CDollars 6m, on sales of CDollars 227m, against CDollars 256m.
The Red Dog mine in Alaska continued to show losses, as did the Sullivan
mine and Trail smelting operations in British Columbia.
Fertiliser profits slipped to CDollars 5.9m, and sales were lower because of
poor weather in the US market.
The Quebrada copper project in northern Chile is now in full construction
with a workforce of 2,000 at the site. Inco is responding to lower nickel
prices by driving costs down further and may cut back production again later
this year, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, told the annual meeting in Toronto.
'Russian nickel exports overhang the market like a cloud,' he said.
Inco is looking to offshore laterite deposits for future expansion, because
they can be mined by open-pit methods and show lower costs.
Stelco, Canada's second-biggest steelmaker, lost CDollars 38m, or 51 cents a
share,in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 32m, or 45 cents, a
year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 575m.
Rio Algom's first-quarter profit jumped 43 per cent to CDollars 7m, or 15
cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 258m, up 8 per cent. The gain came
from growth in metals distribution.

SARA LEE, the Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday reported a
10.8 per cent increase in after-tax profits, to Dollars 152m, in the third
quarter to March 27. The improvement came on sales 5.2 per cent higher, at
Dollars 3.3bn.
The company said it saw 'continued margin improvement in packaged foods'.
However, on the personal products side, strong performance in the US was
offset by weakness in Europe, and operating profits from this division
slipped 2.9 per cent, to Dollars 127m.
The group is showing net profit of Dollars 514m for the first nine months on
sales of Dollars 10.7bn. Earnings per share for the quarter were 30 cents,
against 27 cents a year ago. The nine-month figure is Dollars 1.

DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, reported unexpected losses
for the second quarter as its struggle to achieve sustained profitability
faltered, despite increased sales of its new open systems products.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 7.6m, or 22 cents per share,
compared with losses of Dollars 55.3m, or Dollars 1.69, in the same period
last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 48m.
Revenues were Dollars 267.4m, against Dollars 273.8m. The company said that,
without the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, revenue
would have been slightly higher than last year.
'We are not satisfied with the overall results, primarily in the revenue
area,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, 'but we are
encouraged by the continued success of our open systems computers.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORLAND International and WordPerfect, two of the leading suppliers of
software for personal computers, have formed a strategic alliance to compete
more effectively against Microsoft, the world's largest software company.
The two companies will share technology and other resources but have no
plans to merge, they said.
Initially, Borland and WordPerfect will collaborate in research and
development and jointly support standards for accessing data on different
types of computers. They will also co-ordinate marketing, sales and support
programmes.
Financial terms of the agreement between Borland and WordPerfect were not
revealed. The companies said, however, that it did not include equity
investment by either company.
Next month, Borland will launch the first product resulting from the
alliance, Borland Office for Windows, an integrated software package
combining WordPerfect's popular word-processing program with Borland's
spreadsheet and database programs.
This product will be available only in North America at first, where it will
cost Dollars 595, less than half the price of the three programs that it
combines.
Borland Office will compete with similar 'suites' of application programs
from Microsoft and Lotus Development. According to International Data, a
market research group, Microsoft sold 700,000 suite packages in 1992, and
Lotus 100,000.
However, neither offer a 'suite' package containing a database management
program.
Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, unveiled a
sharp drop in earnings on flat revenues for its first quarter.
Net income was Dollars 12.3m, or 29 cents per share, a 41 per cent decline
on income of Dollars 20.8m, or 47 cents, last year. Revenues of Dollars 227m
equalled those of the first quarter a year ago.

<TEXT>
UNITED Technologies, the US high-technology company, reported a 32 per cent
drop in first-quarter like-for-like net income, due to plunging profits at
its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine division, which has been hit hard by the
problems of the world airline industry.
UTC reported net income of Dollars 64m, or 42 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 94m, or 68 cents, in the same period of last year before the impact
of a 1992 accounting change. Revenues totalled Dollars 4.9bn, down from
Dollars 5.2bn.
Pratt's earnings totalled Dollars 13m, down from Dollars 151m for the same
period of last year, while its revenues were Dollars 1.4bn, compared with
Dollars 1.8bn.
This more than offset improved performances in other businesses. Flight
systems reported income of Dollars 82m, up from Dollars 40m, due to improved
deliveries of Sikorsky helicopters. Otis elevator made Dollars 94m, up from
Dollars 80m, and automotive parts Dollars 37m, up from Dollars 13m.
The drop in Pratt's sales and earnings was due to lower engine shipments and
sharply reduced spare part sales. Spares are among the most lucrative parts
of the aero-engine business, but during downturns airlines cut back on the
size of their fleets and spares inventories.
The company said commercial spare part sales in the quarter averaged Dollars
94m a month, down from Dollars 154m a month in the same period of last year.
However, after two exceptionally low quarters for orders at the end of 1992,
spares orders had improved in the latest quarter.
Cigna, the Philadelphia-based composite insurer, is reorganising its
property-casualty operations into three business units, in an effort to
become a 'specialist' company, AP-DJ reports.
The reorganisation, which takes effect immediately, will create divisions
focusing on large risks, standard commercial business and special markets
respectively.
Transamerica, the US financial services group which last week sold its
property and casualty insurance unit to the public for Dollars 1bn, reported
first-quarter net income of Dollars 91.8m, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
A year ago, the group recorded net income of Dollars 83.6m, although that
included Dollars 12.5m from the discontinued insurance operations.
Transamerica's remaining life insurance business, which posted a 19 per cent
increase in income to Dollars 51.8m, made the biggest contribution to group
earnings.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Peugeot down 39% to FFr3.37bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSA PEUGEOT-CITROEN, the French car group, yesterday reported a 39 per cent
fall in profits to FFr3.37bn (Dollars 608m) last year, down from FFr5.5bn
the year before.
Mr Jacques Calvet, the group president, said the prospects for European
sales this year were 'detestable', with a likely overall drop of at least 10
per cent over last year.
The first quarter had shown a 17 per cent decline, and April seemed no
better, he said.
Weaker demand had led to a 3 per cent decline in Peugeot's sales to 2m cars,
producing a turnover figure of FFr155.4bn and squeezed operating margins.
But the Peugeot group had held on to its position of number three in the
European market, behind Volkswagen and General Motors. Mr Calvet says it
remains one of the most profitable carmakers.
But competitive conditions on the European market would worsen further this
year, Mr Calvet said, due to over-capacity among producers, the drop in
demand and 'the successive surrenders' to Japan by the European Commission.
Japanese carmakers were not abiding by the terms of their 1991
'pseudo-accord' with Brussels to share with their European competitors the
burden of any fall in the EC market, said Mr Calvet, who congratulated the
new French government for taking up this matter in Brussels.
Peugeot's results had not suffered from the franc's effective appreciation
by 8 to 9 per cent against other European currencies since last summer,
because it had always hedged its currency risks, Mr Calvet said. But he
called on European carmakers 'to compensate speedily' for devaluations in
the UK, Italy and Spain 'by significant price increases in these three
countries' to maintain profit margins.
Reflecting the reduction in its cash-flow from FFr15.5bn in 1991 to
FFr13.7bn last year, the Peugeot group scaled down its investment by roughly
the same amount, as well as shedding another 6,000 workers.
Peugeot yesterday an-nounced a dividend of FFr10 against FFr13.

<TEXT>
ROCHE, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals group, said sales in the
first quarter were up 7 per cent to SFr3.5bn (Dollars 2.39bn), almost in
line with the growth level in the second half of last year.
Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, said the result indicated that 'barring
exceptional developments, 1993 will be another successful year for the
group'.
Speaking at the group's annual press conference in Basle, Mr Gerber said
Roche's 29 per cent rise in net income last year to SFr1.9bn was helped by
improved control of operating costs, which rose only 8.7 per cent.
Income from the group's SFr12.1bn liquid assets soared 51 per cent last year
to SFr1.3bn. Net financial income was SFr663m, accounting for a little over
one-third of total net income.
Roche does not yet provide a sectoral breakdown of profits, but officials
indicated that the diagnostics division, which has been a chronic lossmaker,
broke even, and the vitamins and fine chemicals division improved its
performance.
Mr Gerber said German healthcare reforms had caused a 20 per cent slump in
the country's pharmaceutical market in the first quarter, but said Roche's
share of that market fell only 10 per cent.
In the first quarter of this year, pharmaceutical sales rose 10 per cent to
SFr1.9bn while sales of the vitamins and fine chemical division gained only
3 per cent to SFr795m. Diagnostic sales were up 7 per cent to SFr418m and
fragrances and flavours sales up 2 per cent to SFr372m.
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, said it had a
'thoroughly pleasing result' in the first quarter.
'The results of both the parent and the group were substantially above the
previous year's pre-tax result,' it said. No figures were given.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg denies financial
difficulties

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and industrial group, fell sharply
yesterday for the second day in succession as investors reacted to reports,
strongly denied by the company, that it was facing acute financial
difficulties.
Trelleborg 'B' stock, the most traded shares, fell by SKr4 over the day to
close at SKr49.50, having at one point dipped to SKr47.50. The shares have
lost more than 12 per cent of their value since Tuesday, when the B stock
closed at Skr56.50.
Trelleborg issued a strongly-worded denial of a front page story in
yesterday's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper which alleged that it was
negotiating with its bankers, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, over
its debts following problems meeting its interest payments.
The company, which is struggling to recover from heavy losses in 1992,
described the report, and similar rumours in the stock market, as a lie. 'We
have not been in any discussions with our banks about our loans or their
terms,' a spokesman said.
Trelleborg was hit hard last year by recession in its domestic and
international markets, falling metal prices and a foreign currency loss of
SKr765m as a result of the devaluation of the Swedish krona. It scrapped its
1992 dividend after reporting a SKr1.6bn (Dollars 215m) loss after financial
items.
Yesterday, it blamed speculators for manipulating its stock price to make
gains on options due for redemption in June. It said it had several times
been the victim of similar speculative dips in its share price in recent
months. In February, it weathered a wave of rumours ranging from reports
that it had exhausted its capital to speculation that Mr Kjell Nilsson,
chief executive, was ill.
But analysts said investors were not convinced that the latest reports were
baseless and were worried that Trelleborg had cash-flow problems that were
prompting concern by the banks. One said Trelleborg shares were not yet on a
crisis valuation. 'If there really is a problem, there is more downside to
come,' said one.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Z-Landerbank struggles to
Sch508m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria eked out a net income of Sch508m (Dollars 45m)
last year, but only after extraordinary gains on asset sales covered bad
debt provisions of Sch6.3bn.
However, in its first full year of operations since the merger of the
Zentralsparkasse group of Viennese savings banks and Osterreichische
Landerbank in the autumn of 1991, Austria's largest bank made considerable
progress towards cutting costs and improving margins.
Net interest income rose 3.5 per cent to Sch10.9bn, as the bank benefited
from falling interest rates and, later in the year, greater spreads.
Commissions were up 9.3 per cent to Sch2.5bn.
Operating profit was up 1.2 per cent to Sch3.4bn and bank officials
indicated that nearly half came in the fourth quarter.
Total assets grew 5.8 per cent to Sch544.9bn. Capital rose 9.2 per cent to
Sch27.8bn, providing a BIS ratio of 9.3 per cent.
The directors are recommending that the dividend for 1992 be cut from 14 per
cent to 10 per cent.
Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, said its pre-tax
profit surged 46 per cent in the first quarter to Sch1.15bn, due mainly to
booming securities trading.

CREDIT AGRICOLE, the French farmers' co-operative bank, defied the trend of
its competitors by yesterday announcing a 6 per cent increase in net profit
to FFr5.2bn (Dollars 959m) last year.
With FFr1,560bn deposits, or 20 per cent of the total in France at the end
of last year, Credit Agricole confirmed its leading position.
Increased profits came from an 8.2 per cent rise in net banking income and
only a 4.2 per cent rise in general costs.
Credit Agricole is still the provider of 80 per cent of all bank loans to
France's farmers.
Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceutical group controlled by Hoechst of
Germany, has reported pre-tax profits of FFr357m, up from FFr123m for the
first three months to 31 March, writes Paul Abrahams in London.
The results were achieved on turnover of FFr3.992bn against FFr3.806bn for
the same period last year. Cash-flow increased from FFr264m to FFr286m.

FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Axa posts decline of 35% in
group profits for year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AXA, the French insurance company, yesterday announced a 35 per cent fall in
group profits for the year and expressed confidence about the future
profitability of its investment in The Equitable of the US.
Mr Claude Bebear, Axa president, said the chief reason for the group's 35
per cent fall in profit to FFr1.54bn (Dollars 284m) last year from FFr2.38bn
was the drop in capital gains from asset sales, due to poor market
conditions.
Axa has set a net dividend of FFr23, up from FFr22.
Mr Bebear said the group had some FFr16bn cash in hand.
This might be spent on new acquisitions, he said, but not necessarily in
buying into the three big French state-owned insurers which are on the
newly-elected Balladur government's privatisation list.
He indicated that Axa's gaze was more international, either towards Mexico,
soon to be integrated into the North American market, or in south-east Asia,
where 'the entry ticket is cheap' for a market which in a decade or two
could be the world's biggest.
Axa's French rivals have snapped up most takeover candidates in Germany, and
therefore Axa is now contemplating selling non-life insurance to Germans
directly from France.
Mr Bebear predicted that after last year, in which the US insurance company
produced a FFr77m (Dollars 14m) loss for Axa, 'the evolution of Equitable
will be positive' this year with the cutting of costs and development of new
products.
But he refrained from forecasting when The Equitable, which is America's
fourth-largest life insurer and makes Axa the world's fourth-biggest fund
manager, would be back in profit.
Axa made a Dollars 1bn investment in The Equitable, which bought it a 49 per
cent stake in the US insurer when The Equitable demutualised last year.
This week Axa maintained its stake in The Equitable by buying 49 per cent of
an Dollars 800m convertible bond issue by the US group.
The purchase was made out of the proceeds of Axa's own FFr3.65bn convertible
bond issue in February.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Low ahead as margins improve - Despite
24% rise, shares fall 17p on worries about competition from discount stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer, yesterday announced a sharp rise in
interim profits and said it had restored its margins from the disappointing
levels of a year ago.
Pre-tax profits increased 24 per cent, from Pounds 8.82m to Pounds 10.9m, in
the 28 weeks to March 20.
The increase reversed the first half decline last year, which was blamed on
lower gross margins and rising branch costs.
Despite the increase, the shares fell 17p to 209p on worries about
competition from discount stores and rising costs. Mr Philip Spicer, who
took over as chief executive last year, said both fears had been overdone.
'Competition is competition, but you've got to fight it. Our stores are
trading extremely well,' he said.
Turnover increased by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 240m. Most of the increase was
due to new store openings, although like-for-like sales increased by 1.5 per
cent.
Operating profits improved 31 per cent to Pounds 11.6m, raising operating
margins nearly 1 percentage point to 4.8 per cent.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 19m and is expected to total Pounds 41m
(Pounds 44.3m) for the full year.
Net borrowings at the period end stood at Pounds 52.9m, compared with the
year end figure of Pounds 37.9m. Mr Spicer said that, with the company's
expenditure programme peaking this year, gearing would end the year at its
present level of 33 per cent.
Some Pounds 1.39m of interest costs on property developments were
capitalised.
Fully diluted earnings increased by 19.7 per cent to 12.01p (10.03p) per
share.
However, the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.7p.
COMMENT
After last year's damaging interim performance, Wm Low must have hoped
yesterday's figures would silence its sceptics. The share price fall
suggests otherwise, and there are now fears for the second half outlook for
margins. Some of the worries - the impact of discount retailers, for example
 -may have been overdone. But Wm Low's older stores remain vulnerable and,
with companies like Sainsbury and Kwik Save expanding in Scotland, the stock
market has plenty to twitch about in the longer term. Full year profits of
Pounds 22.5m put the shares on a multiple of 8, a discount to the sector.
Although yesterday's selling may have been excessive, concerns about the
company's size and store portfolio will keep a lid on its rating.

Over the 12 months to February 28 1993, net asset value of Abtrust New
European Investment Trust was unchanged at 77.5p. In February the portfolio
was refocused to replicate the FT-SE Eurotrak 100 Index. Since then the
underlying portfolio had matched the performance of that index.
The asset value included unlisted investments.
Total income in 1992-93 came to Pounds 735,000 (Pounds 717,000). Earnings
per share worked through at 0.53p (0.48p). The dividend is maintained at

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alexander Proudfoot halved to Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDER Proudfoot, the management consultant which saw its shares collapse
last year on trading and management worries, yesterday announced profits
down by nearly 50 per cent due to recession and one-off costs.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 25.2m in the year to
December 31. At the interim stage profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds
12m; Proudfoot said then that the full year dividend would be maintained,
but yesterday it changed its mind and recommended a cut in the final from
13.5p to 6p, reducing the total to 12p (19.5p), payable from earnings of
18.2p (51.6p) per share.
Mr John Prosser, who was appointed group chief executive last year after a
management shake-up, said the dividend cut reflected the company's caution.
'Trading conditions will continue to be difficult in 1993,' he said.
Turnover was Pounds 172.4m (Pounds 176.4m), including a full year's
contribution from Indevo, the Swedish consultant acquired in 1991. Excluding
Indevo, turnover fell 6 per cent to Pounds 158m.
Indevo has continued to lose money, and Proudfoot has decided to close the
company down. This will lead to an exceptional charge this year of about
Pounds 17m, reflecting closure costs of Pounds 1.8m and goodwill write-offs
of Pounds 15.2m.
Management reorganisation costs totalled Pounds 3m. A previously announced
provision of Pounds 6m to cover unpaid overseas tax has been reduced to
Pounds 2.3m.
Losses in Scandinavia led to an increased tax charge of 54 per cent (36 per
cent).
After several senior management departures last year, three more directors -
including former finance director Mr Neil Hamilton - announced they will
stand down at the annual meeting due next month. Mr David Gill will join the
company as finance director from Avis Europe. Mr Prosser said Lord Stevens
would stay on as chairman.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Management team to take over French radio
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by management and including Hambros Bank is set to take
over FRM, the French radio network whose losses brought down Crown
Communications, the UK broadcasting group.
Crown went into receivership in January with debts of Pounds 16m.
Its main asset, London Broadcasting Company, floated clear and effective
control passed to Chelverton Investments, whose main shareholders are Mr
Matthew Cartisser and Mr John Porter.
The CSA, the French regulatory authority, has chosen the management team led
by Mr Andrew Manderstam, who has been running the network since Crown took
control in 1989, as the most appropriate owners.
Two other bids were rejected: one from Mr Albert Cohen's Nostalgie and the
other from NRJ, the radio network which has been trying to buy FRM from some
time.
The decision by the CSA to block a sale by Crown to NRJ triggerred the
receivership of the British company that once was the darling of the
Unlisted Securities Market.
The Manderstam-led consortium, backed by Hambros European Ventures, is
expected to make an offer for Crown's stake in FRM.
Arthur Andersen, Crown's receivers, will try to get as much as possible for
the stake.
The radio network links 114 stations and goes under the slogan: 'Tous les
tops, toute la Pop, sans les flops' (all the tops, all the hits and none of
the flops.)
Throughout the drama FRM has remained on the air.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Brasway acquires hose maker for up to
Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRASWAY has purchased Winster Hose for a maximum Pounds 2.6m cash, including
repayment of external debt, following its recent withdrawal from the tube
industry through the sale of a subsidiary for Pounds 3.4m.
With the announcement Brasway said that its pre-tax profit for the year to
May 1 would only reach break even before exceptional items, including the
profit on the sale of Brasway Tube. In 1991-92 profit was Pounds 1.25m.
The effects of inconsistent demand and increasing pressure on margins had
'far outweighed' savings achieved from cost reductions, directors explained.
At mid-term the profit had plunged to Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 708,000).
The purchase is part of the strategy to develop the higher added value
Europower business. Winster makes hoses, couplings and assemblies for the
mining, agriculture and construction industries.
In the year to June 30 1992 it made an operating profit of Pounds 42,000 on
sales of nearly Pounds 11m, but a pre-tax loss of Pounds 234,000.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed stages recovery to Pounds 1.22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed enfran-chisement of Austin Reed's non-voting shares
overshadowed results yesterday which showed a recovery in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 810,000 to Pounds 1.22m over the year to January 31 after a loss
at the interim stage of Pounds 430,000.
The group, chaired by Mr Barry Reed, saw sales from continuing businesses
little changed at Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 58.6m), though in total there was a
fall from Pounds 65.8m.
The profit recovery was after a fall in interest charges to Pounds 1.65m
(Pounds 2.44m) and the absence of an exceptional charge (Pounds 633,000).
But profits in the comparable period included an unquantified contribution
from businesses sold.
A maintained final dividend of 3p is proposed, for a total of 5p (6p).
Earnings per share were 3p (0.7p).
Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said the dividend decision signalled the
board was sufficiently encouraged by an improvement in trading to pay an
uncovered dividend. He said the spring season had started better.
The proposal to enfranchise the 90.5 per cent of shares which do not have
votes will be put to the annual meeting in June. Holders of voting shares
will be offered a 1-for-1 scrip in compensation, effectively doubling their
dividend entitlement. However, they will have only 17.3 per cent of the
votes in the enlarged share capital.
Mr Thomson said the proposal had been entirely at the company's instance and
did not result from pressure from shareholders. While the group is not
planning a rights issue, moving to a unified share structure would help the
company to take opportunities.
He said Austin Reed had worked hard to get the balance sheet into shape, had
cut costs and sold non-core businesses. It had come through recession and
had a new chief executive. Now it had the infrastructure to cope with more
activity than it could grow organically, and bolt-on acquisitions or
partnerships could be in prospect.
The balance sheet showed net debt down from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 8.3m.
However, a reduction in property values from Pounds 29m to Pounds 17m, and a
transfer from reserves of Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 1.5m) cut shareholders
funds to Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 53.2m) leaving gearing little changed at 20.4
per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Regent Inns set for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGENT INNS, which operates 38 public houses in London and the home
counties, yesterday announced plans for a full stock market listing.
It is raising Pounds 6.16m in a share placing and open offer, giving it a
market capitalisation of Pounds 19.8m.
Mr David Franks, managing director, will retain a 15.9 per cent stake in the
company, worth Pounds 3.15m at the issue price of 135p a share.
A chartered accountant, Mr Franks invested Pounds 20,000 in his first pub in
1977. When that was sold three years later he used the proceeds to acquire
Regent Inns, which then had six outlets. He expanded the company to 17 pubs
before merging it with Lockton Inns, a BES company in 1988.
The group, which has developed a diverse rather than themed estate, aims to
expand to about 80 outlets over the next five years.
It has increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 512,000 in 1990 to Pounds
974,000 last year and is forecasting not less than Pounds 1.31m for the
current year to July 3.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Liberty declines to Pounds 3.66m and chief
divides roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERTY, the retail and wholesale group, yesterday reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 3.66m in the year to January 30.
However, the recommended final dividend is maintained at 5.35p to give an
unchanged total of 7.2p.
Mr Harry Weblin is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive,
handing on the latter job to Mr Patrick Austen. He will start work on May 1,
coming from BTR where he ran the consumer products business.
Liberty came under pressure last year from a South African investor group,
headed by Mr Brian Myerson, which holds 15.77 per cent of the voting shares.
Mr Weblin said the appointment of a chief executive had taken account of
last year's events, but was mainly because he was 63 and approaching
retirement. Two non-executives were appointed recently.
Mr John Pugh, the finance director, said that since an extraordinary meeting
last summer, at which Mr Myerson called for changes to the board and the
enfranchisement of non-voting shares, he had become a 'constructive
shareholder'.
Mr Myerson said he supported the appointments made. He said the question of
enfranchisement would be raised at the annual meeting next month. Mr Pugh
said that under 30 per cent of Liberty's shares were non-voting. 'Our voting
holders own the company as well as control it.'
Trading conditions had been bleak in 1992, Mr Weblin said, but the outlook
for 1993 was better. Wholesale operations were being affected by recession
in export markets, such as France, and so far in 1993 wholesale sales were
running below last year's levels. Retail sales were ahead, especially in the
London store.
In 1992-93 group sales were slightly lower at Pounds 82.4m (Pounds 84.9m)
mainly because of a 20 per cent drop in converting and wholesaling sales to
Pounds 18.1m.
Trading profits fell 38 per cent to Pounds 3.94m. However, the interest
charge was lower at Pounds 283,000, against Pounds 696,000. A higher tax
rate cut earnings per share by 56 per cent to 9.05p (20.77p), still covering
the dividend.

<TEXT>
SUNTORY, the Japanese drinks and drugs group, is to invest Dollars 15m
(Pounds 9.9m) in a research and development collaboration with Xenova, the
UK biotechnology company.
The agreement, which involves Suntory paying Dollars 12m in fees and buying
Dollars 3m worth of Xenova shares, is to develop drugs for
immune-inflammatory diseases - particularly rheumatoid arthritis. Xenova has

and Genentech, Genzyme and Warner-Lambert of the US.
The basis of Xenova's work is its collection of fungi and bacteria - now
containing 24,000 species - combined with its proprietary drug screening
technology. The company has raised Pounds 39m from investors since its
formation in 1987.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Smiths Inds continuing to reduce activities
in avionics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS Industries is continuing to cut its traditional core activity of
supplying avionics and components for civil and military aircraft. The
company is currently earning more profits from medical products than
aerospace.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said he expected civil aviation
to recover in the second half of the decade, but could not predict when.
Smiths has accordingly continued to reduce its aerospace workforce, cutting
200 jobs in both the UK and the US in the six months to January 30. This
leaves the total workforce at 6,000, split equally between both countries.
The company, which this week reported a decline in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 40.3m, spent Pounds 122m on acquisitions outside
aerospace.
The pre-tax figure was depressed by a Pounds 3m provision to cover an
unsuccessful investment in a device for measuring blood pressure.
Mr Hurn said: 'All parts of the company have shown a resilient performance
in this first half, and we expect to achieve steady progress in the
remainder of the year and beyond.'
The aerospace division's trading profits fell from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds
13.9m, on sales down from Pounds 184m to Pounds 175m.
The downturn was offset partly by the rapidly expanding medical systems
division.
This area increased trading profits from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 16.1m on
turnover which advanced from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 84.8m.
Industrial, the group's third division, increased trading profits from
Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.6m in spite of being exposed to the worst effects of
the recession. Sales increased from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 68.4m.
The division's ducting companies, in particular Flexible Technologies, the
US acquisition now in its second year with the group, had performed well.
Smiths also said that Vent-Axia, the fans and hand driers maker bought for
Pounds 56m in December, had proved a natural fit.
In medical systems, Smiths paid Pounds 16m for HG Wallace of Colchester in
July and Pounds 66m for Intertech Resources of Florida in October.
Both companies manufacture single-use products, mainly in the field of
anaesthesia and respiratory products, and have been integrated with the
existing businesses.
Mr Hurn said he would be willing to borrow to make further acquisitions if
the right opportunities arose.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum threatens liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Aberdeen Petroleum yesterday threatened to liquidate the
company and distribute proceeds to shareholders if they failed to secure a
higher bid than the current offer from Pittencrieff.
USM-quoted Aberdeen said it had received proposals, subject to contract, to
purchase all of its oil and gas assets.
Responding to the offer document from the acquisitive natural resources and
communications company, Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen managing director, said:
'The offer is cheap and Pittencrieff clearly must reconsider its position.
We shall continue to solicit a superior offer.'
He thought liquidation would give shareholders cash of more than 18p per
share. The 15.2p per share offer from Pittencrieff did not fairly value its
assets, which Aberdeen said had a realisable value above 20p per share.
Pittencrieff holds 26.6 per cent of its target, shares in which closed
unchanged at 15 3/4 p. Pittencrieff shares were unchanged at 373p.

LOSSES AT Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil
engineer Sir Robert McAlpine, were halved from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 21.5m
in the year to October 31.
Turnover fell to Pounds 267.8m (Pounds 463.6m). The loss was Pounds 11.8m
(Pounds 15.7m) to which was added provision for loss in partnership
development Pounds 5.56m (Pounds 25m), redundancy costs Pounds 2.99m (Pounds
2.13m), Australian restructuring costs Pounds 430,000 and exchange
differences Pounds 708,000.
Directors said the core business held up satisfactorily, returning a trading
profit before the exceptional costs of slimming down the organisation.
In the current year the group had obtained new contracts above targeted
expectation, with an increasing percentage of civil engineering work, and
was continuing to receive 'a healthy volume' of inquiries.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wembley deficit widens to Pounds 12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, owner of the north London stadium, fell further into losses last
year weighed down by the cost of its high debt and a stagnant market.
Pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 12m on sales up 13 per cent
at Pounds 191.4m. Losses per share fell from 7.9p to 5.9p after adjusting
for the bonus element of the rights issue in February last year.
The board is not recommending a final dividend and does not anticipate
making a payment until there is 'significant' improvement in profitability.
Wembley also revealed the identity of the investor group behind Orpington
Investments, which has appeared on the share register with an 11 per cent
stake after buying part of the 16 per cent stake owned by United Dutch.
The group is Rolaco Holdings, a Swiss-based company that has stakes in
companies like the Kempinski hotel group and Club Mediterranee.
United Dutch, once Wembley's largest shareholder, filed for bankruptcy
protection in the Netherlands in March.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said trading conditions had remained tough in
1992. The group would be re-focusing on the management of other
international venues.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 15.9m) as rates declined and
debt was repaid. But with Pounds 140m (Pounds 160m) of debt gearing is 80
per cent in spite of the rights issue.
Wembley also took a Pounds 13.4m exceptional charge for the costs of
restructuring and re-financing the bank debt. There were also Pounds 21.3m
of extraordinary charges relating to losses on sale of assets.
At the trading level profits grew 5 per cent to Pounds 15.8m. At the stadium
complex, profits rose to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.3m). Perimeter advertising in
the stadium fell, however, and the Arena held only 148 events compared with
180 in 1991. Greyhound racing profits fell to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 7.9m).
COMMENT
Nobody could ever accuse Sir Brian Wolfson of lacking enthusiasm.
Unfortunately, with the exception of the upgrading of the core stadium
complex, many of his group's ventures have been less than successful. Hence
gearing of 80 per cent and the current focus on asset disposals. It must
come as some relief, therefore, that Wembley's latest efforts focus on
leveraging the Wembley name by bidding to manage other people's stadiums -
an activity that should not require a great deal of capital. In the absence
of a really strong recovery in the UK, the area offers a dim but
nevertheless real ray of hope. The real question remains whether Wembley can
reduce its debt. For this it requires the sale of the US greyhound
operation, unfortunately dogged last year by an outbreak of kennel cough.
Without such sales, Wembley will remain a speculative play, caretaker of one
the UK's most recognisable assets but perilously close to the banks' problem
lists.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sprait seeking new strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVE &amp; PROSPER Return of Assets Investment Trust is asking shareholders for
approval to alter its investment strategy and change its name to the Fleming
Geared Income &amp; Assets Investment Trust.
Sprait was founded in 1984 to invest in fixed proportions of three unit
trusts, also managed by Save &amp; Prosper. It has a split capital structure,
with ordinary and participating preferred shares, and warrants.
The preferred shares initially paid a 7 per cent dividend, which will
increase by 0.7p per year until 1995. When the trust is wound up, sometime
between 2008 and 2010, the preferred shares will receive 100p, plus 10 per
cent of the growth in assets.
The nature of the preferred shares means that the return to ordinary
shareholders is highly geared to assets and dividend growth.
Things went well during the 1980s when assets and dividends achieved strong
growth. But in the 1990s recession, many companies have cut their dividends
and this has led the unit trusts in which Sprait invests to plan cuts in
their distributions.
The result will be a substantial cut in the earnings attributable to the
ordinary shares, with the managers estimating that earnings per share will
fall from 6.3p in the year to end May 1993 to 0.5p the following year.
However, the trust is unable to take any action to mitigate this problem
because of the fixed nature of the investment policy.
Accordingly, the board proposes that the trust should cease to invest in
unit trusts and should invest directly in equities. The board believes that
this change will give the trust flexibility, enhance prospects for capital
and dividend growth and reduce the expected fall in earnings per share.
The directors expect to maintain the total dividend on the ordinary shares
at 7.6p this year and, if the proposals are implemented, expect to pay a
dividend of 2p next year.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Clark's shareholders urged to reject Shoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company which has received a
takeover proposal from Berisford International, the property and food group,
were yesterday sent a letter from a group of shareholders urging serious
consideration of the bid.
The letter is from Mr Hugh Clark, Mr Michael Clark and Mr David Edwards, and
is in part a response to a letter from Shoes, a group of 'shareholders
opposed to enforced sale'. The three say that the acronym is misleading as
the sale depends on a vote of shareholders and is not 'enforced'.
It also condemns Shoes for recommending rejection of the bid without putting
forward 'a deliverable alternative'.
Shoes also published a letter yesterday strongly recommending shareholders
not to vote for the bid and promising a fuller letter next week containing
details of what it considers to be a viable alternative.
Shareholders will vote on the future ownership of Clark at an extraordinary
meeting on May 7. Before them will be a resolution to sell the company's
business and assets to Berisford.
If that is passed Berisford will make an offer worth 213p in cash, shares or
loan notes, and a further 26p of cash to be raised from the sale of surplus
properties. If the offer fails to win 90 per cent acceptances, Clark can
revert to the plan of selling the business to Berisford.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher shows advance to Pounds 25m -
Continuing pressure on UK margins following devaluation of sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Walls has become full-time executive chairman of Albert Fisher,
the food processing and distribution group.
The announcement accompanied the interim figures which disclosed a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 25m.
Mr Walls became non-executive chairman in July after the sudden departure of
Mr Tony Millar following a profits warning. Mr Millar built the company by
acquisition into one of the stock market stars of the eighties.
The profit covered the six months to February 28 and compared with a
restated Pounds 17m last time. The shares, which fell from 82p last May to a
low of 31p in August, yesterday dipped 2p to 69p.
Sales slipped from Pounds 608m to Pounds 599m. Mr Walls said: 'We have yet
to see any significant impact of an upturn in the UK economy on our markets,
with continuing pressure on margins following the devaluation of the pound.
'As we anticipated, the over supply of fresh produce has continued to
overhang the market in Europe which, when linked to the recession now
prevalent throughout Europe, continues to create very difficult marketing
conditions. However, the first signs of improvement in the North American
market are evident, particularly in our south-east region.'
The European fresh produce division suffered most, with operating profits
down from Pounds 7m to Pounds 942,000. German trading was hit by recession
and low banana prices. In the UK, an exceptional European apple crop
continued to overhang the market, while on the Continent the large Spanish
citrus crop and reduced demand led to severely depressed margins.
The apple glut also affected the European food processing division, which
saw operating profits fall from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 9.72m. The juice and
concentrates business of Mondi Foods suffered from the apple surplus and
fruit supply problems from eastern Europe.
The European seafood business was the group's star performer. An improved
harvest of cockles and mussels helped increase operating profits from Pounds
5.41m to Pounds 9.44m.
The North American fresh produce operations saw operating profit fall from
Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 5.08m. Although market conditions remained depressed
at the beginning of the period, with margins still under pressure, there
were first signs of recovery early this year.
The group also announced that it has sold Grossman, a US distributor of
paper and plastic disposable products, to the US distribution arm of Bunzl,
the UK paper company, for about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m).
Mr Walls said the group would continue to seek better synergy among its
activities, increase efficiency and strengthen its market position -
particularly in areas which offered higher margins than pure commodity
businesses.
Earnings per share increased from 1.19p to 2.66p. The interim dividend is
held at 1.85p.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hold Etam to 3%
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of defence costs helped Etam, the fashion retailer, to report a
3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended January 30.
Profits rose from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 10.9m on increased sales of Pounds
221m (Pounds 213m).
Last year Etam spent Pounds 1.2m on successfully repelling a 185p a share
bid from Oceana Investment Corporation of South Africa, which acquired a 34
per cent stake. Etam's shares yesterday rose 10p to 228p.
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.9m). Mr Keith Miles,
finance director, said: 'I hoped it could have been a better year but we are
only just coming out of the recession.'
Mr Miles criticised the decision of Oceana to show 34.4 per cent of the
company's profits as its own. 'They should not have equity accounted since
they have no influence on us whatsoever.'
Equity accounting requires a shareholder to have 'significant influence'
over the company in which it has a holding. Etam has refused Oceana's
request for boardroom representation.
Etam, which caters for women and girls, is getting out of its loss-making
mens' wear division which accounted for less than 5 per cent of sales. This
resulted in a Pounds 431,000 restructuring charge.
The loss on disposal of fixed assets, which included withdrawing from a shop
with high rent, was Pounds 752,000 (Pounds 552,000).
Capital expenditure increased to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 3.1m) while net assets
rose to Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 73.9m).
Earnings per share were 10.29p (9.42p). The proposed final dividend is
raised to 5.25p giving an increased total of 6.9p (6.6p).
COMMENT
Etam had taken the precaution of making sure its somewhat disappointing
results came as no surprise. The difficult second half led to higher
mark-downs, resulting in lower operating profits. The future looks more
promising. It has now taken a number of steps to improve the bottom line,
including closing the loss-making mens' wear operations and withdrawing from
a shop charging an exorbitant rent. With continuing uncertainty in South
Africa, Oceana is unlikely to sell its 34.4 per cent stake, which is just as
well for Etam since it would not want it sold to a UK predator. With the end
of the recession in sight the group is forecast to make full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 14.5m, giving earnings per share of 13.9p. The shares look
fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 16.2.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram attracts critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group, finally brought out its annual
report and accounts yesterday, with several more items under the 'notes to
the accounts' heading.
The document was read with particular interest by analysts, because the
group blamed its sharp fall in 1992 profits - the first setback since its
flotation in 1983 - on a change in accounting policies and pressure for a
conservative approach.
The report includes a proposal that Arthur Andersen be reappointed as
auditors on May 21.
The board had engaged in much haggling with the accountancy firm prior to
bringing out a pre-tax profit figure of Pounds 26.2m, a third less than
expected.
The extra work earned Andersen higher auditing fees of Pounds 170,000
(Pounds 140,000) and an additional Pounds 391,000 (Pounds 136,000) on
non-audit fees.
A few of the new notes, however, were criticised by analysts for not showing
100 per cent conservatism: for instance, the carrying forward of some
marketing and business development costs and the capitalising of interest on
some investment in fixed assets.
There was also quibbling over the group's claim to having year-end net cash
of Pounds 10m, because the figure excluded Pounds 4.74m owed in non-bank
loans and Pounds 6.52m in bills of exchange.
Mr Stuart Greenwood, the finance director who has resigned over accounting
controversies at the group but is carrying on until a replacement is found,
said these items were partly to do with tax and partly trade credit.
On the accounting policy questions, he commented: 'Some would say not
everything is conservative, but I think the accounts are substantially
prudent.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Institutions force management change at Alexon Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of Alexon Group's biggest institutional shareholders yesterday secured
the removal of the chairman and chief operating officers at the womenswear
retailer.
Mr Lawrence Snyder stepped down as chairman and Ms Ruth Henderson and Mr
Peter Ridsdale resigned as joint chief operating officers. The shares rose
6p to 89p.
The three executives were confronted with the demand for their resignation
48 hours earlier.
Mr John Sadler, a former finance director of the John Lewis Partnership was
appointed non-executive chairman and Mr John Osborn, a former director of
Sears took over as chief executive.
Gartmore Pension Fund Managers, Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and
Mercury Asset Management took the usual step of forcing a change of
management after last month's dismal results.
Alexon lost nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final
dividend. It had made an Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous year.
At its peak Alexon's shares touched 444p since its demerger from Claremont
Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier in July 1991.
Earlier in the year Alexon stripped Ms Henderson of her chief executive's
title and promoted Mr Ridsdale, who had come from the Burton Group in
September 1991.
But the three big institutions told the group's adviser, Schroders, and its
two non-executives, Mr David Hewitt and Mr Brian North, that it would not
subscribe to any rights issue without wholesale board changes. With net debt
of Pounds 23m one of the group's main options to reduce its borrowings was
to tap its shareholders for cash.
The new management is expected to speed up the repositioning of the Dash
leisure wear chain, which used to account for the majority of the group's
profits. It is planning to replace tracksuits with more co-ordinated
leggings, knitwear and casual jackets.
Mr David Cohen remains as finance director. He has been involved in
renegotiating the group's banking facilities after Alexon breached its
covenants.
Mr Patrick Cooper, a director of Goode Durrant, an industrial conglomerate,
has joined the board as a non-executive director.

FT  23 APR 93 / Compact car with designs on success: Christopher Parkes
reports on changes aimed at overtaking Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER by a matchstick's length than its executive predecessor, and replete
with two dozen new features as standard, the marketing motto for the
Mercedes-Benz compact C-class is that it offers customers more car for their
money.
According to Mr Klaus-Dieter Vohringer, director in charge of passenger car
production, buyers will get up to 20 per cent more value at prices basically
unchanged from those of the outgoing 190 series.
Technically and cosmetically refined, the C-class is the fruit of
manufacturing and management innovations with which Mercedes hopes to
transform its prospects in the global quality car market.
It is the first practical example of the group's new pricing policy. The
range embodies a principle new to Mercedes which states that before any work
starts a new product will be priced according to what the market will bear
and what the company considers an acceptable profit. Then each component and
manufacturing process will be costed to ensure the final product is
delivered at the target price.
Under the old system of building the car, adding up the costs and then
fixing a price, the C-class would have been between 15 per cent and 20 per
cent dearer than the 10-year-old outgoing 190 series, Mr Vohringer said.
Explaining the practical workings of the new system, he explained that
project groups for each component and construction process were instructed
without exception to increase productivity by between 15 and 25 per cent.
And they had to reach their targets in record time.
One result was that development time on the new models was cut to 40 months,
about a third less than usual. But the most important effect, according to
Mr Vohringer, has been to reduce the company's cost disadvantages vis-a-vis
Japanese competitors in this class from 35 per cent to only 15 per cent.
The time taken to build a car has been cut from 45 man-hours to around 35.
Collaboration with outside suppliers has resulted in Mercedes making less of
its own parts and also speeding up assembly. Complete electrical wiring
harnesses, for example, are now supplied from outside on a just-in-time
basis, ready to be inserted in one process into the bodies. Door interiors
are also shipped complete for one-step installation. Where Mercedes used to
produce 48 per cent of parts, it now makes around 42 per cent.
Dashboards and controls, built in a separate assembly shop, are also
installed in one action instead of being bolted and screwed together
piecemeal on an assembly line comprising rolling platforms in place of a
conveyor system. Body assembly is robotised; side panels come in one piece
rather than five parts.
Quality controllers have been moved from the end of the production line,
where jams built up. They now work as members of each assembly team.
Group work has been introduced at every level of the Mercedes product cycle
and six management layers have been thinned to four. According to Mr
Vohringer, this improved efficiency and collaboration with suppliers have
each contributed 50 per cent of cost efficiencies.
The main task is to launch a new and still relatively costly car into
crowded and depressed international markets. In Germany, which routinely
absorbs almost half Mercedes' compact class output, total industry sales are
expected to fall 20 per cent this year. Yet the company is committed to
producing 100,000 C-class cars and will step up production to 200,000 in
1994 compared with a recent annual average output of 180,000 for the old 190
series. Some executives even hope production can be cranked up to 250,000 in
1995, even though most forecasters reckon European car markets will still be
weak.
In the meantime, Mercedes has to tackle the introduction of similar changes
throughout the rest of its range. Three-quarters of the passenger car output
and most of its profits come from the middle-range executive classes and the
luxury S-class. But it has ground to make up. Japanese competitors have a 15
per cent cost advantage over Mercedes' new compact model and are not
renowned for standing still.

FT  23 APR 93 / CE Heath reports big losses on old aviation insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE legacy of its past involvement in Australia came back to haunt CE Heath,
the insurance broker, yesterday when the group reported further heavy losses
from discontinued aviation reinsurance business. Heath announced that it
intends to sue two rival brokers over the losses, which will push the
company into a post-tax loss when it reports its 1992-93 results next month.
Shares in Heath fell 12p to close at 313p in London.
Heath, which has scaled back its involvement in insurance underwriting to
concentrate on broking activities, has been hit by claims on aviation
reinsurance business underwritten by its insurance subsidiary between 1987
and 1991.
Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, said total claims from the loss-making
aviation reinsurance business amounted to Dollars 70m (Pounds 45m), about
twice as much as premiums generated.
'Claims can go on for some time. It is the nature of underwriting. It is a
risk business,' said Mr Presland.
Heath is alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the Australian Trade
Practices Act and negligence by two UK brokers which placed the business
with it and also arranged reinsurance cover. It is unable to identify either
broker until writs are served later this week.
The group expects the matter to come to trial within the next 12 months and
said that 'there are reasonable prospects of a substantial recovery'.
The group will post an Pounds 18.6m exceptional item to meet the aviation
losses. An exceptional gain of Pounds 5.6m from another corner of its former
Australian underwriting operations, was partially offset by a second
exceptional loss of Pounds 5m, incurred from restructuring UK retail broking
operations.
The exceptional gain has occurred as a result of recent developments in the
protracted litigation between Heath and other insurers and the nationalised
workers' compensation fund of Victoria.
Heath reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.9m for the six months to
September 30 and cut its interim dividend to 5p.
Heath is not expecting the exceptionals to affect dividends, which it says
it will pay from cashflow. Notwithstanding the loss the group expects a
final dividend at the level indicated in the interim statement of 11p net,
giving a total for the year of 16p.

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, mainstay of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, hopes to stop the
profits rot this year in spite of a 24 per cent slump in turnover and
unspecified operating losses in the first quarter.
While Daimler's group net earnings are expected to slump by 30 per cent to
around DM1bn (Pounds 400m), Mercedes should show a result 'similar' to last
year's DM849m, Mr Helmut Werner, incoming chief executive, said yesterday.
This implies that the group's non-automotive businesses, including Deutsche
Aerospace, AEG engineering and the Debis software and financial services
division, will contribute a mere 15 per cent of total earnings, against 42
per cent last time.
In conditions one executive described as 'ploughing through fog', Mr Werner
Niefer, retiring chief executive, said attempts to prepare forecasts were
blighted by 'many imponderables'.
The company had high hopes of its new compact C-class range, a replacement
for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller executive car, which
will be launched in June, but he did not expect any marked improvement in
markets for cars, buses or trucks before the end of this year.
The so-called C-class was expected to start having a positive effect on
operating results by next year, when, according to one manager, the company
hoped to snatch back market leadership from BMW. Last year Mercedes was
overtaken in unit sales by its Bavarian rival for the first time.
Mercedes expects to build 200,000 of the new model in 1994, compared with
output of 120,000 compact cars in 1992.
This year, however, Mr Niefer said he expected total car output unchanged
from last year's 486,000 while commercial vehicles would fall slightly from
the 1992's 260,000.
In the 1993 first quarter, turnover from cars had fallen 30 per cent, while
unit sales had dropped 32 per cent. Sales revenue from commercial vehicles
was 16 per cent lower on unit deliveries down 20 per cent.
As part of continuing economy measures, at least a further 7,000 German jobs
will be lost this year, after a cut of 14,700 in 1992. Some DM500m had been
set aside in provisions for personnel measures.

FT  23 APR 93 / Austin Reed and Liberty in board and vote changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO family-run retail groups with non-voting share structures yesterday
announced steps towards opening up their companies.
Austin Reed, the upmarket clothing retailer and manufacturer, said it would
ask holders of its voting shares to enfranchise the non-voting shares at its
June annual meeting. Holders of voting shares would receive a one-for-one
scrip issue in compensation. Austin Reed's non-voting shares rose 25p to
132p, while voting shares rose 47p to 235p.
Meanwhile, Liberty, best known for its Regent Street, central London shop
and its prints, appointed a new chief executive, splitting the roles of
chairman and chief executive. This follows the recent recruitment of two
non-executives. Liberty's shares, taking heart from Austin Reed's move, rose
75p to 655p, and the non-voting shares 48p to 358p.
Mr Brian Myerson, whose Concerto Capital Corporation holds 15.77 per cent of
Liberty's voting shares, said the appointments met the corporate governance
questions he raised at an extraordinary meeting last summer.
Mr Myerson called the meeting which also discussed the enfranchisement of
the non-voting shares. Although that vote was defeated, he said he was now
'quietly confident' that Liberty would move to enfranchise the non-voting
shares.
The Stock Exchange allows companies to maintain two-tier voting structures
but frowns on any attempt to raise capital through issuing more shares. Such
companies are thus prevented from having rights issues or making share
acquisitions.
Mr Chris Thomson, finance director of Austin Reed, stressed that the company
had no intention of making a rights issue. The group had come through
recession and wanted to be able to take opportunities, which could include
acquisitions.
Liberty's finance director, Mr John Pugh, said the group had Pounds 1.2m of
net cash at its January 30 year end. He said the issue of enfranchisement
continued to be reviewed by the board.
The retail conundrum is whether Great Universal Stores, the giant
mail-order, high-street retailing, property and finance group, will
enfranchise its non-voting shares. Lord Wolfson, the group's chairman, told
shareholders at the last annual meeting the matter was under review.

FT  23 APR 93 / Salomon falls into Dollars 102m loss in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON, the Wall Street securities house and energy trading group,
yesterday announced a pre-charge net loss of Dollars 65m (Pounds 42m) for
the first quarter after its Salomon Brothers brokerage subsidiary fell into
the red because of short-term losses on its proprietary trading activities.
The total net loss for the group, however, came in at Dollars 102m because
Salomon took a Dollars 37m charge to cover the impact of changes in the
accounting of post-retirement benefits. In the same quarter a year ago the
group earned net income of Dollars 190m.
The news did not come as a surprise because Salomon warned in early March it
had incurred a large loss on its trading business during the first two
months of the year. The size of the shortfall at Salomon Brothers, however,
was smaller than expected.
In March Salomon said that between January and February it had lost Dollars
250m (pre-tax) at its securities brokerage operation.
However, yesterday, the firm said its loss for the whole quarter was only
Dollars 89m, and that included a Dollars 25m charge to cover legal costs
relating to the 1991 Treasury auction scandal.
The company would not comment on the specific numbers, but it appears there
was a significant positive swing in Salomon Brothers' trading positions
during March.
Salomon's investment banking and commissions revenues were both strong in
the quarter, reflecting heavy demand for the firm's underwriting and client
brokerage services.

FT  23 APR 93 / Major links recovery with EC: PM hails beginning of upturn
and dismisses fears of Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sought to draw a line last night under the Conservative civil
war over the Maastricht treaty as he seized on the latest batch of economic
indicators as clear evidence that economic recovery was now under way.
The conclusion at Westminster of the Maastricht bill's tortuous committee
stage was followed by an upbeat speech by the prime minister underlining his
determination to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'.
Dismissing the 'nameless' fears of Tory Euro-sceptics, he linked directly
the prospects of sustaining the recovery with maintaining Britain's
influence in the European Community. He told a Conservative party din-ner:
'Outside Europe Britain can survive; inside we will thrive.'
Buoyed by the favourable economic news and the growing conviction at
Westminster that ratification of Maastricht is within his grasp, Mr Major
launched a public relations blitz to underline the wider message that his
government has put behind it the crises of the past year.
While other ministers were cautious in announcing formally the end of the
recession, Mr Major used a series of television interviews to declare that:
'We are beginning now to see the recovery. I think that it is self-evident
from what businesses themselves are saying.'
The interviews will be followed by a speech to businessmen in Manchester
this evening in which the prime minister will emphasise the government's
determination to help extend the economy's manufacturing and technological
base.
His theme in last night's speech was that the government had an agenda which
would give Britain a pivotal role in shaping the future of Europe.
Operating at the centre, the government could press its case for a wider,
free-trade, liberal community that would in turn render irrelevant the idea
of a centralised European superstate. He said: 'The idea of a centralised
Europe had resonance in a Community of six. But for 12, soon 16, and
eventually 20 plus nations, it is a grandiose doodle.' The government's
long-term aim was 'the whole continent of Europe with free democra-cies and
without trade barriers'.
After several months on the defensive Mr Major felt confident enough to
dismiss as 'nonsense' claims from Tory Euro-sceptics that enthusiasm for
Europe meant putting Britain second. He told the dinner: 'It is precisely
because we put Britain's interests first that we need to be in there,
shaping the new Europe.'
Developing the argument, Mr Major said that Britain had to take its
'rightful place' in the world: 'Though no longer a global power, we still
have global interests. We need to defend them with determination but also
with subtlety. We cannot afford to subject ourselves to the despotism of
nostalgia.'
In a subtle sideswipe against Baroness Thatcher - once dubbed 'the Iron
Lady' - the prime minister accused opponents of full participation in the EC
as practising 'a sort of phantom grandeur, a clanking of unusable suits of
armour'.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Walls wants to develop Albert Fisher into a reliable high-margin
business. But he must wish he was not starting from here. Following a
frenetic acquisition spree in the 1980s, his predecessor bequeathed a
company with a disparate array of commodity food businesses which have an
unhappy vulnerability to natural phenomena. Yesterday's 19 per cent slide in
interim profits only highlights the scale of the challenge: no matter how
well Mr Walls performs, problems such as apple gluts and storm-affected
cockle beds may have a greater influence on Albert Fisher's immediate fate.
Shorn of the benefits of acquisition accounting, the company will try to
produce smooth earnings progress by squeezing more juice from existing
assets and shifting its focus towards higher value-added sectors. This is a
prudent strategy but it will doubtless prove prolonged. In the short term,
the task will be hampered by the adverse impact of sterling's devaluation on
margins and its big exposure to the UK's strong and price-conscious
supermarkets. But Albert Fisher should reap some recovery gains as it
attempts to lift its 4 per cent operating margins back to their historical
peak of 7 per cent. The acquisition of Hunter Saphir will help.
While waiting, shareholders can comfort themselves with Albert Fisher's
sound balance sheet and strong dividend yield. But the company will face a
stiff challenge trying to persuade the market to attach a more serious
rating to its inherently volatile earnings stream.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Axa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One might wonder whether Axa increased its dividend yesterday to rub salt
into the wounds of its state-owned competitors. Its share of pain from the
Paris property slump is less than that of UAP and AGF, both of which cut
their pay-outs this week. While all three have had to content themselves
with lower profits from asset sales than usual, UAP and AGF are also the
proud owners of banks with a predilection for property lending. In contrast,
Axa's investment in Equitable Life is a reason to be cheerful.
The US company's share price has more than doubled since Axa bought its
stake last year. The additional Dollars 400m injected this week should help
Equitable's profits recovery by bringing its capital strength into line with
its competitors. That will help win new business. The US life assurance
market should anyway improve in line with the economy. The worry is that
more capital could yet be required. If the likes of Aegon pump extra cash
into their US life operations, Axa will have to choose between following
suit and losing market share.
While its own shares are rising, though, Axa can afford to take a relaxed
view. February's convertible bond to finance investment in Equitable Life
barely interrupted the upward march of the shares. The good performance in
French motor and property insurance evident from yesterday's figures
suggests that adventures abroad have not led to neglect of the domestic
business. The French government might wish Axa, rather than UAP, was on the
privatisation list.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Lex Column: European car market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It hardly needed Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot to tell us that life is hard in
the European car business. One of the most marked characteristics of the
current downturn has been the way in which manufacturers have consistently
underestimated the size of the problem. The market may be heading for a 15
per cent fall this year, while carmakers cling to thoughts of a 10 per cent
decline. That is particularly unfortunate given existing overcapacity and
the Japanese transplants and eastern European production which will soon be
on stream. Volkswagen and Mercedes say they are getting a grip on the threat
posed by their high costs. But it is unlikely that they can slim fast enough
to avoid horrifying operating losses for some time.
The current downturn is also unusual because, with the exception of the UK,
all of the EC's major markets are in decline simultaneously. Perhaps
carmakers are the first victims of the single market and ERM convergence?
Certainly European manufacturers are unused to the kind of volatility in
demand which is commonplace in the US.
A widespread downturn also highlights the regional constraints of the
European industry. The strength of Far Eastern markets and recovery in the
US are only of marginal benefit to European companies. With the possible
exception of Volkswagen, the EC lacks competitors with the global reach of
Ford, GM and Toyota.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Lex Column: A miraculous recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has found so many ways of 'adjusting' the unemployment
figures that it is hard not to feel cynical about recent falls. All the more
so because the proffered explanations are so intangible. Still, it is not
totally implausible that improvements in the supply side of the labour
market have made it more responsive to changing economic conditions.
Companies may be faster to sack people, but they may also be less frightened
to hire them back - particularly in areas such as housebuilding which have
seen a strong upturn this year. If that is true, then unemployment is less
of a lagging indicator than it was in the past. Support for the idea of a
more flexible market comes from the average earnings and unit wage figures
which are down to a level more normally associated with a successful low
inflation economy.
Since the appalling December jobs data gave rise to the base rate cut in
January, it is reasonable to assume that further cuts have now been
postponed. That may cause short gilts to give up some ground, though longer
maturities can take comfort from the relatively benign inflation outlook.
Confirmation from the Bundesbank that the situation in Germany continues to
worsen will also help sterling. Even if the pound approaches DM2.70 as
German rates fall, it will still be well below the level of a year ago. The
chancellor may actually welcome this, given the extent of monetary easing
since Black Wednesday.
What remains unclear is the political response to the worsening of official
figures which surely lies ahead. The recent data have been so strong that
there is bound to be some disappointment during the summer.

FT  23 APR 93 / Exchange to look at US option for trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange has decided to consider a computer system from
Nasdaq, the US exchange, as a replacement for its Seaq trading system.
Parts of the Nasdaq system will be considered as an alternative to the
exchange's own proposed new system, which is being developed by Andersen
Consulting.
The decision to consider both systems was made by the Stock Exchange board
yesterday. The board also agreed to concentrate on 'core functions', and to
transfer the exchange's Topic electronic information system to two outside
vendors, Telekurs of Switzerland and ICV of Woking.
The Nasdaq decision is a victory for five big City securities houses. They
commissioned a study from Booz Allen, the management consultants, which
concluded it would be better to buy a system from another exchange.
Some houses lack confidence in the exchange's ability to develop systems
after the failure last month of its planned Taurus automated settlement
system.
'The board is clear that it will invest in supporting a market system and we
are looking anxiously at making a final decision on that in the near
future,' said Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman.
The two systems will be compared over the next month. The decision between
them will be taken at the board's next meeting, in late May. There will be
an independent assessment of the two systems, which is likely to mean the
appointment of a third set of consultants.
Mr James Spellman, of Nasdaq in Washington, said the first elements of the
new Nasdaq system would be distributed to customers this autumn, but the
whole project would take five to seven years to complete.
The exchange has considered buying a system from Nasdaq twice in the last
five years, most recently two years ago.
The exchange's new strategy reflects a desire to 'concentrate wholly on its
core functions,' according to a board statement yesterday.
These were organising and regulating the UK central market in securities;
running the Seaq International market in international securities; and
acting as the legally designated authority for listing securities.
'The exchange would continue to operate as a non-profit making co-operative
on behalf of the market,' said the statement.
This marks a shift from views expressed by Peter Rawlins, the chief
executive who left the exchange after the Taurus collapse. He had argued at
times for a profit-making role for the exchange.

FT  23 APR 93 / Russian defence minister faces corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin last night faced the gravest threat to the success
of his referendum campaign when the prosecutor- general's office issued a
statement implicating the Russian defence minister in 'illegal deals'
involving former Soviet military property in east Germany.
General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has strongly supported Mr
Yeltsin and has so far ensured the loyalty of the military. One source close
to the security services said last night that he would be forced to resign.
The allegations came at the end of a day in which the bitterness between Mr
Yeltsin and parliament erupted in a series of charges and counter charges.
The parliamentary press office distributed a statement, claimed to be based
on security services' information, that Mr Yeltsin planned to falsify the
results of Sunday's referendum and to impose presidential rule with the help
of armed Cossack regiments.
The country's main hardline groups announced the formation of a public
committee for the protection of the constitution, uniting nationalist and
communist parties and previously centrist parliamentary factions.
Mr Vladimir Isakov, leader of the Russian Unity faction, said the group
would use 'all means including civil disobedience and resistance . . . if we
encounter open violence to the constitution this means we will defend the
constitution by the use of force'.
Mr Yeltsin, on a campaign trip to the city of Izhevsk in the Udmurt
Republic, promised 'tough measures' against the opposition.
The corruption allegations against Gen Grachev come a week after Gen
Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, who has emerged as the main opponent
of Mr Yeltsin, alleged massive corruption on the part of close presidential
aides - including a charge that Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, head of the Federal
Information Service, has been involved in the sale of Soviet army property
in Berlin.
The prosecutor-general's office said that Mr Gennady Burbulis, the former
first deputy prime minister and long-time confidant of Mr Yeltsin - also
named by Gen Rutskoi - together with other senior officials, would be
interrogated in a seperate corruption case.
The key passage in the statement says: 'The prosecutor-general's office,
investigating illegal deals involving the property of the Western Group of
Forces, discovered new facts of abuse of official position by the commanders
of the group, of the defence ministry and personally by defence minister
Pavel Grachev'.
Gen Grachev was made defence minister over more senior general officers
after he sided with Mr Yeltsin during the August putsch in 1991.
Mr Yeltsin's hardline opponents plan a rally in Moscow today.

FT  23 APR 93 / Compass for a safer passage: Lloyd's hopes its business plan
will help it overcome a rising tide of problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Lloyd's of London had some stark words for his staff
earlier this year. 'No British institution has ever taken the losses that
Lloyd's has and survived,' he said, underlining the need for a 25 per cent
cut in administration staff to ensure the future of the insurance market.
Mr Peter Middleton and Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, are likely to
strike a similar note of urgency next Thursday when they announce details of
a radical new 'business plan'. The market's survival is dependent on the
success of the plan because unless Lloyd's can reduce its costs, contain a
rising tide of old asbestosis and pollution claims and negotiate a legal
settlement with thousands of aggrieved loss-making Names, it could start to
disintegrate.
Two issues have highlighted the need for radical action. First, the market's
losses in 1990 - due to be announced in June under Lloyd's three-year
accounting system - are expected to exceed 1989's record loss of Pounds
2.06bn. Second, the erosion of the market's capital base has accelerated.
Some 2,000 Names left last year; many more will follow this year. 'Many
Names are hanging on by their finger nails,' says one members' agent.
A broad strategy outlining the route forward was agreed last year when the
governing council accepted the recommendations of a task force led by Mr
Rowland. Its groundbreaking proposals included modifying the principle of
unlimited liability - whereby Names are liable for all insurance losses
underwritten on their behalf - and the invitation to corporate investors to
commit capital to the market.
Behind the report's recommendations lay the realisation by senior Lloyd's
figures that the market was losing ground to competitors in Europe and North
America - such as Zurich Insurance and the American International group -
which have made inroads into specialised areas of commercial insurance and
reinsurance once dominated by Lloyd's. The London market decided to respond
with a swingeing cost-cutting and rationalisation programme which would
produce fewer - but more efficient - bigger and better-capitalised
businesses. Some progress has been made. In the past three years, for
instance, the number of syndicates (which underwrite business) has fallen
from 401 to about 230.
The business plan aims to develop the cost-cutting and consolidation
strategy to restore profitability and attract fresh capital. Lloyd's
insiders say in some senses it is a 'pathfinder prospectus' - a document
similar to that issued by a company seeking to raise cash.
However, the prescriptive nature of many of the proposals will mark a sharp
break with the past, when Lloyd's governing council stood back from the
management and direction of the market, confining its role to regulation and
the provision of back-up services. 'The council is effectively saying, 'You
will do the following.' If you just wait for all the businesses in the
market to do things you will travel as slowly as the last in the convoy. If
one man keeps a quill pen the benefits of computerisation are lost,' says Mr
Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman. One result could be that syndicates could be
compelled to adopt common computer systems.
In future, Lloyd's regulators, who are responsible to the council, are
likely to be focus on a wider range of issues, in areas such as standards of
professionalism and competence. Lloyd's has traditionally maintained a
hands-off attitude to these matters but allegations of incompetence and
negligence at some agencies and syndicates during the 1980s have prompted a
sense of urgency about monitoring standards. Training is being emphasised,
for instance.
In addition, Lloyd's will encourage the centralisation of a range of
activities - from the way the affairs of Names are handled, to the
processing of claims. Many activities are currently conducted at Lloyd's in
a highly fragmented way. Earlier this year, Mr Middleton said Lloyd's had
managed to make a very simple system 'terribly complicated'. He said that 'a
flow-chart of the claims payments system resembles a combination of the New
York subway, the London Underground and the Paris Metro, with a map of the
European railway network superimposed.'
New systems allowing for speedier reporting of financial information are
likely to be introduced, providing would-be investors with an accurate and
up-to-date picture of the business. The cumbersome three-year accounting
system could also be scrapped.
The need for change is broadly accepted among the bigger agencies which
manage syndicates and handle the affairs of Names. 'It is widely recognised
that if we don't get it right this time, we won't get another chance,' says
Mr Edward Bloxham, chief executive of Cater Allen, which manages several
syndicates.
Opposition could arise from some quarters, however. The existence of some
smaller agencies could be threatened. In such cases the market's leaders
will press acceptance of the 'business plan' through a combination of
persuasion and threat. Mr Middleton has promised to resign if the plan is
not implemented. As one agent put it: 'Middleton is our last shot. If he
doesn't get a high level of support for the plan he walks. If he walks, we
are dead.'
The resolution of two sets of outstanding problems will dictate whether the
plan succeeds or fails: the first comprises liabilities arising from US
insurance policies; the second is the morass of litigation in which the
market is mired.
American court awards in asbestosis and pollution cases are producing a
steady flow of notifications of claims on insurance policies underwritten up
to 50 years ago. Industry observers believe that unless these old
liabilities are isolated or - to use the market's jargon - 'ring-fenced' -
they will dissuade new investors from committing capital to Lloyd's,
functioning effectively as a 'poison pill'.
Ms Julienne Jessup, of the insurance consultancy De Lisle Jessup Scott,
says: 'Lots of investors would be interested but they won't look at it as
long as there is any doubt about their liability for the back years.'
One way for Lloyd's to rid itself of 'long-tail' liabilities would be to set
up a reinsurance company, a proposal understood to be contained in the
business plan. Several billion pounds of reserves set aside to meet future
claims and held in Lloyd's 'premium trust funds' could be channelled into
the company to meet claims arising on pre-1982 policies.
While progress appears to be in train on the US front, the settlement of
outstanding actions for compensation against agents is far from assured. The
prospects of a speedy once-and-for-all settlement have been fading for some
time. Mr Middleton hinted at the intractability of these problems last month
when he said he simply did not have the power to 'impose' a deal.
Negotiations to achieve a settlement will continue, with the business plan
likely to limit itself to outlining a possible way forward.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party - which links groups of loss-making Names - says new challenges could
be afoot, with Names turning to European Community law or even attempting to
allege 'bad faith' by the market's regulators.
A serious question-mark thus hangs over the settlement of outstanding legal
actions by Names, which, together with old US liabilities, poses the most
serious threat to the business plan's success. In any event, Messrs Rowland
and Middleton still have to sell their solutions to the market. If the
market buys them, and they work, an uphill struggle remains. Although
Lloyd's has taken steps to make up lost ground over the past two years,
younger insurance companies around the world have taken the chance to snatch
some of Lloyd's traditional specialised markets. For Lloyd's, survival is
but the first step towards recapturing its former glory. But those days may
be over forever, and it may have to learn to live with a lower profile and
diminished status.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sounded more positive about Britain's role in Europe last
night than he has at any time since he became prime minister. If memory
serves, his speech to the Conservative Group for Europe had a more
'European' tone to it than any address by a Conservative party leader since
Mr Ted Heath left office in February 1974. It was better-written than his
previous speeches, and peppered with ringing phrases and potential
soundbites, such as 'outside Europe Britain can survive; inside we will
thrive', and 'the nations must be free standing - a colonnade, not a set of
bars'.
Mr Major's immediate purpose is to regain authority over his party, while
acknowledging that some of the anti-Maastricht rebels within it are
irreconcilable. The speech marks the end of the committee stage of the bill
to ratify the Maastricht treaty; there may be further parliamentary
rough-and-tumble, but the back of the rebellion has been broken. Thus
fortified, the prime minister spoke out against Europhobia more forcefully,
and more effectively, than he has yet dared to do. Opponents of 'Britain's
full participation in the EC', he said, are moved 'by frustration that we
are no longer a world power'. Pointedly he added: 'We cannot afford to
subject ourselves to the despotism of nostalgia.'
Optimists will read this as a serious attempt to lead opinion within the
country. The speech is not proof against close analysis, but then few such
orations are. Its most useful purpose could be to set the beginnings of a
new mood in which the everlasting domestic debate on European policy may be
conducted. To that end, it may be read as a promising first step, following
a long and bruising internecine struggle within the Tory party.
The test will come in the follow-up. Mr Major made no attempt to explain the
British strategy for the kind of Europe he seeks to establish. It may have
'12, soon 16 and eventually 20-plus' members, but if there is to be no
reformed central machinery, how are these many nations to act in unison,
particularly in the 'many areas where the Community countries do need to
work together'? Again, the prime minister made no mention of the exchange
rate mechanism, let alone monetary union.
The latter omission is practical politics: the Conservatives could not
endure a bid to rejoin the ERM before the next election, let alone a
protracted debate on the merits of a single currency. A British government
that aims to set the agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the
further development of the European Union cannot, however, ignore such
issues. They will be raised by France and Germany as soon as the Danes are
home from their referendum. Mr Major has done well to announce that 'Little
England steps out', but he needs more than a good speechwriter if he is to
convince Britain's partners that it is not marching backwards.

FT  23 APR 93 / Leading Article: Half a trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARTIAL agreement between the US and the European Community in their
trade dispute over public procurement brings several benefits. It opens up
important areas of public procurement; it limits the threatened US
sanctions; it shows that business can be done with the Clinton
administration; and it helps reopen the way for the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations. Nevertheless, it is far too early for
euphoria. Further trouble is inevitable.
The deal has a number of attractive features. The EC has agreed to waive the
discriminatory aspects of its new public procurement rules in the market for
heavy electrical equipment, worth some Dollars 1bn a year; the US has agreed
to remove restrictions on purchases by federal electrical utilities; the
administration will seek withdrawal of 'Buy America' legislation from the
governors of all 50 states; both sides have agreed to remove restrictions on
bidding for supply of goods and services to central governments and they
have also both agreed to undertake a joint study of trade barriers in public
procurement.
More important, there is an agreement. It was beginning to look as though
the Clinton administration would prefer nothing at all to anything short of
unconditional EC surrender. Sir Leon Brittan, whose principal goal remains
completion of the Uruguay Round, is entitled to feel relieved. A process has
been started that might lead to this long-desired outcome.
Yet all is not sweetness. The EC has stated, for example, that
telecommunications is too important not to be dealt with multilaterally. Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, feels obliged to impose
sanctions in response. Provided they prove token, they should be ignored.
Should they be substantial, however, counter-retaliation would be probable,
perhaps desirable.
While the US is attacking Sir Leon's front, France is to his rear. In
yesterday's discussions between Mr Edouard Balladur and the German
chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, the French prime minister made this clear,
stressing how vital it was for Germany to appreciate the importance, for
France, of the Gatt in general and agriculture in particular.
Given these pressures, Sir Leon - like Mr Kantor - may have to prove he is
no push-over. If this is not to happen over telecommunications, it must at
least occur where the EC has a strong case. One reason for tough action
would be to show EC member states that he will defend what they perceive as
their vital interests. Another would be to show the US that sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander. The great threat to the multilateral trading
system is the US attempt to micro-manage every market bilaterally. If the
Clinton administration proceeds ever further down this path, someone will
have to demonstrate the dangers by retaliating. Given the realities of
power, that someone will have to be the EC.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS do not normally shy away from trumpeting apparent good news in
the monthly economic statistics. This makes it surprising that Britain's
Conservative government is reticent about celebrating two consecutive
monthly falls in recorded unemployment. Their hesitancy is probably wise,
given the misreading of the economic runes that the Treasury has
demonstrated over the past two years. But there is also more to the
unemployment figures, and the Department of Employment's caution, than meets
the eye.
The government does not need to rely on the unemployment figures to make its
case that recovery has begun. This year's pick-up in consumer demand and
confidence has now fed through to output, with manufacturing production up
1.2 per cent in February over the previous month.
It is also not surprising that business is more optimistic. Exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism has delivered an injection of lower
interest rates to Britain's ailing economy. Sadly, the Bundesbank's
continued slow monetary easing looks likely to deny continental Europe a
similar remedy for many months yet.
It would be a mistake to be too excited about the 51,500 fall in
unemployment since January. Maybe employers are rehiring workers they
mistakenly shed in a fit of gloom last autumn. Service sector employment did
rise by 36,000 in the final quarter of last year, having fallen 225,000 in
the previous quarter. Perhaps workers are accepting lower pay increases in
order to preserve jobs. Average earnings have also fallen further, though
not faster, than in previous recessions. More companies have also embraced
profit-sharing arrangements, although largely to take advantage of tax
breaks rather than achieve wage flexibility, as the FT reports today on the
management page.
Yet the figures do not, on closer inspection, quite support the bullish case
that some economists, even some 'wise' ones, want to make. It is too early
to tell whether this year's fall in unemployment has been accompanied by a
surge in re-hiring. Manufacturing employment fell by a further 11,000 in
February, only marginally less than in previous months, while average
overtime hours and vacancies are flat and also lower than they would
normally be when unemployment falls. The suspicion remains that the
Department of Employment has become increasingly skilled at finding ways of
moving the unemployed off the claimant count into training schemes or into
sickness and disability, as it has been doing over the past six years.
For now, the fall in unemployment remains a puzzle. If falling unemployment
over the next few months were matched by rising employment, and if wage
inflation were to stay low as the recovery accelerates, then the government
could celebrate. Until then, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
is right to bite her lip.

FT  23 APR 93 / Personal View: One step forward deserves another
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last couple of weeks there have been signs of a re-emergence of
industrial unrest in the UK: the bitter Timex dispute, rail and bus strikes,
threatening noises from the firemen and teachers, and a European 'day of
action' on April 2. There is no clear pattern to these disputes and we at
the Confederation of British Industry see little prospect of a big increase
in the number of industrial disputes across the country.
But there are dangerous hints - mainly in the public sector - of union
claims for 'catch-up' awards next year, to compensate for restraint in 1993.
And, despite ministerial protestations to the contrary, the chancellor has
not helped by reaffirming that this year's 1.5 per cent public-sector
ceiling would not continue beyond the autumn, without describing any new
approach. At the same time, the growing number of indicators suggesting that
economic recovery is under way is encouraging a feeling that good times are
just around the corner, and that we shall all be better off next year.
I believe this assumption, that after tightening our belts this year we can
loosen them next, is wrong.
Certainly it is true that pay pressure continues to be weak. Pay settlements
in manufacturing averaged 2.5 per cent in the three months to March, down
from 4.4 per cent in the same period last year, and the lowest figure for at
least 25 years. And since productivity has continued to rise rapidly, unit
labour costs have fallen over the last year - a better performance than has
been achieved by any of Britain's principal competitors.
Private-sector service settlements were down at 2.8 per cent on the same
basis, and of course public sector pay settlements, which were generally
higher than in the private sector last year, are capped at 1.5 per cent.
Most public-sector unions are disposed to accept that they cannot hope to
breach it without strikes for which their members seem unprepared (only
senior management pay has failed to respond).
But let us not forget that headline inflation was only 1.9 per cent in the
year to April. And the TPI (tax and price index) - a fashionable measure
this year, though it will certainly not be in 1994 - has risen by only half
a percentage point in the last 12 months. So most public servants will be
getting a 1 per cent real increase in take-home pay, at the bottom of the
longest recession since the second world war - a rather generous definition
of national belt-tightening.
In fact, for those in work real incomes have not fallen at all in this
recession. Between the third quarter of 1990 and the end of 1992 average
real pay increased by 1.6 per cent. This is in contrast to what happened in
the mid-1970s, and during the early 1980s recession, when real pay fell (by
3.9 per cent from end-1979 to mid-1981). The recent growth in retail
spending, while the savings ratio has actually risen, shows real incomes
have risen quite rapidly in the last 12 months.
The truth is that the pain of this recession has been borne most heavily,
indeed quite disproportionately, by the 1.5m people who have joined the
ranks of the unemployed, by those (sometimes the same people) under water on
their mortgages, and by perhaps 2m to 3m people (mainly in manufacturing
industries) whose pay has been frozen. Those were the companies most
affected by the exchange rate mechanism squeeze.
So against that background, what should happen next year?
Undoubtedly inflation will rise somewhat, as a result of devaluation. But if
Britain is to ensure that inflation falls back again quickly, and to lock in
the competitive advantage that devaluation offers, there is no case for
domestic pay rises to compensate for its effects on import prices. To secure
sustained improvements in the UK's trade performance a continuing period in
which unit labour costs do not rise is therefore needed. That would also
help to begin to get unemployment down.
Tight control of pay will be harder next year, and harder than it need be if
no management example is set. Disposable income will not have been inflated
by sharp falls in the mortgage rate, and tax rises will begin to bite next
April. But it will be as vital as ever to ensure that pay does not run ahead
of productivity performance, and preferably some way behind.
It is time the government began to make that clear, rather than hinting at
jam tomorrow. And the unions - if they want to make a useful contribution to
the reduction of unemployment - could explain the realities to their
members, rather than indulging in feel-good gestures such as the European
day of action.

Hands up anyone who can name the boss of the European Investment Bank?
Whatever one thinks about Jacques Attali's tenure at the top of the much
smaller European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he has certainly
made sure that people have heard of him and his bank. If only the same could
be said for the EIB.
Indeed, even if Attali's shareholders do eventually force him to walk the
plank, he will have lasted in the job four times as long as Eugene Meyer, a
former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the first president of the World
Bank - the EBRD's granddaddy. Meyer walked out of the door after only six
months because he fell out with Emilio Collado, the headstrong US director.
If the EBRD's shareholders are thinking of changing presidents, there are
plenty of faceless bureaucrats who would dearly love the job, but not many
figures of substance prepared to put up with the bureaucratic infighting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems Jacques Attali is not alone in his fondness for the good life. John
Major's vision of a classless society and his determination to save
taxpayers' money have fallen victim to an unseemly squabble over government
perks among his ministers.
The row centres on that most precious of perks: the 24-hour-a-day
ministerial car replete with chauffeur.
Taking the prime minister's vision to heart, the Department of Environment
decided the government car service could save money by standardising the
models. After all, each and every one of the 100 cars provided for ministers
in the Commons and the Lords costs the taxpayer more than Pounds 50,000 a
year to run.
No longer would junior ministers make do with workaday Montegos or Sierras
while their cabinet superiors luxuriated in Rover Sterlings and Jaguars.
Instead, all ranks would be assigned a middle-range Rover 800. The savings
on leasing and servicing costs would run into tens of thousands.
Junior ministers were understandably thrilled at the idea of some extra
leg-room. But Observer learns that a revolt by their seniors quashed the
plan.
What horrified ministers around cabinet level was not just the thought of
losing their leather upholstery. Even worse was the fear of being mistaken
for mere parliamentary under-secretaries on those long and arduous journeys
from their Whitehall offices to Westminster.
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, was called on to defend their
privileges. The idea was quietly dropped.
Naively, trade and industry ministers then came up with an even better idea.
Since the prime minister was committed to shrinking the size of the public
sector, the car service should be privatised. Hundreds of thousands if not
millions of pounds would be saved by obliging all but the most senior
members of the cabinet to swap their individually assigned vehicles and
drivers for access to a central pool.
That was more than even the most junior minister could stomach. The idea has
been filed in the bin.

FT  23 APR 93 / Quiet on the eastern front: Obstacles facing developers
could keep Berlin a divided city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Berlin is struggling to rebuild itself. Disputes over property rights,
bureaucracy and complex planning regulations are presenting developers with
a frustrating obstacle course. Their difficulties threaten to prolong the
division between the two halves of the country's new capital and demonstrate
the problems of urban renewal facing eastern Germany.
In parts of the Mitte - the traditional city centre - there are pockets of
activity. Contractors are tearing up the streets and renovating the
transport and water systems and housing stock. Some international property
developers, such as Tischmann Spier of the US, are building new office and
shopping complexes.
But for most areas the building boom expected by contractors after the
collapse of the Berlin wall in November 1989 has been slow to spark. A sense
of dereliction hangs over much of the former Prussian capital.
Mr Mark Palmer, a former US ambassador to Hungary and now a property
developer, says he had little idea about the problems he would face when he
arrived in the city after the wall came down.
Mr Palmer, backed by Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, plans to develop
a 20,000 square-metre American Business Centre alongside Checkpoint Charlie.
In 1990, he started to buy 48 plots of land, some from the city council,
others from the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern
German industry, and the rest from private owners.
'We soon discovered that many people were claiming rights over the
property,' said Mr Palmer. His staff spent hours in the Berlin land registry
tracing the original owners of the land. In one case, 214 heirs were
claiming a 600 square-metre plot of land. Mr Palmer said he paid former
property owners the market value, which between 1990 and 1993 rose as high
as DM20,000 (Pounds 8,130) a square metre - the highest in Germany.
In another case, finally resolved earlier this month, Mrs Hilde Frank, an
elderly Jewish lady living in New York, wanted to reclaim her small plot of
land, rather than seek compensation from Mr Palmer. Under the terms of 1991
legislation on compensation and restitution, investors in eastern Germany
have priority over restitution from former property owners if they can prove
they are providing jobs and housing.
But that law was amended in 1992, enabling former Jewish owners the right to
restitution. Mr Palmer had bought the disputed plot from the city council,
before the law was changed. Mrs Frank wanted the 1992 version of the law
applied so that she could get her property back. Both sides eventually
settled out of court. It has taken Mr Palmer almost three years to resolve
all the outstanding property claims. He hopes to start building the DM1bn
office complex in September.
'There's one thing we learned about doing business here. You cannot go in
blind. You must be prepared to deal with property rights. It takes time. But
it can be done,' said Mr Palmer. There are already over 119,000 pending
property claims in east Berlin.
It not only the question of property rights which has delayed the
development of east Berlin. Mr Rainer Wagner, the manager of Sony, the
Japanese electronics company, says the bureaucracy of planning can be 'a
nightmare'.
In 1991, Sony bought 31,000 square-metres of land in Potsdamer Platz for
DM101m, intending to use the site for its new European headquarters.
'When we bought the land, we didn't know that the city of Berlin was going
to develop around our site. This involves building a street tunnel on the
western side, and a huge underground railway station on the eastern side of
Potsdamer Platz. We had to revise our plans several times so that they
fitted into these changes,' says Mr Wagner.
Other property developers say Berlin's divided coalition government presents
particular difficulties. 'The Christian Democrats and Socialists can't make
up their minds if they will allow high rise buildings. They keep changing
their minds about what buildings should be torn down in eastern Berlin.
Sometimes I feel they are overwhelmed by the task of uniting the city,' says
one French planner.
Some politicians have tried to make it easier for developers. 'Mr Wolfgang
Nagel, head of the planning department, is committed to making Berlin open
for investors and developers. But really, very little can be done in this
city without connections, money, and a big name,' said Mr Wagner. 'You also
have to remember that many of the planning experts in the government moved
to the private sector after 1989, so you are dealing with inexperienced
officials.'
The problems of settling property rights claims and obtaining planning
permission means that developers must take a long-term view. 'You don't come
to Berlin and develop with the fast buck in mind. This is a long haul. The
Japanese are here because they believe that Berlin, in the future, will be a
very important city in the heart of Europe. There's going to be a need for
high-quality office space,' explained Mr Wagner. Berlin has only three
square-metres of office space per capita, compared with Frankfurt's 12, and
Dusseldorf's six.
'Berlin is underdeveloped. There was no need to think about an office
infrastructure before 1989,' said Mr Palmer. The need for office space is
likely to increase, following the decision by the federal government to move
Germany's ministries from from Bonn to Berlin.
No date has been set for the move, which is expected to take several years,
but President Richard Von Weizsaker has said he will move his official
residence permanently to the new German capital by the end of 1993.
Property developers, however, do not believe the move by the government will
push prices much higher than their present levels. 'The euphoria of late
1989 has gone; the rush to buy property at any price has subsided,' said Mr
Julian Rudd-Jones, a planner for Stanhope, the British developer. 'The price
of land has stabilised.'
But the price has stabilised at a very high level - between DM10,000 and
DM15,000 a square-metre - and construction costs can be prohibitive. East
German labourers demand the same wages as their western counterparts and
there is a shortage of skilled workers. 'This is an expensive city.
Construction costs are 40 per cent higher than Hamburg. Hamburg used to be
the highest in Germany,' said Mr Palmer.
Financial pressures have combined with the problems of planning and
regulation to create a mood of anxiety among developers. They are urging the
Bundesbank to cut interest rates further to ease some of the pressure while
they try to complete their projects.
'To tell you the truth, our money is not working for us. The banks might get
nervous if we don't start building soon and fill these empty spaces with
tenants. That's why the Sony and Palmer projects are so important. They will
send a signal to other developers that Berlin is finally on the move,' says
one developer.

FT  23 APR 93 / Clinton calls the shots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is ducking and weaving, but today or tomorrow or
early next week he should make a decision on Bosnia. By Monday the Russian
referendum will be out of the way. The west can then stop holding its breath
and walking on tip-toe. Next Friday will be Mr Clinton's 100th day in
office. The anticipation in London is that the president will have declared
himself by then.
That is the timetable to which the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, is
working. I gather from Washington that, yes, there is a discernible sense of
urgency over there, but it is partly TV-driven. A few more days of relative
calm in Srebrenica may lead some in the US administration to believe that
they can postpone the dreadful day on which the president must make a
choice. Let us wait, they may say, to see the full effect of the
strengthened UN sanctions, which start on Monday. Further horror pictures on
prime-time news would speed the decision-making process.
Either way, Mr Clinton must eventually point the way. When he does
politicians on this side of the water may squeak and squeal and shake their
heads, but they will go along with what he proposes.
If you listened carefully this week you could hear the British government
preparing itself for an accommodation with the White House, even if, as it
expects and fears, Mr Clinton proposes a high-risk strategy to contain the
Serbs. The evidence was there in the foreign secretary's words in the House
of Commons on Monday. What he seemed to be saying was that the government
was against bombing Serbian supply lines and opposed to arming the Bosnian
Moslems. What he was actually telling us was that if the Americans insisted
on arming or bombing, or both, Britain would acquiesce.
Look at the small print. 'We cannot rule out anything as the situation
develops,' said Mr Hurd, referring to air strikes but including 'other
options' in his remarks. Reminded by Mr Jim Marshall, the Labour member for
Leicester South, that the arms embargo plays into the hands of the Serbs,
the foreign secretary replied: 'The logic of what the honourable gentleman
says obviously has a very wide appeal, particularly in the US. We may have
to consider this, and I am not ruling it out in certain forms.'
It so happens that the British secretary for defence, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
has been in Washington this week, partly to attend the ceremonial opening of
the holocaust memorial museum, and partly to lobby the US defence secretary,
Mr Les Aspin. The coincidence of the two purposes of his visit is, in
present circumstances, thought-provoking. Mr Rifkind has doubtless been
rehearsing Mr Hurd's arguments against any military escalation of the
conflict. He will have had a sympathetic audience from Mr Aspin, who is of
the generation that was permanently scarred by the Vietnam war. All the
accounts reaching London suggest that the Pentagon is deeply reluctant to
support any course, even high-tech bombing, that might lead to an increasing
involvement of American forces in the unpromising terrain of Bosnia.
Against that Mr Aspin served 11 consecutive terms in the House of
Representatives, becoming chairman of the armed services committee in 1985.
He is credited with the most sensitive political antennae of all the
administration's officials concerned with defence and foreign policy. If,
therefore, Mr Clinton, the untried young ex-governor of Arkansas, finds it
difficult to persuade his generals of the logic of air strikes, then he will
be advised by Mr Aspin as to how to handle Congress.
As the British government sees it, that points one way: to the removal of
the arms embargo. You will realise how the foreign office arrives at this
view if you cross off the remaining possibilities. The first, sticking
resolutely to humanitarian aid while tightening sanctions against Serbia, is
the preferred choice in London. But it is thought here that this will be
insufficient to deflect congressional and media pressure to 'do something'.
This is understandable. Contrary to popular mythology, sanctions can work,
as they did, along with other forces, against apartheid. The process is,
however, extremely slow.
Well then, say some, send Nato troops to keep the peace in the hills. Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, substitutes 'UN'
for 'Nato', but the strategy is the same. It is a perfectly logical response
to Serbian expansionism. It has one overriding flaw. It appears to have been
ruled out by the British, French and US governments. It is therefore not an
immediate proposition.
We are ineluctably back to lifting the embargo. The way British ministers
see it, this would be the worst choice of all, more damaging than selective
air strikes. But are the two proposals mutually exclusive? The diplomatic
professionals believe that a proposal to sell arms to the Bosnian Moslems
alone would be vetoed by Russia, even after a Yeltsin victory. The entire
embargo would have to go.
The consequences would be dramatic. The remnants of the Vance-Owen peace
plan would be swept away. The UN humanitarian forces would have to be
withdrawn. An arms bazaar would open up in the Balkans. At the same time, it
is being argued in the US, the Serbs would wish to launch an all-out assault
on Moslem towns during the interval between the proposal of an
embargo-lifting resolution in the Security Council and the actual arrival of
weaponry in Bosnia. The only way to stop them from doing that would be to
accompany the arms sales resolution with a threat of air strikes against any
Serbian forces that moved.
It is hardly surprising that the conventional wisdom in Washington is that
there are 'no good options'. That is a given. It is, however, the task of
our political leaders to base their decisions upon some foundation of
principle. Let us take the easiest one to sell: self-interest. It is surely
in the self-interest of both Europe and the US that the Serbs be prevented
from establishing a precedent. If they can redraw boundaries and remove
whole peoples, why should the Hungarians not pursue their dreams of a
greater Hungary? Why should Russia accept the rule of ethnic Russians by the
non-Russians who govern its many neighbouring states? Letting the Serbs
rampage over Bosnia is the least good of all the options.

   From Mr COLIN COULSON-THOMAS

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial (April 20) suggests that directors' pay is 'over the
top', while Lucy Kellaway refers to 'allegations of directors' greed'. The
evidence cited is a survey finding that directors' remuneration has
increased during a period of recession.
As well as causing a widespread fall in profitability, the economic
recession has subjected many directors and boards to considerable pressures.
Directors have onerous duties and responsibilities, and when corporate
survival is at stake these come to the fore. I know many directors who have
faced greater challenges over the past three years than at any time in their
directorial careers.
The tough choices that result from a difficult trading environment
invariably end up in the boardroom. I would expect the demands upon
directors, and their workloads, to increase at a time of economic adversity,
and I suspect the remuneration of many directors reflects this.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your suggestion that the institutions should take a more active role in
questioning the increases in directors' salaries is praiseworthy but
unlikely to be fruitful. The essential problem is the incestuous nature of
the system. A sits on B's remuneration committee, B sits on C's, and C sits
on A's is a simplified, but reasonably accurate, description of the way in
which it works. And, of course, the boards of the institutions are
themselves part of this game of 'pass the parcel'.
The rules of the club are well understood:
All downwaves are the fault of government's mismanagement of the economy;
Upwaves are, by contrast, solely attributable to the acumen of the
directors;
Any director who, by his incompetence, reduces a company to its knees is
entitled to walk away from the disaster carrying a large bag of gold: Any
shareholder querying the amount of an increase in remuneration must be told
that it is essential if the director is not to take his talents overseas.
The fact that during the long years of punitive taxation there was not the
slightest evidence that overseas companies had any interest in securing the
services of UK executives is to be dismissed as irrelevant.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, Over-the-top pay' (April 20) is right to pin most of the
blame on non-executive directors for over-the-top pay awards to directors.
Despite many of your leaders on the same theme over the past few years and
criticism from the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
governor of the Bank of England, the director-general of the Institute of
Directors, the Cadbury Report and now the Institute of Management, the gravy
train continues.
Unfortunately, Lucy Kellaway ('Facts show fat cats are fatter', April 20)
perpetuates the myth that questions from shareholders will cause
'embarrassment' to such as the directors of Premier Consolidated Oilfields
who have just managed a 50 per cent hike. It won't. If the recipients of the
questions were thin-skinned enough to suffer embarrassment, they shouldn't
be doing the jobs in any case.
You suggest the Cadbury Committee was right in arguing that the chief
discipline must be openness. That is not working now and is unlikely to work
in the foreseeable future.
Answers at AGMs by the chairmen of remuneration committees will not change
things either. Shareholders receive one standard answer to their questions -
'we have to pay the international market price for our directors'. Which is
mostly nonsense because most of them have worked for their companies for
years and just do not have an meaningful international market price.
Change could come when, and only when, directors' remuneration is made
subject to resolutions at AGMs. If shareholders then vote for the pay award,
everyone can stop complaining.
It is even possible that responsible directors might actually welcome a
change which would add legitimacy to their pay awards via explicit
shareholder approval. Cadbury considered this but turned it down because his
committee couldn't work out what would happen if shareholders were so bold
as to vote down such a resolution]

FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Rail needs subsidy to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps Mr Gill (Letters, April 20) does not leave his ivory car very
often to travel by rail. Surely he knows that no railway can compete with
road without subsidy from taxpayers - not even in Japan with its amazing
population densities. The amount of subsidy/debt depends in part on
political judgment of the externalities, of the social benefits a decent
rail service provides, and not just on efficiency. If you want measures of
the latter, how do British Rail and German Rail stack up on, say, passenger
miles per worker hour, investment as a proportion of turnover, average
vintage of rolling stock, proportion of trains on time?

FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Group 4 confident of courts service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M J HIRST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your leader 'Prison Leaks' (April 21) which
clearly outlines the complexities of the contract awarded to Group 4 to
pioneer the first private court services operation of its kind in the world.
I would like to clarify, however, the escapes to which you refer in the
first paragraph.
Over the 16 court sitting days that Group 4 has been providing the service
there have been four court room escapes directly attributable to it,
including one during which a custody officer was assaulted and the clerk of
the court later commented: 'The Group 4 officers acted in a proper manner
and could not be faulted for the defendant escaping.'
The vehicles from which there were two escapes have been officially
acknowledged as being of faulty Home Office design brief and specification.
Modifications have been made. In addition, a prisoner was released from
Mansfield Magistrates Court as it was not made known at the time that he was
required to appear in another court there to answer a different charge. The
clerk to the court has written to Group 4 clarifying the procedural error
and clearing the company of any blame.
A further incident was reported on April 10 regarding our staff's releasing
a prisoner on theft charges. He was correctly released as he was bailed
subject to regular appearances at the police station.
I am confident, however, that our systems and procedures, which are all
agreed and monitored by the Home Office, are fundamentally sound and our
staff are properly trained to do the job. If all agencies (police, courts
and prison service) within the contract meet their requirements, we can
continue to improve the service that we are providing.

FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: A measure to undermine Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anatole France, the French writer, observed that: 'The law in its
majestic equality, forbids the rich, as well as the poor, to sleep under
bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread.' Apparently, the present
government believes this to be a sound principle and wishes to extend it.
Having already begun the process of denying people access to the courts by
the curtailing of availability of legal aid, it seems ('Acas angry over plan
to make users pay for services', April 21) that ministers now wish to
restrict access to the services provided to workers by Acas, the arbitration
and conciliation service, in the industrial area as well.
Not content with abolishing Acas's statutory duty to promote collective
bargaining, this spiteful, penny-pinching measure will serve only to
undermine the very existence of Acas - or is that what the government wants?

FT  23 APR 93 / Arts: Ample flesh to the fore - Patricia Morison reviews
Jacob Jordaens in Antwerp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The subtitle for Jacob Jordaens, at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in
Antwerp, could be 'The Triumph of Fat'. As Americans put it, I have a
problem with Jordaens - which is not to say anything against an engrossing
exhibition, the most ample (le mot juste) exploration of Jordaens' art for a
quarter of a century.
This exhibition marks the 400th year of the birth of Jordaens. Well
selected, with paintings which give a full idea of Jordaens' huge output,
the show makes a prestigious beginning to Antwerp's year as European Capital
of Culture. Jordaens' reputation has had its ups and downs: in the last
century he was hailed by Flemish nationalists as through and through a
Fleming - earthy, sensual, cheery and scrupulously honest; and at a time
when the fractured nature of Belgium grows more evident by the month, it
seems fitting that the focus is once again on Jordaens.
Even by 17th-century standards, Jordaens was an extraordinarily fleshy
artist, which makes it hard for anyone too set on the 20th-century ideal of
beauty to appreciate his work. His men and women swell, sag, and ooze from
their clothes - when they are wearing any. As he grew older and lost his
youthly bounce, figures which had at first boldly filled canvasses became
smaller but not leaner, leaving more room for sub-Rubens landscapes or
squirming Baroque architecture. A Jordaens nude, highly appreciated in his
day, can be a loathsome thing, as in the elephantine blonde in 'The
Daughters of Cecrops Finding the Child Erichthonius'.
Dogs, cows and horses abound in Jordaens paintings, and he had a mania for
parrots. Rubens generally had the accomplished Frans Snyders to add the
animals, but in Jordaens' equally prolific factory it seems much less clear
who did what. Assistants busily recycled figures from the huge stockpile of
drawings, plonking them on canvasses with fine disregard for relating them
either to each other or to the setting.
Quality control lapsed to a degree which had not been true of Rubens'
workshop. Whoever wielded the brushes, it is impossible to exonerate the
master for sending out paintings as awful as the late 'Mercury and Argus'
(private collection), with cows like dollops of melting lard.
While Rubens and Van Dyck were alive, young Jordaens was regarded as third
among the history painters in Antwerp. Unlike them, he never went to Italy.
After they died, he became number one painter and had some very grand
clients - including Charles I of England, who ordered, but never got, a
decorative cycle for the Queen's House in Greenwich.
The fascinating thing about this exhibition is the gulf in ability between
Jordaens and his great predecessors. A Jordaens portrait can be pretty, as
in the half-length 'Portrait of a Young Lady' from Vienna. But he has none
of Van Dyck's ability to convey refinement, intellect, nor languid
melancholy. Time and again, his bravura painting of heads is let down by
clumsy bodies.
Jordaens's Prado self portrait with his wife and child is a lovely
exception, but in many groups the figures tend to be hugger-mugger. A late
portrait from the Hermitage of a man and two women is a collapsing mountain
of satins and billowing white bosoms. The gentleman's leg sticks out in the
most inelegant manner from under the skirt of a lady whose legs have
apparently given way. One of Jordaens' regrettable cupids prods at her melon
breast with his arrow. Dignified it is not, yet the artist has created a
quite extraordinarily happy portrait.
Animal high spirits demonstrate the best of Jordaens, who has a gift for
capturing smiles and laughter. He can make us smile, too. In the 'Allegory
of Fruitfulness' from the Bass Museum in Florida, the tiger filching grapes
from a basket almost steals the scene. Subjects like 'As the Old Sang, So
the Young Pipe' (versions from Antwerp, Valenciennes, and a private
collection) and 'The King Drinks' (from Brussels), have long been the most
popular aspect of Jordaens.
Important and little-known religious paintings confirm the suspicion that
dramatic scenes of grief and suffering were not Jordaens' strong point. His
penchant for including contemporary peasants in religious scenes conformed
to Counter-Reformation piety, but because they are such coarse brutes, the
effect is a far cry from Zurbaran. 'The Holy Family with Various Persons and
Animals in a Boat' is quite as hilarious as the title suggests. The
catalogue (in two volumes and very desirable) disputes the view that
Jordaens' conversion to Calvinism had any effect on what he painted, or for
whom. He was too much the professional for points of theology to make any
odds.
The treat is the last room, a splendid finale. Here is Jordaens the tapestry
designer - something which for which he was tremendously in demand. Six
Brussels tapestries, 'The Riding School', are almost the complete set from
one bought for a Habsburg wedding and still in Vienna. They look almost as
good as new, their crimson and green hardly faded. Jordaens produced quite a
few horsey tapestries, an illustration for the fashion for applying
astrology to horse-breeding. Like people, horses had star-signs; a
Renaissance edition of The Racing Times would have printed a horoscope for
horses. These tapestries of Spanish-style dressage are magnificently
exuberant and infectiously light-hearted. Gods, men and women, horses and
peacocks, mingle on the friendliest terms. Here is the best of the world
according to Jordaens.
Sponsored by Gemeentekrediet and Sabena. Exhibition continues until June 27,
1993. Closed on Mondays; late opening Wednesdays until 9 pm

Good chaps - white men - pick of the British nation. That horrible war]
Terribly fond of you, old thing. When you think of what the War did to him,

but I've been an officer and a gentleman. I don't suppose he drinks any more
than anyone else of his class. Are you awfully in love with me? Awfully.
And so on. In his 1932 play For Services Rendered, Somerset Maugham catches
all the argot and snobberies of the midwar English upper middle class, and
shows them up as a facade. Frustrations and disillusion are ready to burst
forth. And they do, they do. Mrs Ardsley (Sylvia Syms) is terminally ill,
her son (Tim Sabel) is an invalid blinded in the Great War, her daughter
Ethel (Harriet Bagnall) has unhappily married a mere common farmer (Colin
Haigh), another daughter (Moir Leslie) is being driven bonkers by a life of
spinsterly self-sacrifice, and a third daughter (Sarah Burghard) is tempted
to elope with a married man just to win some independence.
Maugham shows how the war spoilt everybody's world. Even Mrs Ardsley,
preparing for death, admits to her son that she is out of place in the
modern world: 'I'm pre-War'. All this has a certain socio-historical
interest today. The designer, Kit Surrey, sets the Ardsley's drawing-room
pointedly between a backdrop of English landscape and a foreground of burial
crosses and Remembrance poppies.
Yet half the war stuff seems rather laboriously tacked on. The play is
really just a diagram of the minor provincial gentry's pathetic decline.
Every character is plainly a type. When blind, hard-headed Sydney says,
'There are families all over England just like us,' he is only too right. If
a play is to live, we need to believe in the particulars that make its
characters like nobody else but themselves; but not so here.
The first quality that a play like this needs in performance today is sheer
tact. We have to buy all its old-school understatement and circuitous
snobberies without sniggering at them. In this respect, Deborah Paige's
staging is excellent, its period sense flawless. Sarah Burghard is not
luminous enough to persuade us that married men would really fall for her,
but she shows Lois's dilemma with perfect clarity. As her crazed sister
Evie, Moir Leslie does a very good job, bringing off a fit of violent
hysterics and a mad scene. Ann Penfold, Terry Taplin, Jeffrey Segal, Harriet
Bagnall, Colin Haigh, and Peter Halliday all contribute fine pieces of
period character acting.
But it takes another order of performance, conjuring eloquence from every
detail, to make such a play gripping. For this, see the beautifully
understated playing of Sylvia Syms and Tim Sabel as dying mother and blind
son. Every feature of body language makes its point, every phrase makes its
impact. With these two this play spirits us backs through the decades as if
1932 were alive today. Elsewhere it is just a creaky, 'interesting', bitter
little piece of period sociology.

FT  23 APR 93 / Arts: A Scottish 'Norma' to cherish - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the enduring memories from my year at opera school is watching
Caballe rehearse Norma, tripping lightly along the coloratura up to top C's
and down again. Unfortunately it never sounded as easy as that in the
performances. The role seems to invite vocal mishaps, as when a later
soprano at Covent Garden opened her mouth to deliver the crowning top note
of her entrance aria and nothing came out.
What a pleasure it is after so many years of disappointments to come out of
a performance in which the soprano had all the notes - the high, the low,
the loud, the soft, all there for her to pluck from the air as deftly as a
sprig of Norma's holy mistletoe. Jane Eaglen was the singer, to whom
Scottish Opera has entrusted its new production of Bellini's opera. In
recent seasons she has done them proud in several other roles and this was
her due.
There are just a couple of ways in which she falls short of the ideal
Bellinian soprano and it is best to get those out of the way at the outset.
The voice is not really Italianate at heart, not vibrant with emotion, open,
intense; nor does she always drive home a phrase at the point where it
counts (although I note that her final solo, 'Deh] non volerli vittime',
raised the emotional temperature enormously).
In every other respect this was a magnificent display of confident and
secure singing. Miss Eaglen is more ambitious vocally now. Her 't'imploro'
to Adalgisa melted into the softest tone. The cadenza up to a high B in
front of Oroveso was a marvel of floated quiet singing from so big a voice.
It comes as no surprise to read in the programme that her future engagements
are to be in Vienna, Chicago, Paris etc.
As this opera contains some of the finest of Bellini's music, it would seem
to invite the sublime in a production, but all it usually gets is the
ridiculous (remember Covent Garden's pack of neanderthal yokels galumphing
around the stage?) Judge's production has its share of the risible. The
priestesses enter like a chorus-line of Druidic Tiller-girls, clad in the
latest snazzy bronze body jewellery with multi-coloured fans on their heads,
and they wield wicked-looking scythes.
But I must not mock. As productions of Norma go, this one at least has the
advantage of an ingenious set, which gives us a real sacred grove, in which
the Druids can attend to their rites; and Judge is one of the most able at
working with his singers to bring drama, emotion and personality from the
music. From Jane Eaglen he drew far more than the usual stock melodramatic
poses.
It was unfortunate that the scheduled Pollione was only able to act the
role, while another sang from the side of the stage. Katherine Ciesinski
sounded somewhat curdled of tone as Adalgisa, but she was brave enough to
take the top part in her first duet with Norma, when other singers of the
role usually shelter faint-heartedly underneath. Norman Bailey, looking a
Merlin-like elder with long, white locks, was a suitably grave Oroveso.
John Mauceri conducted, giving us every note of the score as it is printed
in most editions, plus the calm ending to the 'Guerra' chorus, which Bellini
cut from his autograph. The ornamentation, worked out during rehearsals, was
among the most stylish of its kind. In fact, all told, this was among
Scottish Opera's finest efforts: the company has provided a fine showcase
for its world-class Norma.
Production sponsored by the Peter Moores Foundation. Further performances at
the Theatre Royal, Glasgow until May 6, then Aberdeen, Edinburgh and
Newcastle

FT  23 APR 93 / Arts: Schiller's 'The Robbers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It amazes me, again and again, that you can so often find rarely-performed
cornerstones of world theatre in London's pub theatres. Right now, in the
Grace Theatre, up above The Latchmere in Battersea, you can see Friedrich
Schiller's first play, The Robbers (Die Rauber, 1780). Liberty] Equality]
You are hurled headlong into a world far from Battersea, far from 1993 - and
yet you know, as you watch, that plays like this, written in a blast of
proto-Romanticism before the French Revolution, helped to create the world
we know today.
It is a double amazement to find such a play in these circumstances, because
Schiller is a mighty hard playwright to bring off in performance today. His
brow is heavy, his tone earnest, and, in The Robbers, he is quicker to
plunge us into a climate of Sturm und Drang and moral/philosophical dilemmas
than he is to create a living, detailed, stage world.
Schiller knew his Shakespeare - as FJ Lamport's Penguin translation (used
here), underlines. The plot opposes two brothers, very much like Edgar and
Edmund in Lear. The younger, Franz, plots against both his brother, Karl,
and their father - wanting not only power but also Karl's beloved Amalia.
Karl, banished, takes to brigandry, using violent methods to destroy the
corrupt rich; and so, ironically, he becomes more criminal and sinful in
practice than his wicked brother.
Both become prey to conscience. Near the play's denouement, they alternate
in soliloquies, like Shakespeare Richard III and Richmond: but their
concerns are right, wrong, justice after death and the soul's immortality.
As Schiller turns either brother's position into anguished metaphysical
speculation, he comes close to such playwrights as Tirso de Molina or (his
near-contemporary and friend-to-be) Goethe. And The Robbers, which has often
seemed an over-lofty play, as it climbs into yet loftier regions,
surprisingly transcends itself, and becomes, in the last resort, wholly
absorbing.
It would take a remarkably sophisticated team of actors to manage the
melodramatic heroism in which Schiller steeps this drama. Paul Miller's cast
consists chiefly of young, good-looking actors. Several of them attend too
much to surface details - brightly intense facial expressions and stiffly
fidgety gestures - and too little to the fomenting Romantic energies
beneath.
But, as Karl, Dominic Taylor delivers a superb performance. He is
marvellously economical and controlled, absolutely in control of every
climax, thrilling in outcry, movingly sincere in quiet reflection. There are
areas of Romantic despair and tragic distraction that he does not yet fill
out, but he shows you the grand shape of this dark hero's mind with power,
virility, stillness, and even wit. And as the play proceeds, it sweeps
everyone else up to his level.
At the Grace Theatre, SW11, until May 1

FT  23 APR 93 / Arts: Bheki Mseleku - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor Bheki Mseleku - everybody so wants him to be The New Thing in jazz. A
co-winner of the Mercury Music Award for album of the year in 1992 with his
much acclaimed Celebration, the gentle South African pianist and sometime
tenor player is the reluctant successor to the Abdullah Ibrahim award for
the cape's most exciting musical export.
Ibrahim, aka Dollar Brand, is firmly established as a stimulating soloist
and an inspiring leader. But Mseleku, a captivating personality who has his
own absorbed sound, seems not yet to have a grip on the wide open spaces of
solo performance. He showed he could lead with the Celebration team but on
Monday's showing, alone in the unforgiving Queen Elizabeth Hall, he offered
little musical relief.
The concert began with promise, a burning joss stick set behind the piano (a
habit of Ibrahim's) before Mseleku walked on breathing rusty melancholia
through the tenor as he did so. After some minor piano chords answered by
Mseleku's grainy and nasal utterances were replaced by flurried notes, the
tone of the long set was cast, however. Perhaps Mseleku, a gentle soul who
dedicates his performances to 'all the masters of spiritual enlightenment
and the great avatars' and an exile from apartheid, was disturbed by the
hideous events unfolding at home on that day, but this was all too flat, for
too long.
At other times, and in a group, the ragged technique which draws as much on
Ellington as it does on the townships, works up waves of ideas which tumble
out poetically. Alone on the South Bank, Mseleku seemed to struggle with
initially interesting arpeggio runs which collided rather than ran together.
Four movements of pre-occupied, superficially soothing improvisation later
and Mseleku was still having trouble shaping ideas. Deliciously tender
cadenzas sliding off the right hand side of the piano and the player's own
quavering vibrato barely made up for the too naive art which went before.
Eventually the addition of Tunde Jegende's kora for the last number added
some depth to the delicate impro.
Monday's meanderings may not have been a good advertisement for the new solo
album, Meditations (Samadhi SA CD 001), and will not prevent Mseleku from
drawing eager crowds to his quartet's UK tour, but it does show that these
are yet early days for this talented musician.
Bheki Mseleku, Marvin 'Smitty' Smith, Michael Bowie and Denys Baptiste UK
tour: June 24, Cheltenham; June 25, Glastonbury Festival; June 26 Bradford
Festival; June 27 Cambridge; June 28, Warwick University; June 29,

The best thing on Fridays is the news quiz Have I Got News For You. Today
the regulars - chairman Angus Deayton and team captains Ian Hislop and Paul
Merton - are joined by Fiona Armstrong whose F-factor was found by breakfast
television to be wanting, and Chris Evans, who has proved to be such a hit
with the kiddiwinks at breakfast time on Channel 4 (10.00 BBC2). That aside,
it seems to be mostly a question of Marks and Spencer drama and old movies.
Among the M &amp; S drama (dependable, inoffensive, middle of the road) is the
hospital series Casualty which is being repeated on BBC1 (8.00); The Chief,
a police series which has proved it can achieve a higher plane from time to
time (9.00 ITV); and The Riff Raff Element which, in some quarters, is
credited with being a rather subtle and successful satire about the English
class system. Long winded and short on jokes would seem nearer the mark
(9.30 BBC1). The movies include a 'colour tinted' version of Fritz Lang's
1926 futurist work Metropolis with large chunks cut out and modern music
(11.35 C4).

FT  23 APR 93 / Management: Nice little earner - Companies and staff have
much to gain and little to lose from tying pay to profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine hundred and ninety five accountants cannot be wrong when it comes to
spotting a good financial deal. When Stoy Hayward asked its 1,000 employees
whether they would like to receive up to one fifth of their salary in
profit-related pay, only five were doubtful.
Accountants are not best known for risk taking, and at Stoy Hayward they
have signed up to a scheme that appears to have little downside. If the
company hits its profits target, employees will be better off by Pounds
1,600 a year. If the company exceeds its target, employees get their share
of the extra. If it does worse, the scheme can protect employees so that in
net pay terms they are probably no worse off than before.
Stoy Hayward is just one of 4,000 UK companies that have introduced
profit-related pay since it became available in 1987. This week the UK
government announced that more than 1m people are receiving PRP, and the
publicity generated has caused the telephones at the Inland Revenue to ring
incessantly. More and more companies want to know how they take advantage of
a scheme.
The original idea was that by linking pay to profits, companies could make
their wage costs variable. Employees would be given an incentive to work
harder, and in good times would reap the rewards, while in bad times would
share the pain.
Roger Young, head of the Institute of Management, purrs over the latest
figures. 'It is very encouraging to see how profit-related pay is taking
off. We need to keep our cost base as flexible as possible.'
It is not clear, though, whether the scheme, which allows companies to pay
employees up to Pounds 4,000 tax free, is working entirely as the government
intended. In August the Inland Revenue closed a loophole which made it easy
for companies to pay out PRP almost irrespective of their performance. But
even with this route closed, the wizards at the accountancy firms appear
able to come up with schemes to do more or less what companies want.
'If you design the scheme carefully you can safeguard employees when profits
fall,' says Sue Bartlett from consultants R Watson &amp; Sons. Most companies
re-submit a new plan every year: those that can predict their profits will
be able almost to choose how much they pay out. Companies with more erratic
profits can limit the effect that these fluctuations have on pay, and they
can also put a cap on profits above which no further bonus need be paid out.
The promise of a big saving on the payroll - which might typically be around
6 per cent - is particularly attractive during the recession. 'Companies are
using these schemes instead of a pay rise,' says Bartlett.
This can be done in two ways, either by introducing PRP as a bonus paid in
addition to existing salary, or by getting employees to swap part of their
salary for a PRP.
A company that has taken the latter route is Asda Property, which is not
paying out any more money this year but has introduced a salary sacrifice
scheme instead. There are no fixed rules on how the tax savings are shared
between companies and employees, but Asda has passed on the full benefit to
give employees a 4-5 per cent net pay rise.
The scheme works so that each month the company pays the same net pay to its
employees as before, distributing the extra at the end of the financial year
when the final profit figure is known. If the company badly misses its
target, and has therefore paid out too much over the year, the Inland
Revenue recoups the money from the employer, not the employee.
'You won't get employees involved if there is too much to lose,' says Paul
Huberman, finance director. 'They won't agree to anything that would mean
their monthly pay would fall, as they've got commitments to meet. After all,
I can't blame my secretary if our profits go down.'
However, because employees stand to gain if the profits go up, he says the
scheme has focused their attention on the company's performance. The scheme
has also proved popular because it gives the same benefit to all employees.
Most of the big companies with PRP have used it as a more tax-efficient
vehicle for paying bonuses than existing schemes in which a profit-related
lump is paid out at the end of the year. The largest company to do so is
Boots, whose scheme covers 56,000 employees. The tax break has given a boost
to the old arrangement - a bonus that previously would have been worth 6 per
cent is now worth closer to 10 per cent. 'The scheme gives our workforce a
greater stake in the business. It means they switch the lights off at night
and don't keep the machinery running,' says Alan Hainsworth, renumeration
manager. It also may have lessened pay claims, he argues.
The Halifax Building Society operates a similar scheme, which has paid out
an annual bonus of between 2 and 10 per cent of employees' salaries over the
last five years. According to David Thornborow, an assistant general
manager, 'staff see that it is not a static give-away every year'.
Some companies have shunned PRP because they prefer incentive schemes based
on individual rather than group performance. But at both Boots and Halifax
the scheme is seen as an addition rather than an alternative to individual
incentives.
The flexibility of PRP means that a suitable plan can be designed for most
companies - at least for those that are making profits. Those that have
little to gain from them are those with very low-paid workers  - who pay
little tax anyway - or with profits so volatile that they are impossible to
predict. Companies may need to adjust pension funds to include expected PRP
as part of final salary.
So far, very large companies have held back from salary sacrifice schemes.
The main problem, according to Brian Friedman of Stoy Hayward, is one of
communication. 'We wrote to everyone setting out the terms. We then
published a booklet about it. We invited staff to briefings, and we ran a
help line to deal with individual inquiries.'
The accountants themselves were convinced. They are now setting out to
convince their clients.

FT  23 APR 93 / Management: Learning to live with a cultural mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU work for an American multinational which is having trouble
introducing a performance-related pay scheme in its French, German and Asian
subsidiaries, even though it has worked well in Britain, Sweden and the
Netherlands? Is your employer a German company which is struggling to apply
Anglo-Saxon methods of 'change management'? Or do you work for an Italian or
Spanish enterprise which is experiencing schizophrenia over the new 'matrix
management' structure being imposed by its US or British parent?
If so, you're suffering from one of the most underrated aspects of
management: culture clash.
If you tend to read only the best-selling business books, or listen just to
the world's top management gurus, you will either be surprised by these
problems or fail to appreciate their disruptive potential. For your
management ideas will have been formed by a mixture of your own cultural
experience and the dominant American view that there is 'one best way' of
resolving any issue - so that a company with a strong corporate culture will
be able to bridge any national differences among its employees around the
world.
Yet consider the evidence presented in a new book* by Frans Trompenaars, a
Franco-Dutchman who worked in nine countries for Shell before becoming a
consultant to the oil group and several other sophisticated cross-cultural
multinationals, as well as 'learners' such as Mars, Kodak, Heineken,
Philips, ICI and Apple. He has also compiled a database of the cultural
characteristics of 15,000 managers and staff from 30 companies in 50
countries.
His conclusions contrast starkly with the notion that the world is becoming
a 'global village', in which a new generation of international managers will
operate easily across borders. Instead, he argues that what works in one
culture will seldom do so in another.
On performance pay, for instance, Trompenaars finds that people in France,
Germany, Italy and large parts of Asia tend not to accept 'that individual
members of the group should excel in a way that reveals the shortcomings of
other members'. On two-way communication, Americans may be motivated by
feedback sessions, while Germans find them 'enforced admissions of failure'.
On more structural issues such as decentralisation and delegation,
approaches that work well in Anglo-Saxon cultures, plus Scandinavia, the
Netherlands and Germany, may prove disastrous in Belgium, France and Spain.
Some of these differences are pretty obvious, and skilful companies have
learned how to accommodate them. But in many cases, especially where the
local culture bottles up problems by discouraging open criticism, the
gung-ho 'universalist' manager will not even perceive them. All he or she
will notice is general dissatisfaction or poor performance.
Trompenaars distinguishes seven basic, but finely nuanced, dimensions of
culture. Five concern the way people deal with each other. They include:
'universalism versus particularism' (behaviour based on general versus
specific relationships); the slightly different 'collectivism versus
individualism' (group-based versus individual behaviour); a 'neutral' versus
expressive attitude to emotions; and the creation of status through
achievement, versus what Trompenaars calls 'affiliation'; this is similar to
the usual juxtaposition of 'personal' and 'positional' power.
A sixth dimension concerns people's attitude to time, especially the future.
The final one is whether, like most Americans and north Europeans, they
strive to mould their environment, or whether they tend to go along with it
more, like most Europeans and some Asians. Contrary to American dogma,
Trompenaars argues that the second group is better at dealing with change.
These dimensions have combined in various ways to create several types of
corporate culture, Trompenaars concludes, with the home culture dominating
in most multinationals. No organisation consists of just one cultural type,
but the mix between them varies considerably. They include:
Family. Typical of Japan, India, Belgium, Italy, Spain and smaller French
companies. Very hierarchical, and more intuitive than rational. Delegation
is difficult because the leader is a father figure who is seen as knowing
better than his subordinates. Matrix and project structures create problems,
since they divide authority and loyalty. Praise is a better motivator than
money.
Eiffel Tower. Typical of large French companies, plus German and Dutch ones.
Also hierarchical, but much more impersonal and rule-driven. Adapts very
slowly to changing environments.
Guided missile. Typical of the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK. This is
much more egalitarian and individualistic, but also impersonal. It can
adjust course rapidly, but not change it completely.
Where does all this leave the struggling multinational and its 'global
managers'? Above all, Trompenaars advises companies to avoid their usual
blanket application of standard, head office-generated American and north
European ways of managing.
Instead he advocates a 'trans-national' approach: a blend of the best from
several cultures which should be applied differently in each country.
Managers must also be trained in cross-cultural awareness and respect, he
says. They must stop seeing cultural problems as other people's
stubbornness.
Trompenaars underplays the gradual narrowing of cultural differences among
some younger globetrotters. But his prescription is a welcome antidote to
blinkered universalism.

FT  23 APR 93 / People: Clean sweep at Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least half a dozen senior executives of Invesco MIM, including the
finance director, have resigned as part of a wideranging reorganisation
designed to restore the image of the troubled fund manager.
In an unexpected decision, Ratan Engineer, finance director since 1989, is
to leave. A number of other staff below board level on the compliance and
legal side, as well as two fund managers, are also departing.
Charles Brady, who has recently assumed the title of executive chairman, is
attempting to improve the image of the group which has been affected by
episodes including the Maxwell affair.
He is working closely with the new head of European operations, Norman
Riddell.
In January, Bob Wilkinson, former head of surveillance at the London Stock
Exchange, was hired as a consultant to Brady, with a brief to improve group
compliance procedures.
Wilkinson is also reporting to Imro, the pension fund management regulatory
organisation, which has been conducting a long-running investigation into
Invesco's compliance affairs.
The Imro inquiry is likely to be concluded in the next month or so.
There have been redundancies connected with the recent loss of Drayton Asia
investment trust to a rival group EFM Dragon.

FT  23 APR 93 / Technology: Vorsprung durch aluminium - Audi and Alcoa are
preparing to launch a tough but lightweight luxury car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Audi launches its latest top-of-the-range luxury car next spring it
will be the culmination of one of the few joint venture projects between a
European and a US company to have reached a successful outcome. For the car
will be built mainly of aluminium, using technology jointly developed by
Audi, the up-market subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen group, and the
Aluminium Company of America, the western world's biggest aluminium group.
How was it possible for companies with such different cultures to stay the
course during the 11 years the project - called the aluminium intensive
vehicle project - needed to come to fruition?
The answer, it seems, is that the bosses at both companies were personally
involved at the start, were dedicated to the project, and never gave up
pushing for its ultimate success.
Audi and Alcoa set themselves some daunting objectives and it was not clear
until well into the project that these could be achieved. As Heinrich Timm,
manager of the Audi team involved in the project and an engineer who has
been with it since the start, says: 'At the begining nobody could guarantee
that the concept would work.'
The companies set out to design and build an all-aluminium car. But
aluminium is much more expensive than steel, the traditional material used
for car construction, so it was not going to be viable simply to substitute
aluminium for other materials in most of the components.
Instead, the partners set out to design a car that had many fewer individual
components and structures than were used in steel vehicles. This involved
developing new aluminium alloys which would be safer than steel - which
would crumple in a controlled way, for example, if a vehicle was in a crash.
At the same time, it was recognised that constructing an aluminium car would
require a very different approach from the conventional car assembly line.
New production processes had to be developed too.
Consequently, there were many times when the dedication of the men at the
top was tested. There were times when engineers began to believe some of the
objectives simply could not be reached; times when accountants asked
searching questions about the budgets.
But the bosses would not accept defeat. At Audi there was Ferdinand Piech,
the 'father' of the project and Audi's chairman, until he was promoted
recently to become chairman of the Volkswagen group. He believed Audi was
underrated in the car market and deserved a 'place at the top table' with
German rivals BMW and Mercedes, and Jaguar of the UK.
He also believed that Audi would not gain this recognition by producing
'me-too' cars which simply copied the virtues of those made by the
competition. Audi needed to set itself apart by taking a technological lead
over its rivals. With this objective in mind, 11 years ago Audi launched the
world's first four-wheel-drive saloon car, the Quattro. Audi also started to
use galvanised steel to make its cars more rust-resistant.
Piech was already thinking about the next generation of Audi cars when he
put his proposition to Alcoa. There it was seized on with enthusiasm by Fred
Fetterolf, Alcoa's president until he retired two years ago, who could see
it might well provide an important new market for aluminium. The joint
venture was up and running in 1982.
Although many objectives were set, there were no deadlines. This removed a
great deal of pressure from the Audi and Alcoa engineering teams but it also
increased the chances that one or both of the bosses would run out of
enthusiasm or patience. In the event, it was the engineers who sometimes
temporarily ran out of of steam. 'But whenever we suggested we should stop
the project because we did not think we could find solutions, they said we
must carry on,' Timm recalls.
This backing, needed several times during the past 11 years, was
unstintingly given even when Audi and Alcoa ran into troubled times. For
example, Audi lost ground in its most-important export market, the
highly-competitive US luxury car market, because of the bad publicity that
arose when some customers experienced unexpected acceleration problems.
As for Alcoa, there were even some years, in the wake of the oil supply
crises in the 1970s, when some of US group's senior managers seemed to have
lost faith in the future of aluminium, a metal whose production process
absorbs huge amounts of energy.
Throughout that difficult period Fetterolf remained steadfastly behind the
AIV (aluminium intensive vehicle) project.
'We are very happy with the association with Alcoa,' says Franz-Josef
Kortum, who has taken over from Mr Piech as Audi's chairman. 'It works very
well because both sides are dedicated to show the world this concept will
work and can bring the world new technology. Alcoa is fighting for the
aluminium story and we also have much to gain. We can make our slogan
Vorsprung durch Technik come to life.'
From the outset it was decided each of the companies would pay its own
costs. It was expected that during the research and development phase those
costs would fall about equally on each of them. From this early work they
developed special aluminium alloys for a spaceframe, a skeleton-like car
body structure, composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings which can
be welded by robots. This compares with the conventional car structure that
requires spot welding of as many as 300 stamped steel components. The new
aluminium alloys and castings processes improve the metal's strength and
toughness, enhance its 'crushability' - the ability to crumple evenly and
predictably - and its shock absorption.
For car makers, the new technology offers several advantages: it cuts the
weight of a car's body by about 35 per cent compared with traditional steel
bodies without reducing the vehicle's size; it reduces tooling expense by as
much as 50 per cent, and cuts the number of parts to be stocked and the time
taken from design to production.
The partners agreed that, at a certain point, they would go their own ways
with the technology. Alcoa has built a Dollars 70m (Pounds 46m) plant at
Soest in Germany to produce the spaceframes and other aluminium components
for Audi and will be offering the technology - and products from the Soest
plant - to other car makers.
Audi has spent about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to bring its new luxury car to the
market. Kortum says: 'This is our most important project. We are trying for
the second time for success in this segment of the car market and this is a
great challenge for the company. But we will set new standards in this
segment. We have changed the rule that says the bigger and better the car,
the heavier it must be. It is true that cars generally have improved
enormously, but the weight has increased enormously too.'
He says the new Audi will offer drivers 'a new experience because of its
light weight, stiffness and rigidity and safety'. Many will find its
performance and low fuel consumption astonishing. 'And this is because it is
built of aluminium.'
Kortum says, however, it is not yet possible to promise that all Audi's cars
will one day be using this technology. At present the process is economic
only for production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year but the partners are
looking for ways to make longer runs viable.
In the meantime, before the new car is launched Audi's biggest marketing
challenge, ironically, is to undo some of the aluminium industry's work in
promoting the metal as the ideal, recyclable, material for beverage cans and
other types of packaging. Kortum says: 'Our marketing must emphasise that
all aircraft and rockets use this material. We must re-educate people so
that they associate aluminium with high technology, not with something you
throw away when you have finished with it.'

FT  23 APR 93 / People: Liberty carries the torch for Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard on the heels of the appointment of two part-time directors, Liberty has
decided to split the two top executive roles at the upmarket fabric and
fashion group, bringing in Patrick Austen from BTR as chief executive. Harry
Weblin, who is 63, will remain as executive chairman.
John Pugh, finance director, denies the move was solely inspired by
pressures from Brian Myerson, the London-based South African investor whose
attempts to secure voting rights for all the company's shares at last
summer's egm were roundly trounced but who still holds 15.77 per cent of the
voting and nearly 8 per cent of the non-voting stock.
'(Splitting the roles) was on Mr Myerson's agenda, but it was also on
Cadbury's agenda. Moreover, the search was made with a view to Harry's
retirement in a couple of years' time. A happy coincidence,' according to
Pugh, who adds that the search has been going on for 'not quite a year'.
Myerson, meanwhile, who says he was introduced to the new man three weeks
ago but was not directly involved in picking him, thinks he 'has all the
credentials to do the job. I spoke to him this morning and wished him lots
of luck - and I don't I mean that sarcastically.'
Austen, 49, is being hired not for his retailing skills - Weblin, an
ex-Harrods executive, has those - but for his brand savvy and textiles
experience. With 22 years at ICI Fibres under his belt, albeit handling
rather different fabrics from Liberty silk, he moved to Pretty Polly in
1983, just before BTR acquired its then owner Thomas Tilling.
He is credited with the vigorous expansion of Pretty Polly sales. Since 1987
he has been chief executive of the consumer products group of BTR - which
includes brands such as Dunlop and Slazenger - a division which turns over
Pounds 250m annually and employs some 3,700 staff.
And how will the hard-nosed BTR approach go down at the genteel Regent
Street headquarters? 'Any form of discipline is going to be good for the
company,' Pugh counters, while others comment that Austen, a keen golfer and
blue water sailor, is notably more relaxed than some of his erstwhile
colleagues.

FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): White mineral blocks the sun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who spend their summer holidays worrying whether the sun is
damaging their skin, Masta, part of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, has developed a sunblock which, it believes, has
advantages over existing cosmetic creams.
The lotion, a healthcare rather than a cosmetic preparation, contains the
mineral titanium dioxide. It provides a sun protection factor of 15 against
UVA and UVB rays.
Titanium dioxide provides the white pigment in paint. In the adult
formulation of the lotion the whitening is minimised, but for children it is
retained to indicate whether the child's skin has been completely covered.

Japanese electronics company NEC has developed a computer system that can
identify famous pictures from rough sketches drawn on the screen.
The Intellectual Image Search System uses pattern recognition technology to
analyse the colour and composition of a sketch and matches it with the most
appropriate image in its database.
As well as innumerable multimedia uses in education, NEC predicts that the
system could be used to catch criminals by matching rough sketches drawn by
witnesses to images on a police database. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6511.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If you want to prevent tooth decay you should be choosy about the type of
artificial sweetener in your chewing gum, according to research from the
Central American country of Belize.
The 28-month study of 1,000 10-year-olds, conducted by Kauko Makinen of the
University of Michigan Dental School, showed that children who regularly
chewed xylitol-sweetened gum had half the new cavities of children who
chewed gum containing rival sweeteners.
The research was sponsored by Leaf, of Finland, which makes gum containing
xylitol. Xylitol is found in fruits and plants and produced commercially
from birchwood. Makinen says that unlike other sweeteners, xylitol helps
neutralise plaque acids and so promotes natural remineralisation. Leaf: UK,

<TEXT>
Many companies are considering whether to replace their thermal fax machines
with plain paper models. Muratec, a subsidiary of Murata Machinery of Japan,
believes it has come up with the best of both worlds - a thermal fax machine
that prints on plain paper.
Because the F-70 uses inkfilm transfer thermal printing, in which the image
is transferred from the inkfilm to the paper, the costs are stable - 2.5p a
sheet. But the use of plain paper means the document does not fade, curl or
need photocopying before filing. Muratec: UK, 0737 780178.

'Damaged in transit' is an all too frequent expression, but for many small
valuable items, such as china or electronic components, it could soon become

cardboard frame.
A sheet of the bio-degradable film, developed by Wolff Walsrode, in Germany,

<TEXT>
Burton, the UK fashion retailing group, confirmed yesterday that John
Coleman had resigned as head of its Dorothy Perkins division. The company
would not comment on the reason for Coleman's departure, but there is
speculation that he is being considered for other senior retail positions.
He will be replaced by Stuart Rose, managing director of Burton's Evans
chain.
Rose, 44, spent the first 17 years of his retail career with Marks and
Spencer, 12 of them in the food division. For the final 18 months he worked
at M and S's highly successful Boulevard Haussmann branch in Paris.
He joined Burton in 1989 and worked as a buying and merchandising director
at the Debenhams department store chain before joining Evans.
Rose's eventual replacement at Evans will be Nick Hollingworth, managing
director of IS, the discount retailer that comes under the Evans umbrella.

FT  23 APR 93 / People: Bowman bows out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The search is on at accountants Price Waterhouse for a new chairman of its
European firm, following the announcement that Sir Jeffery Bowman, the
incumbent, is to retire this autumn.
Sir Jeffery, 58, has been chairman since the creation of the pan-European
structure when UK and European firms combined in 1988. He has helped guide
the integration of the firms since.
'I could go on until I am 60 in 1995 but I have been in pretty senior
positions for about 11 years and I came to the conclusion that now was the
right time for a change,' he said.
Sir Jeffery was previously senior partner of PW in the UK from 1982-91, and
had been with the firm since 1958. He was joint chief executive of the PW
world organisation from 1990 to 1992 and joint chairman since 1992.
He says he plans to travel less, play more golf, stay at home and take life
a little more easily. 'But I have no doubt that something will come up,' he
adds.
An electoral college of about one-tenth of the firm's European partners is
currently considering candidates to replace him after he leaves on September
30. Nominations are expected to be complete by July.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Property Market: Hammer falls on the last of the old
school - Vanessa Houlder on the departure of Sydney Mason after more than
four decades at Hammerson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Sydney Mason, the autocratic 72 year-old chairman of Hammerson,
retires this summer, it will be the end of an era for the property company
he has dominated for the past 34 years.
Mr Mason has been virtually synonymous with the group since he took over as
chairman from Lew Hammerson in 1958. Although he relinquished the post of
managing director in 1988, the company is still perceived as his personal
fiefdom.
His retirement will also mark the end of an era for the industry. Mr Mason
is the last surviving member of the postwar generation of property tycoons,
the last of the men of the old school.
Mr Mason's retirement is widely seen as long overdue. Nonetheless his
colleagues talk reverently of his 'gut feeling' for property, his
instinctive ability to size up the value of a deal. 'He has a nose for
property; he can smell a deal,' says Mr John Parry, Hammerson's managing
director. 'He is street wise.'
Much of this nous comes from experience, a matter of knowing the finer
details of every deal in the market. Mr Mason expects the same standards
from his advisers. When he travels abroad to inspect a building, agents are
well advised to memorise the details of every building on the route from the
airport to the city.
For his part, Mr Mason credits the group's growth to 'good luck' and
'location'. The advantages of sticking to central, prime locations has been
at the heart of the group's philosophy. He is scathing about the foolishness
of venturing into areas like the London Docklands. 'Every British developer
could have done the docklands at any point over the past 20 years,' he says.
Mr Mason claims that it was comparatively simple to build up a property
group in a period when properties could be financed without relying on
rising rent reviews. 'We started in a modest way and grew by internal
growth. It was relatively easy.'
But Hammerson's evolution was not a passive affair. Much of the skill behind
its growth came in piecing together development sites without alerting
potential sellers and forcing up land prices. The company put together 12
different sites for Woolgate House in the City of London, and assembled five
sites for a retail complex at Brent Cross, the UK's first out-of-town
shopping centre, which took 17 years to bring together.
Likewise Hammerson became noted for its ventures abroad. It developed
properties and acquired companies in continental Europe, Canada, Australasia
and the US, making it the most international of the large UK groups.
Mr Mason has described his early years in the business as one of 'pirates
and buccaneers'. But in the second half of the 1980s, the group was
increasingly criticised for being too cautious and failing to exploit rising
property values.
When in 1988 Rodamco, a Dutch investment group, made a bid for Hammerson, it
said: 'During a period of buoyant growth in the UK property sector,
Hammerson has lost its way and has failed to take full and profitable
advantage of an active market.'
Rodamco's Pounds 1.3bn bid was foiled when Standard Life, the Scottish
insurance group, came to Hammerson's rescue. Standard increased its stake in
Hammerson from 17.8 per cent to 29 per cent by paying Pounds 11 a share for
its ordinary shares. Standard's loyalty has so far been poorly rewarded: the
ordinary shares yesterday stood at Pounds 3.20.
But for all Hammerson's conservatism, the company has not been immune from
investment disasters. In October 1991, it had to write off Pounds 90m
against a single property in New York. It has recently made a Pounds 12.9m
provision against land at Mississauga in Canada.
Hammerson's international spread of businesses has also served it badly. It
has been exposed to currency fluctuations while the simultaneous decline of
most of the world's property markets has meant that it has reaped few
benefits from its policy of diversification.
The group's net asset values and earnings per share have also fallen below
the level of a decade ago. It is no longer the UK's third largest property
company; both British Land and Slough Estates have larger market
capitalisations. This week Hammerson announced it was to reduce by more than
half its dividend, from 20.5p to 10p.
Its gearing of 114 per cent is acknowledged by the company to be too high,
although Hammerson plays down its need to raise more cash. 'You don't want
to reduce your gearing too much at the bottom of the cycle,' says Mr Parry.
Nonetheless, nothing can be ruled out until Hammerson's new management has
got its feet under the desk. A rights issue may still be on the cards,
perhaps to the tune of Pounds 200m. That would stem the need to sell more
assets, which does little for the group's cash flow since income from
property would broadly equal interest costs. A rights issue would even allow
the company to turn from seller to buyer.
The company's new chairman will be Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman of
Sears. The new chief executive will be Mr Ron Spinney, a former managing
director of Greycoat, who will replace Mr Parry, who also retires this
summer.
Mr Maitland Smith promises 'evolution not revolution'. One of the
management's first tasks will be to conduct a review of Hammerson's
strategy: This will examine:
the constraints imposed by Hammerson's policy of owning a relatively small
number of big properties around the world;
the company's management structure and its perceived failure to bring in
young talent;
and the geographical and sectoral balance of its portfolio.
For the first time since 1949 when he joined the group, Mr Mason will not be
playing a part in the group's strategy. He is clearly disappointed at
stepping down at one of the lowest points in the group's fortunes. 'After 40
years during which we have had sustained growth in value, dividends and
share prices, to go out at the bottom is sad,' he said.
Although Mr Mason will maintain a link with the company as life president
and a non-executive director, he will no longer exercise any real influence.
'I won't be breathing down Ron Spinney's neck,' he promises.
He is cautiously optimistic about Hammerson's future, playing tribute to Mr
Spinney's background and knowledge. He says 'time will tell' what the change
of management will do for the company. 'I can only hope it will be a highly
successful decision,' he says.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont row forces expenses rule
shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over the Treasury's help towards the private legal expenses of
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, led yesterday to revised rules on the use
of public money for matters related to ministers' personal affairs.
The government guidelines, drawn up by the Cabinet Office, say 'great care'
must be exercised when public funds are offered towards extra personal costs
arising from ministers' public duties. Departmental accounting officers
should always be consulted.
The guidelines were written after discussions with government law officers
and after a review recommended by the Commons public accounts committee in
February.
The committee expressed regret that the Treasury had not highlighted in its
accounts the decision to pay Pounds 4,700 towards the Pounds 22,000 costs of
evicting an unwanted tenant from Mr Lamont's private home.
The guidelines say that 'in exceptional cases, particularly those in which
the private interests of ministers are involved, consideration should also
be given to informing the comptroller and auditor-general of any payment
which it is decided to make'.
The rules accept there is justification for sometimes using public funds to
offset private loss when ministers are faced with unavoidable extra costs as
a result of their official position.
'In cases which are not clear-cut, considerations of propriety and public
defensibility must be paramount,' they add. 'As a general rule, it is right
to err on the side of caution in the use of public funds,' the rules say.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major promises bill to ease red
tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday promised the early publication of a 'deregulation
bill' - in spite of continuing tensions between cabinet ministers over the
content of the legislative programme in parliament's next session.
The prime minister told the Commons that he hoped proposals for streamlining
official bureaucracy 'will be brought before the House before too long.'
But separately the cabinet postponed an expected discussion on the
legislative programme for the parliamentary session starting in the autumn.
It emerged that the cabinet committee chaired by Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, has still to decide which bills it proposes to recommend. The
time taken up during the current parliamentary session by the Maastricht
bill has caused a backlog of legislative proposals from Whitehall
departments.
Mr Major wants to present the next session's programme as radical but is
also anxious to avoid unnecessarily splits in the Tory party with
contentious legislation.
Final decisions have still to be taken on whether to include controversial
legislation on equalising male and female state retirement ages, on Sunday
trading and on the de-regulation of London buses.
One casualty has been the Department of Trade and Industry's plans for
privatising the Post Office which has been put off until at least 1994 amid
evidence of Tory disquiet.
Instead the DTI will concentrate on the deregulation initiative headed by
minister Mr Neil Hamilton, and on privatisation of British Coal. Mr Major
said unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy, 'stifles industry and
enterprise,' adding: 'We have to beware of over-implementation of
regulations whether from Whitehall, Brussels, county hall or town hall.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, gave a new warning last night that
Britain's competitiveness would be endangered if the government's refusal to
accede to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty was overturned by the
Commons.
He refused to speculate about the government's response to such an
eventuality when agreeing that MPs should have a separate vote on the
principle of the social chapter before the bill enacting the treaty in UK
law takes effect.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's spokesman on Europe, hailed the acceptance of
a new clause providing for the separate vote as marking another 'government
surrender' during the passage of the Maastricht legislation.
He claimed that as a result a 'time-bomb was ticking away' under the
government.
Mr Robertson explained that Labour would use the opportunity provided by the
separate vote to ask the House to instruct the government not to ratify the
Maastricht treaty unless it agreed to accept the social chapter.
He said the government would not be able to 'wriggle away' from such a
challenge, and that those Conservative Euro-sceptics who had argued that the
Maastricht treaty was unacceptable with or without the social chapter, would
find themselves on the spot.
Mr Hurd said the government had agreed to the separate vote on the principle
of the social chapter because it believed its view would prevail.
Refusing to answer hypothetical questions about the government's attitude in
the event of the result going the other way he said 'we will take one step
at a time'.
In the course of a series of clashes with Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd
repudiated the view of Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East,
that Britain could be forced by her EC partners to adopt burdensome health
and safety and other provisions even if it remained outside the social
chapter.
The foreign secretary insisted that Britain would resist such attempts and,
if necessary, challenge them in the European Court of Justice.
He stressed that the social chapter would 'substantially enlarge the risks'
and by adding to the costs of commerce and industry make it still more
difficult for Britain to compete with overseas countries, particularly
Taiwan and South Korea.
Mr Hurd maintained that acceptance of the social chapter would be like a
householder who had already been burgled deciding to opt for an open door
with a welcome mat.
Mr Robertson said the people of Britain were entitled to the rights and
protection which the social chapter provided.
In the final speech from the Labour front bench Ms Joyce Quin complained
that the foreign secretary had 'skated over' the implications of a
government defeat on the social chapter.
The committee stage, which occupied 163 hours extended over 23 days and
included contributions by 161 MPs, was concluded.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tricky time still faces the treaty
 -David Owen tracks the remaining hurdles for the Maastricht bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S completion of the Maastricht bill's marathon committee stage
does not guarantee the government a problem-free run to ratification.
The Commons report stage looks set to get under way early next month. The
second Danish referendum on May 18 will be followed quickly - if the Danes
vote Yes - by what should be a comparatively untroubled third reading
debate.
After that the bill moves to the House of Lords where Euro-sceptic peers
spearheaded by Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit may try to delay it further and
will press the case for a referendum.
The Commons would be able to vote out any amendments inserted by the Lords
but this would require an additional debate that the government wants to
avoid.
If the measure is still on course, there is an outside chance the government
could trip up in an eleventh-hour debate on the treaty's social chapter, due
to come after Maastricht has been made part of British law.
The critical question at next month's report stage is whether Labour manages
to engineer a vote on its amendment 27 which would delete the protocol
containing Britain's opt out from the social chapter.
This is the only mechanism yet devised which might force the government to
choose between the social chapter and the treaty without requiring at least
some Tory Euro-sceptics first to vote explicitly for the chapter.
The Liberal Democrats have also indicated they will make forcing the
government to embrace the social chapter their main priority during the
report stage.
After an average of nearly 40 minutes devoted in committee to each word of
the bill, progress through report will be comparatively rapid.
The bill's passage through the Lords is arguably the least predictable
obstacle - rules of procedure in the Upper House provide anti-Maastricht
peers with virtually limitless scope to delay it.
This flexibility is rarely exploited to its limit. But with emotions running
high and a passionate anti-Maastricht campaign in prospect, the government
may have to bide its time for a month or two.
The question of a Maastricht referendum - decisively rejected by MPs in the
early hours of yesterday morning - is expected to be among the most ardently
debated subjects in the Lords, particularly if the Danish plebiscite
resulted in a narrow 'Yes' vote.
The likelihood of a difficult Lords passage has been increased by the
disenchantment of some prominent peers with the government's recent Commons
manoeuvrings.
If all else fails, Tory Euro-sceptics could make a last-ditch effort to
derail the treaty by voting explicitly for the social chapter - which they
loathe - in a separate debate due to take place after the bill has received
Royal Assent.
If they did so, Mr John Major could be forced to choose between accepting
the social chapter, from which he took such pains to negotiate a British
opt-out, and tearing up the treaty.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC aid for Scots/Ulster power link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs yesterday that
the European Community was prepared to make a contribution toward the cost
of construction of an electricity interconnector under the Irish Sea, which
would provide the first electricity power link between Scotland and the
province.
Last year the go-ahead was given for a gas pipeline from Scotland to Ulster.
Sir Patrick said: 'The European Commission will be contributing 35 per cent
of the costs of the interconnector as it fits in very well with the policy
of trans-European networks.'
He said an interconnector would end the isolation of the Northern Ireland
electricity system and increase security of supply. But he stressed the
go-ahead was subject to planning permission.
Mr William Ross, Ulster Unionist MP for Londonderry East, said it was vital
that Northern Ireland's electricity industry was allowed to compete fairly
via the interconnector in supplying power.
Sir Patrick said it would be advantageous if there was competition
introduced into the supply of electricity to Ulster.
But Labour's Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) protested:
'It will bring expensive electricity from Scotland, rather than cheaper
electricity generated in Northern Ireland from lignite, coal and gas.'
Sir Patrick said the claims of lignite would be taken into account.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Newbury challengers press Tories
over policy on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORIES came under renewed pressure yesterday in the Newbury by-election
campaign over their plans to extend value added tax.
The issue is threatening to become the single greatest force behind a
protest vote against the Conservatives.
Despite a press conference in the barn of a racing stables - intended to
highlight the Budget's resolution of the problems of VAT on bloodstock - Mr
Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate, was again thrown on to the defensive
about the VAT extension to domestic fuel from next April.
Sir John Cope, a Treasury minister, insisted that the government did not
intend to widen the VAT base beyond what it had announced, and denied that
the fate of the Conservatives' election promises on tax meant that
assurances now about future intensions could not be believed.
The issue is likely to dominate today also, as Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, joins the campaign. Mr Davidson said he was delighted that 'the
man who's guiding Britain's recovery' was coming to Newbury, but the other
parties sounded similarly pleased.
Even before the incentive of Mr Lamont's appearance, both Labour and the
Liberal Democrats have been intensifying their campaign on VAT.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat candidate and the main challenger to
the Tory majority, said that more than 1,000 people had so far given their
support to his petition against the tax change. He talked of 'very real
anger' in the constituency, saying that it was not confined to people who
feared they might not be able to afford higher bills.
Mr Steve Billcliffe, the Labour candidate, challenged Mr Davidson to say
whether he would vote in the Commons against the change if he were elected;
and whether he would vote against any proposal to extend VAT to food.
MPs will have a full day's debate in the Commons on imposing VAT on domestic
fuel soon after the by-election on May 6, as part of their discussion of the
finance bill.
A record number of 19 candidates are standing in the by-election. One of the
late entrants to the race was Mr John Browne, the former Tory MP for
Winchester, who was de-selected by his local party and stood unsuccessfully
at the general election as an independent Conservative.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reynolds renews Irish unity call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the Irish prime minister, last night reiterated his wish
to see a united Ireland but conceded that a more conciliatory approach is
needed towards the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.
In a speech in the US on policy towards Northern Ireland he also ruled out
any concessions on the Republic of Ireland's constitution as a pre-condition
for renewed all-party talks.
Mr Reynolds' statements are his strongest yet and appear to have been made
in response to backbench criticism that his government's Ulster policy is
being dictated by the Labour party, Fianna Fail's coalition partners.
The Irish government recently welcomed a meeting between Mr John Hume, the
SDLP leader and Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA. The meeting was strongly condemned by Unionist leaders.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will set out more of his
thinking on the province in a speech today.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Customs 'lax' over tax avoidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise has taken insufficient measures to deal with tax
avoidance, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday, Andrew Jack
writes.
In a report it said the department has little information on the incidence
and tax at risk from avoidance of payment.
It expressed concern that Customs had not done enough to monitor the
effectiveness of measures on tax avoidance. It criticised the lack of
central co-ordination of Customs' work in countering avoidance and stressed
that the department had acknowledged that the arrangements were inadequate.
Customs said it had created a headquarters team to improve co-ordination on
tax avoidance, and was meeting traders and improving training and guidance
in local offices to deal with the topic.
It dismissed suggestions that traders might be forced to pay assessments
under pressure from officials.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Parties jostle to fight off
election battle fatigue - The Tories have most to lose in next month's local
polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives are promising that this time the recovery is real. Labour
is attempting to play the competence card. The Liberal Democrats are
pledging grassroots diligence. So far, the electorate seems unmoved.
The elections in 47 shire counties across England and Wales on May 6 are the
first real test of the mood of the country since last April's general
election. If they so choose, 25m adults can cast their votes.
In theory, control of up to a dozen councils could change hands, with all
that entails for local spending, education, law and order and social
policies.
The powers of local authorities have been curbed greatly during the
Conservatives' 14-year reign, but they still hold significant sway over
their citizens.
The elections have broader implications. Along with the Newbury by-election
on the same day, they might severely dent Mr John Major's hopes that his
beleaguered government has turned the corner. An unexpectedly good
performance would buttress Mr Major's claim that his administration has
drawn a line under the traumas of the past year.
The Tories start with most to lose. When the counties last went to the polls
in 1989, they emerged with control of 18 of the 39 English shire counties.
Labour took eight in their traditional northern strongholds.
The newly merged Liberal Democrats took only the Isle of Wight. The
remaining 12 were left with no party in overall control. In Wales, Labour
took four councils, leaving two in the hands of independents and two with no
party in control.
Privately, ministers have sought to contain expectations by suggesting they
might lose both Newbury and control of up to six councils. But preparing the
ground now will not make the prime minister feel any better on May 7 if the
predictions prove accurate.
For the opposition parties, the opportunities are not commensurate with the
risks facing the government. The shire counties are Labour's weakest ground.
The results will not reflect its 10-15-point lead in national opinion polls.
Mr John Smith would regard anything close to 40 per cent of votes cast as a
triumph.
Mr Paddy Ashdown has higher hopes. A strong Liberal Democrat performance
would provide the party with the public profile it has been denied since the
election. Combined with victory in Newbury - the Liberal Democrats need a 9
per cent swing - it might also give Mr Smith another shove along the road to
electoral reform.
None of the parties could claim that their campaigns have ignited the
enthusiasm of a sullen electorate. The politicians have indulged in
ritualistic mud-slinging at occasional press conferences and in party
political broadcasts. Ministers and their shadows have been despatched to
boost local party activists' morale. But the campaign has done little to
dispel the mood of battle fatigue at Westminster.
The election battlegrounds are familiar. Local issues - council tax bills,
schools, crime statistics - have dominated doorstep campaigning. But the
economy will act as a powerful influence on the voters.
The harsh impact on the south of the middle-class recession has left the
Conservatives vulnerable to the classic protest of their party's supporters
 -a vote in local elections for the Liberal Democrats.
But confirmation in the latest economic indicators that recovery is under
way is sustaining government hopes that the results may be disappointing
rather than disastrous.
The second Tory theme is equally familiar: the Conservatives cost you less.
In a foretaste of things to come, Mr Smith has decided to fight the Tories
on their own ground. Selective use of statistics (of which both sides are
guilty) is being used to promote a Labour image of cost-consciousness and
competence.
If the Conservatives' ambition on May 6 is to limit the damage, Labour's is
to set off again on the long haul back to persuading the voters it can be
economically prudent as well as socially ambitious.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Design role for road builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL road schemes worth up to Pounds 40m are to be considered for a new form
of contract making roadbuilders responsible for designing as well as
constructing highways, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced
yesterday.
He said that the design-and-build contracts should ensure greater certainty
over timings and costs of projects.
Up to a third of all contracts would be awarded in this way within three or
four years. They would replace arrangements by which consultants are
commissioned to design a road before the construction contract is put out to
tender.
The move follows successful trials of two schemes, and a further four
schemes, totalling Pounds 118m will also be built under the new contracts.

FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Anger over Shephard letter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEACHERS' unions last night reacted angrily to proposals for tightening
Britain's union laws set out in a letter from Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, to Mr John Patten, education secretary.
Mr Patten has announced a review of the National Curriculum and associated
tests but has stubbornly refused to offer further concessions to the
teachers. He has been buoyed by support for his hardline stance from
Conservative MPs but adopting Mrs Shephard's proposals would be a radical
step.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, which
leaked the letter, said: 'Educational change brought about by force and
without the professional support of teachers is unlikely to be effective in
our schools.'
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said the proposed move would be
'offensive' and 'heavy-handed'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the
National Association of Head Teachers, which is not affiliated to the TUC,
said any attempt to change the law was 'disgraceful'.
Mr Fraser Younson, an employment law partner at Baker &amp; McKenzie, the City
firm, said: 'This is the first time since the 1906 Trade Disputes Act that
such a substantive change has been made to the subject matter of a trade
dispute. It broadens the impact well beyond teachers - it seems to invite
litigation in many other areas, including health and safety.'
The letter is as follows:
Dear John,
Industrial action to prevent the performance of statutory duties
As you know I have been considering a possible amendment to the law to make
it clear beyond doubt that industrial action is unlawful if, as in the case
of the threatened teachers' boycott of English tests, it is clearly designed
to frustrate the carrying out of a specific statutory duty. A change to the
law could be made while the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill is
still before Parliament.
The advice I have received indicates that it would be possible to introduce
a provision to remove immunity where the principal or sole demand is that
workers should not be required to do work which is necessary in order to
carry out a specific statutory duty on the employer. The aim would be to
make industrial action such as that presently contemplated by the teachers'
union unlawful, even where it could be argued that the dispute came within
the current definition of the trade dispute.
It is important to be clear about what my proposal would and would not do.
It would not make it unlawful, for example, for trade unions to demand a
substantial pay rise as the 'price' of agreeing to do work required by a
statutory duty. That would remain a lawful trade dispute. It follows that
some disputes would become unlawful whilst others would remain lawful, even
though they had the same impact on services. For example, in the teachers'
case, a boycott which derived from opposition to the principle of the tests
would not have immunity, but a boycott over whether teachers should be paid
more for supervising the tests would have immunity.
It would, of course, be possible to withdraw immunity from any industrial
action which interfered with the performance of statutory duties. This would
be a much more wide-ranging change. It would, in practice, remove immunity
from any industrial action in large areas where the public sector and highly
significant parts of the private sector as well. It would be highly
controversial, and would be attacked by our opponents as tantamount to the
removal of the 'right to strike' from public sector employees. I do not
think we should contemplate going that far. My proposal is designed to deal
only with industrial action whose specific purpose is to prevent an employer
from carrying out a statutory duty.
A change in the law of this kind would be fully in accord with the other
changes to the statutory immunity for organising industrial action which we
have made in our trade union legislation since 1979. In combination with the
'Citizen's Charter' proposal in what is now clause 21 of the Bill, it would
mean that the parents of the child who was denied a test as a result of an
unlawful boycott would be able to seek an injunction to get the boycott
removed, If the unions did not call off the boycott they would be in
contempt of court and at risk of fines and ultimately sequestration of their
funds.
In making the case for the amendment it would of course be necessary to
refer specifically to the threatened boycott of English tests as evidence of
the need for a change in the law but we would make it clear that our
intention was to deal with any industrial action whose purpose was to
frustrate the will of Parliament.
I would be glad to know whether you and other colleagues agree that we
should introduce an amendment of this kind while the current Bill is still
before Parliament. If you agree that we should proceed in this way,
introductions to Parliamentary Counsel - on which my officials will, of
course, consult yours and those of other interested departments - will need
to be prepared urgently. The Bill has now been introduced into the Lords and
Committee stage there is due to be completed before Easter.
I am copying this letter to the PM, other members of the Cabinet, the
Attorney General and Sir Robin Butler.

FT  23 APR 93 / Health dangers ruled out at waste plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE hazardous-waste incin-eration plant of Rechem International in south
Wales has been confirmed as a source of PCB and dioxin contamination after a
two-year study. But the levels detected are stated not to pose any
significant risk to the food chain or to health.
The plant, set up 20 years ago close to residential areas in the Panteg part
of Pontypool in Gwent, has long been the source of controversy, most
recently when there were plans - subsequently abandoned - to ship hazardous
waste to it from Germany.
The Pounds 432,000 survey, published yesterday, is described by the Welsh
Office, which commissioned it from the University of East Anglia, as the
most sophisticated environmental study of PCBs ever undertaken in the UK.
It concludes that PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxin levels in the
Panteg area are normal for urban areas in the UK, with the exception of a
limited area in which they reach levels seen in contaminated industrial
sites.
Two areas of heavy contamination were found within the Rechem site, although
one might be due to a historical source, an old transformer station. Another
zone of heavy contamination was near the plant's lagoon. No evidence of
unacceptable contamination in foodstuffs was found except for duck eggs from
a property close to the plant.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday: 'I hope the study's findings
will go a long way towards reassuring people in the Panteg area that their
environment and health is not being put at any significant risk.' The report
recommended that there should be further monitoring of soil, air, grass and
food and he had asked for this to take place.
Mr Manu Mehta, chief executive of the local borough council, Torfaen, said
its initial response was that it was pleased there was not a great deal of
cause for concern, but a public inquiry was still needed.

FT  23 APR 93 / Radiated soil to be removed
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to remove soil contaminated by radiation from the
Aldermaston, Berks, headquarters of Blue Circle Cement as a result of a 1989
accident at the adjoining Atomic Weapons Establishment.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister of defence procurement, said last night the
contamination was 'well below levels which could cause any harm to
individuals'.
Ministers were first told of the contamination in April 1991.
The disclosure, which followed reports that Blue Circle Cement was moving
150 employees from its headquarters, came in a response to a written
question by Mr Llew Smith, Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent.

FT  23 APR 93 / Eagle Star set to write Lloyd's risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR has become the first UK insurance company to take advantage of
the current enthusiasm of the Lloyd's of London market for consortium
underwriting - in which insurance companies underwrite business alongside
Lloyd's syndicates.
The insurance subsidiary of BAT industries has signed an agreement to
underwrite engineering risks in a deal which should increase the capacity -
or capital base - of syndicate 1048, managed by Crowe Underwriting Agents,
which had a stamp capacity of Pounds 34.3m in 1992. Eagle Star is committing
less than Pounds 10m to the consortium under the deal, negotiated by broker
Jardine Thompson Graham.
The deal is the third announced so far by Lloyd's agencies this year.
Consortium deals are seen as a way of easing capital shortages caused by the
withdrawal from the insurance market of Names, the individuals whose capital
supports underwriting.
This week Cassidy Davis Underwriting increased the capacity of syndicate 582
by Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 42.65m. The Swiss company, Winterthur, and four
life insurance companies - M&amp;G reinsurance of Canada, Sun Life of Canada,
Manufacturers Life, Union Reinsurance and Northwestern National Life
Insurance - are backing the consortium, together with three Lloyd's
syndicates.
The cash is earmarked for underwriting the reinsurance of overseas medical
schemes.
Syndicate 582 also agreed a separate consortium with two French companies,
Assurances Generales de France and SCOR, to underwrite creditor policies.

FT  23 APR 93 / Topic share service in new hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange is handing its Topic electronic news system, which
publishes company and share price information, over to two information
companies.
Telekurs, the Swiss information group, will concentrate on supplying roughly
85 large Topic customers with a service called Topic Plus.
ICV, based in Woking, which already supplies retail investors with stock
exchange data through the Market-Eye system, will concentrate on up to 1,000
smaller Topic customers, selling them a service called Topic 3.
The exchange is understood to be receiving no up-front payment from Telekurs
and ICV, but they will pay the exchange a royalty for the use of its name
and customer lists. The companies will also pay an 'exchange fee' for the
feed of market data which Topic will retransmit.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said yesterday: 'We decided
quite some time ago this was not a core activity.
'With the benefit of hindsight it would have been better to do this six
months ago, but we had a false start in the first round of negotiations.'
Topic customers will be encouraged to 'migrate' to their choice of Telekurs
or ICV systems starting this summer. The transfer of the 10,000 existing
Topic screens to the new systems is expected to be complete by the end of
1994.
The existing Topic system will then be closed down, but there will be no
redundancies.
Telekurs's offering will include a wide range of international financial
data. It will require users to learn a new interface, using a mouse or a
typewriter keyboard. The ICV service will be more narrowly focused on UK
equities. It will allow customers to continue to use the existing Topic
system's codes and numbers on a small keypad.
Both services hope to be supplying clients with test systems from June, with
a 'live' service from September. The aim is to switch all the existing Topic
subscribers to the new systems by the end of 1994.
The new systems will face fierce competition from Reuters, the UK's biggest
financial information company. Reuters launched a rival to the Topic system
in January this year and says that it is making rapid gains of customers.
Telekurs was founded in 1935 as a service company for its owners, the big
Swiss banks. It has an annual turnover of SFr400m (Pounds 160m). ICV,
founded in 1980, had pre-tax profits of Pounds 351,000 on turnover of Pounds
3.8m in 1991, the last year for which figures are available. The company is
privately owned, with principal stakes held by Mr David Taylor, managing
director and Mr Christopher Sharples, the chairman.

FT  23 APR 93 / Army rifle needed 32 modifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY-TWO different modifications have been required on the Army's standard
rifle, the SA80, since it went into service seven years ago, MPs heard
yesterday.
Major General Anthony Stone, a senior Ministry of Defence procurement
official, said the Pounds 300m rifle manufacture programme had been through
sustained criticism. But he assured the Commons defence committee the Army
was now 'entirely satisfied' with the weapon.
Gremlins included triggers that had to be flicked back into position, firing
pins that broke and magazines that fell off.
Field training before the 1991 Gulf war revealed that bayonets sometimes
became detached.
The safety plunger, a key part of the rifle's blocking mechanism, was found
to move when the rifle was dropped in tests.
The metal plunger was replaced by a plastic one, but the plastic proved too
brittle and attracted water. A new plastic version went into production
three years ago. The Ministry of Defence said a full programme of refitting
existing rifles was 'ongoing'.
Cleaning equipment was also found to be 'less than perfect', but the
ministry did not decide to change it until 1991. New cleaning kits are due
by the end of next year.
Modifications, already carried out on 60 per cent of the 307,000 rifles
delivered, were expected to add 9 per cent to costs. Officials said that the
ministry was still talking to Royal Ordnance, the manufacturer, about
contractual liability.
Maj Gen Stone said design faults had been compounded by production problems
following the sale of Royal Ordnance to British Aerospace in 1987 and
transfer of the small arms manufacture business from Enfield to Nottingham.

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT POLICY towards the drugs industry was strongly attacked yesterday
by the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, Paul Abrahams
writes.
Mr Stewart Siddall, association president, said the extension of the list of
products for which the National Health Service would not pay had come as a
'real bombshell'.
He warned: 'Some companies will be profoundly damaged. I have correspondence
from one company which could lose all of its sales.' The proposals, which
had come without warning, could affect about Pounds 400m in annual sales.
The UK pharmaceutical industry generated exports of Pounds 3m last year,
four times more than Japan. Yet spending on medicines a head in the UK was
half that in in Germany, France and Italy, he said.

FT  23 APR 93 / Little elation over unemployment's latest fall: Lisa Wood,
Emma Tucker and Andrew Taylor find reasons for the drop and the guarded
response to it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NOT A FLUKE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but nothing to get too excited about. That was the guarded response
yesterday of City economists and Whitehall officials to the second
consecutive monthly fall in unemployment.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, set the tone. While she
warmly welcomed the March figure, which saw seasonally adjusted unemployment
fall by 26,000 to 2,940,800, she said that not too much should be read into
one month's figures.
But she said fewer people were now joining the unemployment count, every
region saw falls in the jobless figures and vacancies were the highest for
two years.
A number of reasons for the fall were put forward by her officials, the
Confederation of British Industry and economists, though most said it was
too early to say whether the unemployment peak had been reached.
Reasons given for the fall included:
A more flexible labour market: a number of economists said labour market
reforms in the 1980s - in particular trade union reform and stricter rules
for claiming benefits - had made the labour market more flexible. 'I think
that people in the labour market are making Herculean efforts to find jobs,'
said Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, who believes that
unemployment will have dropped to 2m by 1996. 'The unions realise that there
are lots of people out there who want jobs and the scene is one of people
pricing themselves back into work, particularly professionals.'
More part-time work is another feature of an increasingly flexible labour
market. Stateside Foods, of Rossingdale Valley, Lancashire, cut its
workforce early last year from 84 to 34 but then built it back to 75, with
the new recruits mostly being part-time women workers. Mr Leonard Haysom,
operations director, said: 'We have found it (part-time working) extremely
beneficial - we have been able to meet better our commitment to supermarkets
which are now opening seven days a week.'
Over-sacking: economists said a number of companies had been caught out by
the strength of demand, particularly domestic demand, and had shed too much
labour at the end of last year.
'I think the story behind these figures is that the UK corporate sector has
been caught off-guard by the strength of demand in the first three months of
this year,' said Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell.
Big redundancy programmes are ending: the construction industry has forecast
that the sector is likely to lose a further 50,000 jobs this year. But the
rate at which jobs are being shed is expected to decline as the year
progresses, according to Ms Joanne Cutler, economist at the Building
Employers Confederation, the industry's largest trade association.
Much job shedding by national contractors and building material suppliers is
thought to have been completed as companies have reduced overheads and
reorganised their businesses in the recession.
Government programmes: there has been a steady increase in the number of
jobless people going on to government training and work experience
programmes. This takes them off the claimant count. In January there were
129,000 people on Employment Training, the main training programme for the
long-term jobless, compared with 135,000 in March.
In addition, the Unemployment Unit, a research and lobbying organisation,
said it believed the Employment Service had been making great efforts in the
last two months of its financial year to get the unemployed into jobs and
achieve its placement targets.
Demographic factors: the Department of Employment said these could make a
difference to the rate at which unemployment drops as the economy emerges
from recession.
At the beginning of the last decade the number of people entering the labour
market was much higher than it is now, a factor which contributed towards
the rise in unemployment long after the recession was over.
In 1981 the population of working age increased by 177,000 compared with the
previous year, and by about 250,000 in both 1983 and 1984. By contrast, the
working population increased by only 42,000 last year, compared with 1991,
and is projected to increase by 47,000 this year.
At the same time, more young people are staying on in full-time education
than was the case at the beginning of the last decade.

FT  23 APR 93 / Estate agents see increased activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAW in the housing market seen since the beginning of this year is
continuing, according to a survey of more than 100 estate agents conducted
just before Easter.
It provides further evidence of a revival in house sales and mortgage demand
reported by house builders and building societies.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey in
England and Wales, said: 'Although recovery is slow, estate agents from
nearly all areas reported increases in activity and sales.'
Although experiences varied, more than 80 per cent of agents in the survey
said prices had remained stable in the previous three months.
Only 13 per cent reported price falls while 3 per cent said that prices had
risen by more than 2 per cent over the period. Large numbers of agents
reported falling prices at the beginning of the year.
The institution said that the improvement was beginning to penetrate into
the middle and upper price ranges which meant that there was a broader range
of purchaser in the market - so improving the chances of finding a buyer.
Concern over the state of local economies, particularly over job prospects,
continued to depress sales in some areas.
William H. Brown, agents in South Yorkshire, said that uncertainty over pit
closures was inhibiting sales in the Doncaster area. Agents in Halifax, York
and Brigg also suggested that sales had fallen back slightly in March
compared with February.
Renton &amp; Renton, part of the Black Horse estate agency chain in Harrogate,
North Yorkshire, said that there had been a significant increase in sales:
'Just driving round the town people are noticing more 'sold' boards which
seems to be giving them confidence to take the plunge.'
Improved confidence was equally noticeable in London and south-east England
with a swathe of towns reporting much better conditions.
Croydon, however, defied the regional trend, 'reporting low confidence in an
area severely hit by negative equity'. The by-election town of Newbury was
also reported 'to have slowed down'.
Mr Peter Miller, the institution's housing spokesman, said: 'The trend is
encouraging but we still require a big increase in completed sales to be
sure of sustained recovery. The warning remains that sellers must not have
inflated expectations if they hope to sell their property in this still
price-sensitive market.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Figures give hope to all regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEXPECTED fall in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit
last month was spread across every region of the UK, the first time this has
happened since January 1990, official figures showed yesterday.
The biggest falls were in Scotland and the east Midlands where the
unemployment rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 9.6 per cent in both
areas.
The Department of Employment said there were a number of clues in the data
to suggest that falls in unemployment over the last two months were more
than just erratic figures.
These included a marked slowdown in the number of people joining the
unemployment count. Last month 338,000 people joined the dole queues, 14,300
fewer than in the same month last year, and 32,100 fewer than in February.
Meanwhile, 387,800 people left the count in March, slightly less than in
February, but 32,100 more than in the same month a year ago.
There were also encouraging signs from the vacancies figures. Unfilled
vacancies at Job-centres - about a third of all vacancies in the economy -
rose by 6,000 on the year to March, the highest level for two years. New
vacancies last month rose by 7,400 compared with February.
The fall in manufacturing employment also slowed. It fell by 11,000 in March
to 4.19m, the smallest fall since June last year.
Average earnings growth dropped again in February to 4.5 per cent from 4.75
per cent in January. This was the lowest rate for 25 years.
The slowing wage growth, along with improved productivity, caused a further
decline in unit labour costs. In the three months to the end of February,
manufacturing industry unit labour costs were 2 per cent lower than in the
same period a year earlier.

FT  23 APR 93 / Rail union seeks new strike vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE executive of RMT, the main rail union, is to ballot its 60,000 members
employed by British Rail on the BR proposals to end the present dispute. No
further action will be taken before the result is announced on May 14.
The union executive is recommending members to reject BR's final proposals,
which were presented to the union earlier this week.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, said he was 'very disappointed'
at the executive's decision. 'This is a sad day,' he said. 'The cloud of
uncertainty which is damaging confidence in the industry is still hanging
over us.'
He denounced the executive for seeking to 'prejudge the issue for their
members by recommending rejection of BR's position'.
'The least they could have done is to put the issues fairly to their
members,' he added. 'They were elected to take decisions on behalf of their
members. Instead, they have abdicated their responsibility.'
Mr Watkinson said BR had 'moved heaven and earth in nearly 40 hours of
negotiation to address the union's concerns and gave them assurances'.
The union had received written assurances that BR 'does not foresee the need
for compulsory redundancies in the next couple of years' for general staff
and no compulsory redundancies 'in the next 12 months' for workshop staff.
BR had also promised the union that it would carry out no 'major extension
in the use of contract work on rail and signal maintenance during the next
couple of years'.
The union has been seeking a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and a
moratorium on the extension of contract work. The dispute has involved two
one-day strikes this month costing BR at least Pounds 20m gross in lost
revenue.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, said yesterday that the union
leadership could call further stoppages if it thought it necessary as a
result of its previous membership ballot held in March.
The RMT executive's decision to ballot members followed its embarrassing
deadlock on Wednesday night after nine hours of argument. A majority of the
executive rejected BR's final offer but the requisite two-thirds majority
was not prepared to back a proposal to call a further one-day strike for
next Friday.
Mr Knapp conceded last night that BR had moved some way to meet the union's
concerns over the threat of compulsory redundancies in the countdown to
privatisation. But he added: 'The assurances we are seeking on compulsory
redundancy and use of contractors have still not been made with the
conviction we want.'
BR is convinced that once the rank and file see the concessions that have
been made to remove the feelings of uncertainty over the future of the
railway industry, the call to reject BR's proposals and by implication agree
to further strike action will be defeated.
The ballot will be held on May 6 and 7.

FT  23 APR 93 / Production of cars rises 7.7% to a 19-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR production rose by 7.7 per cent last month to its highest March level
for 19 years, boosted by the build-up of output from the British factories
of Nissan, Honda and Toyota of Japan.
Figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office showed that UK car output rose to 144,212
from 133,881 in March last year.
Production in the first three months of this year rose by 6.2 per cent to
364,420 from 343,318 in the first quarter of last year.
The strong performance of the car sector is not reflected in the commercial
vehicle industry, where UK demand remains depressed and output has been
lowered by the collapse of Leyland Daf into administrative receivership in
February.
Commercial vehicle output in March fell 24.5 per cent to 22,036, while
production in the first quarter was 11.6 per cent lower at 59,100.
The rise in car output has been helped by rising export volumes from the
Japanese producers' UK plants and by the growth of registrations of new cars
in Britain.
After 3 1/2 years in recession, domestic sales of new cars have grown
year-on-year for each of the past six months.
In contrast to plunging demand in continental Europe, the UK is the only
large-volume market in west Europe where sales are expanding. In March car
output for the home market rose by 13.6 per cent to 88,904 while production
for export declined marginally to 55,308.
Mr Roger King, SMMT public affairs director, said the car production figures
were 'most encouraging and are the highest for March since 1974.
'They suggest that car manufacturers expect domestic sales to increase,
going some way towards making up for the expected decline in other European
markets.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Figures confirm mildness of Scotland's recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE it is hard to pinpoint any significant source of new jobs, the figures
for Scotland are confirmation of the mildness of its recession, James Buxton
writes.
Since early last year Scottish unemployment has been lower than the UK
average - something not experienced since the early years of this century.
Scotland has the second-lowest unemployment of any region in the UK.
The recession has produced few large-scale job losses in Scotland. The last
boom was far weaker in Scotland so there was much less fall-out from
speculative expansion. Scotland has also benefitted from the North Sea oil
industry and the bias of its manufacturing towards exports. Most of its
heavy industry has gone.
The figures show slight improvements in the industrial west, but also rises
in jobless totals in the Inverness and Invergordon areas in the north. This
reflects the sharp contraction of the oil platform fabrication industry,
where about 5,000 jobs have been lost in the past year.

Lord Donaldson, the former master of the rolls who is chairing the Braer

'dual-carriageway highway' when an ordinary road would have been sufficient.
Mr Robin Bradley, the department's surveyor-general, said a simple sea-lane

FT  23 APR 93 / Retailers back cut in CD prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading music retailers said yesterday they favoured a cut in compact
disc prices but that it was up to manufacturers to take the initiative.
Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of WH Smith, told the Commons
national heritage committee that the high price of CDs was stifling demand.
The most important buyers of music were aged 16 to 24 and the price of a CD
represented about 10 per cent of average weekly take-home pay, he said.
Mr Brian McLaughlin, UK managing director of HMV, said he disagreed with Sir
Malcolm that sales are depressed by high prices. He said HMV's CD sales had
grown well over the past three years.
He said, however, that consumer resentment was likely to grow as a result of
the issue's publicity. HMV hoped to see lower prices, he added.
Both Sir Malcolm and Mr McLaughlin said, however, that retailers could not
reduce prices on their own. Sir Malcolm said CDs had the lowest gross
margins of any product sold by WH Smith with the exception of newspapers.

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish truck maker, is expected to discuss with the Leyland Daf
administrative receivers today the future of the truck operations at
Leyland, Lancashire, Kevin Done writes.
The frontrunner to take over the Leyland Daf truck business, which collapsed
into administrative receivership in February together with the rest of the
Daf group, has hitherto been a management buy-out team led by Mr John
Gilchrist, managing director.
The buy-out team began formal talks with the administrative receivers last
week, when it said a number of funding offers had been received from leading
financial institutions.
The receivers are, however, in contact with several other potentially
interested parties. As well as Volvo they are also known to have held talks
with Paccar, the US truck maker which owns Foden, the specialist UK heavy
truck producer based in Sandbach, Cheshire.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise has taken insufficient measures to deal with tax
avoidance, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday, Andrew Jack
writes.
In a report it said the department has little information on the incidence
and tax at risk from avoidance of payment.
It expressed concern that Customs had not done enough to monitor the
effectiveness of measures on tax avoidance. It criticised the lack of
central coordination of Customs' work in countering avoidance and stressed
that the department had acknowledged that the arrangements were inadequate.
Customs said it had created a headquarters team to improve coordination on
tax avoidance, and was meeting traders and improving training and guidance
in local offices to deal with the topic.
It dismissed suggestions that traders might be forced to pay assessments
under pressure from officials.

BRITAIN is experiencing a broadly based recovery led by exports but
weaknesses remain that could hinder future growth, the British Chambers of
Commerce said yesterday.
The BCC said its quarterly survey of 8,820 manufacturing and service
companies showed that orders were growing at home and abroad, and that a
growing share of companies expect turnover and profits to improve in the
next 12 months.
But although confidence has returned to pre-recession levels, the chambers
warned that only one in five companies is at full capacity. Investment
intentions remain weak and on balance all except small companies plan to
shed labour in the next three months. Small companies with fewer than 20
workers reported both the strongest improvement in orders and worsening
cashflow problems in the survey, carried out between March 5 and March 26.
According to Mr Richard Brown, director of policy, small companies often
suffer from late debt payments or are unable to obtain working capital.
Their cashflow problems point to further insolvencies to come.
The survey found that the portion of manufacturing companies reporting an
increase of UK orders over the previous three months exceeded those
reporting a decrease by 7 percentage points. This positive balance
contrasted with a negative balance of minus 10 points in the previous survey
when reports of falling orders exceeded rising orders.
The service sector also reported a recovery in home orders with a positive
balance of 12 points compared with zero three months before.
Manufacturers' export orders rose strongly, with the positive balance
widening to 20 percentage points from 12 points in the final quarter of last
year. However, the service sector's export outlook was only marginally
better with the positive balance for orders increasing to just 10 points
from 8 points three months before. Mr Brown said that this was a matter of
some concern.
But Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, the chambers' president, said the survey
as a whole was the 'most encouraging for some time'.
He said the marked improvement in business confidence to levels last seen in
early 1989 reflected more than expectations of higher sales and profits.
The survey found that the recovery was geographically widespread. In the
manufacturing sector, only three regions - Scotland, the east Midlands and
Northern Ireland - experienced a fall in UK orders, while in the service
sector no region suffered a decline in orders. All regions reported growth
in export orders. The recession is not yet over, according to a survey which
says signs of recovery are being threatened by low consumer confidence and
unemployment fears.
Business Strategies, the consultancy, and Gallup, the market research group,
say that people remain 'very pessimistic'. Worries about the economy over
the next 12 months are higher than they were in the first quarter of last
year.
Chambers of Commerce Survey
Domestic orders improved for the second consecutive quarter while
manufacturing exports grew at the fastest rate for three years. The survey
said companies were beginning to revise investment plans upwards, but
overall levels remain extremely low. There was a small improvement in the
cashflow position of companies. The level of interest rates remains the
number one external factor affecting business in the service sector and the
second most important factor for manufacturing. Confidence about
profitability and turnover has risen and is highest in the home counties.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC sets Czech and Slovak steel limits
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE volume of Czech and Slovak steel imported into the EC will be allowed to
rise by about 36 per cent this year, compared with 1991 figures. But EC
tariff-quotas will still lead to a sharp cut in imports compared with 1992.
The European Commission approved on Wednesday a series of tariff quotas on
Czech and Slovak steel imports, as part of wider measures to protect the
struggling EC steel industry.
The quotas are the result of a delicate compromise between Sir Leon Brittan,
trade commissioner, and his colleague Mr Martin Bangemann, responsible for
industry.
Under the compromise, the 1993 increase meets Sir Leon's demands, but
restrictions are tightened in 1994 and 1995, in line with Mr Bangemann's
wishes.
The Community will also treat coils more generously than other products,
allowing imports of 200,000 tonnes in 1995, more than double the 1991
volume.
Imports of other products will be roughly 46 per cent higher next year than
in 1991, and 60 per cent higher in 1995. Above those levels, punitive
tariffs are likely to be imposed.
By 1995, imports of hot rolled strip from the Czech and Slovak republics
will be permitted up to 48,000 tonnes, cut length steel up to 112,000
tonnes, sheets up to 135,000 tonnes and wire rod up to 250,000 tonnes. In
most cases that is still lower than the volumes believed to have been
imported last year.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: Airline losses continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S airlines lost money for the third consecutive year in 1992,
according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN
agency, Daniel Green reports.
It said that operating revenues of scheduled airlines, excluding flights
within the Commonwealth of Independent States, rose to Dollars 212bn (Pounds
140.3bn) from Dollars 203.4bn in 1992. Operating expenses rose to Dollars
213bn from Dollars 204.4bn.
The 4.2 per cent growth in revenues was in line with an ICAO prediction a
year ago.
The ICAO's 1992 figures also indicate that pressure on profit margins
increased on the freight side, with revenues per tonne per kilometre falling
from Dollars 0.924 to Dollars 0.887 between 1991 and 1992.
Costs per tonne/kilometre fell from Dollars 0.93 cents to Dollars 0.893
cents.
Freight traffic more than halved on the busiest routes such as the north
Atlantic.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS was the only 'loser' in the settlement this week of the
US-EC dispute over government procurement.
Mr Randall Tobias, vice-chairman of AT&amp;T, America's biggest telephone
operator, said he was disappointed by the pact, but added he was
'encouraged' that the US and EC could reach any agreement at all.
In Washington the business community is heaving a collective sigh of relief.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the untutored 'bulldog' whom President Bill Clinton had
appointed to 'open markets', made his debut with a successful nego-tiation.
Previous trade representatives had come into the job with little knowledge
of their brief. Mr Kantor is an experienced negotiator but it was by no
means certain the skills employed in the give and take of private-sector
talks - or in politics - could be swiftly transplanted to the trade arena.
Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, spent most of their
time together alone in the US trade representative's office. In public they
seemed to be increasingly comfortable with each other.
A senior US trade official said they had developed mutual respect and
growing trust.
This bodes well for settlement of the Uruguay Round this year.
Most trade experts agree that the deal the two men cut required creativity
and flexibility. Because they have been silent about how they got where they
did, it is not known whose skills made the difference.
To Ms Kim Elliott, a research assistant at the Institute of International
Economics, the procurement deal looks 'pretty good' but the dispute was more
about symbols and precedents than substance.
'Every directive out of the EC 1992 exercise which involved reciprocity
provisions, we've challenged on principle,' she said. Referring specifically
to the EC utilities directive which came into effect at the beginning of the
year, she added: 'The US decided it just couldn't let this one go by.'
It was also the first big market opening by the EC in any dispute with the
US in years.
Ms Elliott, who conducted a study of the results of section 301, an
aggressive US market-opening provision, found that the law had produced
liberalisation in two-thirds of the cases filed.
But its lowest success rate was with the EC.

FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: The big guns head off a trade war

THERE was relief mixed with enthusiasm in Brussels yesterday as officials
digested the last-minute compromise in the EC-US dispute over public
purchasing rules.
The partial deal struck between Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, avoids a nasty spat. As late as
Tuesday evening, the dispute risked escalating into a tit-for-tat trade war,
wrecking hopes of progress in the Gatt Uruguay Round.
More positively, the compromise establishes a key principle: the
progressive, reciprocal opening of markets in the government procurement
market. The US still intends to proceed with sanctions because the deal does
not cover telecommunications, but these will be token only.
Like Mr Kantor, Sir Leon is a lawyer. In effect he agreed this week to a
plea-bargain. In return for a light sentence, he has acknowledged that 'Buy
European' legislation unfairly closes the EC procurement market; but he has
persuaded the US gradually to start dropping 'Buy American' legislation at
federal and state level.
Right up until the final transatlantic telephone call on Wednesday evening
it was unclear whether the two men could find enough common ground to avoid
a trade war.
Sir Leon, perhaps the staunchest free trader inside the 17-strong European
Commission, was desperate to prevent the procurement dispute spilling over
into the Gatt trade talks. His fear was that the Clinton administration's
aggressive trade stance could provoke an anti-American backlash in Europe.
Yet Sir Leon also recognised that Mr Kantor needed to show the US Congress
and US companies that tough tactics had produced some tangible successes.
The hope is that both men have found a deal which will play to their
respective domestic constituencies, though one EC official said yesterday
there might not be enough blood to assuage EC trade hardliners.
The heart of the dispute lies with Article 29 of the EC utilities directive
which entered into force on January 1 1993. The law gives a 3 per cent price
preference to EC bidders for any government contract and allows an EC bidder
to ignore an offer if the bidder has a European content of less than 50 per
cent.
The US can now point to the EC's agreement to waive Article 29 covering
heavy electrical equipment such as steam turbines - a market valued at
Dollars 1bn a year. In return, the EC can point to the removal of all
restrictions against EC bids from the five publicly-owned federal electrical
utilities, plus the Tennessee Valley Authority - a market which is valued
potentially at Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn.
EC officials said yesterday these concessions should lead to the eventual
elimination of 'Buy American' clauses at 'sub-federal' or state level - the
lucrative market for building bridges, airports, rapid transit, or buying
school buses. These are currently effectively closed to EC companies.
According to the deal, the administration will approach the governors of all
50 states about the withdrawal of this legislation. Some 33 states have
expressed general willingness to consider dropping the clauses.
Separately, both sides have agreed to remove all restrictions on each
other's companies bidding for contracts to supply goods and services to
central governments. This is a potentially huge prize, allowing EC and US
companies to bid for services ranging from software to supplies to the US
Army Corps of Engineers.
The final twist in the deal is a joint study to identify market barriers in
government procurement rules and to ensure each side plays by comparable
rules. The study could last a year, but the result would be a yardstick for
negotiations on the thornier subject of telecommunications.
Sir Leon's broader aim appears to be to include telecommunications in a
future multilateral deal, as part of a Gatt agreement on market access. For
a comprehensive deal on the Uruguay Round is the prize he wants most.
The signs are that he is building a relationship with Mr Kantor; but aides
say he has still to master the latter's baseball jokes. With the season just
started in the US, Sir Leon has at least shown he can play in the major
leagues.

SIMKO, the Turkish tele-communications company, has signed a Dollars 100m

Interfax news agency said, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The central Asian republic, the world's third largest gas producer, with
output totalling 84bn cubic metres a year, will fund the deal with natural
gas exports.
Several Turkish companies have signed deals for telecom systems in former
Soviet republics.
Officials from Turkey's state-run post and telecommunications company PTT,
which donated a 2,500-line telephone switchboard to Turkmenistan last year,
say only 6 per cent of the republic's 3.6m people own telephones.

The deal is a further sign of the current revival in countertrade for
countries with problems obtaining hard currencies or in economic
difficulties.
The Cuban economy has faced a growing crisis following the gradual
withdrawal of aid and supplies from the former Soviet Union. It has also
suffered from the fall in price of some raw-material exports, notably sugar.
Italgrani will supply cereals, vegetable oils and pasta products, worth
about L100bn, in return for Cuban sugar of a similar value.
Italgrani's deal, double the size of a similar one between July and November
last year, will take effect in the second half of this year.

complaints

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE arrival in Tokyo yesterday of Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, is
likely to be accompanied by familiar strong words from the US on Japan's
trade surplus and closed markets, followed by polite rebuffs from Japan of
US solutions for the problems.
Mr Brown is in Tokyo to take part in a ministerial conference on assistance
to Russia. But his arrival two days before the conference opens will give
him time to remind the Japanese that the US is serious about rectifying the
countries' trade imbalance.
Japan needs little reminding so soon after the bilateral meeting in
Washington last week, which left no doubt where the priorities of the US
under President Bill Clinton lie. Even Japanese trade officials who have
been through the same show often in the last 10 years fear this time they
may be in for a tougher confrontation.
Both the structural and sectoral issues which the current US trade team says
it wants to address have been discussed in the past. But this time the US
administration's emphasis is on economic issues as a strategic priority and
on achieving quantifiable results, says an official from Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
At the same time the Clinton team is not as ideologically committed to free
trade as previous Republican administrations.
Mr Brown is likely to reiterate Washington's unhappiness with Japan's
Dollars 46bn (Pounds 30.4bn) trade surplus and the need to obtain concrete
results in tackling the issue.
The new framework for bilateral consultations on trade agreed last week
between Mr Mr Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to take
firm shape in the months ahead.
In addition to its currency stance, which has allowed the yen to rise
sharply against the dollar, the new bilateral trade framework will form a
key pillar of Washington's strategy on correcting the trade imbalance.
The US also appears reluctant to abandon the idea of using temporary
quantitative indicators to measure improvements in access to Japanese
markets, despite numerous protests from Japan.
For its part, Tokyo is adamant it will not give in to US calls for such
quantitative measures, which it has repeatedly said leads to managed trade.
The Japanese offer is for more long-term steps to deal with the trade
imbalance, such as industry co-operation and business initiatives.

SIGNS that the United States and the European Community aim to contain their
dispute over government contracts have raised hopes for a revival of the
long-stalled Uruguay Round world trade talks, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Both Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, who together shaped the partial accord, have said they are
determined to push on to end the round successfully.
The dispute, in which both the US and the EC claimed their companies were
often excluded from access to the other's lucrative public contracts, was
partly settled on Wednesday. At one stage it had appeared to be a serious
threat to wrapping up the Uruguay Round, which is widely seen as offering a
much-needed boost to the ailing world economy.
One trade envoy in Geneva, where the round is negotiated under the aegis of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said yesterday he was not unduly
concerned that the two sides still retained some mutual sanctions over
telecommunications. Even with such measures, 'it looks as though they will
be trying to quarantine the dispute and get on with the major job - fixing
the round,' he said.
A senior diplomat from an exporting state said he was heartened by what he
saw as an effort by the US and the EC 'to maximise accord and minimise the
discord' on the procurement issue. 'They seem to be concentrating their
minds on the bigger prize - the round,' he said.
However, some envoys and analysts involved in the round negotiations doubted
whether the two key trading powers were ready to make a big effort to
advance the cause of international free trade.
One expert expressed the hope that the partial accord would be a 'step
towards a wider government procurement agreement that could be reached
alongside a multilateral accord inside the round'. But he thought it would
take a lot more than that to convince people they were moving towards
negotiating seriously and wrapping up the round.
Other diplomats and officials said they were not convinced that the
administration of President Bill Clinton had yet decided to make the talks,
originally due to have been completed in December 1990, a major priority.
The US and the EC have to settle all their own differences before the
100-odd other countries in the round can effectively be brought back into
the process.

FT  23 APR 93 / Andries Treurnicht dies of heart failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDRIES Treurnicht, leader of South Africa's Conservative party who died
after heart failure yesterday aged 72, was one of the last survivors of a
generation of deeply conservative politicians, devout churchmen and learned
academics who embraced apartheid with ruthless, near-religious fervour.
His death comes at a critical time for the country's main right-wing
opposition party which seeks an independent state for whites. After
initially refusing to participate, the CP decided to take part in the
constitutional negotiations due to resume soon. But fears that it may resort
to violence have been raised by the detention of two of its leading members
in connection with the murder of Communist party leader Chris Hani 12 days
ago.
Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, Treurnicht's deputy, was expected to be the party's
new leader and could take the Conservatives on a more militant path.
The party was formed when Mr Treurnicht left P W Botha's National party
cabinet in 1982, opposing extension of the franchise to Coloureds and
Indians. Sombre suited and studiously courteous, he seemed more at home in
the Dutch Reformed Church, which he served as a minister in the 1940s, than
on the hustings.
But his quiet manner belied his record. 'The Afrikaner is not prepared to be
regarded as ephemeral in the history of nations,' he said after his election
to head the secret Afrikaner Broederbond in 1972.
As a cabinet minister in the 1970s he won the nickname Dr No, bitterly
resisting measures to ease apartheid. Black South Africans recall with anger
his role as minister of black education in 1976 when black schoolchildren
rebelled against having to study in Afrikaans. Over 600 children were to
die; thousands of others joined the guerrilla wing of the African National
Congress.
He sustained to the end his belief in the apartheid vision of his mentor,
Hendrik Verwoerd, South Africa's prime minister from 1958 to 1966. But
Andries Treurnicht never recovered from the defeat in March last year when
whites voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to support President F W de
Klerk's reforms. The defeat, a psychological as well as political blow, left
him a spent force and the CP without an effective leader.

NIGERIA'S prospects for early rescheduling of its Dollars 29bn (Pounds
19.2bn) external debt have receded after the visit of a joint International
Monetary Fund and World Bank mission.
Although the mission backed the military government's latest reform efforts,
it is understood to have made clear that a formal IMF agreement would depend
on the performance of the civilian administration which is scheduled to take
office in August. An IMF deal is a precondition to rescheduling the debt, of
which Dollars 16.5bn is owed to the Paris Club of official creditors. Paris
Club arrears exceed Dollars 3bn.
Nigeria's transitional council, the country's interim administration, is
drawing up a shadow IMF programme that would conform to the terms of an
extended structural adjustment facility (Esaf).
The new government would be expected to adopt the programme.
The council hopes to present its medium-term economic strategy for 1993-96
to a meeting of the Paris Club co-ordinated by the World Bank. Nigerians
have suggested this could take place in July.
But Fund officials are pressing for action on two key issues before such a
meeting is convened. They want to see deregulation of the foreign exchange
market, and a narrowing of the gap between the official rate of exchange
(N21 to the dollar) and the parallel market rate (N37 to the dollar).
They also expect the government to reduce the domestic fuel subsidy. The
team from Washington was assured that the recent decision to postpone petrol
price increases was necessary to ensure orderly presidential elections on
June 12. The government has yet to give a date for the promised action.
There are also continuing concerns about management of state resources.
Since taking office at the end of December the council has tried to account
for all export earnings, but the exercise is not complete. World Bank
officials in Washington and western government analysts estimate that the
proceeds from 200,000 barrels of oil a day are inadequately accounted for.
Total production is around 1.8m b/d.
It is thought these receipts go directly into so-called 'dedicated accounts'
earmarked for specific purposes or projects, but details remain difficult to
obtain.
Western government and IMF officials have said that they want to monitor the
new government's handling of the economy for at least three months after its
installation in August before a formal agreement can be reached.
This timetable makes it unlikely that debt relief could be obtained before
the end of this year.
If Nigeria can secure an Esaf agreement with the IMF, it could qualify for
debt relief from the Paris Club under the Trinidad terms, involving a
write-off of 60 per cent of the loans and longer payment periods for the
rest.

FT  23 APR 93 / Further criticism of US over rising yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business leaders, senior government officials and politicians
yesterday stepped up their criticism of US economic policy towards Japan as
the yen rose to another post-war high against the dollar in Tokyo.
The dollar closed at Y110.20, down Y0.15 from its Tokyo close on Wednesday.
The yen has appreciated rapidly in the past week mainly driven by comments
last weekend by President Bill Clinton that a stronger yen would help to
reduce Japan's trade surplus with the US.
The yen's continued rise is confounding the hopes of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, that the appreciation would run out of steam with the help
of intervention by the Bank of Japan. If the yen continues to rise Mr
Miyazawa will come under increasing pressure to take a tougher line to
resist US demands for Japan to adjust its economic policies towards US
priorities.
Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives,
said Mr Clinton's remarks were 'strange', 'indiscreet' and 'difficult to
understand', terms of criticism in the language of Japanese politics. Mr
Hayami said the slump in the dollar would damage the US economy by fuelling
inflation and increasing pressure for higher interest rates.
A senior official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry echoed Mr Hayami's
remarks. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, Miti vice minister, said the yen's rise could
stifle the recovery in the Japanese economy, which the US has urged to
create higher demand for imports, as one of the most important ways to cut
the Japanese trade surplus.
Meanwhile, Mr Kabun Muto, the recently appointed foreign minister, is fast
establishing a reputation for outspoken criticism. Mr Muto, who on Wednesday
described Mr Clinton's remarks as deplorable, yesterday attacked US trade
policies designed to open up the Japanese market.
Mr Muto said the US market for manufactured goods was more closed than the
Japanese market. He said the increase in the value of the trade surplus was
partly due to the rise in the yen and Japanese companies' decision to
increase the price of their exports to avoid anti-dumping actions by the US
government.
The frailty of the Japanese economy was underlined by a 3.4 per cent fall in
household spending in February compared with the year before. Average
spending by salaried workers fell 0.7 per cent while that of non-salaried
households fell 8.4 per cent.
Spending on transport and communications rose 13.6 per cent, and spending on
clothes just 1.5 per cent. However spending on food, health care, furniture
and household appliances fell, with education ex-penditure down 15.8 per
cent and that on housing 13.8 per cent lower. The slide in consumer spending
was reflected in sharp profit falls at several leading retailers yesterday.
The machinery industry forecast a 0.7 per cent increase in sales for the
year to the end of next March, reflecting the prolonged slowdown in
corporate investment.
Meanwhile, regional officials of the Finance Ministry, meeting in Tokyo,
forecast the economy would begin to recover, albeit modestly, from the
second half of the financial year.

FT  23 APR 93 / SA violence brings out white fears: Philip Gawith reports on
the mood of alarm in the business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, this week issued a
plea to whites not to leave the country. He said South Africa had no chance
of prospering without their skills. For white South Africans it was a timely
recognition from the country's most important black leader that they too are
an important constituency whose needs must be considered.
Since the assassination 10 days ago of Mr Chris Hani, the prominent
activist, South Africa has heard much of black anger. But the other side of
black anger is white fear, and there has been a lot of it about.
Local radio chat-shows have been awash with calls from whites anxious about
their future, and removal companies have reported the usual upturn in
inquiries from those planning a quieter life elsewhere.
In its own way, the death of Mr Hani was as much a shock to white South
Africans as to blacks. Many white liberals described the week after Mr
Hani's death as the worst of their lives. This was not so much physical fear
 -of spears tapping on the windows, in the words of one - as depression and
foreboding.
At one level, this makes little sense: the number of deaths per day has
remained below levels prevailing earlier in the year. What it illustrates is
the fragility of spirit in the white community. Although most whites favour
the reform process there are grave fears about what the future holds.
White politicians have sought to calm their constituency, but the assurances
they need can only come from black leaders whose attention has been focused
rather more on their own support base. Mr Mandela's comments at a small
Johannesburg gathering on Wednesday represented progress, but would have had
much more impact if spoken at a mass rally or on prime-time television. As
it was, few newspapers reported them.
Also, they sit uncomfortably alongside the ANC's calls for a six-week mass
action campaign. Few things depress white sentiment more than visions of a
future in which city centres are permanent hostage to some form or other of
mass protest.
The prospect of further mass action has also been met with alarm in the
besieged business community, which has experienced three successive years of
negative economic growth, with little, if any, revival expected in 1993.
The barometer of manufacturing confidence, published by the independent
Bureau for Economic Research, showed confidence levels before Mr Hani's
death were barely above the nadir reached during the the foreign debt crisis
of 1985. They can only have deteriorated over the past two weeks.
The view from the ground confirms this gloomy perspective. Mr Ian Willis,
chairman of Holdains, the country's second largest packaging group, notes:
'It is as tough today as it has been, and for the rest of this year it will
get tougher.' His views are echoed by Mr Ken Ironside of Barlow Rand, the
largest industrial group in South Africa. He says sales volumes continue to
decline, trading conditions remain difficult, and even in successful areas,
such as food and pharmaceuticals, conditions appear to be getting worse.
Mr Willis says he doubts whether Mr Hani's death will 'disrupt where the
train is headed'. It will, however, in the words of Mr Jan Robbertze,
managing director of Anglovaal Industries, serve to 'keep uncertainty and
underlying unease in place'.
These factors, together with the depressed economy, have already nearly
throttled investment spending. Reserve Bank figures show that South Africa's
investment rate (gross domestic fixed investment as a percentage of gross
domestic product) has fallen from an annual average of over 23 per cent in
the period 1965-1985 to a post-second world war low of 15.9 per cent in
1992. This figure barely covers depreciation.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, has made fostering business confidence a
priority, but was recently forced to confess that his efforts so far had
borne little fruit. The ANC does not see business as a constituency and is
largely silent on the issue. Indeed, the ANC's political and economic
pronouncements have a negative effect on business confidence.

FT  23 APR 93 / Holiday bonus from downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economic downturn is at least bringing an unaccustomed benefit
to the loyal ranks of Japanese workers: longer holidays.
Most of Japan is preparing to shut down from the end of next week for the
annual 'golden week' holiday, when more than 1m Japanese tourists are
expected to take advantage of the yen's recent strength to travel abroad.
A Labour Ministry survey published yesterday suggests most will have
slightly longer than usual to enjoy their travels. The ministry's survey of
about 1,300 companies found that the average company was providing its
workers with 5.5 days holiday, an increase of half a day from last year.
However at some particularly hard-pressed companies the annual holidays are
being extended even further. Two car component makers are reported to be
giving their workers 12 consecutive days' holiday, while a leading maker of
musical instruments is giving its staff no fewer than 16 days' leave.
In contrast semiconductor makers, which are enjoying strong demand from the
revival of the US economy, have cut holidays to four days from five last
year.

THE INDIAN government approved foreign investment proposals worth Rs42.9bn
(Pounds 909m) between August 1991 and last December, more than eight times
the Rs5.3bn level in the August 1990-December 1991 period, before India
embarked on its liberalisation programme in July 1991, writes Shiraz Sidhva
in New Delhi.
According to the Ministry of Industry's annual report yesterday, as many as
1,520 foreign collaborations were approved in the latest period, including
692 approvals involving foreign equity of Rs39.9bn, more than 32 times the
foreign investment approvals of Rs1.2bn the last time.
The US continues to be the leading foreign investor in India, accounting for
Rs27.8bn or nearly 60 per cent of the total approved, according to the
Indian Investment Centre, a government organisation for the promotion of
foreign private investment. Other countries which committed investment are
Switzerland (Rs9.6bn), Japan (Rs6.5bn), Thailand (Rs3.7bn), the UK (Rs1.9bn)
and Germany (Rs1.8bn).
Officials say there has been a spurt in investment during the first three
months of 1993, despite the setback caused by riots and a series of bomb
blasts in Bombay.

FT  23 APR 93 / Blackout imposed on HK talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH negotiators yesterday imposed a news blackout on details of their
talks with Chinese officials on the future of Hong Kong after three and a
half hours of discussions in a secluded Beijing diplomatic compound.
A British embassy official said after the talks that he was 'not even
permitted to use an adjective' to characterise the meeting.
In Hong Kong Mr Chris Patten, the governor, said that any agreement reached
in Beijing would have to command broad support in the colony and in its
Legislative Council.
Mr Patten told the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's law-making body, that it
was Britain's aim to remain true to undertakings it had made to the people
of Hong Kong about the openness and fairness of elections due in 1994 and
1995.
'We have not travelled this far to abandon those undertakings now,' he said.
The forcefulness of his presentation gave little cheer to those who might be
expecting a British climbdown.
Before the two sides sat down in Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's
ambassador to China and head of the British team, described himself as a
'professional optimist', and said that the British side was looking forward
to a 'successful outcome'.
China's chief negotiator, Mr Jiang Enzhu, vice foreign minister, told
reporters that 'the Chinese side has sincerity in the talks and it is my
hope that the talks will yield positive results on the basis of the
important agreement between the two sides'.
This latter was a reference to Beijing's claim that Mr Patten's proposals
for a broadening of democratic reforms in Hong Kong ran counter to
agreements reached with London in the 1980s about the transition to Chinese
rule in 1997.
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoted Mr Jiang as saying that the
two sides had agreed that the talks would be based on the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and relevant
agreements reached between the two countries.
Differences of interpretation over these documents and agreements lie at the
heart of the bitter dispute that has developed between Beijing and Mr
Patten.
British officials in Beijing expect the first round of Hong Kong talks to
last between three and four days, but a resolution of the problem could take
months. They are warning that a successful conclusion is not guaranteed.
Britain will be seeking agreement on a specific plan for legislative reform
that is acceptable to Legco, to Mr Patten, and is reasonably faithful to
London's aims of broadening popular participation in the political process
before 1997.
Solving the Sino-British row over Hong Kong is crucial to the reunification
of the mainland and Taiwan, a senior Chinese official was quoted as saying
by a Beijing-controlled newspaper.
'If the problem with Hong Kong could be resolved satisfactorily, it will
have extremely important effects on the reunification of both sides of the
Taiwan strait,' Mr Li Ruihuan, a Communist party politburo member, told Hong
Kong's Wen Wei Po.
Beijing has said it wants to use the 'one country, two systems' formula of
Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, for Hong Kong's return to China
as a model for the reunification it hopes for with Taiwan.

<TEXT>
THE US is likely to start high-level negotiations soon with Pyongyang in an
attempt to solve the North Korea nuclear weapon issue, the South Korean
government said yesterday.
'Negotiations are now under way (to hold the talks) and, as far as I know,
the time is getting ripe,' said Mr Lee Kyung-jae, the South Korean
presidential spokesman.
The announcement followed a visit to Seoul by Mr Peter Tarnoff, the US
under-secretary of state for political affairs, who will represent the US in
its discussions with North Korea.
North Korea has long sought high-level contacts with the US as the first
step to achieving diplomatic recognition by Washington. But Mr Tarnoff told
the South Koreans that the forthcoming talks are a special event to solve
the nuclear issue and do not represent a prelude to regular US-North Korean
contacts.
Contacts between the US and North Korea have usually been limited to
meetings between consular officials in Beijing.
Some western diplomats in Seoul, however, describe the proposed US talks as
the first concession North Korea has won since its announced withdrawal from
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last month.
South Korea has been urging the US to hold direct talks with Pyongyang
because it believes the meeting could persuade North Korea to reverse its
withdrawal decision and accept nuclear inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency. It not seek direct talks with Pyongyang until the
nuclear issue is resolved.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR ANDRIES TREURNICHT, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative party, the
official opposition in South Africa's white-dominated parliament, died
yesterday aged 72, AP reports from Cape Town.
Mr Frank le Roux, the party's chief whip, said Dr Treurnicht died in a Cape
Town hospital several days after undergoing heart by-pass surgery.
The death comes at a difficult time for the party, which has opposed
President F W de Klerk's reforms to dismantle apartheid and had one of its
most prominent leaders implicated in the assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the
ANC activist.
Dr Treurnicht had warned of chaos if the black majority was allowed to run
the country, but he distanced himself and his party from violence and from
militant right-wing groups such as the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement.
In the past week Mr Clive Derby-Lewis and his wife Gaye, prominent
Conservative party supporters, have been arrested for questioning about Mr
Hani's slaying. Neither has been charged.
Dr Treurnicht was dubbed 'Dr No' for his rigid resistance to political
reform. A fire-and-brimstone preacher of the Dutch Reformed Church, he
entered parliament in 1971 as a candidate of the ruling National party and
eventually became a cabinet minister whose portfolios included public works,
tourism and state administration.
As early as the 1970s, his conservative views clashed with movements toward
reform in the governing party. Dr Treurnicht was suspended as the party's
Transvaal provincial leader in 1982 and weeks later resigned from the
cabinet to form the Conservative party.
His party suffered an embarrassing defeat last March when whites voted
overwhelmingly in a referendum to support Mr de Klerk's reforms.

<TEXT>
THE political comeback of Ms Benazir Bhutto, dismissed as Pakistan's prime
minister in 1990, gathered pace yesterday with the appointment of her
husband, Mr Asif Ali Zardari, as a minister in the interim government.
After Ms Bhutto's government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Mr
Zardari spent over two years in prison. He has been acquitted on nine of 12
cases filed against him, including murder.
In February, following reports of meetings between aides of Ms Bhutto and
the president, Mr Zardari was released on bail though he still faced charges
of extortion, illegal possession of arms and fixing of bank loans.
On Sunday, Mr Khan dismissed the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, Ms Bhutto's
successor, who had sought to strip the president of his powers to remove
governments and appoint the chiefs of the armed services. The president
called elections for July.
The appointment of Mr Zardari, one of four ministers in the new government
from Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party is a further sign of a
rapprochement between Ms Bhutto and the president as part of a rapid
shifting of political alliances within Pakistan.
As opposition leader, Ms Bhutto repeatedly accused the president of
supporting a campaign to victimise her supporters, including the laying of
false criminal charges. However, she moved swiftly to take advantage of the
constitutional dispute between Mr Khan and Mr Sharif, declining to use her
party's votes to back Mr Sharif.
Mr Zardari is one of 17 new ministers in the caretaker government. Finance
minister Mr Farooq Leghari, deputy leader of the PPP, and planning minister
Mr Hamid Nasir Chattha, were sworn in on Sunday along with Mr Balkh Sher
Mazari, the interim prime minister.
Other ministers include seven from factions of the Pakistan Muslim League,
the main party in Mr Sharif's coalition.

FT  23 APR 93 / Republicans' lesson in respect trips up Clinton: The
president is struggling to hit his stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton declared himself disappointed but not disheartened at
his first big legislative defeat, after being forced to abandon all but a
fragment of the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.3bn) spending package he had called
for to stimulate the economy.
The setback is unlikely to prove devastating for Mr Clinton's presidency;
indeed, it is in some ways more of a rebuke to Senator Robert Byrd's
management of the bill, which showed more parliamentary virtuosity than
tact.
The point made by the Republican minority in the Senate, which prevented the
stimulus bill from coming to a vote through what amounted to a filibuster,
was about street credibility rather than economic policy. They wanted some
respect, and their success does not necessarily mean they will be able, or
willing, to block the rest of Mr Clinton's economic programme.
But the setback comes at a time when Mr Clinton appears to have lost much of
his early momentum and to be struggling to hit his stride.
He has not yet taken full control of the machinery of government - at least
partly because of his slowness in making appointments - and now has been
unable to shake off the largely unfair charge that he has been impotent or
ineffectual in the face of quandaries as different as the siege in Waco and
the civil war in Bosnia.
The president faces a testing time over the next few months when Congress
wrestles first with the details of his five-year economic package, and then
with the reform of the healthcare system now being prepared.
While Congress has already passed a budget resolution fixing the totals for
spending and taxation, the door is opening ever wider for changes to the
detailed measures Mr Clinton has proposed.
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House ways and means
committee presides over all tax legislation, this week advised Mr Clinton to
drop a proposed investment tax credit, which many members of Congress have
criticised as merely bringing forward investments that were going to take
place in any case.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has admitted he has a 'hunch' that
Congress will alter the new energy tax, which is one of the pillars of the
administration's revenue-raising proposals.
Many Democrats in the House of Representatives had at first been willing to
take Mr Clinton at his word and pass his proposals as a whole, swallowing
their concern over particular components.
That willingness is fast evaporating as members observe that the Senate is
not showing the same discipline.
Mr Clinton first gave in to western senators and backed away from increases
in fees for grazing and mining on federal land. Now he has been forced to
abandon most of his stimulus bill.
'I don't see how the president at this point can say no to compromise when
he is doing that over on the Senate side in the stimulus package,' Mr
Rostenkowski said.
Some of this reflects Congress's tradition of swiftly abandoning any ship
that shows the slightest signs of taking on water. But it also shows that
some members are learning a lesson cited by some of Mr Clinton's critics in
his home state of Arkansas: if you want something from Mr Clinton, you can
get more by opposing him than by working with him.
Certainly the White House's attempts to punish Democratic Senator Richard
Shelby of Alabama for breaking party ranks over the budget and the stimulus
bill have been pitiful and wholly unsuccessful.
Another home-state criticism was that Mr Clinton was better at campaigning
than at governing; that remains to be seen, but the president has some
catching up to do if he wants to prove his fellow Arkansans wrong.

FT  23 APR 93 / Brazil's attention returns to economy

BRAZIL yesterday turned its attention to the expected announcement of
anti-inflation measures, following an overwhelming vote in a plebiscite on
Wednesday to retain a presidential system of government.
The government has said it will make an announcement about economic policy
after a cabinet meeting called by President Itamar Franco for tomorrow.
Officials have advanced few details of the measures, although Mr Eliseu
Resende, finance minister, has been at work on policy since he took over his
portfolio in early March.
The government appears set on reducing the monthly inflation rate from the
27 per cent where it now stands to about 17 per cent by the end of this
year.
Ms Yeda Crusius, planning minister, reiterated in a meeting this week with
business leaders in Sao Paulo that the government is not preparing an
economic shock plan, or price freeze, that would 'break contractual
obligations'.
She told executives to expect a reaffirmation of privatisation plans,
efforts to encourage foreign investment, and moderate increases in spending
on social programmes. One probable measure is that three zeros will be
trimmed from the cruzeiro.
Final referendum results are not expected until this afternoon, but exit
polls confirmed predictions of an easy victory for the pro-presidential
camp.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters opted to maintain the current system, against
26 per cent who wanted a change to a parliamentary system, and 16 per cent
of voters who rejected both options. Voters also showed - by a 71 per cent
to 11 per cent margin - their preference for the republican form of
government over a monarchy.

FT  23 APR 93 / Company steps out of Merck price line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS by Merck, the largest US drugs group, on how the industry should
respond to political pressure over pricing, were rejected yesterday by
another company, Warner-Lambert.
Merck's chief executive, Mr Roy Vagelos, has proposed limiting price
increases on all prescription products to the rate of inflation plus 1 per
cent. He suggested drugs groups should sign contracts with the government
and pay revenues from excess price increases to improve access to health
care.
Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Amgen and Schering-Plough have all adopted the plan.
However, Mr Melvin Goodes, Warner-Lambert's chief executive, has refused.
'This is not an industry proposal. It's a Merck proposal,' he said.
Price controls did not work, he claimed, and he believed the Clinton
administration would not implement them.
The announcement exposes a split in the US drugs industry over how to
respond to increasing political attacks on its pricing policies. During the
late 1980s, many groups incapable of driving volume growth compensated by
increasing prices.
Warner-Lambert is a classic example of a struggling pharmaceuticals group,
according to analysts. Most of its recent historic growth has been generated
by price increases.
Its main volume-growing product, Lopid, a cholesterol lowering product, has
been hit in recent months by price competition. Earnings are being driven
mainly through rationalisation. Mr Goodes forecast 7-8 per cent sales growth
this year.
So far, 13 companies, including Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Lederle and Syntex, have
agreed to limit price increases, on average, to the rate of inflation. This
allows them to raise some prices more than the rate of inflation, and while
cutting others.

FT  23 APR 93 / BNL in Atlanta funded arms for Iran: Documents reveal more
secret loans from scandal-hit branch of Italian bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Atlanta branch of Italy's state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) -
already embroiled in scandal over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of loans that
helped fund Iraq's war machine - also provided secret loans to finance arms
sales to Iran.
Italian government documents obtained by the Financial Times show that BNL
Atlanta made Dollars 2bn of loans to countries including Iran, the former
Soviet Union, Turkey and Jordan. Like the clandestine Iraqi loans, a large
number of these additional loans were made without any formal notification
to BNL's head office in Rome.
Some of the money was used to help finance shipments of militarily useful
equipment from US and European companies to Tehran, according to a US
government official familiar with the case. Some of the shipments would have
violated the United Nations ban on arms sales to Iran and Iraq during their
1980-1988 war.
The additional loans, made in the mid- and late-1980s, extend the scope of
the BNL scandal well beyond the bank's Atlanta branch and the issue of the
Iraqi loans.
Earlier this week it emerged that US investigators are also looking at BNL's
Argentine operations to see if any of its funds in Buenos Aires were used to
help finance Iraq's Condor 2 nuclear-capable missile project.
BNL has said it is unaware of any links between its Argentine branch and
companies that worked on the Condor 2 missile project. Last night the bank
said it was unaware of the loans to Iran from Atlanta.
However, a senior BNL executive said yesterday that at the time of the FBI
raid on BNL's Atlanta branch on August 4 1989, a total of Dollars 735m of
exposure resulting from non-Iraqi loans was discovered, of which Dollars
417m was US government guaranteed.
He said he could not rule out that other non-Iraqi loans had been made by
the Atlanta branch and already repaid by the time of the raid.
In Venice, meanwhile, an Italian state prosecutor investigating the BNL
affair has asked a court to convict and jail Mr Nerio Nesi and Mr Giacomo
Pedde, the former BNL chairman and director-general, for allegedly illegal
BNL-funded arms sales to Iran. These were unrelated to the Atlanta loans and
were financed from Italy during the 1980s.
Mr Felice Casson, the prosecuting magistrate, has also alleged that Italian
intelligence agents were involved in the BNL-funded arms transactions.
Both Mr Nesi and Mr Pedde have pleaded not guilty in the Venice trial, which
has been under way for several weeks.
It was also learned yesterday that a team of US prosecutors from Atlanta is
planning to travel to Rome next month in order to question several BNL
executives. This would mark the first time that Atlanta investigators have
gone to Rome and comes three months after the US Federal Reserve re-opened
its investigation of the BNL affair by sending officials from Washington and
New York to Rome.

FT  23 APR 93 / Russian Referendum: Barnstorming campaigner seems to be
losing will to win - The fire has faded since his experiences at this
month's Congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HAS President Boris Yeltsin the will to win? It has not seemed like it, so
far, in this 'campaign'. The barnstormer of presidential elections two years
ago has become a wooden figure, walking through engagements and stumbling
through speeches, write John Lloyd from Moscow and Gillian Tett from
Izhevsk.
Yesterday he made a high-profile attempt to win the support of Russia's huge
military industrial complex with a visit to the Russian republic of Udmurtia
 -hitherto one of the most militarised and secretive regions in the country.
But his appearance in the capital, Izhevsk, was far removed from the
standards of western political campaigning. Although a small group of
supporters turned out in the muddy streets to cheer the presidential
cavalcade, Mr Yeltsin refused to give them more than a stiff wave, a weak
smile and a few words as he dashed between a series of closed-door meetings.
His visit to Izhevsk had been billed as the last leg of his pre-referendum
campaign, a campaign which has taken him across Russia's provinces.
But he told those assembled yesterday: 'I have come for a working visit, not
for political meetings or campaign speeches.'
At the Izhmash Weapons Enterprise, Mr Yeltsin briefly regained a flash of
his old campaigning style when he stopped to wave and speak to the crowd
gathered next to an old stature of Lenin. 'I have come to solve all your
problems,' he announced majestically before striding into the plant to
discuss with city leaders the problems of conversion of military plants.
But such glimpses of the old campaigner have been few and far between. Last
week he read out a prepared statement to journalists as though seeing it for
the first time, then answered questions in an offhand manner, coming alive
only when he said he would resign if the referendum was lost.
He was perfunctory in Novokuznetsk in Siberia 10 days ago, rushing through
meetings looking impatient and ungracious. In Vladimir last Sunday he walked
in the Easter procession but said little of note.
Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, the only Russian politician who approaches
Mr Yeltsin's popularity, claimed before parliament last week that the ruling
power structure, and in particular the president's closest circle, was
corrupt and pursuing self-enrichment while Russia languishes in poverty.
In the face of this, Mr Yeltsin has not recovered the fighting spirit which
was his trademark and his boast. A month ago, addressing the nation on
television, he said: 'I am determined to act resolutely. . . if political
squabbling is not halted, if no resolute measures are taken to resolve the
political crisis, if no powerful momentum is given to the economic reforms,
the country will be pushed into anarchy.'
Yet the resolute action faded away during the Congress of Peoples' Deputies
this month, where at one stage, reeling on his feet, he begged for a
compromise with those with whom he had said no compromise was possible. The
experience of that Congress seems to have made him lose heart.
Mr Yeltsin was right in his speech: the country is indeed threatened, if not
with anarchy, certainly with a further descent. Mr Yevgeny Yasin, director
of the Expert Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and by no
means an opponent of Mr Yeltsin, said last week: 'The government is weak and
resorts to populist measures. . . this year will not become the turning
point in our struggle against the crisis, and we will meet the year 1994
with a weak state power and ineffective state regulation.'
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finances, put it
yet more starkly on April 7: 'By giving money to this or that sector we have
so far averted catastrophe but in six months hyperinflation will finally
exhaust the economy and the budget will collapse. The financial and credit
system will break down soon afterwards.'
All this would happen, said Mr Fyodorov, if the resolute action Mr Yeltsin
has promised is not taken. But first he must win the referendum, and
yesterday in Udmurtia he refused to predict the outcome of Sunday's
all-Russian vote.

FT  23 APR 93 / Russian Referendum: Cold comfort in rebellious Saransk -
Support from the Mordovian republic seems unlikely to be strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SARANSK, MORDOVIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN the cold central square of Saransk, the shabby capital of Mordovia, the
republic's embattled president is housed in a large, grey building. Locals
mischievously call it the 'white house,' - a reference to the Russian
presidential 'white house' 500km to the west in Moscow.
In a virtual mirror image of the struggle being played out nationally, a
political drama is unfolding in Mordovia which could call into question the
very future of Russia as a federal state.
Earlier this month the Mordovian parliament, dominated by former Communist
apparatchiks, moved to oust Mr Vasily Guslyannikov, the Mordovian president,
who, like Mr Yeltsin, came to power through popular elections.
Mr Yeltsin issued a decree declaring the move illegal and ordered it to
reinstate Mr Guslyannikov. This week Mordovia's parliament stepped up its
challenge, establishing a parallel government and constitutional court.
Mr Guslyannikov, who still sits in the 'white house' insists that according
to the Russian constitution he is still president, supported by Mr Yeltsin
and the local militia.
The drama unfolding in Mordovia reflects a battle occurring in many regions
between reformist governments and conservative parliaments. 'What is
happening here is a drive by the communists to regain power. The same thing
is happening across Russia and in Moscow,' says Mr Guslyannikov, a former
engineer.
Across the square in the sugar pink building of the Mordovian parliament,
deputies insist the newly written Mordovian constitution makes the president
powerless. 'The president can say what he wants, but no one obeys his
orders,' says Mr Nikolai Biryukov, chairman of the parliament, and a long
time Communist.
Mr Guslyannikov became president in the same year that Mordovians voted
overwhelmingly for Mr Yeltsin in Russian presidential elections. In two
years he has freed prices, started land reform, and attempted to hold new
elections for the republic's parliament. These moves have met with stiff
opposition from parliament, which, like the Russian parliament, was elected
under the old system. The parliament argues that Mr Guslyannikov's
government is too inexperienced to rule, and that the pace of reform has
been too fast.
'I favour a regulated market, not the chaotic bazaar that we have now,' says
Mr Biryukov, who believes land should remain collectively owned, that food
prices should be regulated and that single candidate 'elections' are
perfectly valid.
Beyond the struggle over reform, there is also a second issue at stake: the
status of Russia as a federal state.
The Mordovian parliament insists it wants to remain part of Russia, not
least because the republic is heavily dependent on Moscow' subsidies - the
largely agricultural republic is one of the poorest in Russia.
But parliament's refusal to recognise Mr Yeltsin's decrees illustrates the
confusion that surrounds the status of the Russian constitution and the
degree to which Russia's regions are successfully challenging Moscow's
control.
The local militia and most of the weary 1m-strong population of Mordovia, a
mixture of Russians and Finno-Ughric groups, remain aloof from the conflict,
for the moment. Mr Biryukov has little outright popularity, but Mr
Guslyannikov's support has been crumbling fast as living standards have
fallen and prices risen - only two people turned out to picket parliament
this week.
But as the republic prepares for Sunday's referendum, this disenchantment
seems likely to rub off on Mr Yeltsin too.
At a nursing college in Saransk, which is acting as a polling station, Mrs
Larissa Vitalievna, an administrator, predicts that support for Mr Yeltsin
will be weak. 'Two years ago we believed so much and hoped so much. . . 'But
the prices have gone up so much, and we see stupid people become
millionaires and highly qualified people become poor'.
In the countryside, a small band of new, private farmers remain solidly
behind him.
However, most state enterprises are trying to ignore the power struggle,
relying instead on Moscow for their trading licences. 'What we want is
stability,' sighs Mr Gennady Uktukhin, head of Mordovia's only commodity
exchange. 'How can we ever hope to run or reform an economy, when we have
two separate governments, sitting in two separate buildings, to deal with?'

FT  23 APR 93 / Russian Referendum: Tired Yeltsin may win apathetic Yes - A
faltering president has failed to inspire the Russian people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian referendum on Sunday is likely to be as fateful a vote as any
which Russians have made in their brief period of statehood. But the
campaign has not been inspiring.
Mr Yeltsin, on his own admission yesterday, is exhausted. He has acted like
it: he appeared briefly at a heavy metal rock concert outside the Kremlin on
Wednesday night with an aide supporting his elbow (though perhaps it was the
appalling sound from the loudspeakers which made him queasy).
On the campaign trail he has rejected the opportunity to energise and
inspire his fellow Russians. Instead he has chosen largely to ignore them.
His public appearances, as yesterday in Izhevsk in Udmurtia, have been curt
and downbeat, his speeches bland, his message crudely simplified.
The referendum itself is the result of horse trading between a president and
parliament who had grown not just to distrust, but to hate, each other.
Mr Yeltsin's original impulse, to seek a simple vote of trust, was amplified
at the last Congress of People's Deputies in early April into a
four-question ballot on trust, approval of the government's economic and
social programme and early elections for president and parliament.
The outcome is uncertain: polling in Russia is in its infancy, and the
better established organisations such as Mnenie (Opinion) point to wide
regional disparities and a very high proportion of people still undecided.
The consensus is that Mr Yeltsin will win on 'trust' and may lose on support
for his economic programme, and that those voting either for or against the
two questions on early elections for parliament and presidency will not have
sufficient numbers to cross the threshold of 50 per cent of the electorate
required by these two questions.
Insofar as Mr Yeltsin and his associates have elaborated themes, they have
been simple and stark. Mr Yeltsin has posed the choice as being between
himself and chaos - and communist chaos, at that. In this he has been
supported by a number of his ministers.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said in Arkhangelsk earlier this
week that 'a No vote would mean that Russia will be forced back into
isolation and confrontation with the world'.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, said that
'battle hardened communist forces', already attacking his privatisation
drive, would 'wholly reverse' the reforms if the referendum was lost.
Against this, the opposition have focused on the issue of corruption,
undoubtedly striking a popular chord.
Since the scabrous speech by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi to parliament
last week, much attention has focused on his allegations of criminality or
criminal negligence against the government and the inner circle of Yeltsin
advisers.
Yesterday the prosecutor-general's office said it was investigating
allegations that defence minister Pavel Grachev was involved in a swindle
involving property belonging to Soviet troops in eastern Germany.
How far Mr Yeltsin himself has been touched by this cannot be ascertained -
though his press secretary expressly denied a story published by Pravda
alleging that he had built himself palatial dachas in various locations in
Russia.
For the poor, who form a large proportion of the Russian population and who
 -on polling evidence - are largely against Mr Yeltsin, the undoubted
corruption of state officials is a terrible added insult to their mean
lives.
To offset such sentiments Mr Yeltsin has issued a series of decrees over the
last two weeks which have been nakedly aimed at buying support: one doubled
the minimum wage to Rbs4,500 a month, albeit still below the poverty level.
The real issues facing the country - the largely unfulfilled prospectus of
economic reform above all - have not had much of an outing, certainly not
from the president, whose most animated utterance yesterday came when he
shouted to a crowd of supporters in Izhevsk: 'I have come to solve all your
problems.'
Beneath the surface, a scarcely-disguised anxiety is evident among the
radicals who still form the economic backbone of Mr Yeltsin's team. Former
prime minister Yegor Gaidar warned in St Petersburg on Tuesday: 'A retreat
has started in economic policy and forces are at work which could restore
state control over the economy'.
Mr Chubais, asked about Mr Yeltsin's appointment of his long-time associate
Mr Oleg Lobov as first deputy prime minister for the economy, saw it as the
possible reassertion of the rule of Gosplan, the once-dominant central
planning ministry.
Mr Yeltsin has said he will resign if he loses. He may, of course, change
his mind if he is persuaded that to hand over power (as the constitution
demands) to Gen Rutskoi would be to betray his reform path.
In this case a dangerous situation arises: Gen Rutskoi has been drawn
increasingly into the hardline camp led by the Russian Unity group, whose
leader, Mr Vladimir Isakov, yesterday announced that a newly-formed union of
hardline forces would use force if they felt the constitution was being
threatened.
The much-mooted civil war could find its origin there.
If he does lose and does go, the chaos predicted by himself and his
supporters would ensue only if Gen Rutskoi tried to make his temporary
guardianship of the presidency until elections into a more permanent one,
and cracked down on Mr Yeltsin's supporters and appointees.
There is a growing field of reformist politicians willing to compete for the
top job: both Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, and Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky, the prominent economist, have said they will stand if Mr Yeltsin
steps down. Mr Gaidar is a political as well as an administrative figure,
and the cabinet contains other ministers - such as Mr Boris Fyodorov, Mr
Chubais and Mr Alexander Shokhin, all with deputy premier's rank - who are
competent and capable of standing the strain.
In the more likely eventuality of a victory on Sunday, Mr Yeltsin has
several times indicated that he will embark on radical reforms. Last week he
said he would bring in decrees aimed at widening private ownership and
introduce a new phase of radical reform.
Yesterday in Izhevsk he said that he would institute 'tough measures'
against his opponents: Mr Sergei Filatov, his chief of staff, said on
Tuesday that a victorious Yeltsin would immediately seek to introduce a new
constitution to replace the present one.
Most of these actions are likely to be unconstitutional: indeed, the tougher
they are, the further outside the current law they will be.
Since the referendum carries no constitutional weight, the formal power
structure will be the same on April 26 as it is today; and it is on this
structure, with its vested interests, many of which have retained their
power and privileges from the Communist era, on which Mr Yeltsin and his
team must launch themselves.
Maybe Mr Yeltsin has already discounted the referendum, and is garnering
strength for the larger battle. He will need fresh strength if this
referendum, meaningless in most obvious respects, is to take on symbolic
value as an opening to further reform.

FT  23 APR 93 / Russian Referendum: Vast logistical effort across 9 time
zones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian referendum on Sunday is a vast logistical exercise. Across nine
time zones of a huge land mass, electoral commissions are preparing ballot
papers and electoral lists to allow Russia's estimated 107m voters to give a
'da' or a 'nyet' to four questions:
Do you trust the president?
Do you approve of his social and economic programme?
Do you want an early election of the president?
Do you want early elections of the people's deputies?
Each one must be answered separately.
Evidence is mixed but signs are most people will have the facilities to vote
despite threats by some republics and regions to boycott the poll.
An example of how the referendum will be organised can be seen at the voting
station in the Lenin Rayon district of Saransk, in the autonomous republic
of Mordovia.
The Saransk electoral commission was first alerted in January, but
preparations were put on hold during two months of infighting between
parliament and Mr Yeltsin.
Once the form of the referendum was decided early this month, work was begun
in Lenin Rayon, much of it by student nurses. Like most places in Russia
they have no computers and everything is being done by hand or on battered
old typewriters.
'We have to do a lot of work in a very little time,' says Mrs Yelina
Lyudmiliavna, chairwoman of the 14-strong electoral committee for Lenin
Rayon.
The young nurses must first verify the district's 2,000 voters, then write
out invitations, vote and address 2,000 envelopes and dispatch them by hand.
When they come to the polling station the voters will exchange their slips
for a ballot paper, go to curtained booths, and make their choice.
'We have a lot of experience from the Soviet time,' says Ms Larissa
Vitalievna 'We had a debate about whether it would be appropriate to use red
banners (from the communist period) and decided no. But it's a pity we won't
be able to put on a show as beautiful as we did then.'
The votes will take some days to count, especially from remote rural
stations, with official results unavailable until the middle of next week.
First results from the cities should be known late on Sunday night or early
Monday morning. Western-style exit polls are not expected to be used.
The president's men are worried by the possibility of a low turnout, and by
the refusal of some regions or republics to provide polling stations. Mr
Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to Mr Yeltsin, said on Tuesday that their
polling showed a possible turnout as low as 53 per cent.
He said that, according to their information, only 73 per cent of the voting
districts were 'technically ready' to conduct the referendum.
Mr Yeltsin felt it necessary to issue an order this week which specifies
that the militia must turn out in force to ensure order during polling.

FT  23 APR 93 / EBRD Annual Report: You win some .. you lose some .. - Some
bankers are questioning EBRD's expertise as well as its luck / EBRD steps in
where others fear to tread
</HEADLINE>

ANY investing institution has its share of successes and failures. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has proved no exception. It
is unfortunate for the EBRD's reputation however that the bank's first and
most closely watched equity involvement, in Microsystem of Hungary, is one
disappointment.
Microsystem, a leading private computer company, looked a good prospect when
the EBRD in December 1991 approved an investment.
Eight software experts had founded the company in 1983 with 'some
programming expertise, Dollars 2,000 and a pencil.' Microsystem rode the
back of the personal computer boom to expand rapidly in the second half of
the decade. The company evaded Cocom restrictions on technology transfers,
imported clones from Asia and added huge mark-ups to the prices charged to
Hungarians.
In the early 1990s Microsystem diversified into telecommunications, a
growing sector in eastern Europe. The company's managers did not, however,
want to lose their independence by teaming up with a large western computer
company.
So Salomon Brothers, the company's advisers, brought in the EBRD as a core
outside shareholder around which other investors would congregate. The EBRD
paid Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.95m) for a 17 per cent stake.
The bank held up the investment as a model. The transaction countered
criticism that the bank was dealing too much with state companies and
institutions, rather than encouraging the nascent private sector in eastern
Europe.
'Everybody was happy,' says Mr Peter Vadasz, chairman of Microsystem. That
is no longer so, as Microsystem's financial performance rapidly soured the
relationship with EBRD.
Fierce price competition in the computer business worldwide combined with
the opening of the local market to legitimate imports. Companies such as
Microsystem, which developed high overheads in the days of high profits,
suffered from undercutting by western distributors.
Microsystem plunged into loss in 1992 and turnover slumped 24 per cent to
Ft1.8bn (Pounds 1.3m), although the company now detects a recovery in
profitability.
The EBRD is clearly dissatisfied with Microsystem's financial performance.
For his part, Mr Vadasz has expressed irritation at constant demands for
information from shareholders. Mr Vadasz is also disappointed that the
EBRD's seal of approval carried so little weight for customers.
'We promised high profits; they promised help; neither of us kept our
promises 100 per cent,' Mr Vadasz says.
Nevertheless EBRD officials adopt a stoical stance. The name of the game is
investment, says one: 'You win some, you lose some.' EBRD's Budapest office
prefers to point to winners such as Petofi Nyomda, a successful privatised
printer which has received EBRD credits.
But some bankers question the EBRD's expertise as much as its luck. One
senior figure who was invited to participate in the Microsystem placement,
said he thought the deal was misplaced and doubted if the company had a
future.'
Judgments of this kind are damaging for the bank. For the EBRD prides itself
on a catalytic role. The bank boasts that its presence gives a seal of
approval to a transaction and attracts other investors.
But that depends on the investor community's confidence in the EBRD's
judgment. The bank cannot afford too many Microsystems.

FT  23 APR 93 / EBRD Annual Report: Attali pledges to triple rate of
investment - Anthony Robinson takes stock of the bank's successes and
failures in stimulating private enterprise / Investment track record
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS not fair to judge a new aeroplane by its altitude just after the
take-off,' Mr Jacques Attali, president of European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, protested yesterday as he summed up the first full year's
operation of what he called this 'unique' institution with its mandate to
focus exclusively on helping the former Soviet bloc develop democracy and
private enterprise.
Particularly, he might have added, as it was taking off with a newly
recruited multinational crew from 40 countries and heading for the
turbulence of unprecedented problems demanding innovative solutions.
Take for example the case of Balkancar, the Bulgarian fork-lift truck maker,
which used to work round the clock on a three-shift basis supplying cheap,
rugged forklifts to the entire Comecon market.
Its plants now work two or three hours a day, hundreds of workers face
layoffs, the plant faces bankruptcy - but throughout the former Soviet
Union, forklifts are being scrapped because of the lack of elementary spare
parts.
Hungary's Ikarus bus factory, the Czech republic's CKD tram factory and
Skoda's locomotive plant, which used to supply the Soviet railways, face a
similar dilemma.
The EBRD, according to Mr Ron Freeman, the head of merchant banking, is
currently looking for ways of helping Russia finance the import of spare
parts from Balkancar to keep Russian factories and warehouses in operation
and provide a breathing space until Balkancar itself can be reorganised and
eventually privatised.
Searching for imaginative ways of keeping state-owned behemoths afloat is
not strictly speaking part of the EBRD's mandate.
It is expected to allocate 60 per cent of its funds to private enterprise.
Unfortunately, privatisation has hardly started in Bulgaria, bank reform is
incomplete, and thus far less than Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) of private
investment has flowed into this Balkan neighbour of warring Serbia.
Mr Alexander Bozhov, head of the Bulgarian privatisation agency, says: 'We
are disappointed with the EBRD because it has not yet finalised any projects
here. But I have to admit that's largely our fault because we have not
prepared any concrete proposals either.'
The list of EBRD projects approved last year, as detailed in the annual
report, reflects the wider experience of the World Bank, the IMF and private
investors who have all concentrated their first efforts on those countries
which have stabilised their currencies and have introduced privatisation,
banking and bankruptcy laws and reformed their tax systems.
The bulk of approved EBRD projects are in the Czech republic, Hungary and
Poland. Private investors have put Dollars 7bn into these three states - but
little elsewhere in the 22 countries in which the EBRD operates, except for
a few potentially big, capital-intensive projects in resource-rich,
private-investment-welcoming new republics like Kazakhstan.
Mr Attali pledged that the rate of disbursement of EBRD financing would
triple this year as projects in the pipeline came to fruition and key
reforms, especially banking sector modernisation and the cleaning-up of
enterprise balance sheets, fall into place.
The exponential growth in private sector enterprise - it already accounts
for well over half the GDP in Poland and is rising throughout the region -
should also make it easier to raise the proportion of funds going to local
entre - preneurs.
Until now, however, the figures show that it has proved easier to make
co-financing deals with the existing international institutions, banks and
private companies than to lend to fledgling local entrepreneurs with no real
track record and little chance of attracting funds from private banks or
other sources than their own.
The classic deal of this kind was EBRD's modest Ecu102m (Pounds 80m)
contribution to Volkswagen's eventual Ecu3.49bn commitment to Skoda in the
Czech republic, followed by its part financing of Air France's investment in
Czechoslovenska Airlines.
In Poland the EBRD contributed Ecu5.5m to AAB's Ecu15.4m extension to its
ABB Dolmel venture in Poland, and has co-financed the Pilkington glass
project in Huta Sandomierz and Lucchini of Italy's modernisation and
acquisition of the Huta Warszawa steel works.
The EBRD's initial emphasis on co-financing western projects, on financing
endless technical studies, pilot privatisation projects and its cautious,
commercial approach to lending to fledgling local entrepreneurs has its
critics in eastern Europe as well as London.
'The EBRD promised to be innovative but in practice it's very conventional,'
complained a Polish businessman frustrated by lengthy correspondence and
meticulous procedures.
The hope in eastern Europe is that the bank will be better able to
accomplish its primary purpose of helping to foster local private initiative
and enterprise once bank reform, bankruptcy and property laws are in place.
The concern is that the bank will get too involved in long-term
infrastructure, energy and environmental projects, including the new nuclear
safety facility.
Significantly however, two of the latest EBRD initiatives are directed at
helping the growth of private banking in eastern Europe.
It has just subscribed to 20 per cent of the shares of Ion Tiriac bank, the
leading privately-owned bank in Romania, and a 28 per cent stake in Poland's
Wielkpolski Bank Kreditowy.
The bank is also involved in a complex Polish scheme involving 180 companies
which figure as bad loans on the books of Polish banks about to be
privatised.
In these cases the EBRD stepped in where private western banks have thus far
been reluctant to tread. Eastern Europe is a risky part of the world for
pioneers.
Given the banks' cost structure and organisation it is not able profitably
to make loans smaller than around Ecu5m.
But by lending to fledgling local banks which are equipped to exercise due
diligence and assess the creditworthiness of small to medium-sized private
companies the EBRD hopes to be better able to fulfil its mandate to help the
emerging private sector.

FT  23 APR 93 / EBRD Annual Report: Overspend at bank put at 20% - Bank
fails to gain from sterling's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's accounts show
spending on overheads last year exceeded its budget by 20 per cent in terms
of European Currency Units.
The bank insists that its costs - most of which are paid out in the British
currency - were in fact less than budgeted when measured in sterling.
Overhead expenses net of government grants came to Ecu50.7m, compared with
the budgeted Ecu42.1m, up from only Ecu12.2m in the bank's start-up year in
1991.
At the Ecu exchange rate at the beginning of 1992, the budgeted figure for
last year was the equivalent of Pounds 30.1m. At the Ecu rate at the end of
1992, the actual amount spent was the equivalent of Pounds 40.4m.
Despite this, EBRD officials said yesterday that, compared with the original
sterling figures forecast for 1992, spending showed a slight fall.
EBRD officials said yesterday that the difference between the sterling and
Ecu calculations partly reflected the impact of procedures for depreciation
of capital spending. It said the discrepancy was also due to transactions
carried out at the start of each year to translate the bank's income -
denominated in Ecus, and accruing in a variety of currencies - into sterling
for spending during the year.
This practice of 'hedging' its Ecu income is meant to avoid exposing the
bank to foreign exchange risks. In fact, it meant that the EBRD failed to
benefit, as it would otherwise have done, from sterling's sharp fall against
European currencies towards the end of the year.
The bank's overall administrative costs, including personnel costs, totalled
Ecu96.2m last year, slightly higher than the budgeted Ecu95.2m.
The relatively small overshoot reflected the impact of lower-than-budgeted
personnel costs, which amounted to Ecu45.5m compared with the budgeted
Ecu45.5m - a fall which was presumably due to the decline of sterling during
the year.
Mr Jacques Manardo, the principal accountant responsible for EBRD's audit,
yesterday said he was fully satisified with the internal controls operated
by the EBRD. 'It's a small, well managed operation. I don't perceive any
lack of transparency,' he said.
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu won the audit for the EBRD after a competitive
tender among the leading international accountancy firms.
The audit is co-ordinated from London, although the audit report is signed
from Paris because that is Mr Manardo's base.
The lead partner on the audit is Mr Brian Smouha, liquidator of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International and a banking partner
with Touche Ross, the DTT affiliate in the UK.
There are another four auditors in London, and about six more overseas, with
auditing of loans and operations in eastern Europe co-ordinated by an
accountant in DTT's Budapest office.
The accounts are prepared in accordance with international auditing and
accounting standards, modified to meet the structure of the bank and certain
EC regulations.

FT  23 APR 93 / UK may back US on bombing Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN signalled yesterday that it was ready to give reluctant backing to a
move by the US administration to bomb Serbian supply lines in Bosnia or to
lift the international arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems.
As Washington continued to weigh its responses to the latest Serbian
advances in the former Yugoslav province, senior British ministers said that
they now judged President Bill Clinton almost certain to announce new
measures against the Serbs.
The London government has drawn up detailed contingency plans to withdraw at
short notice its 2,400-strong contribution to the UN humanitarian effort if
the US stance brings an escalation in the fighting.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told a cabinet meeting that it was
uncertain whether he would choose lifting the arms embargo or the threat of
air strikes. But ministers concluded that in either case it would be
impossible for Britain to stand out against such a move.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said after talks in Washington
that the same debate over the right course of action was going on within US
government departments as in London and Paris. He said he was satisfied the
US attached a high priority to UN humanitarian operations, which he had
warned could be jeopardised by military action.
'It might be a price worth paying,' he said. Mr Rifkind was critical of
calls to lift the embargo on deliveries of arms to the Bosnian Moslems. 'You
are unleashing the dogs of war but you have no control over them. Other
forms of military action don't have that particular problem,' he said.
Meanwhile, Canadian UN troops in Srebrenica are prepared to use force to
protect the demilitarised zone, the commander of the UN Protection Force
(Unprofor) in former Yugoslavia said yesterday.
'The order is that the (troops) protect this demilitarised zone as
peacekeepers,' Lt Gen Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the Unprofor commander, said at a
news conference in Zagreb. 'That means that if somebody tries to enter it
with force, they will use force in self-defence.'
However, a UN official said the remarks by Gen Wahlgren did not imply the
troops were ready to defend the eastern Bosnian town if the ceasefire broke
down and Serb besiegers resumed shelling. 'We have no mandate, no ability
and no intention of defending Srebrenica by the use of force,' the official
said.
The 150-strong UN contingent consists of lightly-armed infantry soldiers
with thinly-armoured personnel carriers and a few trucks and jeeps. The
nearest reinforcements are Canadian and British soldiers at Tuzla, 60km away
and the other side of the confrontation line.
The ceasefire in Srebrenica which was agreed by the Bosnian Serbian and
Moslem military commanders last weekend was holding and an Unprofor
spokesman in Sarajevo said that UN troops had completed the destruction of
weapons handed in by the Moslem defenders of the town.
However, one of the commanders of the Serb besieging forces said that the
Moslems had surrendered 'a ridiculously small' quantity of 'mainly obsolete
and useless' arms.
In central Bosnia, Moslem and Croat forces, once allies in the struggle
against the Bosnian Serbs, continued to fight for territory, breaking a
brief ceasefire negotiated hours earlier.
Some 250 people, mainly civilians, have died in the Croat-Moslem clashes
over the past few days.
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said Croat forces had captured the town of
Vares, 35km north of the Bosnian capital. It accused the Croats of shelling
Moslem positions around Kiseljak, to the west of Sarajevo.
The radio also said that 12 people died in the shelling of Gorazde over the
last 24 hours.
In western Croatia, one Czechoslovak peacekeeper was killed and two wounded
in a Croat attack on Gospic, amid mounting clashes between Croat and Serb
forces.

FT  23 APR 93 / Sweden acts to curb budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right minority government yesterday announced further deep
spending cuts and new measures to tackle unemployment, warning that the
short-term outlook for the economy was worse than previously forecast.
It also warned in its supplementary budget proposal that the budget deficit,
among the highest in western Europe, would be SKr191.2bn (Pounds 16.6bn) for
the financial year starting July 1. This is 12.9 per cent of gross national
product and nearly SKr30bn more than indicated three months ago when the
government made its initial budget proposals.
The spending cuts announced yesterday are in line with indications given in
the broad outline of the budget in January.
Government forecasts now point to a 1.7 per cent fall in GNP this year,
compared with the 1.4 per cent drop predicted in January. Next year, it
predicts growth of 1.2 per cent, compared with its earlier 1.6 per cent
forecast. The government said the main reason for the adjustment was the
sharp slowdown in the German economy.
The forecasts came as the Swedish finance minister, Ms Anne Wibble, outlined
SKr81bn in savings for the years 1994-1998 as part of a strategy to
eliminate Sweden's structural budget deficit.
Of the SKr81bn savings, SKr61bn will come from limiting public consumption
and cutting benefits. Reform of the pensions system and increased income
through tax measures, including widening the VAT base, will account for
SKr20bn.
The government has now outlined savings amounting to SKr160m since it came
to power in September 1991 to help tackle a financial crisis caused by
rising unemployment, falling tax revenues, and the cost of bailing out its
stricken banking system.
The state's borrowing requirement is put at SKr233.9bn this year, rising to
SKr255.3bn next year. Interest on government debt will rise to SKr95bn next
year from SKr73.0bn in 1992-93.
Measures to tackle unemployment were highlighted yesterday, with a plan to
provide work experience and training to a further 130,000-140,000 people.
The aim is to cut official unemployment (excluding those on training
schemes) from 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent.

FT  23 APR 93 / Amato hands in his resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE search began last night for a new Italian government based on a broader
political consensus to reform the electoral system, following last Sunday's
referendum.
This followed a visit to the Quirinale Palace by Mr Giuliano Amato during
which he handed in the resignation of his four-party coalition to President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
President Scalfaro reserved the right to decide whether to accept the
resignation of the coalition, composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists,
Social Democrats and Liberals, formed last June .
Mr Scalfaro has thus kept his options open in finding a replacement and
ensured that the outgoing government will remain in a caretaker capacity.
The search promises to be tortuous in the absence of any prior agreement
either on a suitable candidate or on the type of coalition feasible in a
fractured parliament with the traditional parties discredited by corruption
scandals.
The Socialist premier foreshadowed the end of his government, Italy's 51st
since the war, in a statement to parliament on Wednesday. However, he waited
until the end of yesterday's one-day parliamentary debate on the impact of
the referendum result before informing parliament. This was to observe a
constitutional nicety - the debate could not have been held if the
announcement had preceded it.
President Scalfaro is expected to play a key role in brokering an agreement.
It is the first time a president has found himself in such a pivotal
position, with the main parties having such reduced power.
The president is anxious to see a new government formed as soon as possible.
But as yesterday's debate showed, forging a consensus round a government
with broad parliamentary support could prove difficult.
During the debate Mr Mario Segni, the leader of the referendum movement
whose political position has been boosted by the overwhelming endorsement of
his referendum proposal to reform Senate electoral law, avoided any
suggestion he might be willing to head a new government. This contrasted
with his offer to head a government after last April's general election.
However, Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lombard League which controls
nearly one-third of the vote in northern Italy, backed the idea of a Segni
government.
Mr Amato has not excluded his own candidature at the head of a reshaped
government. This was advocated yesterday by Mr Marco Panella, leader of the
Radical party.

FT  23 APR 93 / Saatchi directs the Yeltsins' debut from wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLICE of life in the Yeltsin household broadcast earlier this week on
Russian television instantly became a big talking point. It was something
akin to the reaction of the British on seeing the family life of the royal
family for the first time three decades ago. But how natural was it?
Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising agency credited with past successes for
the British Conservative party, thinks it may have been in part their work.
Speaking yesterday for the first time about the part the agency has played
in assisting Mr Yeltsin in his referendum campaign, Mr Steve Hilton, a
Saatchi executive, said he had worked with a Russian agency in the weeks
before the campaign and made a series of recommendations about Mr Yeltsin's
image - recommendations which seem to have been heeded.
In association with Gallup Poll and basing his recommendations on group
discussions with Russian citizens in half a dozen cities, Mr Hilton wrote a
memorandum last week which advised the Russian leader to play to his
perceived strengths.
'People saw him as strong: so we advised him to put himself forward as a
strong leader for a strong Russia. He was seen as manly and as simple,
straightforward.'
The film of the Yeltsins at home featured all of these characteristics.
Another of the Saatchi-Gallup findings was that the Russian Congress of
People's deputies was deeply unpopular.
'We found nobody with a good word to say about them. So we advised that
Yeltsin could be very negative about them; much more negative than would
have been the case in a western campaign.' Mr Yeltsin, and his ministers and
aides, have represented the Congress as Communists who want to turn the
clock back to the worst days of the Soviet Union.
'We thought that this should be a very Russian campaign,' said Mr Hilton.
'We advised that there should be a lot of endorsements from famous people,
like actors and actresses, so that the idea of voting for Yeltsin would be
fashionable.'
Mr Yeltsin has the wholehearted backing of the intelligentsia and the
artistic circles of Moscow - meeting them in the Bolshoi theatre and being
welcomed on platforms by famous actresses.
'We didn't have much time,' says Mr Hilton, who had worked on last year's UK
Conservative campaign for months before the general election. 'And I thought
at first that it was almost a lost cause. We weren't able to do poster and
television campaigns: all we could do was to recommend themes which Mr
Yeltsin and his supporters could stress in speeches and in briefings to the
media.'
The Saatchi effort was spearheaded in Moscow by Mr Hilton, who travelled
throughout Russia with Mr Gordon Heald of Gallup to listen for himself to
the opinions of Russians. In overall command in London was Mr John Maples, a
former treasury minister who, since his defeat in the last election, has
been head of Saatchi's government communications worldwide division.

FT  23 APR 93 / The Bundesbank springs another interest rates surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE Bundesbank proved once again yesterday that it likes nothing better than
to be the master of the unexpected.
On Wednesday, the bank published poor money supply figures, and Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister, issued a dire prognosis about the state of
public finances.
Neither development was thought likely to encourage further loosening of
German monetary policy and economists and bond traders had resigned
themselves to a quiet Thursday afternoon contemplating the German central
bank's profit figures - the reason given in advance for yesterday's press
conference.
The Bundesbank was almost predictably unpredictable yesterday, wrong-footing
observers with cuts in official rates. The Lombard rate was cut 0.5 per cent
to 8.5 per cent and the discount rate by 0.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent -
the first cuts in official rates since March 18.
In the weeks since the last cut, the market's attentions had been focused on
the Bundesbank's weekly activities in the money markets. Week by week
throughout April, the German central bank tantalised observers by making a
series of minuscule cuts in the rate at which it provides wholesale funds to
the banking community.
This created the psychological climate where markets were prepared to
continue being disappointed - and found themselves pleasantly surprised
yesterday - even though the cuts in themselves were hardly going to reverse
Germany's increasingly severe recession.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, made little direct reference to
the real economy yesterday, saying the decision was justified because money
supply for all the short-term disappointment of Wednesday's figure - was
again under control.
However, economists are convinced the Bundesbank is increasingly tailoring
monetary policy to developments in the real economy. The gravity of the
recession was underscored by figures from Bonn on Wednesday showing the
economy had further deteriorated since March.
And Mr Waigel's forecast that his central government budget deficit could
reach DM70bn (Pounds 28.4bn), compared with an earlier forecast of just
DM54bn, has shaken business confidence. The main factors in the increase are
the costs of higher unemployment, a shortfall in tax revenues, and the
burden of subsidising eastern Germany.
Inflation is still running at over 4 per cent in the west of Germany - more
than twice the central bank's long-term target of 2 per cent. In this
context the rate cut shows the Bundesbank's recognition of the severity of
the downturn, economists said.
Yesterday's cuts have already set off expectations of further reductions
soon. June 17 is already being touted as the date for the next cut in
official rates.
The Bundesbank, however much it may now be committed to bringing rates down
further, is likely to do this only in a way which continues to maintain the
element of uncertainty. It is eager to avoid the danger that the D-Mark will
weaken as investors make the assumption that German interest rates are set
to plunge rapidly and quickly.

UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday revived fears of a resurgence of nuclear
tension in eastern Europe when it put the country's non-nuclear commitment
into question, Oleg Mamayev writes from Kiev.
In a closed session, the MPs changed a key clause in a draft on military
doctrine which read that Ukraine would in future become a non-nuclear state
to read that nuclear weapons would stay on its territory for a 'transitional
period', according to deputies after the session last night.

FT  23 APR 93 / Brussels wants Pounds 10bn for R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants to commit Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10.44bn) to EC
research and technological development programmes between 1994 and 1998.
More than three-quarters of the funding would be directed at information,
telecommunications, energy and industrial research.
However Mr Antonio Ruberti, EC research commissioner since January, has
stepped back from his predecessor's ambitious and controversial plan to give
European industry more opportunity to shape research and development policy.
The Commission's earlier proposal had raised fears that competition might be
distorted by funding of projects which might benefit specific companies,
rather than specific sectors.
Announcing proposals for the EC's fourth 'framework' R&amp;D programme in
Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Ruberti said Community funding should be
'pre-competitive'.
He said industry could propose individual projects for funding, but within
the guidelines laid down by the Commission, which are not supposed to favour
particular industries.
This EC framework programme is the fourth since 1984, and appears to command
more funds than its predecessors. However, a straight comparison with the
third programme, which was worth Ecu6.6bn between 1990 and 1994, is
misleading, because it does not take account of inflation.
In fact, member states have pegged research funding at roughly 4 per cent of
the overall EC budget. Mr Ruberti said yesterday he was concerned about the
level of EC funding, particularly as the US and Japan spend more on R&amp;D as a
proportion of gross national product than the EC and its member states.
The EC programme, to be discussed by research ministers in Luxembourg next
week, will be divided into 28 themes, within seven broad areas: information
and communications technology, which will account for 36 per cent of funds,
energy (23 per cent), industrial (16.5 per cent), 'life' sciences, such as
biotechnology (12 per cent), environment (9 per cent), transport (2.5 per
cent) and socio-economic (1 per cent).
Mr Ruberti said concentration on fewer areas would mean a reduction in
funding in some sectors. He said one of his principal aims was to address
the problem of fragmentation of research policy across the Community, and
the failure to disseminate the results of R&amp;D.

FT  23 APR 93 / Little progress likely on Community energy tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL plans for a European Community energy tax to combat global
warming look unlikely to progress much further when environment and energy
ministers of the 12 member states meet in Luxembourg today.
Although six EC countries, led by Germany, formally supported the tax last
month, opposition to the levy, spearheaded by the UK and Spain, looks set to
prevent any unanimous recommendation to the EC's finance ministers, with
whom the final decision rests.
Today's extraordinary 'jumbo' Council of Ministers was called by the Danish
presidency of the EC in the hope of getting a political agreement to
introduce the tax when finance ministers meet in June.
But the draft conclusions prepared for the ministers by senior officials of
the 12 reveal a clear split which today's meeting may be able to paper over
but is unlikely to resolve.
'The idea was to send a clear signal' to the June finance ministers'
meeting, said one senior UK official. 'But if there's a split it will be a
mixed signal.'
The tax would put Dollars 3 (Pounds 1.90) on each barrel of oil equivalent,
rising to Dollars 10 by the year 2000, half on the fuel content of all
non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content.
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Denmark all insist
it is indispensable if the EC is to meet its commitment to stabilise carbon
dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. At Belgium's proposal, they call
in the conclusions for the tax to be recognised as 'a key element of the
global strategy' to fight the greenhouse effect.
The UK has inserted the rival formula that 'fiscal instruments at Community
and/or national level may be necessary as elements of a global strategy' -
an implicit reference by the government that its raising of fuel charges in
the last budget will enable the UK to meet the emissions target without an
EC-wide tax.
Ministers will today have to decide which of these counterpoised draft
amendments they steer closest to. The Danish presidency is hoping to blunt
the opposition of the poorest four EC states led by Spain, by proposing a
three-year pause before they would have to introduce the levy. France is
equivocal about the mix of the tax, favouring instead a levy purely on
fossil fuels in order to protect its extensive nuclear energy generation.
Supporters of the tax hope this week's promise by US President Bill Clinton
to match the EC's emission stabilisation targets, along with US fuel tax
plans, will strengthen their case. Introduction of the tax has been made
conditional on the EC's main trading partners adopting similar measures, to
safeguard European competitivity.
British officials were yesterday dismissive of the US moves, however. 'Those
noises are still some way from meeting the Community's conditionality
targets,' one said.
They add that European Commission studies, showing that purely national
efforts to reach the EC stabilisation target, which would result in a 3 per
cent increase in CO emissions by 2000, are 'well within the margin of
error'.

FT  23 APR 93 / Peugeot loses resale court fight
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT, the French car maker, will have to allow its Belgian and Luxembourg
dealers to supply independent intermediaries with cars for resale in other
countries, following a European Court ruling yesterday.
The decision should end Peugeot's long-running legal campaign against
Ecosystem, a Rouen-based intermediary which resells cars bought at lower
prices in Belgium and Luxembourg.
The court yesterday threw out appeals from Peugeot against a December 1991
European Commission decision, forcing the carmaker to lift its ban on
dealers in those countries supplying Ecosystem.
Under EC rules, it is not illegal for intermediaries to import cars on
behalf of individual customers. Sir Leon Brittan, then competition
commissioner, warned the French car maker in 1991 that its Belgian and
Luxembourg dealers would forfeit protection from normal competition rules if
the restrictions were not ended.
At the same time, the Commission laid out a code of buying and marketing
practices for intermediaries.
The Peugeot/Ecosystem case has been at the centre of an often acrimonious
debate about the exclusive dealership system operated by European car
manufacturers. The system is exempt from competition rules until 1995, and
consumer groups complain that it helps perpetuate price differences across
Europe.
Car makers say the dealership system is needed to ensure a proper
after-sales service. They say car price differences are mainly due to other
factors, such as discrepancies between car taxes.

FT  23 APR 93 / Kohl and Balladur present the face of unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, came to Bonn yesterday
studiously refusing to request any gestures of solidarity from his
colleague, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, above all in the minefield of monetary
policy.
In the event, he still came away with a small present from Frankfurt - a
quarter percentage point cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate - and many
warm words from the chancellor to help his early honeymoon in office.
Even on the Gatt trade liberalisation talks, where positions between the two
key European partners are furthest apart, there was not a word of direct
criticism from Mr Kohl over the new French government's refusal to accept
the compromise agreed between the EC and US on easing agricultural
protection.
He also won tacit support - according to French officials - for his idea for
a new European security conference to underpin the ending of the Cold War,
and for his successful start to the process of cohabitation with President
Francois Mitterrand.
Neither Mr Balladur nor Chancellor Kohl was informed of the Bundesbank's
move before the end of their talks, thus deliberately stressing the
independence of the German central bank from the Franco-German negotiating
process.
The French prime minister was told of the decision on the German rate cut as
he left the chancellor's office in his official car.
The French premier yesterday said both sides had agreed to seek to develop
joint policies, and joint initiatives, in the economic and monetary fields,
'to ensure currency stability'.
He gave no hint of what the content might be.
There was certainly no sign of the 'political initiative on monetary
co-operation' mooted in Paris before the recent elections.
A senior French official said later that there was no initiative because
there was no need for one: 'It is working out well,' he said, 'even better
than three weeks ago'.
As for monetary co-operation, it was already the firmest element in the
entire European Monetary System.
Both leaders were at pains to emphasise the vital importance they accord to
the Franco-German alliance, and to discount the slightest suggestion that a
new government in Paris might cause any upset in their co-operation.
Mr Kohl described it as 'the most valuable experience' for both countries in
the second half of the 20th century.
For his part, Mr Balladur stressed that his very first trip from Paris as
prime minister was quite naturally to Bonn.
The two met for a lunch in Bonn last December for what officials agree was a
crucial session of getting to know each other better, on the assumption that
Mr Balladur would become prime minister. One important message from Mr Kohl
at that time was for France not to demand changes in Bundesbank policies
from Bonn.
As for Gatt, Mr Balladur left Mr Kohl in no doubt that he will hold out for
a better deal for French farmers.
'We are not softening,' his spokesman said.
'Just because we are not threatening to use our (EC) veto, and are willing
to negotiate further, does not mean we will roll over.'

FT  23 APR 93 / Spain acts to defend peseta's EMS rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain raised its unofficial intervention rate yesterday and
intervened strongly on the money markets to defend the peseta's central
parity rate with the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.
Speculation against the peseta brought it down to a low of Pta73.10 to the
D-Mark before the Madrid authorities took action, raising the overnight rate
from 13.35 to 14 per cent and part of Spain's Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29.2bn)
reserves were put aside for the peseta's defence.
The action served to steady the peseta and lifted it to Pta72.80 against the
D-Mark, above its Pta72.88 parity in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The
markets are however watching for clearer signals today when the Bank of
Spain sets its benchmark intervention rate at an auction for certificates of
deposits.
The attack on the peseta, and the defence of it, highlighted the nervousness
surrounding the Spanish currency, for the developments occurred before
Germany's Bundesbank cut its Lombard and discount rates.
At the root of speculation against the peseta is the political instability
that has engulfed Spain ever since Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last week
announced a snap election to be held on June 6.
Fuelling the speculative attacks is, on one hand, the belief that the
Spanish economy is in the midst of a recession and that the peseta is
strongly overvalued, particularly in the wake of the Bundesbank's rate cuts.
On the other hand, the market perception is that the ruling Socialist party
will do all that lies within its power, using the Bank of Spain's reserves
as necessary, to ensure monetary stability before the elections.

FT  23 APR 93 / Strikes may face fresh legal curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL plan to impose severe limits on public-sector strikes is being
considered by the government as a way of thwarting the threatened teachers'
boycott of school tests this summer.
The proposal would mark a significant tightening of Britain's trade union
laws and set the government on a fresh confrontation course with the union
movement.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, is backing a proposal that would
end immunity from court action for strikes intended principally to frustrate
the carrying out of statutory duties. An amendment could be made to the
Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill which reaches its final stages
in the House of Lords on Monday.
A government decision on whether to legislate will depend on today's Appeal
Court ruling on Wandsworth borough council's case against the National
Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers. The union is
boycotting preparation of the school tests.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, is expected to give a first government
response when he addresses the Secondary Heads' Association conference in
Southport.
The disclosures came in a letter dated February 26 from Mrs Shephard to Mr
Patten and leaked to the National Union of Teachers. The tone of the letter
suggests that the government has devoted a great deal of effort to drawing
up tough options for heading off strikes by the teachers - and perhaps
public sector strikes in general.
Mrs Shephard's letter says disputes could be outlawed, 'where the principal
or sole demand is that workers should not be required to do work which is
necessary in order to carry out a specific statutory duty on the employer'.
It says disputes would not be rendered unlawful if trade unions demanded a
pay rise in return for doing extra work required by statutory duties.
It was unclear last night the extent to which Mrs Shephard had won cabinet
backing or whether her proposals could be introduced in time to allow this
summer's tests to go ahead.
Last night's disclosures provoked angry protests from teachers' unions. Mr
Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the letter revealed a 'sinister
government plot'. Legal experts suggested that Mrs Shephard's proposal would
be difficult to enforce, and lead to a mass of litigation.

FT  23 APR 93 / Bundesbank cuts rates to stem slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, QUENTIN PEEL and JAMES BLITZ

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday cut both its main interest rates in a move seen as
the clearest indication yet that it is concerned about the slowdown in the
German economy and the prospect of renewed pressures inside the European
exchange rate mechanism.
The central bank's policymaking council decided at its scheduled meeting to
cut the discount rate, the floor for money market rates, by 0.25 points to
7.25 points. It also cut the Lombard rate, which provides an emergency
ceiling for bank borrowing, by half a point to 8.5 per cent.
The timing of the rate cuts surprised financial markets. On Wednesday, a
further easing in monetary policy seemed unlikely for some weeks when the
Bundesbank released figures showing that broad money supply, traditionally
the central bank's key indicator in its fight against inflation, grew at an
annualised and seasonally adjusted rate of 3.2 per cent - twice what
economists had hoped for.
The cuts in interest rates also came even though the inflation rate in
Germany is 4.2 per cent, more than twice the Bundesbank's long-term target
of 2 per cent.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said he stayed fully committed
to cutting inflation. He presented the cuts as part of the central bank's
cautious approach to the easing of monetary policy which had led to stable
conditions on capital and money markets.
Mr Schlesinger also said, despite the worse than expected data, the
Bundesbank's money supply was growing at a level consistent with its
medium-term inflation objective of 2 per cent.
In March, the M3 measure of money supply growth rose at an annualised,
seasonally adjusted rate of 3.2 per cent. This was below the Bundesbank's
target range which, for this year, has been set at 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Mr Schlesinger said the cuts would bring some relief for other countries,
raising speculation that the Bundesbank may have been concerned by new
currency pressures inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
Before the announcement, the French franc and Spanish peseta had been under
pressure inside the ERM, with the Spanish authorities raising their daily
intervention rate by 65 basis points to 14 per cent to staunch selling of
their currency.
The Bundesbank cut helped the French franc recover in afternoon trading to
close almost unchanged on the day at FFr3.374 against the D-Mark. However,
the peseta was still much weaker by the London close, finishing at Pta72.54
from a previous Pta72.37.
In New York, the peseta closed at Pta72.765 against the D-Mark with the
French currency finishing slightly higher than in London at FFr3.3764.

FT  23 APR 93 / Jobless fall fuels hopes of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT fell for the second month running in March, confounding
expectations of a rise in the City and at Westminster and boosting hopes
that the recession is over.
The surprise 26,000 fall in the seasonally adjusted jobless total to 2.94m
last month combined with other upbeat news on the economy and yesterday's
Bundesbank interest rate cuts to give a strong upwards push to the pound.
The latest signs that the economy was strengthening were welcomed by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, who said the fall in unemployment was 'very good
news'. But the Treasury and Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, were
careful not to sound euphoric about the figures.
Mrs Shephard, while pointing out that 'vacancies are the highest for two
years, fewer people are joining the unemployment count and there have been
falls in unemployment in every region', said it was dangerous to read too
much into any one month's figures. The Treasury, which is waiting for next
Monday's data on first quarter national output before deciding whether it
can announce the end of the recession, said it was still too early to say
whether unemployment had peaked.
Other news yesterday sug-gested economic recovery might continue. Official
figures showed car production in March rose a seasonally adjusted 13 per
cent compared with February, while the Inland Revenue said completed home
sales rose an ad-justed 9 per cent in March after a 7 per cent rise in
February.
A British Chambers of Commerce survey of nearly 9,000 companies found that
domestic and export orders rose in the first quarter while the Federation of
Master Builders said its members also saw a first-quarter improvement in
business that they expected to continue into the second quarter of this
year.
The March drop in the seasonally adjusted total of people out of work and
claiming benefit followed a 25,500 drop in February (revised from a
provisional 22,000 fall) and compared with City expectations of a 30,000
increase last month.
The unadjusted jobless figure fell by 46,000 to 2.99m in March, below the
politically important 3m mark.
The UK unemployment figures and the Bundesbank cuts pushed sterling to
DM2.4875 against the D-Mark in London, some 2 1/4 pfennigs up on the day.
The pound also gained 1.15 cents against the dollar to close at Dollars
1.5480 and rose 0.8 percentage points on its exchange rate index to 80.7
after the Treasury made clear it did not intend to cut UK interest rates. In
late New York trading, sterling was at DM2.462 and Dollars 1.557.
The equity market appeared less enthusiastic about the news. While retail
demand for shares was reported to be strong, the FT-SE 100 index closed at
2,881.1, up just 11.5 points.
The drop in the jobless total reflected a lower number of people joining the
dole queues rather than a marked rise in the number of people leaving the
count.
Some economists believe companies shed too many people at the end of last
year following a sharp decline in confidence as a result of sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'With firms having laid
off more people than was necessary then, fewer jobs are being lost now,'
said Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
Yesterday's employment data also showed that average earnings grew by 4.5
per cent in the year to February, the lowest annual rise for 25 years. Unit
labour costs in manufacturing also fell 2 per cent in the three months to
the end of February compared with the same period in 1992 - the largest such
drop since statistics began in 1970.

FT  23 APR 93 / Attali bows to criticism over spending: EBRD president to
split responsibility for budgetary control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said yesterday that he had 'much to learn' from criticisms that
controls of expenditure at the bank had not been tight enough.
However, he added: 'I am not planning to resign.' Mr Attali said that 'more
than two or three' of the bank's governors, who are finance ministers or top
officials from the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank, had
telephoned him to offer support, following criticisms of his stewardship of
the bank.
He said that the 'most important question which needs to be answered is
whether this bank needs to exist or not'. The importance of the bank, which
provides loans and investments to encourage the growth of market economies
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is that 'it is part of the
international response to the urgent need of central and eastern Europe'.
Mr Attali was speaking as the bank published its annual report for 1992. The
report says that the board approved 54 investment projects in the year with
a total EBRD contribution of Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 940m). However, just Ecu126m,
was disbursed, consisting of Ecu75.8m of loans and Ecu50m of equity
injections.
He said it was 'entirely legitimate for the press to raise questions about
the way in which we conduct our affairs'. He justified the lavish
furnishings of the bank's new headquarters, in London's Broadgate complex,
by saying that work on fitting out the building was proceeding 'within the
approved budget'.
He added: 'With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that we should have
done certain things differently.' The replacement of the building's existing
marble with new marble, at a cost of at least Pounds 750,000, fell 'into
this category'.
In order to tighten control over spending, Mr Attali said he was dividing
the responsibilities currently held by Mr Pissaloux, who is both director of
Mr Attali's cabinet and director of the budget.
He said there would now be 'a full time director' with budgetary
responsibilities and a separate cabinet director. He refused to say who
would occupy these posts. Mr Pissaloux would not comment on whether he would
hold one or other of these posts.
Mr Attali also said there would be a 'further deepening and strengthening of
the board committees on budgetary matters, both in preparing and monitoring
the budget' and 'further improvements will be made in the information
supplied to the board about the budget'.
He also confirmed that the board's audit committee was undertaking a review
of the 'costs incurred and the specific procedures followed in the fitting
out of the bank's headquarters'. External assistance, from auditors or cost
consultants, would be given if necessary.
Many of the EBRD's board of 23 directors, who are public officials appointed
to represent the bank's shareholders, have complained that Mr Attali only
agreed to this review and the improvements in the process of monitoring the
budget after they put intense pressure on him.
The EBRD's report also disclosed that two of the projects it has backed had
run into difficulties and it has had to make specific provisions of Ecu2.6m
to cover possible losses.
The EBRD made a loss for the year of Ecu6m, which is a far better
performance than it had been expecting for this stage in its development.
However, the accounts disclose that it overspent by Ecu1m on its budget for
administrative expenses, which had been set at Ecu95m, though the bank said
the overspending was due to currency fluctuations.

FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Builders buoyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building and construction stocks rose strongly for a second consecutive
session as investors responded to this week's results from Abbey National.
The group reported buoyant house sales in the first quarter and this,
coupled with similarly positive views from some house builders recently, has
boosted the sectors' rating.
Moreover, building analysts believe the rises will be sustained in
construction shares, although most think contractors and materials issues
will struggle to hold present levels. 'Construction stocks have a very
substantial upside,' said Mr Jonathan Timms at Charterhouse Tilney. 'By the
end of next year, we expect the sector, currently standing at 76 to the
All-Share, to be back on a one-for-one rating.'
Mr Howard Procter at Panmure Gordon, who is also bullish on the house
builders, added that the outlook for the contracting and building materials
markets remained dull and that the indiscriminate advance across the sectors
would give way to more selected buying.
Both houses like George Wimpey, up 11 at 169p, with Panmure also tipping
Raine, ahead 7 at 100p, and Persimmon, 10 better at 272p. Among other
risers, John Laing added 17 at 269p, and Taylor Woodrow 10 at 113p in
turnover of 6.6m. The materials sector had Ibstock Johnson up 5 at 61p,
Marley 6 ahead at 132p and Spring Ram, another Charterhouse choice, 4 higher
at 75p.
Strong demand for Williams Holdings followed a meeting at James Capel on
Tuesday evening. The shares jumped 15 before closing 13 up at 334p after
2.8m traded. US selling was blamed for the retreat in Danka Business, which
fell 36 to 590p.
A turnround in results from Helical Bar and an upbeat statement helped the
shares leap 16 to 186p.
Following dismal results on Tuesday, Hammerson continued to decline on the
back of negative comments and fading bid hopes. The stock lost 12 to 289p.
NatWest Securities suggests an asset value of 250p.
The cloud over Hammerson pulled down other leading property stocks. MEPC
retreated 11 to 370p and Land Securities 5 to 525p.
A relief factor was said to be driving Ladbroke Group forward as it emerged
that the company's off-balance sheet debt would be far less than some had
had feared. Ladbroke put the figure at Pounds 80m, well below bearish
suggestions of up to Pounds 250m. NatWest Securities reinforced its view
that the stock had been oversold on the worries and said 'buy'. The shares
rose 5 to 177p, pulling up Forte 5 to 199p.
Standard Chartered climbed 6 to 746p, helped by a recommendation from broker
Hoare Govett based on the benefits of sterling depreciation in 1992 coming
through in 1993.
Tobacco to insurance group BAT Industries dropped 15 to 880p after Philip
Morris reported a 1.1 per cent fall in first-quarter US cigarette sales.
The rise in electricity stocks continued but water shares marked time. Among
the Recs, the smaller stocks shone, with Seeboard ahead 10 at 516p, South
Wales 8 at 548p and Northern 3 at 529p. Scottish generators were said to be
pushed by Goldman Sachs. Scottish Power climbed 4 to 320 1/2 p and Scottish
Hydro-Electric 5 to 342p.
Chemicals group Ellis &amp; Everard rose 12 to 195p following a well received
lunch for institutional investors hosted by Hoare Govett.
In the media sector, United Newspapers was one of the best performers as SG
Warburg continued its re-examination of the area by issuing a buy
recommendation, arguing that at a 15 per cent discount to the sector and
with a near 5 per cent yield it 'provides a potent cocktail of recovery
potential and high income'. The shares rose 7 to 593p.
Mirror Group, recommended by the house on Tuesday, added a further 4 at 142p
on heavy turnover of 11.4m shares. Bid stories have continued to circulate
around the stock, although they have been largely dismissed by analysts.
Thames Television fell 5 to 174p on announcing a Pounds 67.5m loss after
extraordinary costs. The slide was softened by speculation over bid interest
from Pearson, up 2 at 414p.
Among food retailers, second line stocks stole the limelight, taking the
opportunity to catch up with the majors. Iceland Frozen Foods rose 5 to 694p
and Kwik Save 6 to 755p.
Dealers in Smiths Industries brushed aside the decline in interim figures
and were instead encouraged by the increase in the dividend and a positive
analysts' meeting. The shares advanced 17 to 347p.
Glynwed International put on 6 at 298p, with Williams de Broe upgrading
forecasts.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE on prices in international container shipping helped push
Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, into the red last year, prompting the
company to omit its dividend for the third successive year.
The loss of Fl 58m (Dollars 32m) which had been widely expected after the
company's profit warning in November, was also caused by the absence of the
large extraordinary gains on divestments that had flattered 1991 results,
when net profit of Fl 145m was posted.
Nedlloyd said it could not make a forecast for 1993 results, but confirmed
that it had made an unspecified loss in the first quarter.
It aims to reduce costs by Fl 250m a year from 1995 and eliminating 2,000
jobs out of a total of 23,500 over the next two years.

QUEENS MOAT Houses, the hotel group, yesterday sold a 14.5 per cent stake in
Harmony Leisure, the pubs and restaurants company, to Southend Property
Holdings.
Southend, an existing minority shareholder in Harmony, said it made a bid
for the stake after shares in the hotel group were suspended last month.
Describing the transaction as a 'good opportunity', Mr Malcolm Dagul,
chairman of Southend, said the group had agreed to buy 3.88m Harmony shares
at 5p apiece. The sale is dependent on a planned rights issue at Harmony
being underwritten.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Barclays' US issue raised to
Dollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the UK clearing bank, yesterday increased to Dollars 500m from
Dollars 300m the amount it is raising in the US through an innovative issue
of convertible capital, following strong demand from retail and
institutional investors.
The fixed-rate notes count as tier two capital for regulatory purposes, but
are convertible into non-cumulative preference shares, which count as tier
one capital, at the bank's option.
Strong demand for the bonds, which carry an 8 per cent coupon, was accounted
for by the premium they offered over US Treasuries. If converted, the bonds
would yield 9.25 per cent inclusive of advance corporation tax in the UK,
leaving US tax-paying investors with a net yield of just below 8 per cent,
Barclays said.

<TEXT>
AUDI, a division of Germany's Volkswagen group, said negotiations to build
an engine plant in Hungary had been completed and a fully-owned subsidiary,
Audi Hungaria Motor, had been founded, Reuter reports from Munich.
An agreement between Audi and Hungary's ministry for industry and trade, the
finance ministry and the ministry for international relations has been
reached.
The plant will be established at Gyoer, between Bratislava and Budapest,
where Audi plans initially to build about 1,000 engine components daily
starting in mid-1994 and employing 200 people. Constructing the plant calls
for the investment of some DM300m (Dollars 186.3m).

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Mondadori raises profits to
L57.1bn

MONDADORI, Italy's biggest publishing group which is majority-owned by Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company, raised net group profits to L57.1bn
(Dollars 37m) last year from L10.1bn in 1992.
The outcome, marking a further step in the gradual turnaround in Mondadori's
fortunes after the battle for control between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De
Benedetti in 1990-91, was accompanied by a 13.9 per cent climb in sales to
L1,600bn.
Sales in the first quarter of this year have continued the upward trend,
with a 9.9 per cent increase to L400bn.
Buoyed by the earnings upturn, the dividend is being raised to L200 for
ordinary shares and L220 for savings shares. Last year, the payout was
restricted to holders of savings stock, who received L120 a share.
Fininvest, which is considering a merger between Mondadori and its unquoted
Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing operation, currently controls almost 80
per cent of the ordinary shares and 90 per cent of the savings stock.
Simint, the listed casual clothing group controlled by financier Mr
Francesco Micheli and designer Mr Giorgio Armani, is making a rights issue
of up to L60bn along with the issue of free new ordinary shares.
The transaction is designed to boost the group's investment in the US, where
it is setting up a new chain of lower-priced clothing stores, called Armani
Exchange (A/X), in conjunction with Mr Armani.
Shareholders will be given five new ordinary shares for every 26 ordinary or
preference shares currently held. Moreover, they will be offered 21 new
ordinary shares for every 26 ordinary or preference shares held, at a price
of between L1,400 and L1,600 a share.
The rights issue will be based on shareholdings prior to the bonus issue.

FT  22 APR 93 / Volvo chairman reveals SKr9.5m salary

<TEXT>
MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, yesterday bowed to pressure
from the Swedish vehicle maker's small shareholders and disclosed that his
annual salary is SKr9.5m (Dollars 1.3m), making him Sweden's highest paid
executive.
Addressing Volvo's annual general meeting, attended by more than 2,000
shareholders, Mr Gyllenhammar also gave details of his other benefits, the
salary package of Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and the 'golden
parachutes' paid to two former top executives who left the company last
year. Mr Gyllenhammar announced that the Volvo board would set up an audit
committee and a committee for management development and remuneration for a
trial period of a year to counter accusations by Aktiespararna, the Swedish
shareholders' association, that he had presided over excessive pay deals for
himself and senior colleagues at a time when Volvo was tumbling into losses.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said conditions for Volvo in 1993 continued
to be 'extremely tough'. There were benefits from the SKr9bn cost-cutting
programme and signs of upturn in the US and UK markets, but he could give no
assurance that sales volumes would rise this year. Sales in Sweden, where
new car registrations are at 1940s levels, were flat and the European
outlook was bleak.
Volvo cut its dividend by 50 per cent last year and decided to close two of
its three Swedish car plants after incurring losses after financial items of
SKr4.75bn.
Mr Gyllenhammar announced that he had held renewed talks with Mr Carl Bildt,
the prime minister, over the future of Procordia, the partly state-owned
food and drugs group in which Volvo is the largest shareholder. The
government last year blocked a bid by Mr Gyllenhammar to merge the two
companies, prompting calls from Aktiespararna for clarification of Volvo's
intentions.
Mr Gyllenhammar believes he will be able to reach an agreement with Mr Bildt
that would give Procordia 'a stable ownership base'. Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh,
head of Aktiespararna, said Mr Gyllenhammar had satisfied 90 per cent of his
association's questions. Mr Gyllenhammar said his salary was made up of a
basic remuneration of SKr7.1m, plus SKr2.2m and a 'handcuff' element of
SKr231,000.

FT  22 APR 93 / Spending cuts anger military in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S armed forces are threatening protest action following government
demands for a 10 per cent spending cut.
The air force commander, Brigadier Jose Julia, told Mr Oscar Camilion, the
new defence minister, that he was cancelling all operational and training
flights. Navy and army commanders are expected to make similar threats at
meetings this week with Mr Camilion, who took office earlier this month.
Brig Julia said he had no choice but to cease operations. Half the air
force's aircraft were already grounded and it had still not replaced
aircraft lost during the 1982 Falklands conflict.
The defence budget was set at Dollars 2.03bn this year, 5 per cent of
federal spending. However, in March, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister,
ordered a 10 per cent cut in ministerial budgets to compensate for a
shortfall in tax revenues.
Ironically, the budget cut may at last force a review of defence policy. The
armed forces may have surrendered their traditionally strong political role
but have resisted half-hearted government efforts at military reforms.
Pay consumes 72 per cent of their budget, but commanders have avoided
cutting jobs or reorganising their top-heavy command structure. The army has
one officer for every five enlisted men and conscripts. Last year's armed
forces' payroll of 169,000 included 35,000 civilian and industrial employees
and 49,000 pensioners.
Officers claim the government has no defence policy other than budget cuts,
which have eroded morale and reduced defence preparedness without improving
operational efficiency.
Pay is the military's greatest grievance, but President Carlos Menem has
ignored previous pleas for increases. Unlike many of his civilian
predecessors, he feels confident in his relationship with the military.

<TEXT>
Employers and union officials in the east German state of Thuringia said
yesterday they wanted to meet for new pay talks in an attempt to avert a
strike over wage equalisation between east and west German workers, Reuter
reports from Erfurt.
A joint statement was released by local negotiators for IG Metall, Germany's
largest union, and local employers.
The two sides said they wanted to ask their national leaders if they would
be allowed to resume talks 'in spite of and regardless of the positions up
until now'. The dispute, originally over employers' refusal to pay a 26 per
cent pay rise from April 1, has developed into a row over how wage policy is
conducted. A strike ballot has been called for April 26-28.
A spokesman for the employers said the new talks were likely to take place
soon, but no date had been set.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP Ukraine official yesterday said that his country is spearheading an
effort to form a central European zone of stability and security which would
embrace Ukraine and its eastern European neighbours.
'Today, the most serious potential source of instability in Europe is
tension between the countries of central and eastern Europe,' Mr Boris
Tarasiuk, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, said. 'To help resolve these
tensions we propose the creation of an organisation of states in this region
which have common interests.'
Mr Tarasiuk said that the idea of a central European security zone was first
broached by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on a visit to Hungary in
February. Since then, Mr Tarasiuk said, Ukraine had begun 'serious work' on
the project and expected results in the 'near future'.
Mr Tarasiuk said such a zone would not be a military alliance or bloc but
that member states would pledge not to advance territorial claims to one
another, respect national minorities and increase economic co-operation.
Mr Tarasiuk said that for eastern European states such as Hungary, Poland,
Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria such an organisation
could smooth the transition to fuller integration into Europe.
'They would prefer rapid integration into the west, but the west does not
want them immediately,' Mr Tarasiuk said. 'The west is not willing to accept
the countries of eastern Europe immediately into Nato, but they need some
sort of security structure.'
For Ukraine, a central European security zone would provide an alternative
to the Commonwealth of Independent States' military bloc being patched
together by Russia. Ukraine has steadfastly refused to join any CIS military
or political structures.
However, Mr Tarasiuk insisted that 'our goal would not be to cut Russia off
from Europe. On the contrary, it would be to serve as a bridge between
Russia and the west.'
Ukraine is notably more enthusiastic about the creation of such an
organisation than its eastern European neighbours, whose sights are still
focused on the west. But the past few months have seen a marked upswing in
diplomatic activity between Ukraine and Poland, Hungary and Romania which
has yielded a number of political, economic and military agreements.

Nature of business: ICI Fibres is Europe's leading manufacturer of nylon
products such as those used in skiwear, carpets and ladies' tights. ICI
Acrylics is a supplier to the paint, sanitaryware, sign-making and
automotive industries, producing innovative materials such as Perspex,
Asterite and Avron.
ICI Fibres is about to be handed over to Du Pont of the US in exchange for
Du Pont's US acrylics business. In a separate deal, ICI is to hand its west
European polypropylene business to BASF of Germany in exchange for BASF's
acrylic units in Germany and Spain.
Turnover: ICI Fibres has a turnover of pounds 600m. ICI Acrylics (pre Du
Pont and BASF acquisitions) has a turnover of pounds 300m per annum.
Key personnel: At ICI Fibres: Scott Davidson, managing director; Dennis
James, IT director; Steve Hamlett, finance director. The same trio fulfil
similar functions in the reorganised ICI Acrylics.
TECHNOLOGY FILE
Software: The Business Information System (BIS), implemented at ICI Fibres
in 1992, is based on the 4GL Focus, from Information Builders. BIS evolved
from two previous prototype executive information systems (EIS) written
initially in PC Express, subsequently refined using a combination of
Lightship, and Lotus 123. The existing system is operational at ICI Fibres,
now used by more than 20 managers in the UK, Belgium and Germany.
Hardware: PC front-ends on 386- and 486-based colour laptop computers
connected to an IBM mainframe via the communications network. Data is stored
on the mainframe and distributed to local PCs. There is automatic download
of data sources from core accounting systems.
Suppliers: West London-based Executive Information Solutions, a 15-strong
specialist EIS company, advised ICI Fibres on the business and management
process.
Cost of system: The consultancy costs in developing the BIS were pounds
220,000 for ICI Fibres and pounds 150,000 for ICI Acrylics. This includes
the review of the IT infrastructure, but not hardware and software
components.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Netherlands manages to regain composure
 -A look at the rise in European turnover in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity trading in the leading European bourses continued to grow strongly in
March for the third successive month. Volume increased by 22.8 per cent
during the month after February's 15.3 per cent rise.
But at the same time, stock indices were not rising so steeply as they had
been earlier in the year. The FT-Actuaries Europe index rose only 1.2 per
cent in March, after February's 4.8 per cent gain as investors began to
scale back expectations of further rapid falls in interest rates.
'Expanding volume in markets no longer rising so rapidly suggests that
profit-taking is being matched by new buyers, rather than by prices being
marked down and volume drying up,' says Mr James Cornish of NatWest
Securities in London. 'It is a bullish phenomenon.'
The Netherlands saw the largest rise in trading volume in March, up 29.8 per
cent on February and 49 per cent higher than the average for the previous
three months, to levels not seen since 1987.
On the corporate front, James Capel in London notes in its latest European
Equity Strategy that the trading sector turned in the best performance
during the first quarter, helped by often better than expected 1992 results,
while companies such as Hoogovens and Philips, which produced huge losses,
were 'rewarded' for taking large restructuring charges.
The market also regained much of the composure dented by February's traumas
surrounding Daf, which filed for creditor protection having failed to set up
a rescue plan; and Fokker, about whose takeover by Deutsche Aerospace there
had been doubts.
Spain came a close second with volume climbing 28.9 per cent as the market
returned to outperformance on hopes of lower interest rates. While much of
the trading was domestic, a 21.8 per cent rise in Spanish volume on Seaq,
the London screen-based trading system for international stocks, indicates a
firm recovery in foreign buying interest.
Expectations of lower interest rates helped to lift German volume by 25.5
per cent on February and 63.5 per cent on the average for the previous three
months. This was the highest level of trading since March 1991 during the
euphoria which followed the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.
French trading volume, up 24.4 per cent on the month, was back up to the
level last seen in October 1989. Strong market indices also reflected hopes
of lower interest rates after the French elections.
Italy's 11.7 per cent rise on the month took volume to a four-year high, in
spite of uncertainties caused by the unravelling and ever widening political
corruption scandal. However, turnover was swelled by local and foreign
demand for Fiat amid continuing speculation that the group planned an
international link-up or asset sale.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (10): Fuel oil freed to earn export revenues
 -As many domestic power plants as possible are switching to gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt is busy with its own version of the dash for gas.
To free up more of its limited oil reserves for export, and make the most
economical use of unexpectedly good recent gas finds, Egypt is switching as
many of its domestic power plants as possible from fuel oil to gas.
About 60 per cent of Egypt's annual gas output of 1.2bn cu ft is presently
used to fuel the country's power stations. With output slated to rise to an
annual 1.4bn cu ft within three years, the government hopes to raise the
proportion of its power stations fuelled by local gas to 80 per cent from
the present 60 per cent by 1997.
Fuel oil freed in the process will be exported to eke the maximum revenue
from Egypt's crude sales. These last year earned just over Dollars 2bn - a
sum which, despite being 20 per cent down on 1991 as a result of softer
world crude prices, was nevertheless Egypt's second biggest source of hard
currency after tourism. Production last year averaged 870,000 barrels a day.
By the reckoning of many oil executives in Egypt, prospects for the oil
sector are limited.
Present reserves are 6.3bn barrels, and few local executives believe that
accelerated exploration in the Gulf of Suez, Western Desert, Mediterranean,
Red Sea and Nile Delta regions will yield much more than a further 1.5bn-3bn
in reserves.
In February the government approved exploration and production agreements
with seven foreign companies, and the state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation is understood to be offering improved terms as an incentive to
attract back to Egypt many of the oil majors which left in the mid-1980s,
mainly as a result of uncompetitive government pricing policies.
The improved terms are likely to include raising to 40 per cent the amount
of oil companies can dedicate to cost recovery in the first years of
production, and lifting to 25-27 per cent from 18-20 per cent the companies'
share of profit oil in their joint ventures with the EGPC. Terms for all
production agreements are, however, made on a case-by-case basis.
Perhaps the most substantial incentive, however, has been provided by a
precedent-setting agreement won by Shell to improve the terms on which gas
prices are set.
The government earlier this year agreed to abandon a formula setting gas
prices at 85 per cent of the price of fuel oil, replacing it with pricing at
85 per cent of the price of Suez Blend, a sweeter and thus higher-value oil.
This, combined with the fact that the government no longer insists on taking
the full share of associated gas from any discoveries, is likely further to
boost Egypt's already promising gas reserves.
Present known reserves of gas have doubled since the mid-1980s to 12
trillion (million million) cubic feet, and many in the industry believe
these could rise further to 27t cu ft, or more.
Shell alone, for instance, is developing a field at Obaiyed in the Western
Desert, which Mr Tarek Heggy, the Shell chairman, says could hold 3.1t cu ft
in its first layer, and possibly a total of up to 9t cu ft in two further
depths.
For the time being, Egypt's present intention is simply to use the gas for
its power system. If further good finds take the country's reserves above
20t cu ft, however, several executives believe that Egypt could start
exporting gas, either by landline to Israel or by pipeline to Italy or North
Africa.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (6): Not the bustling place it used to be -
Emma Tucker visits Cairo's stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRO'S stock exchange is not the bustling place it used to be.
It was once the fifth busiest exchange in the world. Now it has been reduced
to a largely empty room, 13 telephones, one or two brokers and several
listless coffee waiters.
So few stocks are traded that a recent attempt by a group of academics to
construct an index came to nothing and on most days, Cairo's 16 brokers
average about two small trades each.
The casual atmosphere of the exchange - trading lasts for only two hours a
day - might be about to change.
Independent analysts believe that successful completion of the first round
of Egypt's IMF talks, some real progress with its privatisation programme
and implementation of the new capital markets law, could lead to a sharp
revival in Egypt's stock market.
'I think the potential in Egypt is so great, and the opportunity at the
moment so big, that enough people from the Arab world and from the West are
going to invest in Egypt to boost prices sufficiently,' says Mr Miles
Morland of Blakeney Management, a London based consultancy which looks at
and reports on emerging markets.
The death of the Cairo stock exchange began in the 1950s under President
Gamal Abdul Nasser. Although not all its listed companies were nationalised,
portfolios were, and the compensation given to shareholders was
significantly less than the value of their holdings. Mr Nassef Nazmy, a
broker who started work on the stock exchange as a jobber in the 1950s,
remembers nationalisation as a 'suffering time'.
But from his office in one of downtown Cairo's cavernous buildings he
reflects that the worst is over. 'We have just passed through the hardest
period,' he says. 'Egypt's elite abandoned investment in securities after
losing so much. Now we have to win back the confidence of their sons and
daughters.'
There is still a long way to go. Aside from the matter of whether or not
Egypt can complete the liberalisation of its economy, a number of technical
problems have to be tackled before the stock market can compete effectively
with other emerging markets.
The exchange itself looks little changed from the days when President
Nasser's socialist policies knocked the life out of it. Mr Fag El-Nour,
chairman of the Capital Markets Authority has said that a new electronic
stock exchange modelled on Singapore will replace the existing exchange, but
as yet dealing is laboriously old-fashioned. Prices are chalked on the wall,
and deals are relayed by a little bucket that dances above the heads of the
brokers.
Under the new law, however, there is nothing to stop an alternative stock
exchange opening. One Cairo-based consultant said it was open to question
whether the current exchange would survive.
Other groups are apparently investigating the possibility of setting up a
new centre. A workable index also has to be compiled. The last attempt
failed because it was heavily weighted towards those shares with the biggest
listed capital. As these never trade - they remain mostly under state
control - the index was meaningless and had to be scrapped.
Merchant bankers at Kidder Peabody in Cairo have compiled their own index
which tracks the movements of the smaller, more liquid companies: about 23.
In time they intend to publish its results, but preliminary research
suggests share prices rose by 30 per cent in the year to January, and has
chalked up a further 30 per cent rise since the beginning of the year.
In spite of the technical constraints facing the Egyptian market, it is a
difficult market for investors to ignore. 'So many of the ingredients that
led to stock market booms in Latin America and Asia are present in Egypt,'
says Mr Morland. 'Reverse capital flight, fiscal and monetary reform,
declining inflation, a growing economy and great potential foreign
interest.'
A Cairo-based analyst at an American Bank shares his optimism. 'The Egyptian
stock exchange will attract foreign investors,' he says. 'There is Gulf,
western and domestic interest in the local market.'
A further boost should come from the many private, closely-held Egyptian
companies which will turn to the stock exchange to raise capital, once the
new law is in place. This option was previously not available, and companies
were confined to borrowing money from banks.
According to Mr Morland, privatisation remains the key to developing the
market. He has estimated that with daily volume running at about Dollars 1m,
the liquidity does not exist to absorb potential demand if Egyptian Treasury
bill rates decline and money starts looking for an equity home - or if
foreign funds try to get a foothold in the market. 'Until privatisation
creates the new supply, there is simply not enough stock available for a
genuine market to develop,' he warns.
Besides privatisation, potential investors will be watching the progress
made with other structural changes, and the ability of the government to
contain recent outbursts of fundamentalist terrorism. While there is general
agreement that the Egyptian stock market offers a lucrative return in the
short-run, investors will need some convincing that they should stick around
for longer.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (7): Foreigners take the lead - A look at
the most recent developments in banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a tough and messy legislative battle, Egypt's predominantly public
sector banking industry this year reluctantly overcame its xenophobia.
With a push from the president in February, the government agreed to allow
foreign bank branches in Egypt to deal in local currency.
The measure was the latest and probably last refinement of Egypt's new
banking law, which was passed in June last year.
But the modification may do as much in the long run to raise Egypt's
cossetted banking sector to international standards as any other in Law 37.
At the law's heart is the requirement that all Egypt's banks meet by the end
of this year the Basel Committee's resolutions on capital adequacy, a ratio
of 8 per cent of recognised capital to risk-weighted assets.
Law 37 also shifts control for the banking sector from the economics
ministry to the Central Bank.
But many bankers in Cairo believe that it will be the influence of foreign
banks' introduction of sophisticated services, practices and financial
instruments so far absent from the Egyptian market which will do most to
raise the local game. 'We will initiate, and the locals will follow,' says
the manager of one foreign branch.
It was precisely the prospect of such banking technology transfer which led
many in the public sector banks and the government itself to oppose the
granting of full local currency rights to the foreign branches. The big four
public sector banks, Banque Misr, Bank of Alexandria, National Bank of Egypt
and Banque du Caire are feared for their oligopoly - they presently hold
65-70 per cent of domestic footings.
Allied to this was both an historic distrust of foreign banks, deriving from
pre-Nasserite days when overseas bankers financed and somewhat controlled
the key cotton crop, and continued resistance in some quarters of the
government to further economic liberalisation of any flavour. But in the
end, substantial US government pressure, pushed along by the IMF and
interested parties such as Bank of America and Citibank, overcame.
Constraints on the operation of foreign bank branches might still be applied
in the executive regulations for the banking law which are still under
discussion. The law will not take effect until these regulations are
promulgated by the president.
Among the limitations these regulations might impose are ceilings on the
number of branches a foreign bank can open, a requirement that Egyptian
branches be managed by Egyptians, and rules limiting entry to the market for
overseas banks not already in situ.
But none of these potential limitations much deters foreign bankers in Cairo
who are at pains, at the same time, to stress that they do not see
themselves as competing with the big public sector banks, nor even
essentially with the several joint venture banks these have formed in recent
years with international partners. 'We will complement, rather than
compete,' says one US banker.
Of the 22 foreign branches already in Egypt, no more than seven or eight are
expected to embrace with relish the new opportunity. Chief among these are
expected to be Citibank, Arab Bank, Bank of America, Bank of Nova Scotia and
Paribas.
Neither do these banks see the opportunity as one of eroding the public
sector banks' dominance of the local deposit market. Nor do they subscribe
to the oft-repeated view that with a total of 102 banks servicing Egypt the
place is overbanked.
'People take that view from the numbers,' says one foreign banker. '100
banks, and thousands of branches. But Egypt is underdeveloped in a banking
sense. Egyptians are hungry for new products.'
'When it comes to plain vanilla commercial lending,' says another, 'the
local banks can more than cope. What you don't see here yet, and what we can
introduce, is leasing, forward currency dealing, commercial paper and
interbank funding - there's almost none of that here yet.'
Many of the foreign banks already have their eyes on developing the capital
market in Egypt, for which new legislation was passed at the same time as
the new banking law. There is, for instance, as yet no secondary market for
government treasury bills. 'We can make money off these, and make them
liquid,' says a US banker. One foreign branch is already planning Egypt's
first non-government bond issue in decades.
Inroads into the retail market are expected to be limited, though Arab Bank
is considering introducing a phone banking service for clients. Few of the
banks likely to be most active in Egyptian pounds say they intend to open
more than a handful of new branch offices, if any.
In commercial lending, the chance to lend in Egyptian pounds will enable
banks to move out of a short-term straitjacket imposed by the fact that
their clients' cashflow is in pounds while the foreign banks have hitherto
been able to lend only in, for instance, dollars, with the attendant
currency risk. 'We have been practically been unable to do medium term
business here as a result,' says one banker.
But as foreign bankers in Cairo rub their hands together at the prospect of
branching out into Egyptian pounds and inserting new sophistication into the
Egyptian market, they nevertheless raise one substantial doubt. Few are
entirely confident that the Central Bank is yet as sophisticated as it may
need to be.
'The central bank should really be offering the best salaries in the banking
sector, and not the worst,' says one banker. 'Until it does, I think there
will be problems.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (8): Law stifles more than it enables -
Emerging capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DESCRIBE Egypt's present capital market as a market at all is wild
flattery. Shares of debateable real value trade thinly on an antiquated and
near comatose stock market, while the sole other negotiable financial
instruments in the country are government bills. These are snapped up by the
banks, and held there.
Even the treasury bills introduced under the continuing reforms ordained by
the IMF are a recent revolution. For the 30 years since Gamel Abdul Nasser
nationalised swathes of Egypt's industry, capital movements have largely
comprised cosy transfers between big public sector enterprises and big
public sector banks, or the privately-arranged share sales of closely-held
companies.
This must change if Egypt is to see the structural economic adjustments on
which it embarked in 1991 under co-ordinated IMF and World Bank programmes.
Pressed by the twin imperatives of creating a market into which it can make
public offerings under its privatisation programme and that of invigorating
the country's existing private sector, Egypt is trying to create a capital
market, almost from scratch. 'If this mystical privatisation is ever to take
place, we need the capital markets in place first,' says one foreign agency
official.
Thus, with much help from the World Bank, Egypt produced and passed a
capital markets law last June. 'We have established the playground and the
rules of the game, now we can let the players play,' as Mr Ashraf Shams
el-Din of the Capital Markets Authority puts it.
The aim, he elaborates, is to produce a 'fair, honest, disciplined,
professional and transparent market' in both equities and bonds, open to
local and foreign investors and encouraging the growth of a slew of new
financial intermediaries.
In particular, the new law aims to remove two basic impediments to the
evolution of a capital market: a severe fiscal imbalance between securities
and bank deposits, and an arbitrary ceiling on permissible returns from
bonds.
The appeal of securities has been hugely dimmed: money in bank deposits
earns good interest and incurs no tax; share transactions have carried both
stamp duties and income taxes.
In total, the combined taxes on a single share transaction could reach 25
per cent of the equity's value.
The new law exempts shares in companies which issue to the public no less
than 30 per cent of their total equity, and in which shares are held by at
least 150 separate shareholders, from all but a 2 per cent capital gains
tax.
On bonds, the law removes at a stroke a dusty 1948 edict which clamped a
maximum 7 per cent coupon on any such instrument - a law which, essentially
because of the high interest rates available on bank deposits, had alone
scotched entirely any prospect of an Egyptian bond market.
Financiers and bankers unanimously agree that these two measures alone
constitute enormous progress. But that is where optimism about the new law
within Egypt's nascent financial services industry largely ends.
'In comparison to what we had, it's a huge leap forward,' says Mr Ahmed
Foda, managing director of Investments &amp; Securities Group in Cairo. 'But it
falls short of our expectations.'
The basic criticism is that the law has still not been enacted. Although
passed in June last year, the executive regulations which were supposed to
follow 90 days later were still under debate in late March.
Critics of the law consider it flawed both in detail and approach. Specific
complaints focus on the requirement that companies demonstrate at least 150
independent shareholders before they can win full tax exemptions on their
share trading - a constraint seen as particularly limiting in a country
where the stratum of potential direct investors in securities is likely to
be narrow.
Many financiers also worry that the law fails to outline in sufficient depth
the terms and conditions for the creation of new financial intermediaries.
But the broadest concern is that the law is simply too stifling.
'Rather than ask how we can create the right climate for a capital markets
law,' says one merchant banker in Cairo, 'the Capital Markets Authority is
saying, 'how can we take control?' There's too much emphasis on regulating a
market where there's no market to begin with.'
Several bankers suggest that the Capital Markets Authority, which is both
the author and enforcer of the new law, has been excessively influenced by
its experience in dealing with collapse, in the late 1980s, of several
Islamic finance houses. 'They've been traumatised into excessive
regulation,' says one banker.
Whatever its limitations, though, everyone in Cairo's now expectant
financial services industry is willing to accept the new law as a start. And
as we explore elsewhere in this survey, there are some early signs that
investors in the stock market might be willing to bite.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (5): Simple answers look attractive -
Religion is both a political tool and a threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE politicisation of Islam is nothing new in Egypt. The strong religious
attachments of Egyptians has long been both a tool and a threat for the
ruling elite.
President Nasser used religion to broaden the appeal of his pan-Arab
socialism. He nationalised its main teaching institutions in Cairo in order
to strengthen his domestic base. He banned the Moslem Brotherhood, blaming
it for attempts on his life.
President Sadat, in his turn, encouraged and fostered Islamic groups to
counter the threat posed to him by Nasserites in the early years of his
regime. He employed Islam to help justify his most controversial foreign and
domestic policy initiatives, before falling victim to the Moslem extremists
who assassinated him in October 1981.
President Mubarak has permitted himself to become no less entangled. But it
has happened against a fast-changing international background and persistent
economic deprivation at home, both of which are feeding the aspirations of
his opponents.
The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, the
demonstrable power of religious fundamentalism in Iran, and the frustration
in many Arab countries at the perceived failures of leadership, have
combined to create a situation in which the simplistic slogan 'Islam in the
solution' is gaining credibility.
Dr Fouad Zakariya, one of the leading authorities on Islam in the Arab
world, believes that the failure of other ideologies has given a boost to
the Islamic fundamentalists.
'They argue that Islam is the only thing that has not been tried,' he says.
'It also exploits the deep religious feeling among the Egyptian people and
its activists are very well disciplined.'
He has no doubt that it is a growing political force in the country, and
cites the example of recent rioting in the town of Qalyoub outside Cairo as
evidence of the public mood.
In this episode, a teacher was transferred from a school and four students
expelled for listening to tapes of an extremist cleric in the classroom.
'The rioting by the people was immediate and spontaneous. There was no time
for it to be organised. A church was burned, police had to be called from
Cairo to restore order and the ruling against the teacher and students was
reversed,' says Dr Zakariya.
Such an incident claimed fewer international headlines than the spate of
bombs and attacks on tourist targets, but it may better illustrate the
dimension of the challenge faced by the government in trying to halt the
erosion in its public support which has been noted at all levels of Egyptian
society.
Recent moves by the government to change the voting requirements in
elections for the professional organisations representing doctors, dentists,
engineers and lawyers were designed specifically to break the hold
established by the religious factions.
It is not just women students and those women from lower income groups who
are increasingly covering their hair in public, but also the wives of the
affluent who attend cocktail parties in Cairo's five-star hotels.
Society may be becoming broadly more conservative, as some Egyptians say,
but it is more difficult to understand why men and women with higher
educational qualifications would be persuaded by the arguments advanced by
the Moslem Brotherhood.
Although still officially banned, the Moslem Brotherhood is just tolerated
by the government. Until the last parliamentary elections it was represented
in the National Assembly under the coalition umbrella of the otherwise
politically irrelevant Socialist labour and Liberal parties.
An hour spent talking to Mr Mustapha Mashour, a spokesman for the party,
offered plentiful criticism of the government but little enlightenment about
the alternative which it seeks to represent.
Islam is the solution, he says, because the Koran is the word of God, and
God knows what is best for the people. All other systems, particularly
communism and capitalism, have failed precisely because they are man-made.
On taking power - 'hopefully within 20 years' - Mr Mashour says that the
first task of an Islamic government would be the simple, easily-applied
teachings of the Koran.
Alcohol and gambling would be banned and women would have to be veiled.
Structural adjustments, such as the abolition of usury, would be introduced
more gradually. But beyond that Mr Mashour could not be drawn. Critical
problems, such as unemployment, would be resolved by 'independent' ulema
(clergy) being attached to government ministries. They would sit down with
ministry officials and together apply the appropriate solutions provided by
the Koran.
'We cannot provide a solution to just one of the country's problems in
isolation. Islam has to be applied fully and only then can everything be
arranged to satisfy and please the people,' Mr Mashour says.
Some academics in Cairo argue that the best way of blunting the appeal of
the Moslem Brotherhood would be to legalise the party and force it to reveal
how little content there is to the Islamic solution. But it is not an
argument which will be accepted by Mr Mubarak, who views the Algerian
example as a dire warning to any Arab leader who is tempted to go down that
particular path.
Other suspicions remain about the tactics of the Moslem Brotherhood, and not
just at senior government level. Mr Mashour insists that it is totally
opposed to violence and has no links with any of the extremist Islamic
groups, such as the Gama'a al-Islamiyya and Islamic Jihad, which have been
responsible for recent bombings.
'They could fight against terrorism much more emphatically if they wished
to,' says one academic. 'The message could be spread from the mosques which
they control, and they could probably do it directly to those who are
responsible for the bombs. There is no evidence that this is happening. This
could lead to the conclusion that the Moslem Brotherhood is playing the role
of the more politically acceptable face of Islam, while the real game is
being played in secret. It is very tempting to believe that there is some
form of co-ordination which is being very carefully concealed.'
Even if such co-operation could be proved it is unlikely to impress the
poorest sections of society in Upper Egyptian towns such as Assyut, or in
the most deprived areas as of Cairo such as Imbaba, where thousands of
heavily armed police last month bloodily stormed an extremist hideout.
A walk through Imbaba reveals, however, not the tension and hostility which
might be expected of an area where Islamic militants are supposed to hold
sway, but rather the charm and humour of people who have learned to expect
little from their government. Should their proven patience ever snap, it
would be more a condemnation of government than the affirmation of an
Islamic alternative.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (4): Perceptions turn doubtful - Politics
full of uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Hosni Mubarak is nearing the end of his second six-year term in
office with the country in a state of political uncertainty greater than at
any time since he succeeded Anwar Sadat in 1981.
Then a modest and unassuming man who eschewed the flamboyance and
histrionics of his predecessor, Mr Mubarak appeared to offer a calmer, more
practical approach to the mountain of problems faced by a nation wearied by
war, stifled by bureaucracy and embittered by the perceived corruption of
the government and the unrealised promises of Mr Sadat.
The peace treaty with Israel held; Egypt remained aloof from the turmoil
elsewhere in the region; the economic 'open door' policy registered modest
successes, and with the release of political prisoners and a degree more
freedom for the media, the nation's intellectual elite welcomed the new
opportunity to express themselves.
With the return of the Arab League to Cairo, and generous debt forgiveness
by western nations in recognition of Egypt's supportive role in driving Iraq
out of Kuwait, Mr Mubarak appeared to be riding high in the nation's esteem.
But as Mr Sadat discovered before him, international successes are no
substitute for domestic achievements.
Egypt's relentless economic problems, most of all the unsatisfied demand for
employment among the country's young, require an enormous national effort
just to prevent further deterioration. The perception that Mr Mubarak's
government is proving unequal to the task appears to be growing at all
levels of society and has been heightened by the official response to the
spate of bomb attacks launched by Islamic extremists.
By declaring all-out war against the terrorists and by demanding that the
country's political organisations declare whether 'they are with us or
against us,' the government is dictating a choice that calls into question
its own performance.
'People should not be reduced to a choice between a corrupt ruling party and
a reactionary religious one,' according to Dr Ismail Sabri Abdullah, a
leader of the leftist Tregammu party and former planning minister under
President Sadat. His view appears widely shared across the political
spectrum, especially by liberal, secular professionals and the Coptic
minority which fears that a long-drawn out confrontation between the
security forces and Islamic extremists will radicalise the country and
further worsen economic conditions.
Mr Mubarak, however, remains adamant that the extremist violence is
sponsored from abroad, will be defeated within months, and that there cannot
be any comparisons between Egypt today and what is happening in Algeria or
has happened in Iran.
He may be right. But his critics fear that that the consequences of the
president having misjudged the situation could be disastrous for the
country.
Mr Said el-Naggar, once considered by President Mubarak as a possible prime
minister, has launched the New Civic Forum as a vehicle for articulating a
more fundamental appraisal of Egypt's political requirements if it is to
overcome the economic deprivation which is proving a fertile recruiting
ground for extremism.
'I would like to think that Mr Mubarak understands that a third term in
office for him can only be justifiable in terms of real political reform,'
he says.
He wants an end to 'what is in effect one-party rule' and the start of a
three-year transition process which would lay the foundations for all
parties to compete equally, including the legally banned Moslem Brotherhood.
'One major reason for the growth of Islamic fundamentalism is that political
parties cannot express themselves as they should in a proper democracy,' he
asserts. 'Repression, sometimes in a most severe and cruel way, is not the
answer. It is a policy that cannot work.'
Mr Husayn Amin, career diplomat, writer and academic, is even more outspoken
on the failings of the government. 'It has to be recognised that we are at
the end of the road,' he says. 'This government is incapable of combating
Islamic fundamentalism. It is perceived as so corrupt that it is incapable
of winning the support of the masses. If you want to combat extremism then
you had better arrange a new regime, a government that is seen as honest,
capable, liberal and democratic and which can persuade the people to give it
a chance.'
He and others are dismissive of Mr Atef Sidki, the prime minister, and of
the ruling National Democratic Party, which they claim has no ideology and
serves only as a haven for opportunists and profiteers. 'The perception in
the country is that the ruling party will never permit a transfer of power,'
argues Dr Sabri Abdullah. 'Therefore elections become quite meaningless. So
the people's hope for change is not linked to the ballot box.'
The last general election, at the end of 1990, was boycotted by three of the
main opposition parties - the conservative New Wafd, the Socialist Labour
Party and its tactically allied Moslem Brotherhood - providing an even wider
margin of victory for the NDP. But the most virulent, specific criticism is
reserved for Mr Safwat el-Sherif, the long-serving minister of information.
The steadily increasing religious content of television programming,
designed to demonstrate that the regime is more devout than its radical
opponents, is said by the minister's critics to be playing directly into the
hands of the Islamic factions by allowing them to dictate the political
terrain. The nation's newspapers, the least fettered in the Arab world, are
also devoting increasing space to religious issues, a process mockingly
referred to by Mr Amin as 'our writers booking their seats in the next
regime.'
The fact that he, and others, are willing to speak so openly is acknowledged
as a tribute to Mr Mubarak's continued liberalism and compares favourably
with President Gamal Abdul Nasser and with President Sadat, who before his
assassination in 1981 jailed over 1,500 of his most vocal critics.
Few believe that Mr Mubarak would ever resort to such tactics. But neither
do they see much evidence that the president is willing to accept advice
from outside his immediate circle.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (3): Slouching in the direction of reform -
Progress is slow in restructuring the economy as required
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOUCHING towards economic restructuring Egypt may be, but it continues to
slouch in the right direction for the chief mentors of its reforms, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
The two Washington-based institutions recently gave belated approval to the
first phases of Egypt's planned reforms. In February the Bank unfroze a
suspended Dollars 150m loan in approval of Egypt's accelerated privatisation
programme. The IMF then stamped a delayed imprimatur on Egypt's first
agreement since dealings with the agency resumed in 1991.
But it is the pace of Egypt's structural reforms which is likely to test the
patience of the men from the IMF - who returned to Cairo in March to open
talks on a second agreement.
While Mr Atef Obeid, minister for cabinet affairs and a prime interlocutor
in the talks, is characteristically sanguine that a deal can be swiftly
struck - 'We can achieve this in a matter of weeks, I'm always optimistic,'
he says - all signs point to some tough, probably fraught, bargaining.
After sealing some impressive achievements on the financial front under the
last deal the IMF, in closer co-ordination than is usual elsewhere with the
Bank, will address itself mainly to structural reforms to the real economy.
Here, in pushing harder for more thoroughgoing privatisation, for further
cuts in tariffs protecting swathes of uncompetitive industry and for
improvements in investment regulations, the reformers' drive will come up
harder than ever against entrenched vested interests and the government's
determination to permit economic reform only at a pace it feels it can
politically afford.
Progress under the first agreement has been substantial. A previously leaden
budget deficit of 18 per cent of GDP is on target to reach just 3.5 per cent
this year. Inflation of 20 per cent has been trimmed (by official tallies)
to 12 per cent. Interest rates at just over 15 per cent are still high, but
at least are now positive rates. The Egyptian pound holds tenaciously at
about EPounds 3.32 to the dollar. Reserves are a whopping Dollars 14bn. The
balance of payments has edged into modest surplus for the first time in
years.
Shoring up these advances was Egypt's considerable good fortune after the
Gulf war, which led to a surge in remittances and the write-off of Dollars
7bn of US military debt and Dollars 6bn of debt to Gulf countries. Egypt's
strategic importance in the anti-Iraq coalition also smoothed the way to a
particularly favourable 1991 IMF deal, which brought with it an immediate
write-off of 15 per cent of Egypt's Dollars 20bn Paris Club debt. A further
15 per cent was forgiven on completion of that agreement last month; 20 per
cent more will be written off on accomplishing the second, which is slated
for 1994. But the hard part lies ahead. On the financial side, the task is
largely one of consolidation.
Western economists believe, for instance, that Egypt can cut its budget
deficit further, perhaps even in line with Mr Obeid's optimistic forecast of
a level of 2 per cent of GDP in two years and 1.5 per cent in three. Much
will depend on continued success in improving the machinery of tax
collection and expanding the new 2 per cent sales tax, measures which added
EPounds 6.5bn to state coffers last year alone.
The bigger hurdle, though, will be the task of dismantling the heavy and
inefficient edifice of state control of the economy, much of which has lain
crumbling but intact since the days of Nasser. In this, progress has been
more modest.
Privatisation, the vanguard of these reforms, has finally begun in earnest.
Bids are already being gathered for the sale of the first batch of 20 state
assets and companies, among them a clutch of hotels and Nile cruisers and
industrial enterprises including Suez Cement Company and the El Nasr
Bottling Company. The government has promised to sell off a total of 85 of
the country's nearly 300 public sector companies by 1997.
But the programme is already falling behind a delayed schedule. And Mr Obeid
says he will not prepared to commit himself to naming more companies for
privatisation until the government sees how sales of the first batches fare.
'It can't be done quickly,' says a western economist. 'The whole programme
could take at least 20 years.' On tariff reduction there has also been a
gentle start. In March the government cut the standard maximum rate to 80
per cent from 100 per cent for a range of goods, excluding some luxury
items. But the IMF is pressing for more cuts - at first not much deeper.
New banking and capital markets laws have also been passed. But delight in
the private sector that such moves have finally been made is severely
tempered both by concern that haggling continues over the executive
regulations of these laws and that they may be too intrusive to achieve
their intended job of liberalising Egypt's underdeveloped financial system -
a prerequisite for a successful privatisation programme.
All these structural reforms are likely to entail some short-term pain,
largely in the form of forced unemployment, and thus run headlong into the
government's deep concern not to squeeze too hard a poor and fast growing
population which has already had to bear fairly substantial subsidy cuts
(notably on fuel) in the past two years. The shock of serious rioting after
food price rises in 1977 is never far from government minds.
The pace of reform is perhaps equally hampered by the government's
technical, and to some extend ideological limitations. 'The only ones making
policy in Egypt are the IMF and the World Bank,' says one sceptical banker.
'The others are only civil servants, working within constraints, including
their own mental constraints.'
The government is also acutely short of the expertise required to implement
an increasingly complex set of reforms, not least because of the public
sector's dismal salaries. As one economist puts it: 'The government is
trying to implement sophisticated reforms without having more than a couple
of sophisticated economists.'
A measure of Egypt's technocratic poverty is shown by estimates suggesting
that the country can only properly absorb 30-40 per cent of the billions of
dollars of aid it receives each year.
But whatever the constraints, Egypt has overwhelming imperatives to
accomplish reforms which, under the outline programmes of the IMF and World
Bank, are seeking to achieve growth rates of 4 per cent per annum over the
next decade. Present economic growth rates - likely to be 1 per cent this
year - are inadequate for a population growing by 2.3 per cent a year.
This growth rate, and the accordingly youthful profile of Egypt's
population, brings an estimated 400,000-500,000 new workers on to an
impoverished job market every year. Count in under-employment, endemic in
the public sector, and some independent economists reckon the economy needs
to provide at least twice that number of jobs yearly.
Embracing these youngsters, and simply keeping up basic health, schooling
and other services for Egypt's 58m people is an absolute priority for a
government which, for all the finger-pointing at Iran as the cause of recent
Islamic extremism, is well aware of the tinder for militancy provided by
poverty and joblessness.
But the broad improvement to Egypt's financial health has yet to translate
into substantive benefits for the mass of Egyptians. 'Private sector
investment has not yet provided the impetus for real economic take-off,'
says a western economist.
The imminence of that take-off depends on the pace of the next stage of
reforms, and thus on the outcome of the next game of push-me-pull-you
between the government and international agencies.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (1): Anxieties on the Nile - Early progress
in IMF-led reforms has been encouraging, but the pace of structural
adjustment proves more stubborn. The government is determined to crack down
hard on the threat posed by militant Islamic groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EGYPT has suffered an unsettling year: a bomb inside one of the pyramids,
tourists shot at and bombed, bloody security force reprisals against an
intensified campaign of Islamic extremist violence, all this and an
earthquake which ravaged some of Cairo's poorest districts. For the
apocalypse-minded, of whom there are growing numbers among Egypt's
disconcerted middle classes, it all betokens ill.
These Jeremiahs point anxiously at an apparently co-ordinated campaign of
terror waged by the underground Gama'a al-Islamiyya extremists and at the
rising joblessness and economic dislocation on which they seem to feed. They
point at the Islamic 'infiltration' and control of most of Egypt's
influential professional associations. The most alarmist speak of an
irreversible tide of Islamic fundamentalism now directly threatening the
state. 'These people are carrying out a plan to destroy Egypt,' says Mr Said
Ashmawy, chief justice of the supreme court for state security. 'What is
going on now is a civil war between the police and the terrorists'.
But if any of these concerns are shared within Egypt's government, there are
scant signs. President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview before his recent trip
to Washington, was relaxed, even jocular. 'It is not a threat to the
regime,' he insists, a message he carried with him to the US where, standing
beside President Bill Clinton, he declared Egypt 'as strong as ever', its
leadership 'firm and confident'.
Of the government's firmness there can be little doubt. Its response to the
Gama'a's attacks against tourist targets and police has been, by the
president's admission 'heavy handed'. Thousands of alleged activists have
been detained and 49 tried by military court. Thousands of troops entered
the Cairo suburb of Imbaba in one raid to round up 600 suspects. Almost 50
people, including at least 11 security officers, died in gunbattles during
raids on suspected Gama'a hideouts in March alone. Amnesty International,
echoing growing concern among human rights groups, said that the government
appeared to be waging a shoot-to-kill policy against the extremists.
Few of Egypt's middle class worriers oppose such state violence. The local
and foreign business community, in particular, having seen the Gama'a
attacks wipe up to Dollars 700m off this year's precious tourist revenues,
believe that only such a crackdown will, in the short term, safeguard
Egypt's secure image for investors and restore to its previous buoyancy a
tourist industry which is Egypt's most sparkling economic prospect.
Few, equally, think repression alone is the answer. However much President
Mubarak jabs a finger of blame at Iran for sponsoring recent extremism - a
factor even senior foreign ministry officials privately play down - there is
near consensus elsewhere that the roots of the violence, and indeed of
creeping 'Islamisation,' are home-grown and more likely to spread than
wither if confronted solely by force. 'Ninety per cent of what you see is a
rising tide of protest, more than a rising tide of Islamic fundamentalism,'
says Mr Said al-Naggar, a former executive director of the World Bank who
last year set up New Civic Forum, a liberal think-tank and lobby group.
The protest, runs this widely held view, rises from the increasing hardship
of the great bulk of Egypt's 58m people for whom impressive macro-economic
progress under early stages of the country's International Monetary Fund and
World Bank reform programmes has yet to produce any real benefits. The
protest takes an Islamic voice, goes the critique, because the government
has closed or controlled almost all remaining space for political
expression.
The rise of Islamists to fill widening gaps, both economic and political,
was starkly suggested by the response of the Moslem Brotherhood and other
Islamic groups after last November's earthquake. Before the government's
creaky bureaucracy had begun to deploy shelter and food to the broken
streets in Cairo's poorest quarters, Islamic activists had smartly moved in
to provide at least some of both.
To be sure, the government is waging hard the economic battle. Earlier this
year Egypt sealed its first IMF agreement since it broke off discussions
with the Fund in 1987, having slashed its budget deficit, stabilised the
currency, bolstered reserves, pushed its balance of payments into surplus
and embarked on structural reforms to the real economy, including a
four-year privatisation programme.
These will be the focus of a second deal, under discussion.
The imperative for reform is urgent. By official estimates Egypt's
inefficient dirigiste economy needs to be sufficiently rejuvenated,
preferably by the private sector, to produce up to 500,000 new jobs a year
for Egypt's young and still fast-growing population. Mr al-Naggar, who says
such figures ignore massive underemployment in the sprawling public sector,
believes the figure nearer 900,000 jobs yearly - implying annual growth
rates of a presently implausible 8 per cent. The economy this year may grow
by 1 per cent.
But the next, structural, reforms will also be the toughest to achieve in
the face of deep vested interests, which will be threatened by further
tariff cuts and sharpened competition, and the government's limited capacity
to enforce increasing complex measures.
Further, the government has been extremely cautious about pushing reforms
too far too fast, haunted by clear memories of the severe rioting after food
price rises in 1977.
In these concerns, the IMF and World Bank are exceptionally sensitive,
heavily influenced by US-led emphasis on Egypt's strategic value to the
west. This importance, which both the US and Egypt mutually reaffirmed
during Mr Mubarak's trip to Washington, was highlighted by Cairo's staunch
role as shepherd of the Arab allies during the Gulf war. Recognition of this
alone won Egypt tremendously favourable debt-relief, both through the the
write-off of US and Gulf debts totalling nearly Dollars 13bn and through
staged forgiveness of its then Dollars 20bn Paris Club owings tied to
progress with the IMF.
Since the Gulf war, Mr Mubarak has sought to burnish this strategic value by
attempting to place himself and Egypt at the heart of the Middle East peace
process, capitalising on the country's unique ability to be interlocutor
with the Palestinians, the other Arab parties and the Israelis in efforts to
resolve the crisis over the Israeli-deported Palestinians. His anti-Iranian
rhetoric also chimes in neatly with similar such statements recently
emanating from the US State Department.
But if the west can offer a strong buttress for Egypt's economic reforms,
not least by the continued provision of aid, it cannot address directly the
political challenge offered by Egypt's Islamic groups, moderate and
extremist alike. The challenge, or even threat, was clearly voiced recently
by Mr Mahmoun Hudeibi, spokesman for the formally banned Moslem Brotherhood.
'Unless the political system changes in Egypt, and there are more freedoms,'
he says, 'terrorism will intensify. The only way towards political and
social rectification is reform of the regime itself'.
In the Brotherhood's eyes, these changes would be to allow it to participate
directly in the country's political system, from which it is barred by a
constitutional ban on parties based on religion. But Mr Mubarak will have
none of this. Not only has the government introduced legislation aimed at
diluting Brotherhood influence in the professional associations it now
dominates, but Mr Mubarak also brandishes the example of Algeria to show
what happens if Islamic parties are given their head.
But neither do Egypt's liberals, either secular or Islamic, believe that
they are being allowed sufficient political space in which to develop an
articulate response to the militants. Expressing such grievances recently,
Mr Nabil Abdel-Fattah, of the Al-Ahram centre for political and strategic
studies, wrote: 'The ground rules do not exist for the kind of political
game which makes it possible to reach consensus among various political
parties, and imposes obligations and duties as well as providing guarantees
for competing political forces'.
Political options in Egypt, argue such liberals, are being narrowed to a
false choice between Islam of an increasingly militant stripe and the
coterie of figures which has run the country, largely unchanged, since Mr
Mubarak took power more than a decade ago. The call for at least a
rejuvenation of the regime is widespread among prominent Egyptians. 'There
are at least 500 people in this country who could run it as well as the US,'
says one leading businessman. 'But the government will not allow them in'.
Such a choice looks the more unhealthy amid newspaper stories of scandal in
high places and the increasing willingness of critics to brand the
government as not only out of touch, but as touched with corruption. 'The
rising tide is nothing but a protest at what people see as injustice,
corruption and the violation of human rights,' says Mr al-Naggar.
While the government has political control, and a preponderance of force, Mr
Mubarak is probably right that violent Islamic extremism poses no immediate
threat. It is almost equally certain that the government's reliance on
political control and force alone will do nothing for the confidence of
Egypt's Jeremiahs - or to thin their ranks.

Powerful economic assets protected - Why the terms on drug patents have been
lengthened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS have not lengthened patent protection for computers, for fuel
injection systems, or for components for aircraft undercarriages. So why
have the United States, Japan and the European Community all given just such
special treatment specifically to pharmaceuticals in recent years?
Self-interest, is the short answer. Governments were persuaded that
competitive capability was at stake, and did not want to throw away powerful
economic assets that were capable of bringing important foreign trade
earnings.
The US set the pace in the early 1980s, when its government accepted
national drug firms' arguments that tougher drug testing requirements - and
consequently longer lead times to launch - were eating into patent term and
damaging industrial prospects. Pre-launch development had risen from three
to four in the 1960s to around 10 years - thereby eroding as much as half
the product's patent life.
Cutting the lead times was not a serious option in an increasingly
safety-conscious sector: so in 1984, the government extended the length of
US patent term for pharmaceuticals - secure in the knowledge that US
companies, which held the lion's share of the US market, would be the
principal beneficiaries.
When a similar logic convinced the Japanese authorities to extend drug
patent life in Japan in 1988, the European industry was left with serious
double trouble: not only were patents in Europe still being eroded by long
lead times, but the Japanese and US moves had left European firms at what
they claimed was a systematic disadvantage in competition with their main
international rivals.
In consequence, from the beginning of this year a new legal instrument has
come into force in the EC, designed specifically to provide additional
intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical innovation. The
Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC), as it is known, will give up to
five years' further market exclusiveness to medicines, in partial
compensation for patent life lost while they were in pre-launch development.
As many as 50 new medicines a year could qualify for a total protection of
15 years from first launch. And European firms - who hold the largest share
of European sales - will benefit most.
The pharmaceutical industry has produced a barrage of arguments why it is a
special case. It contends that few areas of industry-funded research are so
expensive (with an average new medicine costing ECU200m (Dollars 242m) to
develop). It says that few areas of innovation are as easy to copy as
medicines, and therefore so vulnerable to post-patent competition from
generics. Or it argues that product life cycles are shorter in many other
research-based industries, and in such areas longer patents are therefore
less important.
But the real clincher - and the argument that provokes no scepticism in
other industrial sectors - is that few areas of innovation run into lengthy
post-patent controls before marketing. For many non-pharmaceutical
innovations, product launch comes only months after patent grant - leaving
more than 15 years of effective patent term. By contrast, as the EC's new
SPC regulation expresses it, the lengthy development time for new medicines
'makes the period of effective patent protection under the patent
insufficient to cover the investment put in to the research'.
There is some independent evidence to support the claims that drugs need
patents more than most other products. According to the UK Patent Office, as
few as 10 per cent of all patents are still being renewed in the final year
of their life, and the average patent - across all sectors - is maintained
for only 11 years; by then it is usually abandoned, because the product has
failed, or been overtaken.
Drug firms, on the other hand, maintain that a new medicine is usually only
getting into its stride in the eleventh year of its patent life. One of the
few disinterested cross-sectoral comparative studies of the subject has also
concluded that 'in the patent field, probably only the research- based
pharmaceutical industry is totally dependent on patents'.
In any event, enlightened self-interest has convinced the member states that
they had to act - not because research would be stifled without patent term
reform, but because it could be stifled in Europe. The focus of the EC
measure is clear: medicines which take a long time to research 'will not
continue to be developed in the Community and in Europe unless they are
covered by favourable rules that provide for sufficient protection for
research'; there is a 'risk of research centres situated in the member
states relocating to countries that already offer greater protection'.
The perceived risk is not a breakdown in the development of new drugs, but a
shift in innovation away from one region and towards another. The success of
the research-based pharmaceutical industry in arguing its case on patent
protection probably contains a moral for it as it combats increasing attacks
on its pricing in the US, Japan, and Europe.
But patent term restoration does not please everyone. Generic manufacturers,
who won useful trade-offs in the US legislation, are angry that they get
nothing from the EC SPC. European consumer associations complain that
patients will be worse off, because there are no competition measures to
counter-balance longer monopolies. The Spanish government - which, like many
of its national drug companies, never supported drug patents strongly - has
launched a European Court action against the regulation. Even for the
R&amp;D-based industry, there are concerns over the new EC law: the strength of
the SPC has yet to be tested in any court of law; and the mechanisms for
granting SPCs are proving problematic (many of the applications submitted
for an SPC since the beginning of this year have been rejected as
inadequate).
Nonetheless, some other industrial sectors are showing interest in emulating
the drug industry's achievements. In Europe, the chemical industry
federation, CEFIC, has declared its readiness to back any sectoral request
for patent term extension to compensate for time lost in pre-launch
administrative procedures.
First into the fray are the pesticides manufacturers: the 'SPC task force'
of the European Crop Protection Association expects an EC proposal 'in
mid-1993' for an agro-chemical SPC.
The future may not be only a question of other industries catching up with
pharmaceuticals, however. Within the pharmaceutical sector itself, although
there is more or less a level playing field on drug patent length across the
three principal drug-producing regions of the world since the start of 1993,
there are already signs of moves to make some regions more equal than
others.
In a just-published wish-list for better economic treatment for its members,
the European drug industry federation, EFPIA, concludes a catalogue of
demands with a mysterious cry which it at present declines to explain: 'A
Community-wide mechanism is needed to restore the normal 20-year period of
patent protection for innovative products,' it says. Is the drug world on
the brink of a new round of patent term extension leapfrogging?

Scaling up for manufacture - High costs may follow scientific success before
a drug can be marketed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO NOT equate innovation with commercial success, warns Ian Smith,
pharmaceutical analyst with Lehman Brothers International. Companies that
are highly innovative in discovering potential new drugs may lack the
resources - financial and technical, for example - to capitalise upon their
success. It can take a lot of expensive science and engineering to bring a
new drug discovery to the market.
At an IBC conference on the management of pharmaceutical research and
development in London last year, Mr Smith addressed not just the perennial
problem of picking winners but how to pick 'blockbusters' early enough.
No-one should underestimate the technical effort and the cost that is needed
to translate scientific success in drug discovery into a commercially
profitable new medicine. In the late 1980s, when Wellcome came under
pressure to reduce the price of AZT, its compound for treating Aids, the
company had a manufacturing process it could not scale up because one stage
was too dangerous - had already exploded, in fact. As its (then) chairman
would point out, it had no idea at what cost, or when, it would solve the
problem.
Similarly, Schering AG is having difficulties devising a way of
manufacturing Betaseron, its new multiple sclerosis compound.
'There's a lot of hope involved in this sort of compound,' explains Prof
Gunter Stock, board director in charge of R&amp;D at Schering. 'I don't want
more hope than we can promise. It's a very complicated molecule and we don't
know if we can produce it in commercial quantities.'
Fisons ran into a different problem. Apparently trying to economise on the
costs of manufacture, it ran foul of the US Food and Drug Administration,
which claims the right to approve conditions of manufacture before licensing
new medicines for the US market. The FDA placed a 'detention order' on
Opticrom and Imferon and Fisons was forced to undertake extensive
improvements for Opticrom manufacture at its Holmes Chapel, Cheshire,
factory.
Imferon has been abandoned and licensed out to a US company. Problems with
these two medicines were blamed for a sharp fall in profits last year.
The importance companies now attach to these 'downstream' aspects of the R&amp;D
process can be gauged from the apportioning of corporate responsibility. ICI
Pharmaceuticals (now part of Zeneca) since the mid-1980s has brought
responsibility for R&amp;D, manufacture and production together under its
technical director, Dr Tom McKillop, who is also deputy chief executive of
the division.
For the past few years the division has been introducing a variant of what
the advanced engineering industries call concurrent engineering, to try to
tackle the technical problems of development successively instead of
sequentially, and while the medicine is in clinical trial. To make it work
you have to be technology-hungry, prepared to bring in technology from
anywhere to speed things up, Dr McKillop says.
It can take as long as 20 years to bring a new medicine to the market, Dr
Barry Price, research director of Glaxo Group Research, told a Royal Academy
of Engineering conference on Strategies for Effective Research last month.
Yet three out of four medicines that get to market fail to make money, he
said.
Glaxo faced problems with the FDA in the mid-1980s when the regulators let
it be known that they had worries about the man designated to be the
company's next R&amp;D chief.
As a result Glaxo recruited instead a former employee, Dr Richard Sykes,
from Squibb. Dr Sykes was acutely sensitive from the start to the
international influence of the FDA and its technical judgments. In a
management reshuffle at Glaxo last month Dr Sykes became chief executive
while retaining, as chairman of Glaxo Group Research, his responsibility for
R&amp;D.
Ian Smith in his address on spotting the blockbuster made direct comparison
between Glaxo and Fisons. The former was characterised by aggressive
development, done as quickly as possible - 'they throw money at it'. Fisons
spent less, were very successful at bringing new ideas to the point of
clinical development, but never achieved the commercial potential they
showed.
British Biotechnology, born in 1986 with the declared aim of becoming a
leading pharmaceutical company by developing a second generation of
genetically engineered drugs - was acutely aware from the start of the
hazards that lay downstream in the R&amp;D process. Unlike many research
scientists who launched new biotechnology companies in the 1980s its
chairman and chief executive had prior experience with the industry, at GD
Searle's laboratories. They had taken new products of genetic engineering
into pilot manufacture by the early 1980s.
Drs Brian Richards, chairman, who designed the Searle plant, and Keith
McCullough, chief executive, were acutely aware of the need for
manufacturing development to keep pace with the more highly publicised
activities of drug discovery, and of the fast-growing influence of
pharmaceutical regulators. They elected to sub-contract manufacture of new
chemical entities needed in quantities sufficient for clinical trials, but
to manufacture in-house the often trickier biological entities.
In 1990 they embarked upon the construction of their biological production
facility, close to the main office at Cowley. Designed with the help of
biotechnologists at University College, London, the contained facility
complies with the international regulations on the secure containment of
micro-organisms, as well as stringent quality control and quality assurance
standards.
The facility's main production area - a suite of nine rooms - is equipped
with fermenters of up to 450 litres capacity. It has separate rooms for
separation and downstream processing, as well as rooms for preparing
microbiology and animal cell inoculums. Three separate product streams can
run in parallel.
In addition, the building contains areas for protein purification by
chromatography, etc, and cold storage for sterile filling and for
decontamination by heat and chemical action.
The whole facility, including process development laboratories, is designed
to Category 2 containment standards.
It has been approved for production by the FDA.
Not every company is pinning its faith on genetic engineering. But
biotechnology could find a big role in manufacturing medicines from other
sources, not least because of pressure for purer products. A good example
lies with compounds that are mixtures of two steroisomers - left- and
right-handed molecules. Normally, only one of the isomers is
pharmacologically useful. The other is at best inert, and may even have
undesirable side-effects; in other words, it is an impurity amounting to 50
per cent of the product.
Many companies are already alive to the issue for their existing products,
both naturally derived and synthetic.
New methods of biosynthesis are emerging that yield only the desired isomer.
The result may be not only a purer product, but a cheaper one.

Selection process is critical - How winners and losers are decided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT is a crucial component in the future fortunes of pharmaceuticals
groups. Most have access, either internally or externally, to exciting
research. But the way companies select new chemical entities and the way
they develop them decides the sector's winners and losers.
'The development process is very important. Differentiation comes from the
way you select research and how you use it in a creative and flexible way,'
explains Dr Rolf Krebs, chairman of Boehringer Ingelheim.
Selecting compounds is far from easy yet, according to Dr Richard Sykes,
Glaxo's chief executive and director of R&amp;D, this is where the critical
decisions are made.
'It is critical to decide which projects to take forward. You have to know
the medical need; you have to know that it is technologically feasible; and
you have to be innovative. The drug must have the potential to be an
important medicine - significant advantages in terms of safety and efficacy
or both,' says Dr Sykes.
Most R&amp;D directors agree that any compounds must be innovative if they are
to be successful. 'If the industry does not generate enough innovative
products, it will end up fighting cheap generics with me-too products,' says
Dr Krebs.
Defining, let alone generating, innovative products is not easy, however.
'The problem is you don't know what's going on elsewhere,' says Dr George
Poste, R&amp;D chairman at SmithKline Beecham. 'Take Tagamet, our anti-ulcer
product with sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year. Work began on that
compound 30 years ago.'
New chemical entities are like black boxes, says Dr Poste. It is far from
clear if they will work and if they will be safe. You might be behind three
other companies, but the opposition's second and third compounds could fall
by the wayside, he explains. 'Only generic compounds set out to be me-too
drugs,' says Dr Poste.
'Me-too has wrongly become a pejorative term,' says Dr Leon Rosenberg,
president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. 'Science
only moves in small increments. Giant steps are only made once in a decade
or even every 20 years. The world's two top-selling drugs - Zantac and
Vasotec - were me-too compounds, but with dosing or safety improvements.'
Dr Poste agrees, pointing out that 25 of the 32 compounds given a me-too
classification by the US Food and Drug Administration in the 1980s actually
offered improved safety, tolerability or quality of life, or had better
dosing than earlier medicines.
Developing innovative drugs is risky. Such molecules take longer to develop
than me-toos and there is a heightened danger of them being cut for reasons
of safety and efficacy. Dr Max Wilhelm at Ciba says a development portfolio
must be balanced, with follow-up products in case some fail. There must also
be a good mixture of safe bets and high risk-high reward products. He will
only develop products that will reach annual sales of more than SFr500m.
Sometimes not being innovative can be justified, says Dr Wilhelm. He
explains his recent decision to launch Lotensin, an ace-inhibitor for
hypertension, even though the market is saturated and there is even price
competition in the US. He argues that by developing the drug it gave the
company access to experts and opinion formers.
Without Lotensin, Ciba's credibility in the cardiovascular market would have
been undermined. 'It kept us in the market place and in the scientific
community - and it'll make some money,' says Dr Wilhelm.
Other groups are far more Draconian in their approach. Dr Frank-Joachim
Morich, director of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Bayer, says he is pleased his
company fails to figure among the top 50 groups listed in order of the
number of compounds in development. He says there is no relationship between
the number of compounds in development and innovation.
Dr Jurgen Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche, has also become
increasingly tough. 'We have become very vigorous in refusing to develop
agents that do not have an innovative profile. We have cut the number of
compounds in development by 15 to 20 per cent over the past 12 to 16 months.
We are learning to be strict.'
Dr Drews says an increasingly large proportion of molecules proposed by
research are now rejected. He reckons 10 years ago only 10 per cent of
compounds entering clinical development made it to the market. Now that
barriers are higher, the proportion reaching the market is at about 30 per
cent. 'There are fewer of them, they are of higher quality, and there is
less attrition,' he says.
An added complication to the development process is the need to conduct it
internationally. In spite of efforts to harmonise regulations, authorities
in the US, Japan and Europe, still often require different clinical trials.
Given the costs of bringing a drug to market, pharmaceuticals groups must
develop their medicines in all three regions, covering more than 80 per cent
of the world market.
Not all companies have the expertise to do that. While some are beginning to
license out products for co-development, others are turning to contract
research organisations such as Bessalaar and Pharmaco of the US and
Munich-based Harrison Clinical Research to conduct clinical trials.
Given the increasing demands of regulatory groups, most groups are looking
to cut down on the numbers of studies and the complexity of studies they
conduct.
'It's seductive when conducting trials to add in supplementary questions
that aren't really necessary and that create enormous quantities of data
that can't be analysed,' says Dr Stephen Hill, medical director of Roche
Products, Roche's UK subsidiary.
R&amp;D directors must also be brutal in cutting projects, says Dr Sykes at
Glaxo. 'If a company is ahead of you and your drug is not as good, then you
need to act. There's nothing wrong with cutting projects, the decisions have
to be made.'
Finally, the end product should be a good read, says Dr Drews. 'The new drug
application must be attractive and the dossier must have entertainment
value. It must be something that is almost fun to deal with. It will then be
read faster because the investigator becomes involved in a positive way,' he
claims.

Sharpened wits ensure success - Motivating people at the cutting edge of
science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY ONE in 5,000 compounds investigated by pharmaceutical companies reaches
the market place in the UK, and it takes at least 10 years for a new
medicine to be launched.
How to motivate scientists to continue their search for a cure with the odds
so stacked against them is a problem for drug companies. At the same time,
adequate rewards and recognition are necessary to keep modern-day
researchers from wandering away from the bench.
According to Dr John Taylor, senior vice-president, central research at
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the peculiar nature of research breeds a positive
attitude in scientists. 'By definition, 99.9 per cent of research is
failure. It takes 10 years for the researcher to see the results of his
efforts, but research people are the ultimate optimists - they always
believe they are going to succeed.'
Like the inventor then, the researcher thinks his ideas are the best and
that they will work. But of the 10 new potential medicines proposed each
year within RPR's total research group, only one will eventually make it
through the development phase.
RPR points to two principal reasons why projects are cut. The first, says Dr
Taylor, is when a compound lacks clinical efficacy. 'There's a good idea,
the mechanism is nice, but it doesn't work when you use it in man.' The
second, he adds, is toxicology. 'It does work, but all the long-term safety
testing turns up a toxicity in an animal species that you have to drop.'
When an R&amp;D project is stopped, particularly at a late stage, companies have
to deal with the disappointment felt by their drug research teams. As Dr Jim
Wright, director and vice-president, human resources, for R&amp;D at SmithKline
Beecham, says, 'It's never easy. By that time, people have got a real
personal commitment to the outcome of that project.'
One answer is to fully integrate the R&amp;D function with the rest of the
business, so it is not a sudden surprise when a project is shelved. Then,
'it's not as if you've given away your little baby to the midwife and she
has come back and said 'I'm sorry, I've dropped your baby on its head and
it's died',' says Dr Wright.
Research at SB covers five main therapeutic areas. These are:
cardiopulmonary; anti-infectives; inflammation and tissue repair;
neurosciences; and vaccines. Review committees comprising commercial and
scientific people meet regularly to discuss the development process. 'If you
can get that integration then there is much less disappointment,' says Dr
Wright, because 'we are working as a team towards a common end point.'
Team work though, is an expensive business and companies are increasingly
aware that their scientists expect to be well rewarded, competitively within
the market. 'You're employing a group of people who need to be motivated by
money like everyone else. They are highly skilled and their salaries have to
reflect that,' said Dr Taylor.
Scientists working for Glaxo, SB and RPR are rewarded according to a
sensible merits system, which allows them to get right to the top of the
scientific ladder. Benefits include: a salary increase based on individual
performance; a bonus system linked to the business results; and longer term
incentives based on stock options.
In addition to these financial incentives, most companies support their
scientists' attendance at conferences and publication of their papers. Dr
Frank-Joachim Morich, director of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Bayer, says: 'We
encourage our researchers to be part of the scientific community.'
Even with scientific recognition, and all the material and financial rewards
that go with it, scientists may not feel sufficiently motivated to stay in
research for their working life. 'You well recognise that they can't
perhaps, or won't stay all their lives at the front of research,' said Dr
Taylor, 'Few people can be at the cutting edge of science all their lives
and not get burnt or wounded or cut.'
First-aid treatment in this instance takes the form of annual career
reviews, generating a dialogue for scientists who may wish to move away from
the front end of research. For example, at RPR and SB it is quite common for
a discovery chemist to develop into process chemistry after 10 years, and
then perhaps into manufacturing. 'People tend to evolve through an
organisation. They've got tremendous qualities and potential to give to the
group, which is why we develop them into other areas,' says Dr Taylor.
With about 100 people working on any one particular research project, man
management is a crucial part of science. Companies have to address the needs
of top-quality scientists, but management of these scientists is equally
important. Dr Taylor explains: 'All the best scientists are not necessarily
the best managers. You're looking for a very special breed of scientific
management to manage your top quality scientists.'
However, he points out that scientists often do have good human resource
qualities, and these should be developed. 'We have a plan for high potential
people. We look at where they could and should be in five years' time, and
their career would be plotted to develop their management skills,' he said.
Like other global companies, RPR has three attractive locations, where its
most talented scientists could end up during their careers (Philadelphia,
Paris and London). So-called 'ex-pat' moves can be transitional or permanent
according to individual development, but such experiences come at a price.
RPR sends only the top 5-10 per cent of its scientists abroad.
Competition, the need to be more cost-effective and efficient, and the rate
of improvement of science means scientists have to meet tougher targets each
year. In this climate, scientists encouraged to progress up the scientific
ladder will in turn propel drug companies towards success.
'If the company is successful it is innovative, because all new medicines
are innovative,' said Dr Taylor. 'We want to keep the very best people
motivated and stimulated at the bench as long as we can. If they want to do
it all their lives, then they're rare animals, and we want to provide a
career path for those.'

When time can cost a fortune - Speed is essential when bringing drugs to
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCING the time it takes to bring a drug to market has become the
pharmaceutical industry's overriding objective. 'The most urgent and
immediate issue concerning the industry has been that of time to market,'
says Dr Jurgen Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche.
There are two mains reasons for shorter development time. 'First, you want
to help the unmet medical needs of the public you are trying to serve,' says
Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute.
'The second reason is the limited period that a drug is protected by its
patents. Time is money. Anything you can do to pick up time means millions
of dollars in sales,' he says.
The rule of thumb for drug development is that every day a drug is held back
from the market costs the drug company Dollars 1m, explains Mr David
Matheson, senior vice-president at Boston Consulting Group. Dr Willi
Stammberger, head of development at Hoechst, estimates that one month's
delay in launching an important new product results in a cumulative sales
loss of DM30m (Dollars 18.6m).
Being late hits the company in two ways. It adds costs to the development
bill and it reduces revenues at the end of the product's patent life.
Speed to market also offers competitive advantage. Dr George Poste, chairman
of R&amp;D at SmithKline Beecham, points out that no matter how good a compound
is, speed is essential. There is no point being five years behind a
competitor's product.
'It's fair to say that speed to market was the primary reason for success
during the 1980s,' says Mr Bob Easton, president of The Wilkerson group, the
New-York based consultants. 'It's no coincidence that the two fastest
companies - Glaxo and Merck - are also the world's biggest pharmaceuticals
groups.'
But while most groups agree on the need to accelerate drug development, the
performance of many groups continues to be disappointing.
'There's still tremendous variability in performance between different
companies,' says Mr Matheson, 'The fastest at conducting phase two and phase
three studies are three times quicker than the slowest. Some are taking
eight years and some as little as two and a half years.'
Many research and development directors justify the length of time they take
to develop drugs by pointing out it is far more difficult to prove safety
and efficacy in some therapeutic areas and indications than others. For
example, it becomes clear within a couple of weeks whether or not an
antibiotic works, whereas a central nervous system product can take years.
'Take the 5HT3s,' says Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive and head of R&amp;D at
Glaxo. 'Zofran for emesis was easy - you either feel sick or you don't. But
for anxiety, depression ordementia it's much more subjective whether or not
it works.'
'Many R&amp;D directors claim there's a problem of comparing apples and oranges.
They are slower because their portfolio has more difficult drugs in it,'
says Mr Matheson at Boston Consulting Group. 'But there is a systematic
difference between companies.'
There are huge differences in performance within therapeutic areas,
according to Mr George Farrington, head of pharmaceuticals at The Wilkerson
Group. In antibiotics, for example, the best companies can develop medicines
in 60 months, compared with 250 months for the worst.
One of the key areas that drug groups can improve is the management of their
portfolios. 'You have to match resources to the portfolio available, being
ruthless about which drugs they take into development,' says Dr Tom
McKillop, research and technology director at Zeneca. 'You can't run 12
compounds simultaneously and then decide which one to bet on.'
Many companies try to run too many candidates through their pipeline, which
slows down the development of all of them. Dr Rosenberg at Bristol-Myers
Squibb agrees that resources are always finite. 'We have come to the
conclusion that we need to focus our resources. Each compound at a late
stage of development needs the best clinical trials that we can offer,' he
says.
At Schering, Prof Gunter Stock, board director in charge of R&amp;D, says a
master plan is agreed at the start of the project. A key compound in
accelerated development must not be held up by lack of resources.
The correct mix of products within the portfolio is also essential, says Mr
Matheson. Groups must have a balance between familiar and new areas. If the
area is familiar the company will know the regulators and understand the
required end-points for the clinical studies. For new therapeutic areas, the
development scientists are leaping the fences for the first time.
There must also be a balance of risk within the portfolio, especially in
phase one trials, where the likelihood of a compound dropping out is higher.
Planning is critical, says Mr Matheson. Companies must consider:
A balance between obtaining the necessary data for registration but not
making the dossier too complicated.
Integrating a team of pharma-economists into clinical development process so
the cost-effectiveness of a drug can be incorporated in the regulatory
dossier.
Manufacturing. They must ensure adequate supplies of the compound are ready
for clinical trials. Many groups take the risk of manufacturing large
quantities before the end of pre-clinical development.
Starting the pivotal study - usually the longest and largest - as soon as
possible while ensuring the design is right.
Managing the dozens of investigators around the world necessary for the
trials. Some should be avoided because they cannot meet deadlines. Others
need administrative and computer support.
There is a problem of convincing scientists of the need for urgency: Dr
Stammberger explains: 'It is not clear to the average scientist on the bench
how much money you're losing by delaying a project.'
Coping effectively with the paper mountain that builds up from the clinical
trials.
However, Dr Drews at Roche warns that rushing a product to market is not a
panacea. 'Bringing products to market in any quality as quickly as possible
only makes sense if you have something worthwhile. There is no point
developing something at the speed of light if it is trivial.'

Computers speed up drug dossiers - Technology available for management of
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pharmaceuticals industry has been slow to harness the rapidly-improving
power of personal computing for clinical trials and registration of dossiers
for new drug applications to regulatory authorities.
But a combination of changing demands from the US Food and Drug
Administration and other national licensing bodies, together with the need
to speed drugs through the development process has led to a huge expansion
in the use of computers.
Mr David Matheson, senior vice-president at Boston Consulting Group, warns:
'Drug development is like a paper factory churning out endless pages.
Managing the logistics of data is shot through with difficulties and you can
easily trip yourself up.'
He claims buying personal computers for investigators so they can enter data
remotely is not a difficult investment decision.
The amount of time it takes to organise data in a critical study following
the last patient entry can be cut from 40 weeks to a fortnight, he
estimates. Given that every day a top-selling drug is delayed can cost a
company Dollars 1m, the savings can be immense. Mr Matheson reckons about
half of drugs groups have started using computers, but few are totally
automated.
'Remote data entry for clinical trials is one of the big issues for the
industry at the moment. The theory is very attractive,' claims Dr
Frank-Joachim Morich, director of pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Bayer.
Dr Poste, research and development director at SmithKline Beecham, explains:
'The Utopia would be that an electronic case report connected up to
electronic hospital notes. You would then have a software system that acted
as a gate, flagging any values that might cause concern. That would identify
problems early before the data got into the main database and ruined it.
Essentially you'd have an electronic quality control system in place that
ensured consistency of case notes.'
The electronic system would also help clean up the data before it can be
analysed.
'There is a lot of duplication in quality control,' says Dr Poste. 'Since
people know the data is going to be checked by someone else, they don't do
it properly, but the dossier gets held up nonetheless. It should be done
properly first time.'
'The problem is that it's a real software headache,' admits Dr Poste. At
Bayer, Dr Morich says the software problems are such that although the
company is slowly starting to use remote data entry, it is only beginning
with smaller trials and before moving on to bigger ones.
Computers are also having an impact in computer-assisted new drug
applications - known in the sector as Candas.
Traditional dossiers for new drug applications have consisted of thousands
of pages of documents, that have been long to prepare and difficult to read.
The aim of Candas is to submit dossiers on CD-Roms.
One of the first was Ciba's Voltaren, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
used for arthritis. The medicine was submitted electronically after the
company discovered the FDA reviewer was interested in computers. Although
the dossier was well behind many paper-based submissions, it was third on to
the market. Dr Max Wilhelm at Ciba says Canda is the group's prefered way of
preparing dossiers.
The advantage of submitting in electronic format is both internal and
external. Dr Poste says the real advantage of Canda is it allows several
people to interrogate several hundred thick documents simultaneously - which
helps the company and the regulator.
In addition, the company is better placed to respond to the regulators'
questions. 'It's all far less traumatic,' concludes Dr Poste.
'I genuinely believe that the higher quality of information may accelerate
approval from the regulators,' says Dr Leon Rosenberg, president,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute.
There remain problems with Canda. Speaking recently at an London-based IIR
conference DR Don MacLean, regulatory affairs manager in Europe for Syntex,
warned of the problems of incompatible systems among European and US
regulators.
Meanwhile, other companies must adjust internally. 'Our scientists are are
suffering,' laments Prof Gunter Stock, board director in charge of R&amp;D at
Schering,
'They are used to working on paper. People in registration have become
experts over 20 years. Overnight, we can't expect them to become experts in
computers. We certainly can't throw them out. We need young people who are
used to technology but we can't afford both,' he says.

Poised for the big switch-off - Scientists are developing ways to control
genes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL research will be transformed over the next two decades
through the development of drugs that act directly on human genes.
Almost all today's drugs act on proteins, the chemicals that do the work in
every living creature from virus to human. But the rapid expansion of
genetic knowledge makes it possible to target the original cause of trouble
 -the genes that determine exactly which proteins the cells make.
Every week the world's molecular biologists announce the discovery of new
genes associated with human disease. They are not only identifying the
molecular causes of classic inherited disorders, such as cystic fibrosis,
but are also finding unexpected evidence for the way particular genes
trigger the most widespread illnesses of modern society, including forms of
cancer and heart disease.
Scientists have already identified several thousand of the estimated 100,000
genes that make up the whole human genetic blueprint and, working through a
loosely co-ordinated international effort known as the Human Genome Project,
they expect to have decoded the entire 'handbook of man' within 10 years.
At the same time, other scientists are rapidly developing ways to manipulate
the newly discovered genes. More than 30 clinical trials have started within
the past two years, mostly in the US. Some involve gene therapy - inserting
new genes into the patient's cells to produce therapeutic proteins in the
body. Others are testing anti-sense therapy or code blocking - the opposite
process of switching off genes so that they stop making harmful proteins.
These genetic drugs can be aimed either at defective genes in the patient's
own cells or at infectious organisms. They promise cures for diseases that
are hard to treat with existing medicines, from rare inherited blood
disorders and cancer to viral infections. And their specificity should avoid
the side-effects of today's protein-based drugs.
Anti-sense therapy is the more difficult to understand of the two
approaches. It uses a short synthetic strand of nucleotides, the chemical
building blocks of DNA and RNA, to switch off genes. Every gene has two
complementary nucleotide strands, which together form the famous double
helix. The nucleotides in one strand are said to have a 'sense' sequence and
the other an 'anti-sense' sequence.
A synthetic anti-sense strand, known as an oligonucleotide, can be used in
two alternative ways. It may bind to the sense strand of the gene's
double-stranded DNA and produce a triple-stranded structure which switches
off the gene. Alternatively, the oligonucleotide binds to the
single-stranded RNA which the gene generates as a first step to producing
protein; this blocks protein synthesis without permanently inactivating the
gene.
Although a whole gene may have several thousand nucleotide units, anti-sense
drugs are much smaller molecules with 15 to 25 units. This is long enough to
make them completely specific. Each will recognise a specific sequence in
the target gene, without binding to any of the 100,000 other human genes.
Pure oligonucleotides are not suitable for pharmaceutical development
because enzymes would break them down before they reached their targets.
Therefore anti-sense drugs are chemical derivatives, such as
methylphosphonates, which are more stable than natural molecules and better
able to enter cells.
US companies specialising in anti-sense technology include Isis, Genta,
Gilead, Hybridon and TargeTech. Isis, based in California, is carrying out
clinical trials of an anti-sense drug to treat human papilloma virus (which
causes genital warts and cervical cancer) and other targets include viral
diseases such as hepatitis B, Aids and herpes, leukaemia and other cancers
and inflammatory disorders. Genetic MediSyn Corporation, based in Maryland,
even hopes to develop an anti-sense drug against baldness, by blocking the
production of an enzyme that is responsible for hair loss.
A serious problem with anti-sense drugs is delivering them to difficult
sites inside the body. Therefore the first generation products are directed
at the skin or at bone marrow cells removed temporarily from the body. But
the anti-sense companies hope to solve the delivery problem by linking their
drugs to other chemicals which enable them to permeate cells more
effectively.
Oligonucleotides may not be the only means of switching off genes, however.
Various small organic molecules are known to bind to DNA, and Proteus, the
UK molecular design company, has formed a partnership with Genelabs
Technologies of California (called Progene Partners) to develop these into
powerful DNA-binding drugs, as an alternative to anti-sense.
Gene therapy is moving forward even faster than gene blocking. Researchers
at the US National Institutes of Health carried out the first human gene
therapy trial in September 1990 on a girl who had to be kept apart from
other children because one defective gene in her immune system meant that
she had no natural protection against infection. Every month since then she
has received a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells to
which copies of the correct gene had been added (the treatment has to be
repeated because the genetically-engineered cells gradually die). Her immune
defences are now strong enough for her to go to school normally.
That success had led to a flood of proposals for gene therapy experiments in
the US, where the clinical development of genetic medicine is well ahead of
Europe and Japan. And, as with anti-sense, start-up companies are rushing to
exploit the technology. They include Gene Therapy Inc (GTI), Somatix
Therapy, Viagene, Targeted Genetics, Trans-karyotic Therapies and Vical.
Until recently the established pharmaceutical giants had left gene-based
medicine to academic scientists and biotechnology start-ups.
They are now scrambling to catch up, by starting research in-house and
forming alliances with the specialist biotech companies.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo of the UK, says his company did a
survey of five anti-sense companies, looking for a partnership, 'and came to
the conclusion that Gilead was the best of them. Now we have 35 to 40 people
working on this technology and they have another 35 to 40, with a joint
project group to co-ordinate the work.'
Estimates of future sales of genetic drugs are still highly speculative,
though analysts talk of a market running into tens of billions of dollars
within 20 years.

Working together to create new products - Research and development and
marketing departments need to focus resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS research and development costs increase, the need to focus resources
becomes ever greater. 'R&amp;D departments must join the marketing department in
matching scientific expertise with market opportunities,' said Dr Trevor
Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical, UK.
Market pressure on the world's pharmaceutical companies to find effective
new drugs is increasing. According to the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
Association, the US industry is spending some Dollars 12.6bn worldwide on
R&amp;D. To achieve a 15 per cent return on investment, which is the minimum a
company might expect given the risks, a 10 per cent per annum compound
growth in sales (currently Dollars 231bn) is demanded when there is downward
price pressure.
Companies most likely to be long-term winners in an increasingly aggressive
and competitive R&amp;D environment are those with effective R&amp;D management
which can make full use of the new technologies to discover new compounds
and utilise the skills of the marketing department from early stages of the
conception of an idea.
One such company is Wellcome, which believes the success of a pharmaceutical
company depends fundamentally on the quality of its R&amp;D and marketing
activities and the interaction and synergy between them.
The three phases involved in the development of a product, according to Dr
Jones, require good commercial input and this becomes more quantified and
more important as each phase progresses.
A good example of where marketing and R&amp;D can work together is on
5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, said Dr Jones. The lipoxygenase pathway is
generally responsible for inflammatory disorders and is known to be involved
in inflammation, whether it is inflammatory bowel, asthma, allergic
rhinitis, psoriasis and arthritis. Dr Jones questions where the focus is on
such products 'These are all inflammatory conditions so if a drug works here
at an early stage I want the marketing department to focus my attention on
which of these areas is likely to be the one to go for, because, otherwise
it is shotgun therapy.
'That is where I need someone to work with and agree together the focus
beyond the the discovery in the first phase,' he said. 'If it's asthma,
because it's a big pathway, my first task is to go to volunteers to see if
it works. It's then up to me to get to Phase II. That's when I need the
marketing department to give me a design and business case, because I am
going to start spending the Pounds 50m/Pounds 100m.
'The goals have changed considerably in the past five to 10 years,' said Dr
Jones. 'If a drug is not going to make Wellcome more than Pounds 50m by year
three, we are not going to do it.'
Dr Rolf Krebs, chairman of Boehringer Ingelheim and former head of Bayer
R&amp;D, said: 'Boehringer Ingelheim has no problem in choosing compounds. We
are currently in the process of setting up and testing a properly
functioning development process.
'You don't need to go for the big markets any more. You can go for niche
indications. People formerly feared to go into small markets. But it's zero
therapy, you don't know the size of the market. It depends on the economics
of the countries and the severity of the disease. It makes you look at
marketing and development in a different way.'
Dr Krebs points out that the total cost of Dollars 200m includes the
failures divided by the successful. 'You have to realise that if competing
in a highly competitive market you need a high therapeutic standard and need
far more marketing. It takes three to nine years to establish a drug. If you
have a lower therapeutic standard, but a completely new product, you need
less marketing. That may well allow you to be more profitable in niche
markets.
'The changes in technologies opens up niche markets for new drugs and this
may be acceptable in the future. If you have indications with high
therapeutic benefit you can get higher prices, and lower promotional costs.
That could make niches very attractive.'
Boehringer Ingelheim in the future will look at the medical properties of
the compound and then decide what areas they are interested in - it may have
a wide range of compounds. 'I've told the marketing people this could
happen. They have to re-organise themselves because marketing is no longer a
stable function,' said Dr Krebs. 'We may have to jump from indication to
indication'.
The view taken at Ciba-Geigy is that they will work only in areas where
there is an unmet medical need, where there is room for improvement and
where there is internal know-how.
Dr Max Wilhelm and Pierre Douaze, head of pharmaceuticals at Ciba, said: 'We
don't necessarily have to have marketing expertise. If we don't and the
market is really there we can build up expertise. We have a target of
SFr300m by five years for any drug - if not we question the development.'
They said the figure in the US is about Dollars 250m otherwise they will
license out products, especially if it is a product aimed at general
practitioners that would stretch marketing resources.
'At Astra the therapeutic areas were not chosen,' said Dr Claes Wilhelmsson,
executive vice-president of R&amp;D. 'They just developed - the medicine chose
for us. Science leads us. If we have our own competence, we will develop. We
are not going to start up areas which are not in our own field.'
Astra is prepared to adopt areas. Three years ago the company was not in
cancer, but isinto it now. Immuno-suppressors have taken it from the
respiratory field to cancer. 'We look for medicines where there are
therapeutic needs and try to develop completely new ideas rather than me-too
compounds. For example, we haven't developed an ace-inhibitor - we licensed
one in from Hoechst,' he said.

Blockbusters prove worthy - Some of the large pharmaceutical groups are
building up considerable experience in biotech production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST two blockbuster products of biotechnology are beginning to prove
themselves in the pharmaceutical market, almost 20 years after the crucial
discoveries - recom-binant DNA and monoclonal antibodies - that laid the
foundations for the modern biotech industry.
Amgen, based in California, is far ahead of its biotech competitors. Each of
its first two drugs - Epogen launched in 1989 to stimulate red blood cell
production and Neupogen launched in 1991 to boost white blood cells - is
expected to bring in revenues of more than Dollars 500m this year.
According to a forecast released last month by Lehman Brothers' global
healthcare research team, Epogen and Neupogen will be two of the five
'super-blockbuster' drugs in the year 2000 with at least Dollars 2bn sales
(the other three are conventional pharmaceuticals).
Altogether there are a dozen biotech products in the Lehman list of 65 drugs
with 2000 sales above Dollars 500m. 'If our projections hold true, the
decision 10 years earlier of companies like Roche (of Switzerland), which
took an aggressively optimistic view of the opportunities the biotech
approach would present, will be fully justified,' the Lehman analysts say.
Roche represents one extreme of the range of approaches by large
phar-maceutical groups to bio-technology - direct investment in independent
US biotech companies. In 1990 Roche paid Dollars 2.1bn for a majority stake
in California-based Genentech, then the sector's largest company, and it has
minority shareholdings in Chiron and Protein Design Labs. The Swiss group
also has collaborative agreements with several others, including Amgen,
Synergen and Hybridon.
Dr Jurgen Drews, Roche research director, says the policy is to keep
Genentech's research and development (R&amp;D) at arm's length from Roche's, so
as to avoid stifling its entrepreneurial spirit. 'We made it clear to
Genentech that we wanted to collaborate with them but we didn't want to
manipulate them.'
An example of collaborative R&amp;D is DNase, a cystic fibrosis treatment, which
Genentech and Roche are developing for the north American and European
markets resp-ectively. 'We've had to prove our abilities a couple of times
but that has led to a relationship of trust,' Dr Drews says. 'They come to
us with proposals and we go to them. They still have the characteristic
Genentech culture. It takes patience for the two groups to work tog-ether
but it's a lot of fun.'
A similar policy of direct investment in US biotech R&amp;D has been followed by
the other two large Swiss pharma-ceutical groups, Sandoz and, to a lesser
extent, Ciba. Last year, for example, Sandoz paid Dollars 392m for a 60 per
cent stake in SyStemix and announced a long-term agreement to fund Dollars
300m worth of research at Scripps Research Institute - both based in
California.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, the largest UK pharmaceutical
group, agrees that 'it is absolutely critical for a research-based company
to have strong links both with the academic science base and with the
research boutiques that have sprung out of it, particularly in the US'.
But Glaxo's approach to plugging into the biotech industry is quite
different from its Swiss competitors. The UK group has links with eight US
biotech companies including Amylin, Gilead and Icos. The partnerships are
based on limited R&amp;D programmes with specific objectives and generous
incentives for success.
Glaxo's policy is not to put large amounts of money into its biotech
partners nor take control of them.
'I don't agree with the approach of the Swiss companies,' says Dr Sykes.
'The biotech companies have tremendous drive and it is difficult to create
that environment in a pharm-aceutical group. If you buy a large stake in any
of the companies you have killed its spirit.'
Although young companies started with venture capital funding over the past
15 years represent the cutting edge of scientific progress, some of the
large pharmaceutical groups are building up considerable experience in
biotech production. According to a survey of the world biotechnology market
released last month by Datamonitor, the two largest 'biopharm' companies by
sales after Amgen are the insulin manufacturers Eli Lilley of the US and
Novo Nordisk of Denmark. Both sell human insulin produced by genetically
engineered micro-organisms.
Indeed the endocrine (hormone) sector of the pharmaceutical market is where
biotechnology made its first impact. Apart from insulin, the most important
product of this type is human growth hormone produced by genetic
engineering. This has a sales potential far beyond that of its predecessor,
growth hormone extracted from the pituitary glands of corpses, because
supplies are much greater and it avoids the risk of infection associated
with the natural product. The manufacturers - including Genentech, Lilley
and Kabi Pharmacia of Sweden - hope that research will support the hormone's
use beyond growth disorders in children; there is speculation that it could
reverse some of the effects of ageing.
Interferons have not lived up to the 'wonder drug' hype they received in the
late 1970s but they are beginning to make an impact on cancer treatment and
for treating some infections such as hepatitis. Analysts expect alpha
inter-ferons such as Schering Plough's Intron A and Roche's Roferon A to
emerge as blockbuster drugs.
Biotech will make further progress in the anti-cancer and anti-infective
sectors if and when the large number of drugs based on monoclonal
antibodies, now under dev-elopment, reach the market. Antibody-based drugs
may also be very useful for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic
diseases that result from underlying disorders of the immune system.
In the cardiovascular sector, tPA - Genentech's clotbuster launched in 1987
and once expected to be biotech's first blockbuster - has been a commercial
disappointment. Sales failed to take off after large-scale clinical trials
showed that it was no better as a treatment for heart attack victims than
streptokinase, a relatively cheap drug disc-overed in the 1950s.
Biotech has had several other serious disappointments and there are certain
to be many more in the years ahead, as the industry matures. But, as biotech
enthusiasts are fond of pointing out, the total market capitalisation of all
independent biotechnology companies is no greater than that of Merck, the
largest pharmaceutical group.
Of course, their combined R&amp;D pipeline is far more extensive than Merck's
but it remains to be seen whether they have sufficient financial resources,
development expertise, production experience and marketing muscle to outwit
the established giants.

Programmed to make medicines - How scientists are using computers to design
drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATIENTS in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northern England, who started therapy
with the experimental cancer medicine AG-337 last October, are taking part
in what is believed to be the first clinical trial of a drug designed
entirely by computer, from first conception to final molecular structure.
AG-337 is being tested by the UK Cancer Research Campaign on behalf of
Agouron Pharmaceuticals, based in California - one of a small group of young
companies whose main aim is to design drugs by computer. Others include
Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Massachusetts, BioNumerik Pharmaceuticals of
Minnesota and Proteus International, based in the north of England.
All pharmaceutical groups use computers in drug discovery. The principle, in
brief, is to produce a model of a particular target - say, a receptor on a
cell surface - and then design a molecule to fit it as well as possible,
without causing side-effects by interacting with other sites elsewhere in
the body.
But the established companies use molecular modelling as an adjunct to more
traditional methods of screening and chemical synthesis. Their researchers
usually know roughly what sort of molecule they are looking for; they use
the computer to perfect its structure.
'The hardest step in molecular design is the first one: getting an initial
compound to work on,' says Mr Peter Johnson, chief executive of Agouron.
'AG-337 was designed out of the heads of chemists trying out ideas on the
computer, with no prior starting points.'
In its anti-cancer programme, Agouron is concentrating on what its
researchers knew was a viable target: an enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS),
that is required for rapid cell proliferation. An existing cancer drug,
5-fluorouracil, works by inhibiting TS but its use is limited by toxic
side-effects.
As a prelude to molecular modelling, Agouron researchers used an expensive
and painstaking physical process called X-ray crystallography to obtain
three-dimensional images of TS. Then they began to design new molecules
capable of jamming the enzyme's activity by inserting themselves into a
crevice in its structure.
The first exercise was to re-engineer an existing TS inhibitor whose kidney
toxicity had ruled out its clinical application. After the Agouron
researchers had removed the portion of the molecule responsible for its
toxicity, the cut-down compound was 1,000 times less potent at binding TS.
But through repeated cycles of design, synthesis, analysis and redesign -
driven by crystallographic snapshots of drug candidates interacting with TS
 -the researchers succeeded in restoring the original drug's binding power,
without its toxicity. This compound (AG-85) is in clinical trials in
California.
Then the Agouron team took the more radical step of designing from first
principles two TS inhibitors with no chemical precedents. Through a series
of design cycles, the scientists were again able to improve the potency of
the initial prototypes a thousandfold. Both drugs (AG-337 and AG-331) are
now beginning clinical trials.
Agouron's 16-strong protein crystallography group plays a crucial role in
the molecular design process. 'It's not a static system; both the drug
molecule and the protein undergo conformational changes,' says Mr Johnson.
'You have to re-solve the structure every time with a new molecule attached
to it. We have re-solved the structure of TS about 100 times'.
Indeed, the cost and time required to obtain high-resolution X-ray images is
a serious constraint for all molecular design teams. And, as Professor Barry
Robson, science director of Proteus, points out, 'X-ray pictures can be
seriously misleading. If you are working with a very mobile molecule such as
LHRH (a hormone involved in controlling fertility and in fighting cancer)
you have to be very careful to match its movements with your drug.'
For large biological molecules such as antibodies, X-ray crystallography is
even more difficult and time-consuming. Indeed, Professor Tony Rees of Bath
University says the world's crystallographers publish only two or three
antibody structures a year and 'there are only 14 structures in the (public)
database, compared to the 1bn structures possible in the immune system.'
To get round the problem, Prof Rees has worked with Oxford Molecular to
produce a modelling program for antibodies of unknown structure. Starting
with the primary (amino acid) sequence, the AbM program predicts the 3D
structure with an accuracy that Prof Rees says is at least as good as a
'moderate resolution X-ray structure'. This is good enough for a
pharmaceutical company that needs to design a 'humanised antibody' from a
mouse antibody.
Although what really matters in molecular design is the computational
software and hardware behind the computer screens, 'visualisation is
extremely important,' says Mr Johnson of Agouron. 'I've been in the field
long enough to remember what it was like without any graphics, when you just
had wire models of a protein. The visual image gives you real insight.'
Agouron has a molecular auditorium at its San Diego headquarters, in which
30 to 40 people can see 3D molecular images on a big screen.
Soon, drug designers will be able to use virtual reality technology to work
from inside those 3D images. VR helmets will give the illusion of walking
through the screen of a graphics computer and being surrounded by molecules.
It will be possible to pick up images of atoms and rearrange them in new
chemical patterns by moving the head and manipulating a hand-held device.
A prototype system - the result of a joint project by York University,
Glaxo, IBM and specialist VR developer Division - was unveiled last year.
'The sheer quality of change that you experience as you move into three
dimensions is difficult to describe,' said project director Dr Rod Hubbard
of York University. 'Even though the image you see in VR is still crude
compared with the high-resolution computer graphics we normally use, this is
in many ways compensated by being able both to move easily around the image
and to interact directly with the molecular model through natural head and
arm movements.'
Eventually, said Dr Peter Murray-Rust of Glaxo, scientists might be able to
'experience' biological molecules such as proteins instead of having to
'learn' them from two-dimensional books.
