<TEXT>
How much of a threat to the government and country do you consider the
recent violence from extremists?
From what I read in the western media, if I did not live here, I would say
the country is collapsing. Look, the problem we have, I consider, is very
normal. It is not a threat to the regime, as mentioned by the Iranians and
their followers. The nature of the Egyptians is completely different from
the Iranians. When I read the newspapers outside, I feel you are all living
in another atmosphere. These bombings are happening everywhere. How many
bombs occur in London in one week? It is something unusual in Egypt, which
made all the media concentrate on it.
But surely it is worse than it has been in the past?
It is worse because these elements who are here - they use the word Islam
but they have no idea about it - they are being pushed by some elements.
These people were in Afghanistan. They were earning a lot of money there
under the Mujahedeen. After that problem came to an end, some elements went
to Pakistan, in Peshawar, where there is a collection of extremists from all
countries who wanted to destabilise countries. They were persuaded by the
Iranians now, and mainly the Iranians, who are giving them a small amount of
money. They are pushing them to destabilise the regimes in their countries.
Most of them returned from Afghanistan, from Pakistan, to Iran where they
were briefed how to make problems, then to Sudan. From Sudan via Libya they
started coming here. And the intelligence people here know them by name.
They know their histories. We were watching them at that time. Then they
started making explosions. At the beginning for us it was shocking.
There has been some criticism about the vigour with which the security
forces have been rooting out extremists. Do you think they have been
heavy-handed?
Not to that extent. The police will react and they have some criminals using
machine guns against them. You are killing me. You are shooting me. You are
throwing bombs against me. Do you think that the police will tell them
'hello' and give them a cup of tea and a gateau? The police at the beginning
never used machine guns. But when several police were killed, they started
being very conscious of defending themselves. But there is a big
exaggeration about this. The extremists are much more violent than the
police.
Will it take long to reach another deal with the IMF and the World Bank?
What progress do you expect to make on privatisation?
They are discussing everything now, and I think there will be no problems.
We are focusing our talks on privatisation with the World Bank. But you in
Britain, did you make privatisation overnight? We are making privatisation
on a gradual basis.
Some argue that progress is too gradual.
At the start, when we thought of privatisation, the people were furious.
Because they are not used to this, they think that when this transfer of
companies in the public sector to the private sector comes, they are going
to lose jobs, they are going to lose money.
When people have gone through the privatisation, the people will find that
we are not bluffing them, and the acceleration will be much more. We have to
consider the psychological aspect of the people, or we will face a setback.
How important is it for the government to address the poorer areas and
unemployment, as a potential breeding ground for extremism?
When I took office I had lots of problems economically. We were just about
to collapse. The economic problems were terrible. So we started a programme
for reform, and it took a long time to convince the people.
And I cannot solve all the problems at once. We have so many rural areas
around Cairo, for example. And we made plans to modernise here, put in
facilities and services for them, but it takes billions and billions of
dollars.
I have also insisted on putting factories in Upper Egypt - even though all
the people in Upper Egypt want to make factories in Lower Egypt - in
Alexandria and near Cairo. I am pushing them. I am making new cities in the
desert in Upper Egypt. It's the best way of making sure they have some
advantages, to make the factories there.
In the past 10 years we have built 2m flats. These flats were not built in
the previous 30 years, 40 years. We are doing the maximum.
Telephones - when I took office we had only half a million lines, three
hundred thousand of them were dead. If you wanted to telephone from
Heliopolis to Cairo, it was quicker to get in a car, or walk. In the past 10
years we've made 2.5m lines. From anywhere in Egypt you can contact Japan,
the United States, Saudi Arabia.
Roads? We've built 30,000km, paved 15,000km. I'm just telling you about the
problems we've met and what it cost us to solve them. I can't go through
every affected area - electricity, communications, infrastructure, sewage .
. .
It's cost us money. To make reforms you need money. Our revenues are
limited. If we had money, we could have done it before.
What political lessons did you learn from the recent Algerian experience?
I was expecting it before it took place. I was following the news all over
the world, every day. I spoke with the former president of Algeria a year
before the crisis took place, and I told him that religious problems in our
part of the world are dangerous, so be careful. And I was advising him very
sincerely, because I was watching everything that was happening there.
Do you know what he told me? The FIS should be active. I cannot do anything.
Either full democracy, full freedom, or nothing. I didn't speak any more
words with him.
One week before the crisis took place I was in the bookfair at a seminar.
One of the journalists asked me: what do you expect in Algiers? I smelt that
something was going to happen.
But believe me, this will not last long. I don't think these elements will
take over. The Algerians are very tough and they are trying to defeat all
these things in the country, but it will take some time. There is no
comparison between what happened in Algeria and in Egypt. Never think of
comparing that. We have completely different characters, different thinking,
completely different people.
How long do you think it will take to eradicate the problem in Egypt?
The problems we have here? A couple of months. We hope, I hope.
You have taken steps since becoming president to liberalise political life
here, with political parties and elections. Are you planning greater steps
along that road?
I made one step for the professional associations, to increase the base of
elections. They became furious. The small groups, the religious groups in
these associations. We started this law because so many university
professors were criticising the law that was giving the rights to these
small groups to speak in the name of thousands and thousands in the
associations.
Their association has 140,000 members, but those who vote for the election
of the chairman? Three or four thousand. It is impossible, and these
professors were furious.
For me it was astonishing. I told them, do you want the government to do
something for you? Why don't you go for your elections? If you want
anything, the government is not going to do anything. You go to the
parliament.
They made a proposal to the parliament. Elections need 50 per cent turnout
in the first round, then 33 per cent for the next round. It's a democratic
law. Some people have called it repressive. Repressive? We would like the
representatives to represent the majority. Democracy is the rule of the
majority. It's not the rule of the minority.
Do you have any intention of naming a vice president?
First, naming the vice president does not mean he is going to be elected as
president. Leave the people to say who will be the next president, not me.
If I could find a figure, a political figure. It is very difficult to find
the person.
If I could find someone to fit the job of vice president I would be very
pleased to name somebody else to help me. The problem is, we have so many
good people, but the vice-president needs special qualifications. When I
find somebody with these qualifications I'd love him to take the job.
What would be the qualities necessary for someone to be a suitable candidate
for vice president?
Sincere. A hard worker. To have a conception of democracy, and not say,
whenever anything happens, 'Oh, we'll put them in jail' - which is the easy
way. Someone who is patient.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (16): A heritage worthy of world attention -
A look at the threat to Cairo's architectural remnants of centuries of power
and glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RODENBECK

<TEXT>
Tourists who want to see Cairo's medieval quarters had better hurry.
In the golden days before 1939, when Egypt still had grand hotels and a
Season that ran from October to May, the main attraction for foreign
visitors was not pharaonic monuments or Red Sea beaches, but the Egyptian
climate and the city of Cairo.
Nearly all tourists were Northern Europeans or Americans; and many spent
their entire winter in Egypt; well-heeled refugees from the cold, damp and
darkness of winter-time London or New York.
The experienced traveller might then move on to Luxor and Aswan. On November
10 of each year Thomas Cook &amp; Son's famous paddle steamer Arabia would
depart from Cairo, inaugurating the first of its 20-day cruises upstream to
Aswan and back.
For visitors who wanted more time to loll under Nubian sun, Thomas Cook
maintained a fleet of seven private steamers, four sail-powered dahabiyyahs,
and the slow sternwheeler Thebes, which would leave Cairo on November 17,
taking two full weeks to arrive at Aswan. There most passengers would stay
on in the Cataract Hotel for an additional week or two before making an
equally leisurely return cruise back downstream to Cairo.
When Thomas Cook's last steamer left Aswan - always on March 23 - the Upper
Egyptian season ended. By March 31 the most famous hotels in both Luxor and
Aswan would have closed down and would not reopen until the middle of the
following November.
In Cairo the season was much longer. The Mena House received guests from
October 15 to May 15; and though the famous roof terrace at the Semiramis
was open only from November 20 to April 20, the hotel itself actually
operated all year round, as did Shepheard's, the Continental, the Savoy, and
the Heliopolis Palace. Night life, designed for the young and rich, was
strenuous.
Apart from its glamorous social life, Cairo's main prewar attraction was its
picturesque historic zone: the ramshackle medieval quarters that have formed
the physical and the moral core of the city and have given it a unique
architectural identity.
It contains most of the remarkable remnants of those centuries of power and
glory, between AD 642 and 1517, when Cairo grew into the largest city in the
world west of China, with a high street 13 kilometres long. What is left is
still an area larger than Venice, though much of it is ruinous and nearly
all of it is given over to slums.
Hundreds of monumental buildings, however, most of them intact to a striking
degree, still line thoroughfares laid out in the 14th century at the latest.
From 1881 until the Egyptian revolution of 1952 these individual buildings
were looked after by a Comite de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe,
which worked effectively within the international norms of the period,
Meanwhile the Cairo governorate remained responsible for infrastructure,
while the Ministry of Awqaf (Mortmain Endowments) held the deeds to most of
the buildings.
After Hitler's war, however, the historic zone seems to have been virtually
forgotten by everyone except the Comite and the people who actually lived
there. Tourism returned to Egypt very slowly - no important new hotel was
built in Cairo between 1910 and 1959 - without recovering the impetus
supplied before the war by chic. The jet set and the Beautiful People passed
Egypt by.
Meanwhile the nature of tourism itself had changed. The historic zone now
sees only a few foreign visitors every year, mostly either low-budget strays
or architectural experts with particular objectives.
Under the Revolution the Comite was dissolved. Its responsibilities were
vested in the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation (EAO), which admits that,
until 1979, it has done badly by both the area and its monuments
That year the EAO requested at last that the entire zone be added to
Unesco's World Heritage list; and official attention has been given to it
intermittently since. Between 1983 and 1988, for example, it had the EAO's
top priority. Several important projects were carried out, with considerable
co-operation from the governorate, though little was done to upgrade
infrastructure.
Outstanding among its monuments are the mosques and religious schools built
by great patrons between the 7th century AD and the beginning of the 20th
century.
But there are also palaces, caravanserais, apartment blocks, workshops, and
plenty of bustling markets, often no more than wide places in the road,
where merchants of all kinds - stall keepers, hawkers, tradeswomen -
foregather, Oriental-style, to sell specific wares.
It is these vivifying parts of the city that provide the symbolic settings
in the Cairo novels of Egypt's Nobel prize-winner, Naguib Mahfouz.
The country's pharaonic monuments, a non-renewable resource, are now
routinely surrendered to the requirements of package tourism. Rescued from
oblivion only by the heroic labours of generations of Egyptologists during
the past 150 years, they are being exploited quickly and thoroughly.
Conservation efforts cannot keep pace with the casual destruction that
results from massive continuous human presence.
The ministries of culture and tourism would undoubtedly be delighted to herd
the same foreign multitudes into the medieval monuments of Cairo. For better
or worse, however, Cairo's historic zone is immune to such treatment.
Some of its narrow streets have at last been blocked off to vehicular
traffic. Walking is now quieter, as well as safer and easier. Parking
remains limited, however, and there is no room for package-tour buses except
in approach areas on distant peripheries.
Sanitary conditions generally leave so much to be desired that they are
driving out even the native residents. As the population has diminished,
derelicts have been left behind - the mentally and physically handicapped
are much in evidence - to deepen and confirm official disdain of the
populace.
Government attitudes typically have had less to do with resolution to
improve matters than with a sense of shame, regardless of what aesthetes
might say about historical pride or architectural beauty. Such attitudes are
demonstrated everywhere, in neglect and obvious decay.
But liveliness, charm, and a rich variety of visual delights are still
available in plenty for the visitor willing to take very little trouble; a
three-hour walk through the city's medieval heart is the same exhilarating
experience it must have been six decades or six centuries ago.
How much longer the experience will continue to be available is somewhat
problematic. On October 12 1992 at 3.14 pm an earthquake centred more than
50 kilometres to the south west hit Cairo. Measuring 5.9 on the Richter
scale, it lasted 20 seconds and wrought extensive destruction in villages
near the epicentre.
In Cairo itself a few recently built apartment blocks collapsed, some during
the main shock, others in the course of the next several days. But all the
city's medieval monuments which had remained standing before the earthquake,
survived.
Of the most vulnerable parts of monumental structures - minarets - only one
collapsed. Damage ranged from displaced brass or copper finials or lost
portions of upper storeys, to serious destabilisation of lower sections.
Only one dome fell. Old cracks in walls widened; many new ones appeared.
Confused spokesmen finally agreed that 174 medieval monuments had officially
suffered damage.
The worst of it had been prophesied a dozen years earlier by Professor Ron
Lewcock of Cambridge, a leading expert on the restoration and conservation
of medieval Islamic buildings, then acting for Unesco as adviser to the EAO.
The street he had pinpointed as the most dangerously dilapidated in Cairo
had been allowed to become a main artery for heavy traffic. Medieval
buildings already declared unsafe had thus been additionally pounded by the
passage of buses and lorries day and night for a decade.
After the earthquake the EAO was quick to make dramatic gestures. Dozens of
monuments are now theatrically screened in scaffolding and repairs are being
made throughout the historic zone. At least 10 private contractors,
including Osman Ahmed Osman and Hassan Allam, the largest in Egypt, have
been hired by the EAO to carry out repairs. Several foreign agencies have
joined them, believing that now might be the time to galvanise both the EAO
and the Cairo governorate into effective long term action to preserve this
heritage.
But none of these firms, agencies, governments or government bureaux has
announced any large-scale long-term programme.
For reasons never made clear, the historic zone was specifically excluded
from the city's Wastewater Masterplan, implemented since 1979 with Dollars
10bn worth of foreign aid. Most experts believe that unless the historic
zone is properly drained it is futile to pour money into restoration.
An international conference on the historic zone will be held in Cairo in
June. This may have some influence over its fate. There are important
elements in the government, however, whose idea of preserving the heritage
is to create a kind of Islamo-Disneyland.
Some signs give cause for unease. In February and March this year the Cairo
governorate used bulldozers to destroy the stands of bouquinistes in
Azbakkyah and al-Azhar, where they had long been an essential part of
traditional Cairene culture. And plans have been unveiled to remove the Bab
al-Nasr cemetery, an historic graveyard immediately in front of the two
northern gates of the 11th century enclosure of Al-Qahirah, from which Cairo
takes its name.
This graveyard provided not only the setting for the last half of Mahfouz's
1960 novel, The Thief and the Dogs, but also a last resting place for Badr
al-Gamali (died 1094 AD), the great general who built the two gates; for the
historians Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) and Maqrizi (1364-1442); and for John
Lewis Burckhardt (1784-1817), the Anglo-Swiss explorer-ethnographer -
together with thousands of other less celebrated folk. Once it is gone, and
development on its site begins, ambitions for the rest of the historic zone
may change radically.
Land values have already begun to rocket. In one recent court case involving
an important site, the EAO's argument for protection on the basis of current
law was rejected in favour of a developer's right to do what he likes.
Doctor Rodenbeck lectures at the American University in Cairo. He is the
chairman of the Society for the Preservation of the Architectural Resources
of Egypt and has lived in Cairo for 25 years.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (14): Some plans may see the light of day -
Environment priorities are population control followed by water, water,
water - and water
</HEADLINE>

The Helwan cement works is one of the bleakest legacies left to Egypt by the
late President Nasser. A sprawling jumble of pipes, chimneys and tips, it
creates a grotesque fug stretching 20km along the road south of Cairo -
streets, trees and residents cloaked in a fine white dust.
Little has been done to reduce emissions from the cement works, in spite of
a commitment from the government to 'do something,' and the existence of
several willing overseas donors. Like many environmental abuses in Egypt,
grand talk and large sums of money precede action by a long way.
Not all of Egypt's environmental problems are as visible as Helwan.
Unfortunately, many are even more pressing.
Mr Ahmed Abdel-Gawaad, an academic who specialises in environmental
pollution, says Egypt's priorities as far as the environment is concerned
are firstly population control, followed by water, water, water and water.
'What we do to the Nile today, we will pay one hundred times more in 10
years,' says Mr Gawaad, who despairs of the government's grandiose action
plan to clean up the environment, published last year.
He criticises it for being a document designed to attract international
donors, rather than a coherent strategy to tackle Egypt's environmental
problems from the bottom upwards.
Nonetheless, it is an impressive piece of work, covering everything from
degradation of natural resources to protection of Egypt's cultural heritage.
It describes Egypt's growing population and natural resources as being on 'a
collision course.'
'There is a growing concern that the very limited water resources are
becoming increasingly polluted because of the excessive and improper use of
the resource, and that the nation will have to bear heavy costs in terms of
health and productivity of its population, unless action is taken to improve
resource management,' says the report.
Some of the government's plans may see the light of day after June, when a
new environmental action law is scheduled to be passed. The law will lay out
the powers and functions of the environmental affairs agency , answerable to
the prime minister. Meanwhile, some Dollars 400m has been pledged by a
variety of donors for different projects.
The action plan identifies four main areas, all of which should be tackled
to a greater of lesser degree over the next five years.
Land and water resources: The Nile provides more than 95 per cent of Egypt's
water requirements, but untreated urban and industrial effluent is
endangering the health of the hundreds of thousands of people who depend on
it. Meanwhile, soil salinisation and water logging are affecting the
productivity of agricultural land. The government says that water pollution
is contaminating drinking water sources, encouraging the growth of
pathogenic bacteria and parasites and contaminating fish and other food
products.
Air pollution: According to the action plan, the emission of pollutants into
the air, particularly in the Cairo and Alexandria regions, has reached a
level at which serious health problems occur.
The number of vehicles in the greater Cairo area, for example, has increased
by 10 per cent a year since 1980.
The plan singles out Helwan as one of four areas with the worst air
pollution in Egypt. The efficiency of air pollution control equipment is,
the action plan report says, generally questionable.
Solid waste management: Rubbish collection in Egypt is haphazard. In high
and middle-income areas, collection rates are higher because of the greater
value of the actual waste, while in poor areas there is often no collection
at all. As the report says: 'The lack of an adequate management system
creates a large risk for spread of infectious, parasitic and epidemic
diseases, through people involved in the collection of the waste, children
playing in the streets and scavengers making their living on the dumpsites.'
There is as yet no system for disposing of hospital waste. This ends up,
along with everything else, on the communal tips.
Protecting Egypt's heritage: The government is concerned that earnings from
tourism will not be sustained if inappropriate developments degrade the
initial attractions. These would include not only the ancient monuments of
the Nile Valley, but also the precious coral reefs of the Red Sea.
Attached to each of these areas is a list of specific - and less specific -
proposals. Some, such as reducing subsidies on harmful pesticides, should be
relatively easy to implement. Others - developing air emission policies and
'methods of enforcing them' - might take longer.
The biggest frustration for Mr Tarek Genena, director of the Technical
Co-operation Office for the Environment, is that everything takes too long.
'We always end up with studies, plans and so on, but there is not enough
implementation. There is a great need for co-ordination between the
international and national efforts,' he says, adding that duplication of
studies and no central system of information mean that every time the
environmental affairs agency wants to embark on a new project, it has to
'reinvent the wheel'. Mr Genena says that an agreement with the Overseas
Development Agency to set up a documentation centre will move things in the
right direction.
International donors are interested in backing about 40 priority projects -
many to prevent discharge of industrial waste into the Nile. Donors involved
are the World Bank, Denmark's Danida, the EC and other European governments.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (15): Commitment to peace is at the core -
The Arab-Israeli conflict still dominates foreign affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Sadat could not have been aware when he travelled to Israel in
1977, of the extent to which he was anticipating the realignment of
international relations in the Middle East.
While the peace treaty effectively denied the possibility of the Arab
confrontation states going to war again against Israel, it was the collapse
of the Soviet Union which confirmed the necessity of making peace. Gone are
the days when superpower rivalry could be used as a lever in foreign
relations.
The necessity of establishing a rapport with the US is nowhere more evident
than in the changed attitude of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, once the
most hawkish of Israel's enemies and bitter opponent of Mr Sadat, now a man
praised by President Clinton for his positive approach to the Middle East
peace process and once more a visitor to Cairo.
Gone, too, are the days when the foreign ministry in Cairo was scarely able
to stifle its frustration at the lack of consultation and controversial
policy initiatives of the country's president.
Mr Amr Moussa, the present foreign minister, is reputed to be one of Mr
Mubarak's most trusted associates - and Egypt can but benefit
internationally from the presence of Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, a former
minister of state, at the UN - and of Dr Abdel Meguid, a former foreign
minister, as the head of the Arab League.
What remains at the core of Egyptian policy is its relationship with the US
and the desire to see the Middle East peace process succeed. Mr Mubarak
emphasised in an interview with the Financial Times both his total
commitment to help bring peace to the region and his belief that on the
issue of aid the US should treat Egypt no less well than Israel.
Securing President Clinton's support for a continuation of the annual
Dollars 2.1bn in civil and military aid from the US had to be the primary
objective of Mr Mubarak's visit to Washington earlier this month. In return,
Egypt seeks to promote itself as a strategic partner, the most reliable Arab
ally, and a persuasive force for moderation in the peace process.
Egypt's strategic value was proved during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis when Mr
Mubarak, angered by President Saddam Hussein's personal deceit about Iraqi
intentions, moved with uncharacteristic haste to support, politically and
militarily, the Allied effort to liberate Kuwait. But Egypt, along with most
other Arab governments, is increasingly concerned about the longer-term
political consequences for Iraq of the international boycott and the two air
exclusion zones which threaten to divide the country into three.
At present that concern is being expressed primarily in humanitarian terms.
Mr Mubarak and foreign ministry officials stress the need to limit the
suffering imposed on the Iraqi people as a result of their leader's actions.
They argue that Egypt has legitimate interests in Iraq through the presence
there of between 800,000 and 1m Egyptians, even though many of them have
taken Iraqi nationality.
There is no question yet of any formal resumption of diplomatic relations,
but there are regular contacts at official level. Maintaining Iraq's
territorial integrity is viewed in Cairo as an essential bulwark in
restraining the ambitions of Iran, especially in the south of the country
where most Shias live and where Tehran might hope to exert the greatest
influence.
Foreign ministry officials are rather more reticent, however, about the
extent to which Iran may be seeking to destabilise Egypt, one of Mr
Mubarak's most repeated themes before and during his visit to the US.
Officials prefer to say that relations with Iran will be frozen at the
present non-ambassadorial level until Tehran again speaks with a single,
authoritative voice. It is also largely accepted in Cairo that the idea of
Egypt and Syria joining the six countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council
for the defence of Kuwait - the so-called six-plus-two arrangement - is not
viable.
Instead, what may be re-emerging is the Arab Military Industries
Organisation, a body set up in the mid-1970s whereby the Gulf countries
invested in armaments manufacturing in Egypt.
The arrangement collapsed, amid mutual recrimination and arguments over
money, after Mr Sadat's peace overtures to Israel. But Kuwait has now
expressed interest in reviving the project.
The main foreign policy focus, however, remains the Arab-Israeli peace
process, which has been given a renewed imperative in Egyptian eyes by the
extent to which radical Islamic groups are gaining ground in the occupied
territories and more generally in the region.
As the only Arab leader who speaks openly to the Israelis, Mr Mubarak is
able to act as both conciliator and conduit, but with all parties also able
to have direct contact with the US Administration it is also a role which
has clear limitations. Where Egypt's experience is of considerable value is
in the tactics of negotiating with Israel.
As the only Arab country to have successfully concluded negotiations with
Israel, senior Egyptians who took part in that process provide regular
advice to the four Arab delegations in Washington on how best to proceed.
Officials in Cairo are convinced that the principles of an Israel-Syria
agreement on the Golan Heights are almost in place, and the key issues to be
resolved are now primarily technical - that is, the timing of Israel's
withdrawal, the security arrangements to be put in place, and the parallel
moves Syria will make in normalising relations.
Far more difficult is the Palestinian issue. But if Israel can be persuaded
to table again the full agreement on interim autonomy (negotiated between
the Egyptians and Israel at Camp David in 1978), the peace process could be
given a significant lift.
Mr Mubarak has been notably complimentary about Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister; an acknowledgement of the belief in Cairo that he may be the
best chance the Arabs have of winning an agreement and that, as the
president put it, the last train for peace may be about to depart.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (13): Fewer children mean a better life - A
look at the progress of the government's family planning programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a large, shabby room in old Cairo's Zeinhom district, a small gathering
of headscarfed women is waiting to see Dr Mawaheb El-Mouelhy.
'There is no excuse for not using birth control in Egypt,' says Dr
El-Mouelhy, who has been running the family planning clinic since 1986.
'Anyone who wants it, can get it.'
Certainly the Egyptian government has been very active in promoting family
planning since 1985 when the National Population Council was established.
A blunt television campaign tells women that fewer children will mean a
better life. On street corners, billboards urge parents to content
themselves with two babies. There has been assistance too, from the Grand
Mufti, Egypt's highest authority on Islamic jurisprudence. In a pamphlet
entitled 'Birth Planning and the Religious Point of View,' he declared that
family planning did not contradict the teachings of Allah.
The NPC has an office in every region of the country. Under a programme
sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development, Egypt
has been flooded with highly subsidised intra-uterine devices (IUDs).
The official figures are impressive. Total births per year have dropped from
1.92m in 1988 to 1.65m last year. The birth rate has fallen from 39.8 per
1,000 in 1985 to 29.9 per 1000. The contraceptive prevalence rate - women of
child-bearing age using contraception - has risen from 24.2 per cent at the
beginning of the 1980s to 47.6 per cent at the beginning of this decade.
Unfortunately these figures cannot mask the fact that the total population
is increasing by over 1m a year, and that at current rates it will take only
30 years for it to double to 114m.
The Egyptian Gazette, an English language daily, poured scorn on the
official population statistics earlier this month. It quoted from a report
which put the total population about 2m higher than the official count of
56.434m. In spite of efforts by the government and aid agencies, Egypt's
heavily burdened resources are coming under too much pressure - 98 per cent
of the population live on 4 per cent of the land. A short drive out of Cairo
along the Nile is enough to see how crowded the thin strips of green either
side of the river have become.
Dr Sobhi Abdel-Hakim, professor of population studies at Cairo University,
says that the government's target is to reach a total fertility rate of 2
per cent, at which point the population would be replacing itself. He
believes this can be achieved by the year 2025, but the areas outside Cairo
and Alexandria continue to present an enormous challenge.
Statistics culled from the rural communities of upper Egypt are
significantly less impressive than those from the big cities - tradition and
lack of resources combine to hinder the progress of the campaign. One aid
official pointed out that the proportion of women of childbearing age using
contraception - to over 40 per cent since methods of birth control became
easily accessible - reflects a demand that was already there.
'These are the women who wanted to use contraception but never had access,'
he says. 'It is going to take a much greater effort, and much more
investment in information campaigns, to persuade those who are reluctant.'
Although the NPC is represented in every governorate of Egypt, Dr Maher
Mahran, chairman of the NPC, says that doctors - female doctors in
particular - are reluctant to work outside the big towns. The government is
trying to reach rural communities with mobile units, but low resources mean
that the effort is very stretched.
The biggest block to progress in rural areas remains poverty. Dr Mouelhy
tells the story of Zeinab, in her late thirties, pregnant for the tenth
time. Zeinab and her husband, a farmer, were proud of it; they told Dr El
Mouelhy that one more child meant two more helping hands.
Poor education - especially education of women - and the tradition of
marrying young is also widespread. Dr Mouelhy, who sees up to 40 women a day
at the Cairo clinic, says it is unusual to meet a woman of 20, particularly
in rural areas, who has not already had a child.
Girls usually leave school at 11 and are often married by 14, although the
legal minimum age for marriage is 16. Moreover, parents tend to keep
reproducing until a son has been born.
There are also fears that the rise of Islamic fundamentalism will work
against government and aid agency efforts to bring down the birth rate.
Although the Grand Mufti has spoken in favour of family planning, some imams
have been preaching against it in local mosques.
'The feminist movement is going downhill here,' says Dr Mouelhy. 'We were
the pioneers of the movement in the Middle East, but now it is going
backwards.'
While the government is committed to the work of the NPC - scarcely a speech
passes President Hosni Mubarak's lips without some reference to the problem
of population growth - those in the field feel the government should do more
to promote the cause. About a quarter of the funds spent on family planning
in Egypt comes from the government, but about 25 per cent of it is in kind,
through air time on television and radio.
'Mubarak doesn't put his money where his mouth is,' says one aid official.
'The government doesn't provide enough of a budget to the population council
so it can't be as effective as it should be.'
He worries that the increase in the contraception prevalence rate is
artificial, and that the moment USAID stops providing IUDs, it will drop
back.
Although Dr Mahran is pleased with the progress of the NPC's work, he
remains outspoken about the lack of funds. 'The most serious issue is time,'
he says. 'The clock is ticking in Egypt and each time you postpone a project
by just six months, you lose a lot. We have reached a critical stage.'
Back at the Zeinhom clinic, Dr Mouelhy reflects that when she started work
there in 1986, she rarely saw a woman seeking contraception after just one
child.
'The traditional belief that a woman's only job is to produce children is
still strong here,' she says. 'But we now see women who want to spread out
their families, or take a break from pregnancy, and it gives me such a
thrill to see women and children in good health.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (12): Cairenes reluctant to move - Emma
Tucker visits a city more successful economically than socially
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER

<TEXT>
ORIENTAL Weavers, the Egyptian carpets company, is having a good year.
At recent international trade fairs, Omar Sharif accompanied sales
representatives to promote a new range of carpets named after the Arabian
film-star; in Egypt, 7-minute long advertisements run regularly on
television. The company's success is reflected in its palatial factory in
10th of Ramadan, a satellite industrial town 55 kilometres outside Cairo.
From the walls of the show room, a carpet of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's
president, peers down on the Sharif range - Lara, Russian Shawl, Lawrence
and Arabian Nights, among others. Most of these and the other carpets
manufactured by Oriental Weavers are destined for overseas.
The company is one of the most successful industries in the relatively new
city called 10th of Ramadan - in memory of the war with Israel. It was
established in the 1970s to encourage investment and help depopulate Cairo.
Since then, more than 500 companies have come to the city, including
furniture makers, heavy industry and pharmaceuticals companies. Other
ventures are under way.
Many have been successful; the total output of the city is now more than
EPounds 3,000m (Dollars 900m) a year, with one-third of the total production
exported. Most of the city's businesses are privately owned, mainly by
Egyptians, although joint ventures with foreign companies account for about
a third.
Overseas investors have brought in more than EPounds 1,000m (Dollars 300m)
with much of the capital flowing from Saudi Arabia. The US, Syria, and
Kuwait have also invested.
The general verdict on 10th of Ramadan, some 20 years on, is that while it
has succeeded in attracting industry and creating jobs, it has not worked so
well as a social experiment.
The air is cleaner, the roads wide and the apartments modern. Most of the
city's employees are offered either free, or highly subsidised accommodation
by their companies. But Cairenes have been reluctant to relocate, apparently
preferring life in the ramshackle streets of the capital. Estimates of the
number of people living in 10th of Ramadan are hard to come by, but the
number quoted most often is 100,000. The city's capacity, however, is for up
to 400,000 and lines of newly built apartments and villas stand empty.
Most of the companies operating there have to bus part of their workforce
from Cairo and the Delta. Attracting labour is easy, because average wages
are significantly higher than those in state-run industries.
At Oriental Weavers, the average wage for production line workers, including
incentives, is EPounds 500. The Egyptian International Pharmaceutical
Industries (Eipico), which employs 1,400 at its factory in 10th of Ramadan,
has an average starting pay for workers of about EPounds 250.
Incentives for companies to come to 10th of Ramadan include a 10 year tax
holiday - which can be extended if enterprises undertake further investment
 -cheap land, cheap labour and, after teething problems, relatively easy
access to essential infrastructure such as telephone lines.
The drawbacks remain the same as those for most companies operating in
Egypt. Import tariffs in particular continue to reduce competition. Mr
Haisam Mohamed Jameel, a representative of the Gromex furniture company,
whose initial EPounds 2m investment in 1980 has grown to EPounds 10m, says
the reduction of tariffs would help him compete more successfully in the
international market.
'Importing raw materials such as wood, which we don't have, is a real
problem because the import tariffs are very high,' he says. But he benefits
from the heavy protection the furniture industry enjoys.
The problem of attracting residents remains. Mr Mohamed Khairy Taha,
financial director of Eipico, which has been operating in 10th of Ramadan
since 1985, says the reluctance of workers to move to the city reflects
Egyptian conservatism. 'Egyptians do not shift easily. They don't like to
leave their families.'
None the less he is confident that in another 10 years the city will be
self-generating. 'Ten years ago you would have been afraid to move here. Now
there are schools, supermarkets and sports facilities.'
Aid agencies give other reasons for the failure of 10th of Ramadan to
attract higher numbers. Transport between the city and Cairo is patchy,
making it difficult for families to stay in contact. The city authorities
were slow to develop social infrastructure such as schools and parks.
Furthermore, unlike in Cairo, there are few opportunities for younger
members of families to hustle for business during the day.
But A new park is about to open near the middle of the town and a sports
centre is under construction. Each area of the city has a mosque and there
is a church to serve resident coptic Christians.
And Mr Mohamed Farid Khamis, chairman of the Oriental Weavers Group, is
building a sumptuous-looking villa on the outskirts of town.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (11): The wrong sort of shooting - Attacks
on tourists have damaged tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This had been billed as a record breaking year. The tourism ministry had
pencilled-in possible receipts of Dollars 4bn from an expected 4m visitors
for the 1992/93 season, at least Dollars 1bn better than the year earlier.
The private sector was more bullish. 'The whole industry was shooting for
Dollars 5bn this year,' says Mr Taher el-Sharif, secretary general of the
Egyptian Businessmen's Association.
But, as any media watcher knows only too well for the tourism ministry's
liking, Egypt's tourism industry this year saw the wrong sort of shooting.
A bomb at the pyramids, one outside the Egyptian museum, a tourist shot dead
in Upper Egypt, two foreigners killed in a cafe bomb in downtown Cairo and
other attacks on tourist targets have devastated business.
Estimates vary of the damage done to the industry by the extremist Gama'a
al-Islamiyya's campaign - which aims to undermine the government by
attacking vital tourist trade earnings.
Mr Fouad Sultan, the tourism minister, reckons trade to be a fifth down on
last year, when 3m visitors poured in Dollars 3.2bn worth of business. By
the end of this year, he says, Egypt may have forfeited Dollars 700m in
potential revenues.
Others are gloomier, and suggest that business since Christmas has been
running at half last year's levels.
Some Cairo hotels in March were barely more than a third full. Others had
slashed room rates in an increasingly savage price war. Transmed, a private
charter airline, says business is down by at least 50 per cent. Egyptair,
the national carrier, says trade is 40 per cent lower and has postponed the
purchase of three A340 Airbus jets accordingly.
This is not the industry's first reverse in recent years. Tourists stayed
away in aeroplane loads after the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking and riots by
Cairo security police in 1986.
No sooner had the industry recovered from those shocks than the Gulf war
stopped the industry dead - individual tourists could have the pyramids to
themselves at some points during the war.
But this time visitors are being deterred not simply by general fears of the
region's instability or volatility, but by a direct campaign against tourist
targets.
'The problem is we just don't know when this will stop,' says Mr el-Sharif.
'Unlike the Gulf war, when we knew there would eventually be an end'.
In the meantime, the tourism ministry has been working on several fronts to
restore in potential holidaymakers' minds the image of Egypt as a safe and
sunny idyll of pyramids, pharaonic treasures and feluccas.
Mr Sultan has been tireless in attending the world's tourism fairs. He has
hired Burson-Marsteller, the world's biggest public relations company, to
promote more positive stories about Egypt in the world's press. Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi has also been enlisted to promote Egypt's fairer face.
Security has been intensified anywhere tourists set foot. Policemen sit in
the entrances of popular restaurants, bags are searched at all hotels.
Tourist police, troops and helicopters have been deployed in Upper Egypt,
where the Gama'a began their campaign last summer by spraying gunfire at
tour buses from the cane fields next to the Nileside roads.
But finally, the restoration of Egypt's tourism industry will depend most on
the success of the violent crackdown by the security forces to eradicate the
extremist threat. A considerable amount rides on such success.
Many economists in Egypt, not least in international agencies guiding the
country's economic reforms, argue tourism to be its greatest hope. Before
the present crisis the industry was Egypt's biggest hard currency earner,
reaping Dollars 1bn or so more in 1992 than either hydrocarbon exports or
Suez Canal toll receipts.
Since Mr Sultan became minister in the mid 1980s, the industry has grown by
an average 17.5 per cent a year. 'Tourism is the future,' says Mr John
Stewart of the International Finance Corporation. 'Oil reserves are finite,
the Suez has limited potential and remittances are likely to stay flat.
Tourism is the only area where there can be real growth.'
Under Mr Sultan's tutelage the private sector has also been allowed rare
scope to flourish in the tourism industry. Tourist asset sales will also
form much of the advance guard in Egypt's tentative first steps towards
privatising its lumbering private sector; hotels and Nile cruisers
comprising 8 of the first 20 assets or companies to be sold off this year.
'We are still barely tapping the potential,' says Mr Sultan, who believes
the industry could draw an annual 5m visitors within a year or two; 10m - as
many visitors as Greece presently accepts - within a decade.
Indeed, the scale of present investment in the industry is exceeded only by
that of Mr Sultan's ambitions for the sector. In a programme which
anticipates the annual number of tourist nights in Egypt to double to 45m
from the present 22m within five years, as much as EPounds 10bn has already
been committed by the private sector to add new hotel rooms and attendant
infrastructure.
This will add at least 25,000 rooms to the country's stock of 55,000 by the
end of 1994. Fourteen new hotels are being built at the Red Sea resort of
Hurgada alone.
And it is in resorts like Hurgada, rather than more traditional Egyptian
holiday haunts such as Luxor, Aswan or even Cairo itself, that the boom in
capacity growth is taking place. Reaching out to attract mass tourism,
adding sea, sand and sun appeal to that of its iconic historical past, the
government has been handing developers large tracts of coastline to develop
in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Sinai.
Three mega-projects in these areas could alone see up to Dollars 3bn
invested in the next few years.
The Sahel Hashish Coast Development Company has won approval for a Dollars
750m scheme to build a tourist village on a stretch of Red Sea coast between
Safaga and Hurgada. A consortium of investors led by the Egyptian finance
Company, is sinking an initial Dollars 150m into developing from desert a
spit of land south of Hurgada into a full tourist complex, with hotels and a
golf course, in a project which some of its investors believe could finally
reach Dollars 1bn.
Dallah al-Baraka and a local Islamic bank are planning, in turn, a Dollars
1bn project to develop a strip of the Mediterranean coast between Alexandria
and Mersa Matruh.
So far none of these projects has been hurt directly by the recent spate of
attacks or the climate of uncertainty they have provoked. Some smaller
investors have pulled out of at least one of these projects, but they have
been replaced. 'Let's just say what's been happening is not helping,' says
one investor, with understatement.
And from the government's perspective it is vital that nothing should derail
these investments. The reason, as Mr Sultan is abundantly aware, is simple:
jobs. 'This is the only industry in the country which is capable of giving
the new generation in this country enough jobs,' he says. The minister says
that already one in 15 jobs in Egypt depends directly on tourism. After the
envisaged expansion, he says it will be one in 10.
A great deal, therefore, will rest on the prospects of peaceful months
between now and the real start of the Egyptian tourism season in October and
November.
'We believe time will prove Egypt is as safe as it was,' says Mr Sultan. But
that lies outside his hands.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (9): Wider still and deeper runs the
waterway's future - The Suez Canal Authority faces competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Russian supertanker and a Moldovian bulk carrier glide peacefully between
the sand banks of the Suez Canal. Along the edge of the 125 year old
waterway, young conscripts watch idly in the sun as the tankers are piloted
past.
The days are long gone when the far bank bristled with Israeli armaments and
the canal was blocked by sunken ships. Now the canal authorities face new
challenges: world recession and a competitor oil pipeline.
The number of ships passing through the canal in October and November 1992
was about 10 per cent lower than in the same month in 1991. Last year, the
number of transits dropped from 18,221 in 1990-1991, to 17,473. Tonnage fell
from 419m tons to 408m.
In spite of this, an increase in tolls at the beginning of 1992 meant that
revenues rose by 10 per cent - to a record Dollars 1.86bn - in the financial
year 1991-1992, compared with the previous year.
The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) is now concentrating its energies on a
project which will allow bigger ships to pass through the canal, improving
competitiveness against the Cape route and the Sumed oil pipeline which has
deprived the canal of a share of its trade from giant oil tankers.
Sumed, which provides an alternative to the Suez Canal route for oil between
the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, is owned by a consortium of Gulf Arab oil
producers and Egypt. An expansion scheme, to be completed by next year,
involves the addition of a pumping station half way - an increase in storage
capacity and an improvement in loading and unloading facilities at both
ends.
In response, the SCA has started to deepen the Suez canal's draught from
53ft (16 metres) to 56ft (17 metres). This will allow ships of up to 180,000
dead weight tons to pass through it fully loaded. The project also involves
widening the canal.
According to Mr Mohammed Ezzat Adel, chairman of the SCA, a more ambitious
project to deepen the canal to up to 72ft, enabling it to carry ships of up
to 300,000 dwt, had to be shelved after feasibility studies showed it to be
unprofitable.
Such a project will have to wait until world trade reaches new levels, he
says. 'Freight trades are very low. Now is not the time to embark on the
implementation of such a monstrous project.'
To keep abreast with world trade, however, the authority is continuing to
review the way in which tolls are levied. Although tariffs increased last
year, they averaged only 3 per cent, a slight drop in real terms. Meanwhile,
a system of discounts has been introduced to woo ships away from the Cape
route. Large tankers can get rebates of up to 50 per cent, while even more
generous discounts are offered to ships coming from the Far East, Western
Europe, the US and Australia.
The latest discounts are expected to increase revenues by about 5 per cent
this year. Any ship choosing the Cape route over the canal because of
expense is invited by the SCA to submit a breakdown of costs, allowing the
authority to examine the competitiveness of its tolls.
Mr Adel is confident that the Suez canal will have a successful decade. He
believes that financing further deepening and widening of the canal will not
be difficult when the SCA decides the time is right.
The cost of the complete project - deepening the canal to 72ft - has been
estimated at about Dollars 350m. Borrowing such sums from the Egyptian
government, at a time when the IMF is pressing it to cut its budget deficit,
might not be possible. But Mr Adel says loans from the Gulf Arab states and
the offer of soft loans from Japan mean there would be no 'bottle-necks' in
financing phase two of the expansion scheme.
'Financing is not considered a problem in the development of this
internaional waterway which serves world trade and the economy of Egypt,'
says Mr Adel.
As for competition from Sumed, Mr Farouk Mohamed Nadi Abou-Taleb, director
of the SCA's management department, admits that the expansion project of the
pipeline will take trade away from the Suez Canal. But he points out that
the income from oil tankers nowadays is about 25 per cent of the canal's
total revenues. 'The canal doesn't depend particularly on oil,' he says.
'Dry cargo represents the main factor affecting the income of the Suez
Canal.'
As world shipping trade recovers and peace talks in the middle east
progress, Mr Adel (who describes the canal as a thermometer not just of
world trade but of world peace) is optimistic. He believes that the 195km
canal, which takes only 15 hours to navigate, will continue to attract the
world's shipping fleets.
In the meantime the authority will 'take small steps' towards its ultimate
goal of being able to transport even the biggest carriers.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals, Research and Development (1): A
taste of its own medicine - Although the world pharmaceutical industry is
facing an unprecedented examination of its prices and profits, investment in
drugs research and development remains inviolate. This year the sector will
spend Dollars 26.5bn on R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>

THE pharmaceuticals industry is under attack. Around the globe, governments
and health providers are struggling to control their healthcare budgets.
Although drugs represent only a small element of overall spending - in the
US the figure is 7 per cent of the Dollars 800bn spent annually on
healthcare - the industry has suffered the brunt of attacks. The Japanese,
German and Italian governments have all implemented measures against
medicine prices, or use, over the past 18 months. Now, in the US, the
world's largest market, the new administration is considering measures to
control the drugs bill.
The medicines industry's profits and prices are under pressure. For the
first time, the sector is facing serious cost-cutting. All aspects of the
drugs group's business are under the microscope. Manufacturing is being
rationalised, and sales forces cut.
But investment in research and development remains inviolate. Indeed,
expenditure continues to increase. The UK-based Centre for Medicines
Research estimates investment in pharmaceuticals research and development
has increased from Dollars 15.26bn in 1988 to Dollars 26.5bn this year. The
reason for this extraordinary increase is that successful R&amp;D has become
critical for pharmaceuticals companies individually and for the industry as
a whole.
The sector can justify its prices and profits only by arguing it needs them
to develop medicines for poorly-treated or untreatable diseases. Only the
drugs industry can offer remedies for Alzheimer's or Aids. More than 90 per
cent of medicine discoveries are developed by the drugs industry, according
to the US Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers' Association.
Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, is
calling for the sector to negotiate a new social contract between the
industry and society. He believes the contract would be based on showing
customers - governments and patients - that medicines are good value for
money, demonstrating they were not only safe and effective but also
cost-effective.
'Balance is required,' says Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo.
'Society needs cost-effective healthcare, but we also need money for R&amp;D.
Finally we also have shareholders who are not altruists and need a return on
their investment,' he argues.
'The industry has cried wolf in the past,' admits Dr Jurgen Drews, president
of international pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Roche. 'But it has gone on to even
greater profits. The industry will be successful as long as it produces
innovative products that make financial sense. But we will have to be more
efficient and productive,' he explains.
Some members of the industry are doomed, however. With prices of existing
medicines frozen or falling in most countries, only those groups capable of
discovering and rapidly developing innovative drugs will survive.
The burden, then, is on R&amp;D directors to come up with innovative compounds.
Although R&amp;D budgets have escaped the cuts elsewhere in the industry,
company boards are demanding that the ever-increasing sums spent on R&amp;D are
employed more productively.
The cost of developing a new compound is increasing. The Centre for
Medicines Research estimates the cost of bringing a compound to market had
increased from about Dollars 50m in the late 1960s to more than Dollars 250m
by the mid 1980s. Dr Peter Ringrose, senior vice-president of medicinal R&amp;D
at Pfizer Europe, reckons the true figure for the late 1980s is closer to
Dollars 400m.
Admittedly, such high figures include issues such as opportunity cost and
the cost of compounds that fail to reach the market. In Japan, where
development procedures are different, Professor Stuart Walker of the CMR
estimates the cost is between Dollars 70m and Dollars 100m. And even after
R&amp;D expenditure most drug companies are still making substantial profits.
Nevertheless, an increasing regulatory burden, combined with new, expensive
technologies such as biotechnology and gene therapy, have undoubtedly
increased the costs of developing drugs. So, too, has the need to
internationalise research and, in particular, development so a compound can
be launched as quickly as possible.
To cope with falling prices and rising costs, the industry will need to
manage R&amp;D more efficiently, says Dr Tom McKillop, of Imperial Chemical
Industries' bioscience subsidiary Zeneca. He questions whether all groups
are capable of managing the change.
Industry consultants argue a management revolution is taking place within
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D. The revolution's aim is to increase the odds for the
companies playing the molecular roulette of the drug development.
The issues concerning R&amp;D directors include:
Where to find innovative compounds. Some companies are dedicated to using
their own research molecules. Pfizer, for example, reckons 90 per cent of
the compounds in development are from internal research. 'You have to keep
bureaucracy down to create a free-wheeling atmosphere. The paradox is that
to be a world player you need a certain size, but size leads to bureaucracy.
The big question is: how to maintain an appropriate climate to keep your
scientists productive?' says Dr Frank-Joachim Morich, director of
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D at Bayer.
A number of companies have proved anxious to gain access to molecules
discovered outside their own organisation, in particular from the
rapidly-growing biotechnology industry. Some, such as Roche, have taken
majority stakes in large biotech groups. Others, such as Merck and Glaxo,
prefer to set up agreements with biotech companies on individual projects.
How to select which therapeutic areas and compounds to develop. A critical
challenge confronting R&amp;D directors is the problem of which molecules to
invest in. How to accelerate the time it takes to bring a drug to market.
For a blockbuster compound, every day's delay can cost a company Dollars 1m.
R&amp;D directors must use every trick at their disposal to accelerate the
development process, while simultaneously ensuring a compound is safe and
effective.
They must also co-ordinate the development of compounds in the US, Japan and
Europe, to ensure the group receives a return on its investment as soon as
possible. The CMR reckons during the 1970s it took eight years on average to
roll out a product in Japan, the US and three European countries. It now
take four years.
How to incorporate health economics studies into clinical trials. Trials
have traditionally demonstrated drugs are safe and effective. Now they must
also show they are cost-effective, reducing time in hospital or time away
from work. How to use new computer technology efficiently. Collecting data
during clinical trials by computer should be able to cut months off
development schedules. By submitting dossiers on optical disk rather than on
the tonnes of paper traditionally used, R&amp;D directors can save space and
time. How to manage scientists around the world. Most significant groups
have research and development in the US, Europe and Japan. This presents
considerable logistical difficulties.
As each company tries to use such measures to shorten the odds in its own
game of molecular roulette, the odds for the industry as a whole appear to
be lengthening. The rate of increase in R&amp;D expenditure is clearly
unsustainable. And whether existing investment can be justified by the
eventual returns is far from clear.
Governments and health providers are already struggling to pay for existing
therapies. The danger is that medical technology may well be outstripping
the ability of society to pay it.

FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk drives equities higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT market speculation that a substantial corporate deal or straight
takeover bid is about to hit the London market refused to die down and
continued to drive share prices sharply higher. The bid story was said to
have provided the late impetus in the Footsie future, which closed at an
11-point premium to fair value over the cash market.
London's recent strong performance - the FT-SE 100 Index has risen by more
than 45 points in the past three trading sessions - was all the more
impressive against a background of renewed weakness on Wall Street at the
opening of trading in New York yesterday and continuing uncertainty about
German interest-rate policy.
A meeting is scheduled this morning at the Bundesbank at which a decision
whether to maintain or cut interest rates will be taken.
The FT-SE 100 Index settled a net 13.5 higher at 2,869.6, slightly
outperforming the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which moved up 18.4 to 3,115.9.
Dealers were encouraged by the latest good turnover numbers for the equity
market, which showed 737.7m shares traded on the day, with Footsie 100
stocks accounting for volume of 275m shares.
The turnover was given a substantial boost by the placing, via a bought
deal, of 36.9m shares in Meggitt Holdings, the engineering group, by BTR.
Allowing for double counting of the shares, to include the buying and
selling of the stake, the deal contributed 74m shares to the day's total
market turnover.
Ironically, BTR has been viewed as one of the most likely predators waiting
to strike in the market. Lucas Industries was again mentioned as a possible
target.
Other bid candidates included many of the building materials stocks. Already
given a massive boost by ever increasing evidence of recovery in the UK
housing market, the sector remained among the best performers in the
FT-Actuaries indices amid persistent stories that MB-Caradon might be about
to launch its long expected move into the building materials arena. In a
long list of outstanding performers, Hepworth, Heywood Williams, Marley and
Tarmac were prominent.
Housebuilders posted hefty gains, with Taylor Woodrow heavily traded and,
rather surprisingly, attracting vague takeover speculation. Barratt
Developments and Bryant Group also saw exceptionally heavy support.
The main thrust behind the Footsie 100, however, came from the drugs sector,
where big rises in stocks such as ICI, Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham accounted for more than nine index points. The drugs stocks
encountered very heavy US support overnight as US investors increasingly
adopted the view that the shares have been oversold in recent weeks.
Mining group RTZ was the worst performer in the Footsie 100, reacting to an
earnings downgrade by Warburg Securities. BAT Industries, the tobacco to
insurance group, was also under pressure.
A utilities sector badly mauled in the recent past provided two firm
features in the Scottish generators, which responded to positive comments by
Goldman Sachs, the highly influential US investment bank. Sedgwick, the
insurance broker, was given a boost by a Smith New Court buy recommendation.

FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The release of the pathfinder prospectus for the demerger of ICI's
bioscience business Zeneca coincided with a jump in the share price.
The rise of 41 to 1236p on healthy turnover of 4.4m shares was, however,
inspired by US buying rather than new information. US brokerage houses
PaineWebber and Goldman Sachs were both bidding aggressively for stock.
UK analysts said they had discovered no new causes for optimism in the
prospectus and many argued that by the close ICI shares were at best very
fairly valued. In fact the performance was a sign of things to come, being
more driven by reconsideration of the pharmaceuticals sector than corporate
fundamentals. The reconsideration was prompted by an easing of fears over US
drug price reforms.
There were reports that Ms Donna Shalala, new US secretary of health and
human services, had reacted favourably to a proposal by Merck, the world's
largest pharmaceuticals group, that prices should be held to within one
percentage point of inflation. This compared to some estimates of 30 per
cent price cuts and helped stocks pick up across the board.
Glaxo moved ahead 19 to 599p, Wellcome added 30 at 764p and SmithKline
Beecham gained 24 to 468p in the 'A's. The combined rises accounted for
around 9.3 points of the gain in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday.

<TEXT>
Heavy falls in the price of copper led to a sharp decline in the price of
RTZ shares as one of the leading securities houses cut its profits forecasts
and advised clients to sell. RTZ shares were the worst performers in the
FT-SE 100 Index, dropping 27 to 631p.
Global copper prices quoted in London hit a 5 1/2 -year low yesterday,
prompting SG Warburg to cut its current year estimate of average prices for
the key industrial metal by 10 cents to 95 cents a pound. RTZ is the world's
second biggest producer of copper, and Warburg subsequently lowered its 1993
profits estimate for the mining group by Pounds 70m to Pounds 575m. The
house also changed its recommendation on the stock from hold to reduce.

FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR sells Meggitt stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKEOVER speculation surrounding BTR intensified after it placed its 17.2
per cent stake in engineering group Meggitt. In a bought deal, Smith New
Court, Meggitt's broker, is believed to have purchased the 36.9m shares from
BTR at 100p cum-dividend, placing between 11m and 12m at 101p cum-div, and
the remainder, around 25m, at 98p xd.
Although Meggitt was said to have initiated the deal, the move led to
increased speculation that the proceeds from the sale would go towards BTR's
takeover war chest. Lucas Industries remains the market's favourite bid
target for BTR but there was some suggestion that it may be Pilkington,
which escaped its clutches after a bitter and acrimonious Pounds 1.2bn
battle six years ago.
BTR put on 2 at 619p, and Meggitt, which also benefited from a buy circular
from its broker earlier this week, firmed  1/2 to 101p. The bid speculation
continued to boost Lucas and it added 2 1/2 at 134 1/2 p in trade of 6m,
while Pilkington ended 3 better at 130p on volume of 6.5m.

FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BID speculation, and vague hopes that today's Bundesbank council meeting may
bring a cut in German interest rates, boosted trading in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers of the June FT-SE 100 futures contract were in evidence early in the
session. Having opened at 2,875, just ahead of the previous night's close,
June moved steadily ahead for the rest of the morning, with overseas
institutions, said to believe the UK market was undervalued, reported to
have been among the buyers.
A poor opening on Wall Street subsequently unnerved the futures, causing a
temporary decline, but a squeeze later in the afternoon pushed June to the
day's high of 2,891.
Profit-taking approaching the close left June finishing at 2,888, up 15 from
Tuesday's close and some 11 points above its fair value premium to cash of
around 8 points. Turnover improved from recent levels, reaching 8,472 lots.
The volume in traded options continued to increase and totalled 29,560
contracts. Both the FT-SE 100 option and the Euro FT-SE option were busy and
traded 9,074 and 5,594 lots respectively.
Wellcome, one of the day's strong performers in the equity market, was the
most active among the stock options and had a total of 1,510 contracts
dealt. It was followed by Hanson, in which 1,307 lots were transacted.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets search for a new
direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US MARKETS lay dormant yesterday as investors searched in vain for a lead
from bond prices and first-quarter corporate earnings, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.05 at 3,439.44,
having spent most of the day only a few points either side of the opening
level. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 1.47 to 443.63, while the American SE
composite was 1.62 firmer at 419.03 and the Nasdaq composite 2.07 higher at
664.04. NYSE trading volume came to 286m shares.
After two days of losses, the stock markets struggled to hold prices in
positive territory yesterday. In spite of Monday's and Tuesday's declines,
sentiment is not particularly bearish - the problem is that there are few
reasons to buy stocks at the moment. Bond yields have fallen in the past
week, but they were only retrieving lost ground, and there is no indication
that they will fall much further.
As for the quarterly reports, a few stocks have been boosted by unexpectedly
good earnings, but most seem to have had good news on profits already built
into the price. Consequently, there has been a lot of profit-taking in
recent days, and much shifting of funds in and out of various industry
groups as investors search for the sector holding the most promise for quick
gains.
Bank and airline shares were affected by this switching yesterday. Bank
stocks, which have had a good 1993 so far on expectations of improved
profitability, have been overrun by profit-takers lately, in spite of good
first-quarter earnings announcements.
Among those that suffered yesterday were JP Morgan, down Dollars 2 1/8 at
Dollars 69 7/8, BankAmerica, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 49 1/8, Banc
One, off Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56 5/8, and First Union, Dollars 1 3/4
cheaper at Dollars 46 7/8.
In contrast, airline issues bounced back strongly from recent selling on
fears of a renewal of the air fares war. They were aided by news of improved
operating earnings at AMR, parent of American Airlines. AMR climbed Dollars
6 to Dollars 72, UAL jumped Dollars 9 3/4 to Dollars 149 3/4, USAir put on
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 24 1/4 and Delta added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 59
1/4.
AT&amp;T dipped Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 57 3/8 in volume of 2m shares after the
telecommunications group announced a first-quarter loss of Dollars 4.19 a
share, compared with a profit of 67 cents a share a year earlier.
General Dynamics firmed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 97 1/8 after the aerospace
and defence group unveiled first-quarter net income on continuing operations
of Dollars 1.30 a share, more than double the earnings of a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23
on news of its alliance with WordPerfect to produce personal computer
software.
Canada
THE Toronto market showed little overall change for the second consecutive
day, in continued heavy trading. The TSE 300 Index rose just 0.5 to 3,663.8
and advances led declines by 352 to 317 after volume of 73.1m shares valued
at CDollars 664m.
Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher, with the biggest gains recorded
by real estate, transportation and energy, up 1.71 per cent, 1.38 per cent
and 1.13 per cent respectively.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average retreats
further after fall in NTT

<TEXT>
EQUITY prices settled lower as the weakness of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, Japan's largest telecommunications company, erased early gains
triggered by institutional investors and arbitrageurs amid choppy trading,
writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average retreated 55.42 to 19,773.01 for its fourth consecutive
decline, after moving between an intraday low of 19,672.02 and a high of
20,008.13. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.78 to
1,532.56, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 5.74 at 1,207.41.
Volume was estimated at 400m shares, compared with Tuesday's 460m. Declines
outpaced advances by 699 to 330, with 148 issues unchanged.
Investors took profits quickly after NTT dipped below the Y1m level. NTT,
which represents about 10 per cent of the first section in terms of market
value, finally settled Y60,000 lower at Y937,000 for a sixth consecutive
loss.
The strength of the yen also gave investors an additional reason to sell
equities or to remain on the sidelines. The yen advanced beyond Y110 to the
dollar at one point during Tokyo trading.
Mr Hiroshi Nakagawa, head of research at Morgan Stanley Japan, estimated
that the Nikkei average would trade between a narrow range of 18,000 to
20,000 for the next three months. Any rally beyond this level is likely to
result in profit-taking because investors regarded the overall stock market
as expensive, he added.
Electric power and gas suppliers came under pressure. Tokyo Electric Power
settled Y120 lower at Y3,840 while Tokyo Gas lost Y18 to Y542.
Brokerages lost ground, Nomura retreating Y40 to Y2,000, Yamaichi Y22 to
Y830 and Nikko Securities Y11 to Y999.
Consumer electronic issues were weak: TDK fell Y50 to Y3,800 and Pioneer
Electronic Y50 to Y2,410. But high-technology shares moved higher, NEC
appreciating Y9 to Y937, Hitachi Y9 to Y829 and Mitsubishi Electric Y3 to
Y558.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 223.25 to end at 21,533.79 in volume of
33.9m shares.
Roundup
THERE WAS a positive mood in some of the Pacific Rim markets yesterday.
HONG KONG closed higher on comments by a senior Chinese official about
Sino-British talks, but activity remained thin. The Hang Seng index finished
129.85, or 1.9 per cent, up at 6,768.39. Turnover was HKDollars 4.3bn.
Mr Lu Ping, China's senior official on Hong Kong affairs, said success in
discussions over the colony's political reforms would be positive for
shares.
KUALA LUMPUR rose to a new high on index-linked buying and speculative
activity. The composite index added 19.17 at 691.70. Increased demand for
laggard blue chip issues from institutional investors boosted activity.
SEOUL ended at a 20-month peak on a surge by financial issues. The composite
index climbed 11.92 to 733.58 in volume of 56.6m shares. Popularity in
electronics issues contributed to a rise in confidence.
MANILA fell in spite of strong buying at the start of the session. The
composite index lost 22.05 to 1,532.76 in turnover of 426.16m pesos. Rumours
of foreign selling in the oil sector due to the lack of positive
developments in oil drilling projects depressed other shares.
TAIWAN was weak in financials but managed to reverse early losses to end
slightly higher. The weighted index put on a net 34.20 at 4,482.63 in thin
turnover of TDollars 31.44bn.
Some analysts noted that the failure by the provincial assembly to pass
dividend plans by the major provincial commercial banks had hit sentiment in
the sector.
AUSTRALIA eased on profit-taking after declines on Wall Street, the All
Ordinaries index slipping 9.7 to 1,693.9 in turnover of ADollars 340.5m.
SINGAPORE was firmer after falling back on Tuesday, but many investors
preferred to concentrate on the Malaysian market. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed 6.99 ahead at 1,770.06 in turnover of SDollars 451m.
BANGKOK moved ahead on hopes that the authorities might take less severe
action than expected against violators of the new securities law. The SET
index gained 5.20 at 889.42 in turnover of Bt3.84bn.
NEW ZEALAND continued to be driven by strong performances in the forestry
sector and the NZSE-40 index rose 7.04 to 1,604.93, its highest close since
February. Turnover amounted to NZDollars 42.6m.
KARACHI was supported by buying from state financial institutions. The KSE
index moved forward 12.38 to 1,088.30. BOMBAY fell to a 14-month low as the
BSE index lost a further 10.51 to 2,194.40.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Astra ahead on recovery hopes
in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG buying interest in Astra was seen yesterday as the stock reacted to a
growing belief that the pharmaceuticals sector may have reached the bottom
of the cycle, writes Our Markets Staff.
Susan Haylock, European pharmaceuticals analyst at NatWest Securities in
London, noted that there had been a revival of interest in the sector over
the last few days. Some better than expected first quarter results from US
groups and expectations that the Clinton healthcare reform proposals would
be outlined by the end of next month had contributed to a change in
sentiment, she said.
The mood among senior bourses generally, however, was much less enthusiastic
as hopes dimmed that the Bundesbank would cut interest rates further at
today's regular meeting.
STOCKHOLM was driven by Astra with strong US and European buying seen as the
stock put on 3.6 per cent in the B shares, closing SKr24 higher at SKr668.
However, as one trader noted, the stock still has a long way to go before it
passes the all time high of SKr751 reached in January.
The Affarsvarlden index gained 15.50 or 1.5 per cent to 1,026.0 in turnover
of some SKr1.2bn.
Another gainer was Ericcson which saw the B's close at a year's high, up
SKr9 at SKr283
FRANKFURT fell for the second consecutive day, as disappointment over
earnings prompted profit-taking. The DAX index fell 20.24 to 1,666.87 in
volume estimated to have been considerably less than Tuesday's DM5.1bn.
All sectors declined on the day. Steel and machinery makers lost ground on
Tuesday's lower profit warnings by leading companies at the Hanover trade
fair. Thyssen, the steel maker, lost DM4.30 to DM174.20, while Mannesmann
eased DM3.70 to DM261.70.
Construction companies, which lost ground on Tuesday after announcing a
rights issues, continued their descent. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson
Securities said that liquidity in the market was being absorbed by the
increasing number of rights issues. Holzmann fell DM65 to DM1,010, while
Hochtief retreated DM37 to DM1,090.
In post-bourse trading, the market weakened as hopes of lower interest rates
receded after the release of money supply figures. The M3 for February grew
by 3.2 per cent, against forecasts of around 1 per cent.
PARIS dipped again with a loss in the CAC-40 index of 17.44 to 1,931.89.
However, turnover was stronger than in recent days at FFr3.4bn.
Some analysts commented that sentiment had been affected by a feeling that
France was unable to act unilaterally on reducing domestic interest rates
further until some movement emerged from Germany.
In the corporate sector UAP slipped another FFr12 to FFr541 as some
investors continued to digest its 1992 results published on Tuesday.
Reports of US selling and a downgrade hit L'Oreal which closed down FFr14 at
FFr1,061 while Peugeot, which reports 1992 figures today, was down another
FFr9 at FFr537, although some observers believe that expectations of poor
results has largely been discounted.
ZURICH saw demand for industrial stocks more than offset weaker banks and
insurances, as the likelihood of a German interest rate cut today faded, and
the SMI index rose 7.3 to 2,178.1.
Bearer shares in Ascom, the telecommunications equipment maker, rose SFr90
or 6.6 per cent to SFr1,450 on reports of heavy buy orders by a private,
Geneva-based bank which has recommended the share recently.
Roche certificates were also actively traded, rising SFr30 to SFr6,720 as
positions were built up ahead of today's annual news conference. Sandoz
bearers rose SFr80 to SFr3,040 and Ciba-Geigy registered shares dipped SFr5
to SFr592 amid reports of share switching in the sector.
Profit-taking left Sulzer SFr19 lower at SFr724 after the group said that it
expected this year's group profits at least to match the 1992 level.
AMSTERDAM was puzzled by the good performance from Nedlloyd, up Fl 1.30 at
Fl 30.30, after the transport group announced disappointing 1992 results.
The only positive sign in the report was a suggestion that there had been a
slight pick-up in trading activity in March. The CBS Tendency index closed
0.4 higher at 110.7.
BRUSSELS was pulled down by the fall in Petrofina which lost BFr150 to
BFr9,250 on profit-taking by institutions. The Bel-20 index fell 4.7 to
1,247.21.
MILAN remained overhung by the uncertain political situation as efforts
began to decide the composition of a new government. The Comit index eased
4.55 to 518.17.
Privatisation stocks recouped some of Tuesday's losses on hopes that Mr
Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, would head an interim government until
general elections in the autumn. Credito Italiano rose L90 to L2,863 while
SME ended L153 higher at L6,202.
OSLO rose on speculative buying with a gain in the all-share index of 4.04
to 450.31 in turnover of NKr469.7m.
MADRID fell steadily in line with other markets with the general index
losing 1.11 to 242.51 in turnover of a low Pta5.36bn. ISTANBUL continued to
recover strongly after Monday's plunge and the market index rose 312.24 or
4.7 per cent to 6,921.49.

FT  22 APR 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank's
latest figures for money supply growth were higher than the market had
expected, writes James Blitz.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent in March
after contracting by 0.3 per cent in the previous month. The March figure
contrasted with economists' expectations of a 1 per cent rise in M3.
A particular concern for the market was the growth in German bank lending,
which showed a rise of 9 per cent when annualised over the last six months.
When the Bundesbank cut its discount rate at its last council meeting in
March, the low level for this figure was cited as one of the reasons for
easing policy. Yesterday's data served to underline that an easing in the
discount rate at today's council meeting was unlikely.
There was little reason for dealers to be bullish about rate cuts following
the week's money market operations by the German central bank.
As expected, repo funds were offered to commercial banks at a minimum rate
of 8.09 per cent, 2 basis points down from the previous level.
However, an injection of DM5.8bn helped to push call money below the repo
rate level, to 8.07 per cent.
All this data added up to a downbeat day for German futures contracts. The
June contract declined 5 basis points on the day to close at 92.63. The
September contract fell even more heavily, finishing 14 basis points down on
the day at 93.39. At this level the market is looking for 129 basis points
off three-month money in the next five months.
French franc interest rates were affected by the German news. One-month
French francs rose sharply from 8.62 per cent to 9.25 per cent, and
three-month French francs rose from about 8.25 per cent to about 8.7 per
cent.
Sterling markets were slightly affected by the news from Germany which
implied that it might be difficult for the UK to bring down short-term
interest rates.
The June short sterling contract dipped 3 basis points to close at 93.95.
However, three-month sterling cash was unchanged at around 6 per cent. The
Bank of England forecast a large shortage of Pounds 1.9bn, which pushed the
overnight rate up to a peak of 7.5 per cent at one stage.

FT  22 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar shrugs off M3 figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR remained firm against the D-Mark yesterday in spite of the
release of German money data implying that the Bundesbank was unlikely to
cut rates at its council meeting today, writes James Blitz.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent in March
after contracting by 0.3 per cent in the previous month. The March figure
contrasted with economists' expectations of a 1 per cent rise in M3 money
growth.
A particular concern for the market was the growth in German bank lending,
which showed a rise of 9 per cent when annualised over the last six months.
Although the Bundesbank has said it will be holding a press conference after
its council meeting today, the data underlined that there would probably be
no cut in the discount rate.
The news from Germany failed to depress the dollar, however. The US currency
closed at DM1.6050 from a previous DM1.6000. But in New York it receded to
finish at DM1.5997.
In part, this may have been due to continued short-covering of dollar
positions by dealers who had oversold the US currency in recent weeks. The
market may also have been awaiting the outcome of today's council meeting
before deciding what to do.
The D-Mark did not strengthen much against most European currencies, in
spite of the German money supply figures. The French franc closed at
FFr3.377 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.379. Dealers remained optimistic
about the parity between the franc and the D-Mark in the European exchange
rate mechanism in the run-up to today's summit between Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
The pound closed  1/4 pfennig easier against the D-Mark yesterday at
DM2.4650. Some dealers said they were waiting for today's unemployment
figures and tomorrow's retail sales numbers before deciding what to do about
sterling.
According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London, the market is
expecting the March unemployment figure to be on the high side following
February's net drop of 22,000 on the month.
The peseta was lower against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, in
spite of heavy Bank of Spain intervention to support the currency.
Some dealers said comments from the governor of the Bank of Spain, who
predicted that the ERM might face further instability, had weakened the
Spanish currency. After dropping to Pta72.48 at one stage, the peseta closed
at Pta72.37 from a previous Pta72.31.
In spite of another strong rally by the yen in Wednesday's Tokyo trading,
the dollar managed to recover in Europe, helped by heavy intervention from
the Bank of Japan. After hitting another historic high of Y109.90 to the
dollar in Tokyo, the yen closed weaker in Europe at Y111.05. In New York it
finally stood at Y110.62.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices continued to follow the easier tendency apparent before the Easter
recess in the Australian selling, when sales were resumed in Melbourne and
Brisbane this week. China was a prominent buyer but overall demand remained
insufficient to match offerings. Stockpile sales have for many weeks been
entirely negligible in market significance and the emphasis is on over
production of wool with no early indication of a better balance, unless it
is for a brief market upturn reacting to such an exceptionally long downward
trend. The AWC market indicator was at another new low point of 401 cents a
kg on April 21.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT drops Comex merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATION OF the US futures industry has been set back by the collapse
of the Chicago Board of Trade's attempt to acquire New York's Commodity
Exchange.
Although the two exchanges negotiated a preliminary affiliation agreement in
January, the CBoT announced late on Tuesday that it was withdrawing its
offer to take over Comex because it expected Comex traders to reject its
bid.
Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of CBoT, said: 'After weeks of negotiations, we
have concluded that we could not modify our original business proposal to
satisfactorily address Comex's demand for extended access to our products'.
Comex traders were ready to reject the deal primarily because, under the
agreement, CBoT would not have allowed them enough access to CBoT's
lucrative interest-rate and agricultural futures contracts.
The collapse of the deal is a blow to Comex, the largest metals exchange in
the US. Comex has suffered from declining trading volume in recent years,
especially in the important gold and silver futures contracts.
Although volume has picked up this year, Comex leaders are still shopping
around for possible merger partners.
The failure of CBoT and Comex to agree on an affiliation will disappoint
those in the futures industry who believe that consolidation through mergers
and acquisitions is essential if the established exchanges are to compete
effectively with the rapidly growing over-the-counter market in futures,
options and other derivative contracts.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Natural rubber producers to
prepare for life after Inra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS OF the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries are to
meet here next week to work out a programme of action if the present
International Natural Rubber Agreement is abandoned.
The agreement expires at the end of this year. Producer countries want it to
be renegotiated but consumers say the present pact is adequate. Furthermore
consumers accuse producers of breaking the terms of the agreement by
refusing a downward revision of natural rubber prices earlier this year.
The ANRPC groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New
Guinea and Singapore, which together account for more than 80 per cent of
the world's natural rubber output.
Mr Sucharit Promdej, the association's secretary general, has warned that
producers will bring in their own supply curbs and pricing mechanisms if
there is no renegotiation of the agreement.
However, producers face a dilemma in that if Inra is abandoned then nearly
200,000 tonnes of natural rubber stockpiled by the International Natural
Rubber Organisation's buffer stock manager will start being sold on the open
market.
This would put further downward pressure on world natural rubber prices.
Inro groups both producers and consumers. An Inro meeting here next month is
expected to make a last ditch effort to maintain the agreement.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian miner still hungry
for cash - State-company's search for private partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARVED OF new investment funds, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, Brazil's
state-controlled mining company, plans to continue its strategy of forming
partnerships to maximise investment while minimising it own cash outlays.
The company is capitalising on its mineral rights at already discovered
sites to attract private sector investment through partnership deals. A
five-year investment plan includes more than Dollars 2bn in new investment
in five major projects by CVRD and its partners. Three of these are in the
mining sector and two are in forestry and wood pulp production, a growth
area for the diversifying company.
The mining schemes are all in the northern Amazonian state of Para. One is
the resumption of the Alunorte project for the construction of an alumina
(aluminium oxide) plant, which was suspended in the mid-1980s. The others
are the Salobo project, for the exploitation of a big copper deposit, and
the Caulim project, to develop an important kaolin site.
Formal approval from the Ministry of Mining and Energy is not needed for the
developments. Last year CVRD signed a 'management agreement' with the
government that allows it to operate more like a private company, provided
that it meets specific targets.
Even under that deal, however, CVRD has limited access to investment funds.
It has not increased equity capital in more than four years and as a
state-owned company it is prevented from securing certain lines of public
credit, says Mr Helio Blak, the company's superintendent for development.
The joint venture strategy is a way to get around the fact that CVRD's
principal shareholder, the state, is unable to consider new investments.
The CVRD strategy also reflects an international trend toward joint mining
ventures, says Mr Blak. 'This is happening all over the world. . . Everyone
wants to dilute his participation in the search for minerals.'
The company's approach is to make deals based on its extensive mineral
rights, in lieu of laying out scarce capital - witness the Salobo and Caulim
projects. 'We found the copper and the kaolin and we are principally
entering with the rights,' says Mr Blak.
Most of the expected Dollars 765m in new money needed to prepare for copper
operations at Salobo will come from CVRD's partner, Morro Velho, a leading
Brazilian gold mining company half-owned by Anglo American. The two
companies will control equal shares of the venture.
The copper deposit is estimated at 1.2bn tonnes. After the installation of a
processing plant it should be producing 150,000 tonnes of copper and eight
tonnes of gold a year beginning in 1998.
The kaolin deposit will be exploited with Caulim da Amazonia, part of Caemi,
a Brazilian mining group, which will provide most of the projected Dollars
295m investment. The 220m-tonne reserve should be producing 500,000 tonnes
of high quality coating kaolin, used in the production of high quality
paper, by 1995. CVRD will retain a 49 per cent share in the joint venture.
The Alunorte project will involve Dollars 500m to Dollars 550m of new
investment, bringing the total outlay to about Dollars 880m, according to Mr
Blak. It envisions the construction of a 1.1m tonnes-a-year plant to produce
alumina, the raw material for aluminium smelting.
Originally a joint venture between CVRD and a consortium of Japanese
companies, the Nippon Amazon Aluminum Company, the plant was 30 per cent
finished when work was halted because the foreign associates baulked at
further investment eight years ago. Long negotiations were necessary to coax
them back. They will be joined by two new partners: Brazil's Companhia
Brasileira de Aluminio and Mineracao Rio do Norte.
With the alumina operation, CVRD, which mines bauxite (aluminium ore),
intends to supply the missing link in its aluminium production.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe's CIS aluminium imports
rise 52%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM IMPORTS to western Europe from the Commonwealth of Independent
States reached 550,000 tonnes last year, a rise of more than 52 per cent
from the 361,185 tonnes imported in 1991 and well over three times the
123,452 tonnes recorded for 1990, according to estimates from the European
Aluminium Association.
Nevertheless, in spite of the output reductions forced on the European
industry last year by low prices, for which the CIS imports were at least
partly to blame, European production held up reasonably well. The
association suggests that it slipped by 5.3 per cent, from 3.53m tonnes to
3.34m tonnes.
The European industry did better than expected because in June the
association forecast that 1992 output would drop to 3.28m. In the event, a
smooth start-up at Pechiney's new smelter at Dunkirk in France helped to
compensate for many of the cuts elsewhere in Europe.
However, 1992 produced the third successive annual fall in European
aluminium production and output was 7 per cent below the peak of 3.6m tonnes
reached in 1989.
And so far this year European aluminium production rates have continued to
fall. According to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the output
rate of 8,935 tonnes a day in the first quarter of 1993 is equivalent to
3.26m tonnes a year, just above the nine-year low reached early in 1992.
The statistics will provide some ammunition for the association's campaign
to have the European Commission impose severe quotas on imports of CIS
aluminium to the European Community.
Some analysts suggest, however, that the surge in imports from the CIS has
benefited the world-wide aluminium industry by speeding up rationalisation.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
says: 'Our view is that one good thing to arise from the CIS dumping is that
it has hastened the necessary rationalisation of high-cost European
capacity'. Unlike the previous experience in the US - some smelters closed
during the last recession but re-opened when prices picked up - 'many of the
European closures will be permanent - and that can't be bad'.

SHELL AUSTRALIA, yesterday announced the go-ahead for a ADollars 270m coal
mine at Dartbrook in the Hunter Valley coalfields of New South Wales.
The company said that the mine would produce up to 3.5m tonnes of steam coal
a year, increasing the group's Australian output to about 16.5m tonnes.
Dartbrook's production will be exported to customers in the Asia/Pacific
region.
The mine will consolidate Shell's position as Australia's third largest coal
producer behind Broken Hill Proprietary and CRA, which is in the process of
absorbing Coal &amp; Allied, formerly the third largest producer.
Shell is also considering developing another mine at Moranbah North, in
central Queensland, which would produce about 3m tonnes of steam coal a year
for the export market. However, production is unlikely to start for several
years.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shell signs Nigerian oil
development contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA THIS week signed an oil exploration and production contract with the
local offshoot of Royal Dutch/Shell, the first in a series of such
agreements with foreign oil companies that could increase the country's
output to 2.5m barrels a day.
The deal marks a welcome success for the Transitional Council, which had
pledged to end months of delay over the signing and clear the way for more
foreign and private sector investment in the sector.
Similar deals are expected shortly with other foreign oil companies,
including Elf Aquitaine, Mobil Corporation, Chevron and Agip and with the
alliance of Statoil and BP, whose Nigerian assets were nationalised in 1979.
If exploration agreements were made for the 65 new areas, it would help
Nigeria to hit its target of 25bn barrels of recoverable reserves by 1995
with no initial outlay by the government.
Shell has set up a new company for exploration and production in new areas,
operating purely as a contractor and taking all the risk in developing five
new exploration blocks awarded by the government in December 1991. Under the
new agreement, there is no guaranteed minimum nor any upper limit on the
foreign operator's earnings. The Nigerian government will receive signature
bonuses of Dollars 30m each for licensing the two deep offshore blocks and
less than Dollars 1m each for three large onshore permits in the Benue
basin.
The new terms replace the joint ventures with the state-owned National
Petroleum Corporation in which foreign companies hold minority stakes.
Shortage of cash recently forced NNPC to cut investment in these ventures.
Oil Secretary Mr Philip Asiodu said: 'Exploration sharing is better for
Nigeria because we can save scarce funds for more pressing needs'. These
include the state monopoly on oil refineries and distribution, which is near
to collapse, leading to fuel shortages in most parts of Nigeria.
The new signing is also a boost for Shell, the largest foreign investor in
Nigeria, which has been caught up in controversy as the technical adviser on
the delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to lift livestock import ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community intends to lift its one-month ban on imports of
livestock and dairy products from central and eastern Europe after a
foot-and-mouth scare in Italy, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner,
confirmed yesterday.
The ban will be lifted progressively, subject to the eastern Europeans
agreeing to tighter controls on export certificates. The EC also wants a
14-day quarantine on live animals so they can be given blood tests.
The EC move aims to defuse an embarrassing dispute with 18 central and
eastern European countries, some of whom denounced the original trade ban as
a restoration of the Iron Curtain.
Mr Steichen said in Strasbourg that the new code of conduct would require
national veterinary authorities to attach number export certificates to East
European livestock, so they could subsequently be traced.
The EC's and Austria's one-month ban on meat and dairy products imposed
earlier this month provoked a furious protest from central and eastern
European countries who said there was no sign of foot-and-mouth disease
infecting their animals.
Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic imposed tit-for-tat bans,
while Slovakia barred the transit of EC livestock. Some affected countries
denounced the EC ban as an excuse to protect community agricultural
producers.
The foot-and-mouth scare began after an outbreak of the disease was
discovered in Italy and later traced to Croatia, a transit point for goods
and produce entering the EC.

FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese traders face heavy
copper losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME CHINESE trading houses are suffering substantial losses because of the
recent collapse in London Metal Exchange copper prices, according to traders
and analysts. Nobody knows the details, but trade estimates yesterday
suggested Chinese losses might be as much as Dollars 80m.
LME sources suggest there was a concerted attack by some London traders on
the Chinese futures and options positions. This helped to drive down copper
prices from a 1993 peak of Dollars 2,400 a tonne to a 5 1/2 -year low of
Dollars 1,820 a tonne yesterday.
'The London traders have been going after the Chinese for six to eight
weeks. They found their long positions and hit them hard,' said one
observer.
This was a reversal of the situation in 1992 when the Chinese seemed to be
all-powerful in the copper market. China's demand for the metal is so great
that its traders are estimated to have bought 300,000 tonnes of physical
metal last year and taken futures positions on 500,000 tonnes. Analysts say
the Chinese used their buying power and astute trading ability to make
handsome profits in 1992.
However, traders suggest the Chinese left themselves somewhat vulnerable by
buying about 85,000 tonnes of physical copper in December, which was enough
to cover most of China's first-quarter 1993 import requirements. The London
traders' determined attack pushed the copper price down below Dollars 2,100
a tonne, a level at which Chinese 'sell stops' (sales to keep losses to a
pre-determined minimum) started to be triggered.
Chinese losses on some contracts are between Dollars 200 and Dollars 400 a
tonne, traders estimate, but it is impossible to guess the tonnage involved.
'It could be between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes. But they can handle the
losses,' said one.
Traders say that, while the Chinese 'lit the blue touch paper', for copper's
fall, much of this week's volatility and further price drop has been caused
by options traders being forced to offload positions into a very thin
market. 'Most of the traders with real business to do have stepped aside
because of the extreme volatility. The big option books are now being
crucified,' said one.
Analysts expect the copper price to stabilise now. Mr Wiktor Bielski,
analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group, said
copper was unlikely to fall below 75 cents a lb (Dollars 1,653 a tonne) and
would probably form a base at 80 cents, a price at which one quarter to one
third of world producers broke even. The price rally when it came would be
as sharp as the recent fall as 'buy stops' would be triggered on the way up.
He pointed out the copper market remained fundamentally weak, with a supply
surplus of at least 200,000 tonnes expected this year and a period of
seasonally poor demand in the northern hemisphere fast approaching.

Three-month COPPER attempted to consolidate around Dollars 1,870 a tonne on
the LME after an early fall to a fresh 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,820 and
subsequent sharp rally back towards Dollars 1,880. However, sentiment
remains shattered after the hefty battering prices have taken over the last
two weeks, and selling was starting to build up by the close. Other metals
ended mixed after mostly trading routinely throughout the day. Three-month
NICKEL built on an early break above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. London's robusta
COFFEE market continued its downward path. Dealers said the mood remained
very gloomy, depressed by rising stocks in the US, sluggish demand and the
prospect of a slightly larger Brazilian crop being shipped soon. 'Coffee
hasn't got a friend in the world,' one dealer said. GOLD, PLATINUM and
SILVER weakened on the London bullion market, but PALLADIUM held its early
gains, and was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 115 a troy ounce.
Palladium's rise - after trading at around Dollars 111 for most of last week
and this - came from a combination of factors, dealers said. 'It is in very
short supply, although not as badly as a month ago,' one dealer said.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive pricing for Dollars 500m
five-year Canadian offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Export Development Corporation of Canada yesterday launched its
anticipated Dollars 500m offer at an aggressive yield of only 22 basis
points above US Treasuries, taking the unusual step of restricting the
transaction to just three underwriters.
The five-year issue was led jointly by CSFB, Merrill Lynch and UBS.
Restricting the transaction to three banks increases these institutions'
control over the distribution of the bonds, though the transaction runs the
risk of undermining the borrower's standing with banks not invited into the
deal.
The underwriters reported that while the pricing had been aggressive, more
than half of the bonds had been sold by the end of the day.
Also in dollars, the Republic of Austria came with an unusual 15-year offer,
a maturity which is seldom traded and for which some bankers said there was
little demand. However, at just Dollars 200m and given the relative scarcity
of the name, the bonds were said to have sold well in eastern Asia and
continental Europe.
With no current-coupon benchmark bonds over which to price the deal, the
bonds were pitched at 42 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. The slope of
the US yield curve between 10 and 15 years implied an increase in yield of
4-4 1/2 basis points a year, giving a spread of 20-22 basis points over the
interpolated curve, banks involved in the deal said. The yield spread held
up later in the day, after the bonds were freed to trade.
On a busy day across a range of currencies, the French franc was again a
focus of attention. McDonald's and Toyota Motor Credit Corporation launched
FFr1bn deals in the international market, at 10 and five years respectively.
Aeroports de Paris raised FFr1bn over 10 years in the domestic market.
The tight yield spread at which the Toyota deal was completed - 25 basis
points - reinforced the recent trend for the Eurobond market to offer more
competitive pricing than the domestic markets, as international investors
have bought into a rising currency. As a result, the European Investment
Bank, which was planning a domestic issue today, was reported to have
switched its attention to the Eurobond market. It was said to be planning a
FFr2bn three or five-year issue at a spread of 12-15 basis points over
French government bonds, some five basis points less than it would have paid
in the domestic French market.
Both the Kingdom of Sweden and New Zealand launched offerings in currencies
where they have existing issues maturing. Sweden's CDollars 300m deal was
pitched in the less-heavily used 10-year area and, with a payment date on
May 12, was positioned to benefit from a CDollars 250m issue from the same
borrower which matures on May 5. New Zealand, not seen in the public markets
since 1990, raised Pounds 150m, one day after its existing Pounds 100m issue
matured.

FT  22 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Dealers disappointed by slight reduction
in Bundesbank repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday disappointed European government bond markets with
the announcement of a tiny easing at its weekly repo and some unfavourable
economic news. German government bonds fell back during the day, pulling the
other European markets lower.
The Bundesbank said the lowest allocated rate at its regular securities
repurchase tender had dropped to 8.09 per cent from 8.11 per cent, which
confirmed the recent very gradual easing in rates by the German central
bank.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM60.6bn of 14-day securities repurchase
funds, representing a net injection of DM5.8bn in liquidity.
Dealers had expected a drain of funds and a bigger reduction in the repo
rate, and the bund market fell back in the morning after the repo results
were announced.
Further disappointing news came with the announcement that the M3 money
supply aggregate expanded at a seasonally-adjusted, annualised 3.2 per cent
during the first three months of the year, having contracted in recent
months.
The central bank reported a February M3 contraction of 0.3 per cent
following January's contraction of 2.4 per cent. Dealers said the market was
particularly worried by the acceleration in bank lending.
Supply fears contributed to the market's doldrums after Mr Theo Waigel, the
German finance minister, was reported as saying the federal budget deficit
would be slightly more than DM65bn, compared with a DM39bn shortfall in
1992. The size of the deficit has raised worries in the market about the
amount of borrowing required.
In spite of the news, some dealers expressed faint hopes that the Bundesbank
might announce at cut in the Lombard rate at today's council meeting.
The Lombard rate - now 9 per cent - acts as a ceiling on overnight money
rates, while the 7.5 per cent discount rate provides the effective floor to
call money.
The Liffe bund future, which opened at 96.08, fell from its high of 96.13 to
a low of 95.66 before ending at around 95.68 in heavy volume.
UK government bonds lost between  1/8 and  1/4 of a point yesterday in the
middle and longer-dated maturities, taking their cue from the German bond
market.
Some of the sluggishness was attributed to residual disappointment over the
March public sector borrowing requirement and the rise in inflation,
announced in the past few days. The gilt market will be closely watching
today's labour market figures, including average earnings and unit labour
costs, for positive news.
Dealers added that some positioning was taking place ahead of the April 28
gilt auction.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as the yen reached an historic high
against the dollar in Tokyo trading and the stock market continued to slip
back.
The yen touched 109.90 to the dollar, ending at 110.35 in Tokyo. The
strength of the yen against the dollar raised hopes of monetary easing,
dealers said.
The fall in the stock market, which closed lower for the fourth consecutive
day, also helped to lift bond futures. The Nikkei average index closed down
55.42 points at 19,773.01.
The futures contract, which was heavily traded, rose from its opening price
of 109.29 to a high of 109.45 before ending the day at 109.40.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 bond moved in a range
of 4.19 to 4.235 per cent, and closed at 4.225 per cent against its opening
level of 4.205 per cent.
Dealers said the new supply of 10-year bonds at Tuesday's auction was
probably the main explanation for the underperformance of the cash market.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly in dull trading yesterday as the market
patiently awaited more news on the economy.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 104
7/8, yielding 6.740 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also up  1/16 at 100 1/4, to yield 3.722 per cent.
The day opened quietly, with dealers and investors trading cautiously ahead
of the next set of economic data - today's weekly jobless claims report.
The only action in the morning was the Fed's buying of two-, three-, five-
and seven-year notes, apparently on behalf of the Bank of Japan. The
Japanese central bank had intervened earlier in the week to support the US
currency against the soaring yen. It was believed yesterday that the BoJ was
using those newly-acquired dollars to buy Treasury securities, via the Fed.
In the afternoon, the Treasury announced it would sell Dollars 15.25bn in
two-year and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes next week. The figures
surprised analysts, who had been expecting the Treasury to cut the size of
each issue.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Eurobond debut for Republic
of Colombia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Colombia will make its debut in the Eurobond market next
week with a Dollars 125m five-year bond issue aimed at establishing a
benchmark for external fund-raising.
The proceeds will be used to pay off existing borrowings. Colombia's
external debt has remained at between Dollars 17bn and Dollars 18bn for the
past six years, about 34 per cent of last year's estimated GDP.
Mr Rudolf Hommes, finance minister, said he expected Colombian borrowers -
public and private - to follow over time, but there would no flood of issues
and the country's debt ratios would continue to decline in coming years.
Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil company, would probably be the most
active borrower. Ecopetrol is scheduled to launch a debut Eurobond of
Dollars 120m next month.
As a guide to the yield spread for the republic's new issue, Bankers Trust
International, lead managers, pointed to the United Mexican States 7 1/4 per
cent bond due 1998, launched in February at 208 basis points above the
benchmark five-year US Treasury.
However, some Latin American debt analysts said that Colombia's first issue
should come at a small premium to the latest Mexican bond, suggesting the
220-230 basis point range.
Colombia is not rated by either Standard &amp; Poor's or Moody's, but Bankers
Trust says it should attract an investment grade rating. The factors
stressed were: the country's sound record on servicing debt - it did not
reschedule its borrowings in 1980s debt crisis; the economic growth rate,
which has averaged 3.4 per cent a year in real terms since 1980; the current
account surplus; and a negligible budget deficit.
Representatives of merchant banks at yesterday's presentation in London
agreed that Colombia had a good economic record, but pointed to political
and social risks, including the activities of terrorist groups and drug
traffickers.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM's German unit records its
first annual loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IBM Deutschland yesterday recorded its first annual loss as a result of
recession, weak prices and restructuring.
The company recorded a net loss of DM443m (Dollars 277m) for 1992. The costs
of restructuring the company, which entailed dividing IBM Deutschland into
several independent companies under the umbrella of the holding company, as
well as reducing the workforce, totalled DM892m.
Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel, chairman, said the company managed to achieve an
operating profit of DM272m. However, 'we made a decision to place a burden
on our financial balance in order to ensure a healthier future', he said.
A programme to reduce the workforce was introduced last year: by the end of
1992, full-time employees had been reduced to from 31,536 to 24,651. The
introduction of a flexible retirement scheme and compensation is intended to
reduce the workforce by a further 3,500 by the end of this year.
IBM senior officials said the pressure to cut costs stemmed not only from
the fundamental management changes being undertaken in the parent company in
the US. 'We now have to cope with a recession in Germany, which has come
late, and has hit us hard,' said Mr Wilfried Daudt, financial controller of
IBM Deutschland.
Total revenue fell by 6.8 per cent to DM13.8bn in 1992. Over the same
period, domestic revenue fell by 7.8 per cent to DM9.5bn. Export revenue
fell 4.8 per cent to DM4.3bn.
However, total revenue from services showed a small increase, from DM3.8bn
to DM3.9bn. Software and services now account for 41 per cent of total
domestic revenue.
IBM Deutschland believes it was lulled into a sense of false confidence once
the Berlin Wall was removed in November 1989. 'With unification we had a
boom. Large western German companies were ordering from us. Investment in
eastern Germany was high on the agenda of the business community in western
Germany,' said a senior IBM official.
'The slowdown started last June. Western German companies are cutting back
their investment plans in eastern Germany and looking at costs. Some are
even taking other systems.'

Dollars 360m

<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the international aerospace and transit equipment group, has
lodged a CDollars 450m (USDollars 360m) claim with the prime contractor in
the Channel tunnel project, which is to link Britain and France, to cover
the cost of late design changes to 250 shuttle wagons it is building.
The prime contractor, TransManche Link, comprising a group of construction
companies, awarded Bombardier the CDollars 700m shuttle contract order three
years ago. The equipment is being built by Bombardier's Eurorail unit in
Europe.
TML itself is in dispute with Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel owner, over
cost over-runs.
Bombardier halted output of wagons at Eurorail's Bruges plant in Belgium
nearly two months ago, saying it could not deliver because TML had not
provided certification for the first 10 prototypes.
Bombardier's claim is nearly twice industry estimates. Mr Laurent Baudoin,
chairman, said the claim would be subject to arbitration.
In the year ended last January, Bombardier earned C4132.8m, or 85 cents a
share. This was up 23 per cent from CDollars 107.7m, or 73 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues advanced to CDollars 4.4bn, against CDollars 3.1bn.
The revenue increase partly reflected an acquisition. All parts of the
business did better except transit equipment which posted a loss of CDollars
73m before tax.
Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 42.1m, or 27 cents, against CDollars
37m, or 24 cents, a year earlier.
Talisman Energy, formerly BP Canada, had first-quarter earnings of CDollars
7.9m, or 16 cents a share, against Dollars 2m, or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 63m, against Dollars 53.5m.

The Shangri-La group is ultimately controlled by Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian
Chinese businessman who made his initial fortune in the commodities trade
and is known as Asia's 'Sugar King'.
Mr Kuok is believed to have interests in several hotels in China and last
month purchased a 510-room hotel in Xian in central China. It is understood
that Shangri-La Asia will be used to buy Hong Kong and China hotels from Mr

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday reported a 31 per
cent increase in net profits before abnormal items to ADollars 67.4m
(Dollars 48.35m) for the 40 weeks to April 4. Sales were up 11 per cent to
ADollars 1.4bn.
MIM said it had benefited from a more favourable exchange rate for the
Australian dollar, increased gold production at the Porgera and Tick Hill
gold mines, and reduced costs at Mount Isa, its Queensland base.
The group said copper production at Mount Isa reached record levels in the
third quarter, partly because of changes to more flexible work practices
which allow mining seven days a week.
However, operating profit fell by ADollars 11m to ADollars 81m after taking
account of an abnormal profit of ADollars 13.4m, compared with a similar
profit of ADollars 45.7m in the comparable period of the previous year.
For the third quarter, MIM reported a net operating profit of ADollars
16.3m, compared with ADollars 30.1m in the comparable period of the previous
year. The group said the fall was caused by a higher tax charge and lower
lead and zinc prices.
The group reported a bottom line loss of ADollars 500,000 for the quarter
after accounting for net abnormal losses of ADollars 12.3m, net foreign
exchange losses of ADollars 3.3m, and minorities of ADollars 1.2m. It made a
profit of ADollars 22.5m in the comparable period of the previous year.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Parmalat exercises its appetite
for acquisition - How an Italian dairy products company is expanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARMALAT, the dairy products group burdened by heavy debts and troublesome
diversification in the 1980s, could become Italy's biggest listed foods
concern of the 1990s. No Italian foods operation offers the same
ingredients.
Barilla, the big pasta and biscuits maker, is privately-owned; SME, the
state-controlled foods, caterer and retailer, is being dismembered;
Eridania, the Ferruzzi-controlled sugar group, has been merged with
Ferruzzi's Paris-based Beghin Say; while Buitoni is owned by Nestle of
Switzerland.
Swelled by acquisitions, group sales surged 23 per cent to L1,636bn (Dollars
1.07bn) last year and should reach about L2,800bn in 1993. Net profits for
Parmalat Finanziaria, the listed holding company, rose by almost 24 per cent
to L52bn and are forecast to rise again.
The results complete a remarkable recovery. Three years ago, Parmalat seemed
in danger of foundering under excessive borrowing, the effects of costly
diversification into television by the controlling Tanzi family and the
after-effects of an aborted takeover by Kraft Foods of the US.
However, enough banks were willing to gamble on a restructuring. After a
complex transaction, debt was reduced by a substantial cash injection, the
Tanzi's shareholding in Parmalat declined, and a number of merchant banks,
notably Milan-based Akros, became more closely involved with the management
of the company.
Since then, Parmalat, run by Mr Domenico Barili, director-general, has not
looked back.
Growth in Italy has come through buying regional diaries to build up market
share. This month, it took control of Giglio, the biggest dairy group in the
Emilia Romagna region.
The deal will raise Parmalat's big share of the Italian long-life milk
market above 34 per cent, from 30 per cent.
Giglio is the largest of a string of dairy industry purchases Parmalat is
targeting this year. Its list includes a number of municipally-owned milk
companies. Bovisio, a small town near Milan, is already in the bag and the
group is in talks for others in Verona and Brindisi.
Parmalat would like more. The milk business is municipally-owned in 10 of
the biggest cities, and a number are due to be privatised. Last year,
Parmalat purchased businesses in Genova and Como, the two main
privatisations so far.
Parmalat is also is also interested in the privatisation of the big SME
foods group, which has put its Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica subsidiaries up for
sale.
Despite the opportunities in Italy, most of Parmalat's growth will come from
abroad. Sales in Europe, excluding Italy, jumped by 164 per cent to L66bn
last year. In South America - mainly Brazil and Argentina - turnover climbed
almost 29 per cent to L260bn, while US sales reached L13bn.
Turnover in Latin America should double due partly to the purchase of
Lacesa, a dairy products group in southern Brazil, and its associated
Sodilac company, which have sales of about Dollars 80m. Together, the 10
planned takeovers in the region should push up Parmalat's Latin America
revenues to about L650bn from L260bn last year.
The US marks Parmalat's latest attempt at expansion. This year, it has
already bought an Atlanta diary, with sales of about L100bn.
Mr Tanzi believes the US, Latin America and eastern Europe are the main
areas for expansion.
Is Parmalat over-extending itself? 'It is a risk', admits Mr Tanzi. Though
its acquisitions are often accompanied by tough restructuring, he hopes the
best staff in the companies acquired can be encouraged to stay on.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: South Korea moves on banking
corruption - A look at the government's campaign to reform and modernise the
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT PROMISES to be a tumultuous year for South Korea's 23 commercial banks as
the government prepares extensive reforms to restructure the industry.
Banks have already become the first business sector to feel the full impact
of the new government's anti-corruption campaign.
The presidents of Korea First Bank, Bank of Seoul and BorAm Bank have been
forced to resign within the past month for allegedly receiving 'commissions'
in return for loans or for other questionable lending practices.
Corruption is claimed to be widespread in banking. A recent survey by the
Federation of Korean Industries said that 30 per cent of businessmen report
that they have had to bribe bank officials to acquire loans. Banks also
often require corporate borrowers to make compensating deposits in return
for loans.
Analysts explain, however, that the corrupt practices are a result of strict
government regulations that have prevented the banks from operating
efficiently.
Banks demand compensating deposits for loans because most of their deposit
rates are set by the government at a lower level than those offered by
short-term finance companies, making it difficult for banks to attract
money.
The government also requires the banks to provide as much as half of their
loans at below market rates to designated strategic industries. The
resulting shortage of capital has encouraged the bribery of bank executives
by other borrowers to obtain credit.
The state's tight control reflects the prominent role the banks have played
in the country's centralised planned economy during the past three decades.
Banks were chiefly used to funnel money at favourable rates to industries
the government considered vital for economic development.
Although the country's financial industry has expanded rapidly to meet
growing capital needs, banks have less autonomy than competing finance and
investment companies and their management is subject to political influence.
Many bank presidents are still appointed by the government, despite the
privatisation of most banks in the 1980s.
The new government of President Kim Young-sam believes that deregulation of
the banking industry will promote more efficient allocation of credit, while
reducing corruption, one of the main goals of his administration.
Other senior bank executives are likely to be ousted as the government
purges corrupt officials and tries to de-politicise the banking sector by
encouraging the independent selection of managers. This is considered a
crucial step to loosening the close ties between banks and government.
More fundamental reforms were promised this week in the government's
five-year economic plan. Almost all interest rates are scheduled to be
deregulated by 1997. Although this will allow banks to attract more deposits
by offering higher rates, it will also harm earnings by narrowing the
interest rate spread, which was 2.32 per cent last year.
The healthy spread guaranteed under the regulated system contributed to the
28.4 per cent rise in 1992 operating profits for commercial banks, which
totaled Won2,596bn (Dollars 3.28bn). Total net profits grew by 12.9 per cent
to Won931bn. Korea First had the best earnings performance with Won355bn in
operating profits and Won147bn in net earnings.
The pace of interest rate de-regulation and other reforms, however, is
likely to be dictated by the banks' ability to solve their potentially
serious bad-loan problem.
Government officials worry that rapid deregulation could threaten the
survival of several banks and force the state to rescue them.
The banks are saddled with a large number of non-performing loans because
they have been forced to give low-interest - and barely profitable - 'policy
loans' to industries selected by the government.
The extent of the problem is unknown. The Office of Bank Supervision has not
released precise figures on bad loans since 1990. Moreover, Korea's lax
accounting rules 'permit plenty of scope for the banks to manipulate their
accounts' and hide their non-performing assets, according to a recent
analysis by the Seoul office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK brokerage.
'Given the limited amount of disclosure, this area is a veritable
minefield,' BZW added. It estimates that ratio of non-performing loans
averaged 8.8 per cent of total credits for the six largest and oldest city
banks - Commercial Bank of Korea, Korea Exchange Bank, Cho Hung Bank, Bank
of Seoul, Korea First Bank and Hanil Bank. They account for almost 90 per
cent of total estimated bad loans of Won10,200bn.
The average bad loan ratio for the 10 provincial banks was 4.6 per cent and
2 per cent for the seven new commercial banks that have been established in
the past decade.
If these estimates are accurate, the country's biggest banks will have to
increase substantially their provisions for loan losses beyond the 2 per
cent of total credit now required by the government.
They need to raise capital not only to cover bad loans, but also to meet the
Bank of International Settlements capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by
1995. Only Shinhan Bank is believed able to fulfil the BIS requirement so
far. But raising capital through share issues may be difficult due to the
sluggish performance of the Seoul bourse.
The government has promised to solve the bad loan problem, although it has
offered few remedies. One likely solution is to allow banks to engage in
other financial sectors, such as brokerage and investment consultation, to
increase turnover and profits.
The government is likely to encourage bank mergers by easing rules on
ownership that limit individual shareholders to a 8 per cent stake.
Mr Park Jae-yoon, the former head of research at the Korea Federation of
Banks, predicted last year that Korea will have two or three mega-banks by
the end of decade, a development that he described as 'inevitable'. Mr Park
is now chief economic adviser to President Kim, and a key architect of
country's financial reforms.

Anglovaal advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION in losses at the Loraine mine and an improved performance from
flagship Hartebeestfontein helped the Anglovaal group record increased
profits from its gold mines in the three months to the end of March.
Loraine, which has recorded losses for nearly three years, reduced its net
losses to R2m (Dollars 600,000m) from R2.9m in the December quarter.
The mine has received permission to operate on Sundays, and the management
says this should boost the June quarter result.
Hartebeestfontein lifted after-tax profits to R36.4m from R32m in December.
This improvement was the result of lower costs and increased production at
the low-grade gold plant, as well as from the main underground operations.
Here an increased milling rate and better grade boosted gold recoveries to
6,906kg from 6,525 the previous quarter.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Gengold ahead 18% on tight cost
control

<TEXT>
IMPROVED cost control and a rising gold price helped Gengold, the gold arm
of South Africa's Gencor group, lift after-tax profits by 18 per cent to
R76.6m for the three months to the end of March from R65.1m (Dollars 20.4m)
in the quarter to the end of December.
The group also announced three medium-sized capital projects at the Beatrix,
Buffelsfontein and Kinross mines, which are in total worth about R200m,
reflecting increased confidence in the industry's prospects.
The trend in the group towards mining less, but higher grade, ore continued.
Compared with the March 1992 quarter, the group milled 18 per cent less ore,
but an increase in the average grade to 6 grams per tonne from 5.2 grams
meant total gold produced was only 5 per cent lower at 17,156kg, compared
with 18,037kg.
Total working costs for the group were 8 per cent lower than a year ago,
with unit costs nearly 4 per cent lower at R26,699 per kg gold produced
against R27,626 per kg.
The effect of hedging transactions and a firmer gold price was a 2 per cent
increase in the average price received to R32,942 per kg from R32,304 per kg
the previous quarter.
Buffelsfontein plans to spend R74.6m on its Multigold project which allows
for a more sophisticated dump treatment operation, raising gold recoveries
to 80 per cent from 40 per cent. The project offers an 18 per cent real rate
of return. Production costs at the operation will be R17,000 per kg.
Meanwhile, Beatrix plans to spend R77m to sink a minor shaft which will give

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: JAL plans hiring freeze for
flight attendants

<TEXT>
JAPAN Airlines, the country's largest carrier, plans to cancel its annual
intake of Japanese flight attendants for next spring as a continuing
downturn in passenger has led to an intensification of its cost-cutting
drive.
JAL has been hit by a fall of almost one-fifth in the number of business and
first class passengers last year as Japanese companies have sought to cut
costs.
The recruiting freeze, the first since 1976, follows the delayed start of
training for this year's intake of 386 flight attendants, who are likely to
start in September.
The airline is still under pressure to cut costs to reach its goal of
breaking even this year as it has forecast a pre-tax loss of Y50bn (Dollars
438.6m) for the year to March, compared with a Y6bn loss in the previous
year. JAL has suspended its dividend payment.
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), a leading Japanese heavy
machinery maker, is to cut about 500 jobs in its aircraft engine division by
the fiscal year ending March 1997, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The company expects to reduce jobs by hiring fewer recruits, relocating
employees and through attrition. IHI blamed Japan's cut in defence spending,
the airline recession and the sharp appreciation of the yen.

The Indian government has approved the plan.
A joint venture to be called GE-Apar will make florescent lighting tubes to
compete with Philips, of the Netherlands, which dominates the Indian market.
State-owned Indian Petrochemicals Corporation and GE will jointly
manufacture a range of engineering plastics in Baroda in western India.

move into chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAWASAKI Steel, a leading Japanese steel producer, yesterday announced a
restructuring plan that includes shedding 3,200 jobs during the next three
years and the delaying of its drive into the semiconductor market.
The rapid appreciation of the yen combined with the domestic economic
downturn has forced Kawasaki to launch the cost-cutting drive, which is
similar to those adopted by most Japanese steelmakers during the tough years
of the mid-1980s.
By March 1996, the company hopes to have only 14,800 workers, down from the
present 18,000. Kawasaki does not plan to sack workers, but will introduce
an early retirement scheme and not replace those who leave the company.
Capital spending over the next three years has been cut to an annual Y45bn
(Dollars 394.7m) from a previously-planned Y80bn, while a Y25bn
semiconductor plant due to be constructed in 1995 has been delayed for at
least a year, thwarting the company's ambition to become a leader in
electronics.
Like most other Japanese steelmakers, Kawasaki turned to the electronics
industry in the mid-1980s in the belief that semiconductors would be the
'industrial rice' of the future, in the same way that steel was an
industrial staple in the past.
Steel demand has fallen in tandem with the downturn in the Japanese car,
machinery and construction industries, and the pressure to shed staff and
cut costs would be greater but for unexpectedly strong export orders from
China, running at four times the levels of a year ago.
For the year ended last month, Kawasaki expects sales of about Y1,100bn,
down from Y1,208bn in the previous year, and a pre-tax profit of Y7.5bn, a
fall of just over 80 per cent. Longer-term goals were also revised
yesterday, with sales in the year ending March 1996 now forecast at
Y1,400bn, compared to an earlier target of Y1,700bn.

decline in net
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters which is 48 per cent
owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday unveiled third-quarter net
earnings of Dollars 800,000, or 3 cents a share, down from Dollars 4.9m, or
16 cents, a year ago.
In the 1993 quarter, Smith Corona had restructuring charges of Dollars
800,000. Sales in the three months fell to Dollars 76.8m from Dollars 86.5m.
Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, said total unit sales fell in
the third quarter in spite of increased shipments of personal word
processors.
For the first nine months, Smith Corona recorded a net loss of Dollars
300,000, or 1 cent a share, against net earnings of Dollars 16m, or 53
cents, the previous year. Sales slid to Dollars 244.8m from Dollars 285.4m.
The company had restructuring charges of Dollars 10.3m in the 1993 period.
The company said it was in discussions on a new revolving credit facility
which it expected to be in place before the current agreement expires in
October.
'Our balance sheet remains strong and out new agreement will provide us with
the requisite working capital financing for the foreseeable future,' Mr
Thompson said.

68.7m

<TEXT>
REPUBLIC New York, the commercial and savings bank group that is 29 per cent
controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, the Geneva-based financier, yesterday said
its first-quarter 1993 net income rose by 13.8 per cent to Dollars 68.7m, or
Dollars 1.15 a share.
The New York bank also said it had signed an agreement to acquire SafraCorp
California, a private banking business that was wholly-owned by Mr Safra.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but SafraCorp has three offices in the
Los Angeles area and assets of Dollars 83.8m.
Mr Walter Weiner, chairman of Republic New York, said the deal represented
an opportunity to expand in the California private banking market.
Republic's net interest income in the first quarter of 1993 was Dollars
191.5m, up by 13 per cent year-on-year. Bad debt provisions in the quarter
were Dollars 25m, compared with Dollars 20m a year ago.
Income from trading activities was Dollars 39.2m, compared with Dollars
28.9m a year ago. Interest income from taxable investment securities rose to
Dollars 216.7m from Dollars 188.3m.
Fleet Financial, the Rhode Island-based banking group, yesterday reported
first-quarter net income of Dollars 106.3m, or 66 cents a share, more than
twice the level a year ago.
Mr Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman, said that this was the first quarter
since the end of 1989 when all operating subsidiaries had been profitable.
The profit performance was driven by a strong net interest margin, lower
problem assets and cost savings resulting from the integration of the former
Bank of New England network into Fleet's operations.
Net interest income was Dollars 513m in the quarter, compared with Dollars
472m a year ago. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 85m, down from Dollars
111m in the first quarter of 1992.
Non-interest income was Dollars 324m, up from Dollars 278m a year ago.

COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products company, saw profits increase
from Dollars 113.8m to Dollars 140.8m in the first quarter of 1993, before
charges related to changes in accounting rules, writes Nikki Tait.
Sales were up from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 1.7bn, and earnings per share
(again before accounting-related charges) rose from 74 cents to 85 cents.
Mr Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman, said that strong sales increases in
Latin America, Asia and in the Hill's Pet Nutrition division offset 'the
effects of economic softness' in the US, and the less favourable currency
exchange rates in Europe.

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, reported unexpected losses
for the second quarter as its struggle to achieve sustained profitability
faltered, despite increased sales of its new open systems products.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 7.6m, or 22 cents per share,
compared with losses of Dollars 55.3m, or Dollars 1.69 per share, in the
same period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of
Dollars 48m.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 267.4m, compared with Dollars 273.8m.
The company said that without the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange
rate changes, revenue would have been slightly higher than last year.
'We are not satisfied with the overall results, primarily in the revenue
area,' said Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, 'but we are
encouraged by the continued success of our open systems computers.'
Data General is in the midst of a transition from its traditional
proprietary minicomputer products to open systems based upon industry
standards. Revenues for these open systems showed significant growth in the
quarter, Mr Skates said.
Wall Street analysts had been expecting Data General to report profits of
around 4 cents per share. The company's stock closed at Dollars 9 1/2 in New
York yesterday, down from Tuesday's close of Dollars 10 1/4 .
For the first six months of fiscal 1993, the company reported a net loss of
Dollars 6.8m, or 20 cents per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars
51.3m, or Dollars 1.58 per share, including the restructuring charge.
Revenues for the first half were Dollars 547.1m, down from Dollars 568.6m in
the same period last year.
'We are confident that our open-systems strategy is in line with the needs
of the marketplace,' said Mr Skates. 'However, we continue to be very
cautious for the short-term in light of the continuing weak worldwide
economy and because we see no evidence that industry-wide pricing pressures
will abate in the near future.'

UNITED Technologies, the US high technology company, yesterday reported a 32
per cent drop in first quarter like-for-like net income, due to plunging
profits at its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine division, which has been hit hard
by the problems of the world airline industry.
UTC reported net income of Dollars 64m, or 42 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 94m, or 68 cents, in the same period of last year before the impact
of a 1992 accounting change. Revenues totalled Dollars 4.9bn, down from
Dollars 5.2bn.
Pratt's earnings totalled Dollars 13m, down from Dollars 151m for the same
period of last year, while its revenues were Dollars 1.4bn, compared with
Dollars 1.8bn.
This more than offset improved performances in other businesses. Flight
systems reported income of Dollars 82m, up from Dollars 40m, thanks to
improved deliveries of Sikorsky helicopters. Otis elevator made Dollars 94m,
up from Dollars 80m, and automotive parts made Dollars 37m, up from Dollars
13m.
The drop in Pratt's sales and earnings was due to lower engine shipments and
sharply reduced spare part sales. Spares are among the most lucrative parts
of the aero-engine business, but during downturns airlines cut back on the
size of their fleets and spares inventories.
The company said commercial spare part sales in the quarter averaged Dollars
94m a month, down from Dollars 154m a month in the same period of last year.
However, after two exceptionally low quarters for orders at the end of 1992,
spares orders had improved in the latest quarter.
Cigna, the Philadelphia-based composite insurer, is reorganising its
property-casualty operations into three business units, in an effort to
become a 'specialist' company, AP-DJ reports.
The reorganisation, which takes effect immediately, will create divisions
focusing on large risks, standard commercial business and special markets
respectively.
Transamerica, the US financial services group which last week sold its
property and casualty insurance unit to the public for Dollars 1bn,
yesterday reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 91.8m, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
A year ago, the group recorded net income of Dollars 83.6m, although that
included Dollars 12.5m from the discontinued insurance operations.
Transamerica's remaining life insurance business, which posted a 19 per cent
increase in income to Dollars 51.8m, made the biggest contribution to group
earnings.

<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday
reported an underlying improvement in first-quarter profits, at Dollars 58m,
up from Dollars 35m in the same period of 1992.
However, two charges meant that the bottom-line figure for the
Michigan-based group showed a Dollars 162m loss after tax in the most recent
three months.
One of these was a Dollars 180m item, related to accounting rule changes;
the second was a Dollars 40m charge to adjust the value of certain accounts
held by Whirlpool Financial Corporation.
Whirlpool had warned the stock market of the Dollars 40m item.
Whirlpool's first-quarter sales rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, and Mr
David Whitwam, chairman, described operating performance as 'excellent'.
The company said shipments in the North American market outpaced the
industry average of about 3 per cent, and operating profits grew even more
substantially.
In Europe, shipments rose only slightly, but margins increased. In Latin
America and Asia, there was a 'marked' advance in both shipments and
revenues.
The Brazilian affiliates also swung into profit, having suffered losses a
year ago.

THE EQUITABLE, the large US life insurer which recently 'demutualised' as
part of an effort to bolster its capital base, yesterday announced it had
completed an Dollars 800m private placement of depositary shares. Almost
half the new investment came from Axa, the French insurer.
The new depositary shares represent underlying cumulative convertible
prefered stock.
The stock carries a 6 per cent annual dividend and is convertible after July
22 1994 into about 32.7m shares of Equitable common stock, at a conversion
price of Dollars 24.50 a share.
Axa had invested Dollars 1bn into The Equitable ahead of the
demutualisation. This, in turn, bought the French company a 49 per cent
interest in the US insurer, when the demutualisation plan and an associated
stockmarket flotation of Equitable shares was completed.
Axa's subscription in The Equitable's latest capital-raising exercise means
it maintains its underlying interest in the US company. The remaining
depository shares were purchased by unnamed institutional investors.
The Equitable said yesterday that 'a significant portion' of the placement
proceeds would be used to increase the capital of group's life insurance
subsidiaries. This would be achieved through direct capital contributions
and the possible purchase of the capital stocks of Equitable Real Estate
Investment Management, a subsidiary of the group.
'Additional actions to increase the capital of the insurance subsidiaries
may also include asset securitisation of certain investment assets,' it
said.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers disappoints with

BRISTOL-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday
disappointed Wall Street with its first quarter earnings of Dollars 574.7m,
or Dollars 1.11 a share.
On the New York Stock Exchange shares in Bristol-Myers eased Dollars 1 1/8
to close at Dollars 60 7/8. Analysts had expected the company to earn about
Dollars 1.13 a share in the 1993 quarter.
A year earlier, Bristol-Myers turned in net income of Dollars 301.5m, or 59
cents.
Stripping out the impact of accounting changes and earnings from
discontinued operations, the company earned Dollars 534.2m, or Dollars 1.06,
last year. Sales rose 4 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 2.76bn
from Dollars 2.64bn.
Bristol-Myers's 8 per cent improvement in underlying first-quarter earnings
contrasts with a 10 per cent rise in underlying profits from Merck and
Pfizer's 25 per cent leap in underlying earnings from ongoing operations in
the same period.
Bristol-Myers, which was one of the first big drugs companies to cut its
workforce in response to increasing industry competition, has fallen from
favour among many analysts after its disappointing performance in 1992.
In January, Wertheim Schroder analyst Mr Jonathan Gelles warned that
Bristol-Myers's most important drugs had peaked in use.

SMITH Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters which is 48 per cent
owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday unveiled third-quarter net
earnings of Dollars 800,000, or 3 cents a share, down from Dollars 4.9m, or
16 cents, a year ago.
In the 1993 quarter, Smith Corona had restructuring charges of Dollars
800,000. Sales in the three months fell to Dollars 76.8m from Dollars 86.5m.
Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, said total unit sales fell in
the third quarter in spite of increased shipments of personal word
processors.
For the first nine months, Smith Corona recorded a net loss of Dollars
300,000, or 1 cent a share, against net earnings of Dollars 16m, or 53
cents, the previous year. Sales slid to Dollars 244.8m from Dollars 285.4m.
The company had restructuring charges of Dollars 10.3m in the 1993 period.
The company said it was in discussions on a new revolving credit facility
which it expected to be in place before the current agreement expires in
October.
'Our balance sheet remains strong and out new agreement will provide us with
the requisite working capital financing for the foreseeable future,' Mr
Thompson said.

PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US drugs companies, posted a 25 per cent
rise in first-quarter underlying earnings from continuing operations, writes
Karen Zagor.
Net income for the 1993 first quarter was Dollars 329m, or Dollars 1.01 a
share, on sales of Dollars 1.87bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 14.8m,
or 4 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.76bn, a year earlier. Accounting changes
reduced 1992 earnings by Dollars 312.6m.
Pfizer has divested and closed businesses and took restructuring charges in
both years.
Excluding unusual items, Pfizer said net income from ongoing operations was
Dollars 350.3m, or Dollars 1.07, on sales of Dollars 1.86bn in the latest
quarter against earnings of Dollars 279.8m, or 83 cents, on sales of Dollars
1.63bn a year earlier.
Mr William Steere, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Virtually all our
sales growth was from increased volume.'

AMOCO, the Chicago-based energy company, yesterday reported a net profit of
Dollars 229m, or 46 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1993, which
compares with a loss of Dollars 619m, or Dollars 1.25 per share, in the
year-ago quarter.
At the operating level, Amoco earned Dollars 343m, or 69 cents, in the first
quarter of 1993, but this excluded Dollars 170m of write-downs from
exploration in the Congo and tax benefits of Dollars 56m derived from asset
disposals.
The comparable 1992 operating figure was Dollars 257m, or 52 cents, before
Dollars 924m of charges resulting from accounting changes and tax benefits
of Dollars 48m.
Amoco's first-quarter revenues were Dollars 6.978bn, up slightly from
Dollars 56.389bn a year ago.
Mr Laurance Fuller, Amoco chairman, said that, exclusive of the special
items, the company's earnings benefited from cost-reduction efforts.
He said US exploration and production operations also improved, reflecting
higher natural gas and crude oil prices and higher gas volumes.
Worldwide capital and exploration spending in the quarter declined to
Dollars 597m from Dollars 634m in the first quarter of last year.
The company is planning to spend Dollars 1.5bn to develop a large oilfield
in the South China Sea, in an area 120 miles south-east of Hong Kong.
Schlumberger, the energy industry services group, yesterday unveiled a net
loss of Dollars 114.8m in the first quarter of 1993, compared with a net
profit of Dollars 156.3m a year ago.
The company said the loss was caused by a Dollars 248m extraordinary debit
resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards.
Excluding the special charge Schlumberger would have had profits of Dollars
133.2m, down by 15 per cent year-on-year.
Revenues in the 1993 quarter were Dollars 1.62bn, up slightly from Dollars
1.59bn a year ago.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications and computer
group, yesterday unveiled a 12.8 per cent increase in first-quarter income,
excluding changes in accounting methods which led to a net loss of Dollars
5.6bn.
Mr Robert Allen, chairman, said that, excluding the accounting changes, the
results augured well for the rest of the year.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief financial officer, said the group's target of at least
10 per cent annual growth in earnings was on a 'sound footing'.
The company reported net income of Dollars 996m, or 74 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 883m, or 67 cents, in the same period of last year.
This became a net loss of Dollars 5.6bn, or Dollars 4.19, after a Dollars
7.02bn charge for changes in accounting for retiree health benefits and a
Dollars 383m gain for changes in tax accounting methods.
All US companies are implementing these changes and AT&amp;T's charge, which
does not affect cash-flow, had already been announced.
Revenues rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 15.72bn, 'driven by growth in
financial and long-distance services and sales of network communications
products and micro-electronic components'.
In the long-distance telecommunications market, AT&amp;T's first-quarter calling
volume rose 5 per cent, year-on-year, while revenues rose Dollars 94m, or 1
per cent. Long-distance margins rose to 37 per cent, up 2 percentage points
from a year ago.
Equipment sales rose 2.9 per cent, helped by increased in network
communications products and microelectronic components. Revenues from
communications products and systems, which include business phone systems
and consumer products, were roughly the same as a year ago.
However, NCR, the computer company acquired by AT&amp;T nearly two years ago,
saw revenues drop to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.53bn a year ago, which
the company blamed on weak demand in Europe and Asia/Pacific and general
industry softness.
The subsidiary had an operating loss of Dollars 20m, after a Dollars 50m
restructuring charge, against a Dollars 46m profit. Mr Mandl said the charge
was designed to reduce NCR's cost structure in the US and Europe, and this
action, with an improving order book, suggested the 1993 results would be
better than last year.
Group operating expenses in the quarter rose 3.3 per cent, or Dollars 146m,
mainly because of higher spending on advertising and sales support in the
long-distance market, where AT&amp;T faces a marketing war.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Nucor plans to expand capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, is to greatly expand capacity
at a plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which has shaken up the industry by
its use of a radical, new technology.
The company is to expand the plant's annual capacity from 1m tons a year to
1.8m tons.
The expansion would cost less than Dollars 40m, would increase the number of
employees by only 10 per cent, and would be in operation by the second
quarter of 1994.
The company pioneered the thin-slab casting method of making sheet steel at
the Crawfordsville plant, which began operations in 1989.
This makes sheet steel much more cheaply than conventional methods, since it
cuts out several stages of the manufacturing process.
Last year Nucor opened a second thin-slab plant in Hickman, Arkansas, with
an annual capacity of over 1m tons.
Until Crawfordsville began operations, the high-value sheet market had been
one of the few sectors of the US steel market in which the country's
traditional, integrated manufacturers had been free from competition from
low-cost mini-mills.
However, its lead is being followed by other mini-mill groups and the
integrated manufacturers themselves.

<TEXT>
TWO large eastern Canada newsprint companies with combined annual capacity
of nearly 1.5m tonnes have posted improved first-quarter results, signalling
an end to the three-year slump which has hit the industry.
Donohue, controlled by Quebecor publishing and printing group, reported
profits of CDollars 6.3m, or 18 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars
8.3m, or 26 cents, a year earlier, on sales ahead at CDollars 135m, against
CDollars 114m. Quno reduced its loss to CDollars 4.2m, or 30 cents a share,
from one of CDollars 15.7m a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 127m,
against CDollars 106m. The Chicago Tribune is still the biggest single
shareholder and customer.
Both Canadian companies cited higher prices for newsprint and strong demand
from the eastern US, higher timber prices, lower interest rates and a lower
Canadian dollar.
Donohue, a low-cost producer of kraft pulp as well as newsprint, is seeking
to diversify into higher value added products and is considering a move into
the US.

<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
sharp improvement in first-quarter earnings - in spite of falling US
military spending and a troubled world airline industry.
It announced net earnings of Dollars 216m, or Dollars 5.51 a share,
including Dollars 122m of gains from the resolution of tax issues and the
sale in the UK of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International.
Excluding these gains, earnings totalled Dollars 94m, or Dollars 2.41 a
share, compared with Dollars 20m, or 52 cents, last time. Revenues dropped
from Dollars 4.06bn to Dollars 3.62bn. The company also reported a 10 per
cent reduction in the debt of its aerospace business, from Dollars 2.76bn at
the end of 1992 to Dollars 2.48bn, due to asset sales and improved
operational cash-flow.
It hopes to achieve Dollars 1bn in free cashflow in 1993 and cut debt to
around Dollars 1.8bn by year-end, which would lower its debt to total
capital ratio from 48 per cent at the end of 1992 to around 35 per cent.
The results were better than the market expected and McDonnell Douglas's
shares, which have risen from Dollars 48 at the end of last year, jumped a
further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 in early trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Mr John McDonnell, chairman, said there were two fundamental reasons for the
strong performance: 'Programmes that were doing well have continued to do
well or even better. Second, there were no write-offs or major losses.'
He said this included the controversial C-17 military cargo aircraft
programme, which was close to break-even for the first time in eight
quarters and was expected to see profit later this year.
General Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is shrinking through asset
sales, announced first-quarter earnings after taxes of Dollars 41m on sales
of Dollars 878m, up 37 per cent on the Dollars 30m of earnings a year ago on
sales of Dollars 848m.

<TEXT>
AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday gave a fillip to the
entire US airline sector when it unveiled better-than-expected results for
the first quarter of 1993, and suggested that there was a 'good prospect for
much-needed profitability' ahead.
AMR reported a Dollars 22m loss after tax for the first three months of
1993. This compared with the Dollars 8m profit which the company - one of
the 'big three' US airline operators - made in the same period of 1992
(ahead of accounting-related charges). The first-quarter figures translated
into a loss per share of 43 cents (10 cents profit). Analysts, however, had
been predicting a loss of about Dollars 1 a share.
AMR also made an operating profit (before interest charges and tax) of
Dollars 116m in the most recent quarter, virtually unchanged from the first
quarter of 1992. It said the first three months of 1992 had been fairly
favourable, because Pan Am had just gone out of business leaving American as
the only US carrier operating on a significant scale in Latin America.
AMR is often seen as a bellwether for the US airline industry, and its first
quarter figures are the clearest sign yet that domestic business is
recovering in the absence of any severe fare wars.
Mr Mike Durham, finance director, suggested that even if the recent fare
discounts initiated by Northwest prevailed for a while, 'it would not be a
bad fare for the summer'.
AMR shares bounded Dollars 6 higher on the news, at Dollars 71 1/4, while
United gained Dollars 9 3/4 at Dollars 149 3/4, and Delta rose Dollars 2 3/4
to Dollars 59 1/4. USAir added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 24 1/4.
Ironically, just as the domestic operations look more stable, American
reported mounting problems on the international front. The European
operations almost certainly made a loss in the first quarter - partly, AMR
said, because of recession, aggressive fare discounting, and adverse
currency movements. Latin American results were also down year-on-year,
although the comparison was tough because of the Pan Am situation.
Overall, AMR's revenues were up by 8.8 per cent on the same period of 1992,
at Dollars 3.81bn, while operating expenses increased by 9 per cent to
Dollars 3.7bn. However, Mr Durham said the company still expected unit costs
to be unchanged in 1993.

goods business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PINAULT-PRINTEMPS, the French retail group, yesterday announced plans to
develop its electric goods business by taking a majority stake in the
privately-controlled Groupelec and putting it together with its
publicly-quoted CDME subsidiary.
The resulting company is to be renamed Rexel, with a turnover of some
FFr16.7bn (Dollars 3.09bn), 13,000 employees and 870 retail outlets. The
Pinault group has been selling off some non-core businesses in order to
reduce the debt it assumed in buying the Au Printemps department stores in

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Accor slides to FFr870m for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotel, catering and tourism group, yesterday reported a
15.5 per cent decline in its net profit to FFr870m (Dollars 161m) last year,
from FFr913m the previous year.
The company blamed part of the decline on the poor economic climate.
Although 60 per cent of its business is now outside France, Accor executives
have been among the relatively few French managers who have been quoted in
the press as advocating an end to France's high exchange rate policy, for
fear that it will deter tourists.
The other factor cited for Accor's profit drop was depreciation associated
with its acquisition of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et du
Tourisme. This doubled turnover to FFr30.56bn. The dividend is raised 12.5
per cent to FFr18 a share.
Air France has confirmed that its losses last year deepened to FFr3.2bn from
FFr685m the year before, on total turnover which decreased by 1.1 per cent
over the same period.
The state-owned carrier blamed part of its poorer performance on the
'morose' state of the French market in which it was facing new competition.
But it also revealed that it had made a FFr723m provision to cover costs of
pensions for ground personnel.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT-PRINTEMPS, the French retail group, yesterday announced plans to
develop its electric goods business by taking a majority stake in the
privately-controlled Groupelec and putting it together with its
publicly-quoted CDME subsidiary.
The resulting company is to be renamed Rexel, with a turnover of some
FFr16.7bn (Dollars 3.09bn), 13,000 employees and 870 retail outlets. The
Pinault group has been selling off some non-core businesses in order to
reduce the debt it assumed in buying the Au Printemps department stores in
1991.
But seeing growth in the electrical goods sector, it has since built up its
stake in Groupelec to 49 per cent, and yesterday it said it would raise
this, first to 53.4 per cent and by the end of this year to 60 per cent.
Pinault said a capital increase of FFr150m would be needed to allow the new
company, Rexel, to buy Pinault's shares in Groupelec.
Galeries Lafayette, another department store chain, has announced a steep
fall in profits to FFr69m last year from FFr356m in 1991 but is keeping its
dividend unchanged at FFr11 a share. It blamed its poor performance on the
weakness of the French economy, as well as increased financial charges
arising from its takeover of Galeries Nouvelles.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: AGF blames bank arm for drop in
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASSURANCES Generales de France said yesterday that a FFr963m loss by its
banking subsidiary, Banque du Phenix, was the main reason for the insurance
group's 45 per cent drop in profits to FFr1.49bn (Dollars 275m) last year
and a cut in dividend to FFr12 from FFr13.70.
But Mr Michel Albert, president, said his group had weathered the recession
and property slump better than many other French insurers, and insisted that
AGF, of which the French state owns 75 per cent directly and indirectly, was
still a prime candidate for privat-isation.
He said there was logic in the government selling off state insurers first
rather than waiting for them to enlarge their holdings by buying into
companies already privatised.
AGF claims that the balance sheet of Banque de Phenix has now been
strengthened by the sale, albeit at a discount, of some FFr3.5bn in property
assets to Comptoir des Entrepreneurs.
But the latter property company has had to be recapitalised by its owners,
among them AGF which has a 20.8 per cent stake. AGF's share in Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs loss last year was FFr217m.
Mr Albert said AGF was still on course to become 'a big federal European
insurance group,' with its new alliance with Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligung, the number two German insurance group, in which AGF now has a
controlling 25 per cent stake.
This part of AMB's results will be consolidated into AGF accounts from this
year.
AGF congratulated itself on the rise in profits in its international
operations to FFr122m from FFr56m, largely achieved by more than halving the
losses of its UK branch to FFr108m from FFr274m over the same period.

FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Pehr Gyllenhammar motors on at
Volvo - Concessions and defiance at the Swedish carmaker's AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, chairman of Swedish vehicle maker Volvo, threw out
some notable concessions to small shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting
in Gothenburg. But he offered little sign of retreat when it came to his own
position at the lossmaking company and the strategies he is pursuing.
Indeed, there were were flashes of flamboyance from the man who has been the
driving force at Volvo for 22 years. Arriving for a press conference before
the shareholders' meeting, he cut a dashing figure in a felt fedora hat.
He cheekily told shareholders that the leaders of Aktiespararna, the Swedish
shareholders' association which has pursued him recently, had themselves
refused to reveal to their congress what remuneration they received - a
revelation they were demanding of him.
Mr Gyllenhammar then went into detail about the pay and benefits Volvo has
paid him and other senior executives. He announced the Volvo board was
setting up an audit committee and a committee on management development and
remuneration, in line with the UK Cadbury report on corporate governance.
Aktiespararna has said the report should serve as a model for Swedish
companies.
The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, which
prepared the so-called Cadbury report, concluded that the best practice was
for executive directors' pay to be subject to the recommendations of a
remuneration committee made up wholly or mainly of non-executive directors.
Also, there should be full and clear disclosure of directors' total
executive pay, including pension contributions and stock options.
But Mr Gyllenhammar was less defensive on where Volvo is heading after a
turbulent 1992.
The company posted record losses last year of SKr4.75bn (Dollars 610m) and
announced the closure of two of its three Swedish plants, with the loss of
11,000 jobs.
The crisis at Volvo, Mr Gyllenhammar insisted, was 'partly a myth'.
He said: 'It is more a crisis of Sweden than anything else and, because we
have invested so much in our country, we have suffered. We have therefore
been forced to a brutal adaptation to new realities.'
He tackled head-on the two strategic questions troubling Volvo shareholders:
the company's three-year-old alliance with Renault, the French car and truck
maker; and what its plans are for Procordia, the Swedish food and drugs
group in which Volvo, with 45 per cent of the voting rights, is the largest
shareholder.
Mr Gyllenhammar said Volvo did not intend to retreat from either
relationship.
He announced that he had held 'constructive' new discussions with Mr Carl
Bildt, the prime minister, about Procordia, in which the state holds a 40.4
per cent stake.
Last year, the government blocked Mr Gyllenhammar's attempt to merge Volvo
and Procordia.
Mr Gyllenhammar acknowledged concern that Renault, which owns 10 per cent of
Volvo group and 25 per cent of the car company, might swallow its partner.
He said the two companies would become 'ever more interwoven'. But he
insisted there was no alternative to the alliance.
There were few hints that, with his 58th birthday approaching next week, he
was contemplating stepping down.

attacked

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CB CAPITAL Bank, a Swiss investment bank which is the largest foreign
shareholder in Uni Storebrand, yesterday attacked one of three restructuring
plans being considered for the Norwegian insurer.
Mr Leon Genoud, chairman of CB Bank which owns 4.1 per cent of Uni
Storebrand capital, said the financial restructuring would be
'discriminatory of present shareholders, especially foreign ones.'
The plan, in part, calls for a syndicate of 35 Norwegian companies to
underwrite capital issues of NKr2.8bn (Dollars 413m), including NKr1bn in
new equity capital.
Some 50 per cent of the new share issue will be reserved for members of the
syndicate. One proposal is that the face value of existing shares should be
written down from NKr20 to NKr10.
Details of the other two plans, which have been formulated by an alliance of
creditors, potential new investors and the administrators, have not been
released.
Mr Erik Keiserud, Uni Storebrand chairman, declined to comment on the Swiss
banker's comments. 'We will take his views into consideration,' he said.
Uni Storebrand collapsed last year after over-extending its finances by a
hostile raid on Skandia, the Swedish insurance group.
Mr Genoud said he would have no objection to the plan if existing
shareholders were free to offer to buy all of the 280m new shares, with the
syndicate underwriting any which remain unsold.
In a letter to Mr Keiserud, he writes: 'To pretend that the equity of the
Uni share is less than the nominal value of NKr20 is an insult to
bookkeeping and to common sense.'
Mr Genoud, using figures from the Uni Storebrand annual report, claims that
the book value of Uni shares at the end of last year was NKr54.40 per share,
the 'real value' was NKr103.50. The shares last traded at NKr13.30.

The outcome, marking a further step in the gradual turnaround in Mondadori's

Benedetti in 1990-91, was accompanied by a 13.9 per cent climb in sales to
L1,600bn.
Sales in the first quarter of this year have continued the upward trend,

ACCBANK, the state-run Irish concern being groomed for privatisation,
reported a 31 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 6.51m to
IPounds 8.5m (Pounds 8.41m), in the 1992 year.
Established in 1927 to provide exclusively agricultural loans, the bank has
in the past five years diversified its operations and now trades as an
ordinary high street bank.
It has 45 branches throughout Ireland and a deposit base which expanded last
year by 21 per cent to IPounds 592m.
Interest and other income grew by 19 per cent to IPounds 95.7m (IPounds
80.4m). Total assets rose by 26 per cent to IPounds 860m (IPounds 681m).
The 1992 dividend of IPounds 763,000 goes to the Irish Government, which is
the 100 per cent shareholder.
Last August, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, announced that the
government intended to dispose of ACC. However, those plans have seemingly
been put on hold with the formation of the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition in
January, which in its programme for government talked of a merger with ICC,
another state-run bank, rather than a privatisation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLAT second six months' trading combined with a poor Christmas left
Bentalls, the department store group, Pounds 986,000 in the red at the
pre-tax level for the year to January 30.
The total dividend is cut from 3.85p to 1.9p via a reduced final of 1.3p.
The shares closed 9p down at 108p.
The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 1.4m, came from
turnover of Pounds 72.4m (Pounds 71m). Losses per share emerged at 0.28p
(earnings 2.21p).
Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said that retail conditions were now more
favourable than a year ago.
At January 31 the total value of the group's property interests amounted to
Pounds 68.6m. Largely as a result of the reduction in the revaluation
surplus, shareholders' funds decreased from Pounds 69.7m to Pounds 56.8m and
net asset value per share from 166p to 135p.

The outcome was struck on turnover down from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 34.1m
and after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.92m). These were
related principally to redundancies, reorganisation and property
write-downs.
The company said margins on ductwork trading had been very poor,
particularly in the second half.
After a tax charge of Pounds 782,000 (Pounds 697,000 credit), losses per
share came out at 11.4p (11p). There is no divided for the year - last year
an interim of 0.5p was paid.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dorothy Perkins director quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON, the UK fashion retail group, is expected to announce today that Mr
John Coleman, managing director of the Dorothy Perkins chain, has left the
company because of differences of management style.
But there were rumours within the retail trade last night that Mr Coleman
had been asked to leave after Mr John Hoerner, Burton chief executive,
discovered he had been in discussions with headhunters about other senior
positions - including that of chief executive of the Storehouse group.
Storehouse has been without a chief executive since the resignation of Mr
David Dworkin, who left in February to join the US department store group
Carter Hawley Hale in California. Storehouse has been looking on both sides
of the Atlantic for a replacement.
Mr Coleman last night refused to make any comment on the speculation.
If he were to be appointed to the Storehouse position, it would be a rapid
rise for a man who entered the retail trade only 10 years ago.
However, in the past two years Mr Coleman has helped make Dorothy Perkins
one of Burton's two best-performing divisions, along with the Debenhams
department store chain, redefining its image and target customers and
introducing a new store format which boosted sales.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Henry Boot ahead 5% - Housebuilder tops
Pounds 7m and bucks industry trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENRY BOOT, the Sheffield-based contractor, housebuilder and property
developer, yesterday became one of the few construction companies to
announce profit and dividend increases for 1992.
Following a 4.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.77m to
Pounds 7.08m, the final dividend is lifted to 4.3p from a 1991 equivalent of
3.9p.
The total dividend for the year of 5.9p is 9 per cent higher than in 1991
and well covered by earnings per share ahead from 18.4p to 18.9p.
The profits increase was achieved despite a fall in interest receivable from
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.9m. Net cash at the year-end is thought to have
reduced from more than Pounds 14m to about Pounds 10m following
acquisitions.
Turnover fell marginally, from Pounds 129.9m to Pounds 129.4m.
Trading profits rose from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 5.2m due to better
performances from contracting and housebuilding.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director of the company in which the family owns
about half the shares, said the company had succeeded because it had not
chased low margin construction work or indulged in some of the excesses of
other housebuilders in the late 1980s.
Even so net housing margins had slipped last year to about 8 per cent. Unit
sales by comparison were up by 50 per cent on 1991 levels.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Littlewoods forms US-style warehouse club
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLEWOODS, the privately-owned retailing and football pools organisation,
has formed a joint venture with Price Club Canada and aims to open at least
one US-style warehouse club in the UK before the end of the year.
The announcement ends several months of speculation in the retail trade
about Price Club's plans in the UK.
Warehouse clubs - forecast to have a significant impact on UK retailing -
sell a limited range of food and non-food goods at low prices from
industrial-style premises to members who pay a small annual fee.
Costco, the third-largest US warehouse operator, has taken two sites in the
UK, and Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the UK cash-and-carry operator, said this month
that it would open two warehouse outlets.
Littlewoods yesterday reported unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 97m for
1992, on turnover up from Pounds 2.59bn to Pounds 2.71bn.
The company said trading had been difficult, with turnover for its retail
businesses, which include the department store chain, mail order division
and Index catalogue stores, up only 1.6 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds
1.87bn).
However, total profits from retail operations increased 4.3 per cent to
Pounds 79.7m (Pounds 76.4m), thanks partly to interest received of Pounds
4.9m, com-pared with a Pounds 6.2m charge in 1991.
That reflected the group's success in reducing borrowings from Pounds 50.8m
to Pounds 6.1m, through reductions in stock levels and bad debts.
Littlewoods chain stores saw sales fall from Pounds 704m to Pounds 696m, in
spite of opening two new stores. Profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 28m
(Pounds 30.3m). The home shopping division increased sales by Pounds 8m to
Pounds 974m , but profits were static at Pounds 55.9m.
A 12 per cent increase in sales at the Index catalogue stores to Pounds
228m, largely the result of 10 new openings, could not stop losses
increasing from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 9.1m. Littlewoods said this was due to
the cost of developing Index and pressure on mar-gins from severe price
competition.
The contribution from the football pools interests rose from Pounds 19.9m to
Pounds 21.6m.
Mr Barry Dale, chief executive, said he hoped the venture with Price Club
would 'herald the beginning of a new wholesale concept for the UK.'
Price Club is a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of The Price Company, the
second-largest US operator of warehouse clubs with 94 warehouses in the US
and Canada, and turnover of Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in 1991.
Littlewoods said its club would be restricted to wholesale customers, and
was likely to be sited in north-west England.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa loss climbs to Pounds 3.07m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting company, saw pre-tax losses increase from
Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 3.07m over the 1992 year but said it was 'cautiously
optimistic' about its prospects, mainly because of last autumn's financial
restructuring.
The outcome was reached after an exceptional loss of Pounds 893,000 (Pounds
458,000), mainly reorganisation costs of Pounds 696,000.
Losses per share were 15.4p (10.2p). No dividend is declared for the year;
an interim of 1.5p was paid in 1991.
Difficult market conditions pushed turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 32.9m
(Pounds 37.7m).
Last October the company reacted to continuing poor trading conditions by
raising Pounds 2.97m via a placing and open offer and setting up a trading
alliance with SAS, a private building systems supplier. SAS took up nearly 4
per cent of the increased equity and has a director on Havelock's board.
The company also carried out a cost cutting programme in which it cut its
workforce by 220 to 609. Staff salaries have not been reviewed since late
1990. It reduced its overheads by Pounds 1.7m in 1992
Gearing was reduced from more than 50 per cent to 26 per cent at the
year-end.
'We have now got the cost base to a level where we can survive with lower
levels of activity,' said Mr Norman Lessels, who at the beginning of the
year took over as chairman from Sir Lewis Robertson. 'We have tailored the
business to operate on turnover of Pounds 32m.'
Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive, said that Havelock's survival had owed much
to strong orders from its traditional customers, Boots and Marks and
Spencer. It had entered the storefitting market for food retailing and had
increased the proportion of turnover from financial services companies from
11 per cent in 1991 to 18 per cent.

<TEXT>
SHARES OF Forward Group yesterday jumped 26p to 205p after the USM-quoted
printed circuit board manufacturer accompanied almost doubled full-year
profits with an upbeat statement on current trading.
Another strong performance from the core Forward Circuits business and a six
month contribution from Chemical Express, acquired last July, helped pre-tax
profits for the 12 months to January 31 advance to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds
622,000). Turnover improved 33 per cent to Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said strong demand had seen sales in February
and March exceed budget. 'If the group continues as it has started we expect
to record a very satisfactory performance for the current year,' he added.
A proposed final dividend of 2p brings the total to 3.3p (2.5p), covered 3.4
times by earnings of 11.06p (5.69p).
The Staffordshire-based group also announced a placing and open offer on a
1-for-9 basis at 175p per share to raise some Pounds 1.32m. Proceeds will be
used to reduce borrowings and 'allow greater flexibility' in financing
future acquisition opportunities.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Etonbrook bid talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS AIMED at securing an agreed takeover bid for Etonbrook Properties
collapsed yesterday amid claims that rebel shareholders had insufficient
backing to make a cash offer for the former BES company.
Mr Keith Moss, managing director of the property development group, said
dissidents led by Mr Andrew Perloff, who controls 29.9 per cent of the share
capital, had failed to show they could muster funds for a 79p offer, valuing
the company at Pounds 3m. The shares closed yesterday unchanged at 79p.
The rebels last night rejected the Etonbrook claims and said their bankers
had given verbal confirmation that the necessary funds were available.
Although Mr Perloff still hoped an agreed offer would be accepted, both
sides are now resigned to the issue of con-trol going to an extra-ordinary
meeting tomorrow at which the rebels are seeking the removal of the current
board.
The EGM marks the culmination of an increasingly acrimonious battle for
control of the company which began last year when Mr Perloff first sought a
seat on the board.
Etonbrook has since blamed a sharp fall in interim pre-tax profits on costs
incurred fighting the rebel action.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barlows passes dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses almost doubled to Pounds 654,000 at Barlows in 1992 and the
property company decided to omit its final dividend.
The company attributed the further decline from 1991's Pounds 339,000
deficit to the disposal of its interest in Trinity Court, Manchester, to its
joint partner, the Church Commissioners; the cost of delay in letting two
other joint ventures, together with reductions in their asset values; and a
reduction in the value of the rest of the portfolio.
Net asset value per share at December 31 stood at 69.8p, down from 85.2p.
Losses per share rose to 2.65p (0.77p). The interim dividend of 0.825p was
the sole payment - in 1991 the total was 2.475p.
The shares fell 3p to 43p.
The directors said that following the sale of Trinity Court, the value of
the remaining property portfolio amounted to Pounds 28m.

BARCLAYS' New Zealand subsidiary announced an 80 per cent rise in profits
from NZDollars 6.1m to a record NZDollars 11m (Pounds 3.85m) last year.
Mr Warren Salisbury, general manager, said the result reflected increased
revenues, a drop in overheads, and improved processing systems.
The division cut its staff by 20 to 40 people.
Mr Salisbury said most of the revenue came from the asset book, which he
said was valued at between NZDollars 1bn and NZDollars 1.5bn.
Barclays bought the swaps book of DFC New Zealand, the collapsed former
state-owned investment bank, in 1991.
The New Zealand branch trades in the short term money market, and is active
in the foreign exchange forwards and swaps markets, but does not deal in the
spot New Zealand dollar.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day achieves Pounds 4.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the discount retailer, has taken an important step on the road to
regaining credibility following last year's departure of Mr Philip Green,
its controversial chairman and chief executive.
The group yesterday reported operating profit of Pounds 5.9m in the six
months to January 30. That was down from Pounds 7.46m, but it said the
figures were not directly comparable because of a large one-off video deal
which contributed about Pounds 2m last time.
Sales by the 52 branches of What Everyone Wants grew 17 per cent to Pounds
55.7m, split almost equally between like-for-like growth and new stores.
Group turnover, including an import business, improved 10 per cent to Pounds
61.3m (Pounds 55.5m).
The pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 4.45m compared with a restated loss of
Pounds 6.29m. The profits figure was depressed by the exceptional payment of
Pounds 1.13m made to Mr Green, who stepped down in September after the group
reported a sharp fall in profits.
The company also spent Pounds 1.7m in August to buy and cancel 6.1m shares
in the company held by Prudential, which bailed out at just 27 1/2 p per
share. Amber Day's shares, which have recovered steadily since their low
point of 24p in August, yesterday closed 5p higher at 79p.
Mr Stacey Ellis, the former Inchcape director who became group chairman,
said: 'I have been greatly impressed, in the three months since I joined,
with the group's strengths and prospects and look forward with confidence to
the second half of this year and beyond.'
Mr Ellis said more competitive pricing, coupled with a policy of widening
the product range and upgrading quality had been well received.
Strong cashflow from operations helped limit the increase in gearing to 38
per cent, up from 22 per cent.
Earnings per share of 2.51p compared with losses of 6.43p. Mr Ellis said
that the strong financial position and growth prospects meant the board felt
justified in maintaining the interim dividend at 1.1p.
COMMENT
Amber Day's main task yesterday was to reassure doubters that there would be
no more nasty surprises from a company which caused a lot of grief last
year. Mr Ellis achieved his aim, assuring analysts that there were no
skeletons in the cupboard, and that these profits represented a clean basis
on which to judge future performance. More remains to be done - not least
the crucial appointment of a chief executive, which should be announced by
the middle of the year. However, forecast earnings of Pounds 9m for the full
year put the shares on a prospective multiple of under 15. At this level
they are likely to attract further support from investors who believe that
discount shopping has a place in the UK.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Recovery takes Helical to Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELICAL BAR, the property investment, development and trading company,
continued the recovery seen in the first half to report pre-tax profits of
Pounds 5.88m for the year to January 31, against losses of Pounds 7.56m.
The profits included Pounds 3m from investment sales, which previously would
have been shown as extraordinary items. Sales fell to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds
31.1m).
Helical said it was helped by falling interest rates, lower administration
costs and recoveries of previous years' provisions.
It sold Pounds 38m of property during the year with Pounds 30m completed
before the year end. With the completion of the balance and sales of Pounds
11m since the year end, net borrowings will fall to Pounds 52m.
Gross profits were Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 11.6m) which included rents of
Pounds 13.8m. Net interest payments fell to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 15.4m) as a
result of sales and the fall in interest rates.
Fully diluted net assets per share rose 4p to 224p. Earnings were 29p (43.2p
losses). A second interim dividend of 2.4p in lieu of a final has already
been paid for a total of 4.8p (4p).

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Chinese trust to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST UK-listed investment trust to concentrate on China is set to be
launched over the next few weeks.
The China Investment Trust will join the market via a placing by James Capel
and will be managed by Jupiter Tyndall (Asia).
Yesterday, CST Emerging Asia Trust announced that it was in talks which
could lead to a takeover by the China Investment Trust once the latter comes
to the market.
CST is also managed by Jupiter Tyndall, which beat off a move to replace it
as manager last year by promising to produce alternative proposals to
shareholders.
The offer will provide a full cash alternative which is expected to be at
about 95 per cent of CST's fully diluted net asset value.
The China Investment Trust will aim for long-term capital growth by
investing in shares on the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges as well as by
investing in 'China plays' on other exchanges such as Hong Kong and Taiwan.

pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 246,000 for the 1992 year.
Turnover totalled Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 37.1m) of which textiles accounted
for Pounds 21.4m, an increase of 7.5 per cent.

(Pounds 6.38m).
Losses per share were trimmed to 3.7p (10.5p). The dividend for the year is

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: The hammer falls on Spink - Christies has
bought the coin and art dealer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE yesterday of Spink &amp; Son to Christies International marked the
close of the City's love affair with the art market. The 300-year-old firm
of dealers was among the first to be taken over by large companies in the
1970s, when the high prices and profit margins of the art boom began to
attract commercial investors.
The art trade has not, however, turned out to be the great honeypot once
envisaged. Since the bubble burst at the end of the 1980s, there has been a
steady rise in the number of distinguished London dealers whose businesses
have folded at the command of suddenly unsympathetic backers. The roll call
includes the Heim Gallery, Ackermann's, Sparks and, most recently, Bluett's.
it is hard not to foresee a gloomy long-term future for Spinks in the form
in which it exists today.
In April 1990 Andrew Weir &amp; Company put Spink on the market, believing its
future could be better nurtured in a specialist art environment. The initial
asking price was believed to be between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m.
Despite considerable interest, the company was taken off the market at the
end of the year. When a subsequent management buy-out was proposed, the
price was down to Pounds 22m, with the stock valued at Pounds 8m-Pounds 9m
and the grand King Street premises at about Pounds 5m. Christies will pay a
maximum of Pounds 16.3m.
Spink is unique as a London dealer in that it houses a broad range of
specialist departments, from British art to jewellery, oriental and
south-east Asian works of art, coins, stamps, even furniture restoration.
Its founding father was John Spink, who set up as a goldsmith in 1666. In
its operational range it resembles its neighbour, Christie's - as do the
firm's claret-coloured flag and liveried doorman.
Spink's uncertain future has had the effect of eroding both the firm's
breadth of interest and its base of expertise. Last year two senior staff
members left to establish The Oriental Art Gallery in Mayfair. Two months
ago the silver department closed.
The most profitable part of the company is the coin and medal department.
Christies has announced that this department is to take over Christies' own
coin and medal department to reinforce Spink's leading position in the
field.
The auction house states that the move will ensure that less than 10 per
cent of its auctioneering business will overlap with the interests of Spink.
The purchase of Spink provides Christies not only with the dominant position
in the coin and medal market but with access to its clients in south-east
Asia and South America, currently two of the world's most vigorous art
markets.
It also brings handsome adjoining premises in St James's with a lease
running until 2017. Over the last few years the auction house has been
aggressively acquiring much-needed additional space. Now it owns long
leaseholds on the entire block bordered by King Street, Duke Street, Ryder
Street and Bury Street.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Widows increases life and pensions
contract sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH WIDOWS, the mutual life insurance company, reported increases in
its sales of life and pensions contracts in 1992. Annual premiums rose 10
per cent to Pounds 122m and single premiums were up 19 per cent at Pounds
536m.
Sales of unit trusts improved 62 per cent to Pounds 92m, of which Pounds 71m
came from the personal equity plan and Maximiser product.
The company commented on the recent recommendation by the Office of Fair
Trading that independent financial advisers should be obliged to reveal to
their clients the commission they receive from product providers.
'This seems to us to introduce an unacceptable bias against IFAs and is
likely to alter the way in which the market operates to the long term
disadvantage of consumers' said Mr Colin Black, chairman.
However, Scottish Widows said it was supportive of other parts of the OFT's
report, notably that consumers should be provided with greater information
on the surrender value of insurance policies.
The company was fined Pounds 120,000 during the year by Lautro, the life
industry regulator, and obliged to review its authorised representative
buiness. It said it had introduced a new management structure and an
improved training programme to deal with the problem.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Smiths lower despite medical boost -
Aerospace division falls to Pounds 13.9m following civil aviation downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNTURN in civil aviation means Smiths Industries has for the first
time made more profits from medical products than aerospace, the UK-based
group's traditional core activity.
Smiths, which reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds
40.3m in the period, spent Pounds 122m on acquisitions outside aerospace
during the six months to January 30. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief
executive, said he expected civil aviation to recover in the second half of
the decade, but could not predict when.
Delays in defence procurement and the reduction in civil aircraft programmes
by customers such as Boeing caused trading profits from aerospace to slump
from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 13.9m, on sales down from Pounds 184m to Pounds
175m.
Smiths has accordingly continued to reduce its aerospace workforce, cutting
200 jobs in the UK and 200 in the US, bringing the total to 6,000.
The aerospace downturn was partly offset by a strong performance by the
rapidly expanding medical systems division, which increased trading profits
from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 16.1m on sales which rose from Pounds 63.8m to
Pounds 84.8m.
Overall sales increased from Pounds 307.4m to Pounds 328m. Acquisitions were
responsible for Pounds 17.1m of sales and contributed Pounds 3m to total
operating profit of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 37.8m). The pre-tax figure was
depressed by a Pounds 3m provision to cover an unsuccessful investment in a
device for measuring blood pressure.
Despite the profits fall, shares in Smiths rose 7p to 347p.
Mr Hurn said: 'All parts of the company have shown a resilient performance
in this first half, and we expect to achieve steady progress in the
remainder of the year and beyond.'
Industrial, the group's third division, increased trading profits from
Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.6m, in spite of being exposed to the worst effects of
the recession. Sales increased from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 68.4m.
The division's ducting companies, especially Flexible Technologies, a US
acquisition now in its second year with the group, had performed well.
Smiths also said that Vent-Axia, a fans and hand driers maker bought for
Pounds 56m in December, had proved a natural fit.
In medical systems, Smiths paid Pounds 66m for Intertech Resources of
Florida in October, and Pounds 16m for HG Wallace of Colchester in July.
Both companies manufacture single-use products, mainly in the field of
anaesthesia and respiratory products, and have been integrated with the
group's existing businesses.
Mr Hurn said: 'The medical systems group will be a major contributor to the
future success of Smiths Industries.'
In spite of the heavy spending on acquisitions, Smiths still had net cash of
Pounds 5m. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4.3m.
Cashflow from operations increased substantially to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds
37.9m).
Mr Hurn said he would be willing to borrow to make further acquisitions.
Earnings per share fell to 9.2p (10.1p). The interim dividend is lifted by 5
per cent to 4.3p (4.1p).

Turnover of Pounds 38.9m compared with Pounds 42m previously.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Thames TV clears way for bid as profits
surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television is selling Reeves Entertainment, its loss-making US
production company, in a move that is expected to clear the way for a bid
from Pearson, the publishing, banking and industrial group.
Lord Brabourne, chairman of Thames, said yesterday that the company was 'in
advanced discussions' with the management of Reeves about a possible
buy-out.
His statement came at the same time as Thames announced pre-tax profits of
Pounds 44.4m in the year to end-December - its last as an ITV company -
compared with Pounds 8.2m.
However, after extraordinary items of Pounds 93.4m and the interim dividend
the loss for the year was Pounds 68.8m. The accounts were prepared on a
pre-FRS 3 basis.
Lord Brabourne also said yesterday that 'discussions regarding a possible
offer for Thames by Pearson have advanced, but agreement has not yet been
reached.'
Neither side would comment further on the talks although Pearson, which owns
the Financial Times, has made it clear that it is interested in expanding in
the media. The present market capitalisation of Thames, which is controlled
by Thorn EMI, is Pounds 88.7m.
Reeves has never fulfilled Thames' hopes since the UK broadcaster bought it
for about Pounds 57m. It lost Pounds 10.3m last year. The provisions on the
purchase include Pounds 51.5m in goodwill previously written off to reserves
plus Pounds 22.8m, mainly for programme costs not yet amortised.
Further provisions of Pounds 19.1m were made in the UK because of the loss
of the ITV franchise, almost all because of property and equipment
rationalisation costs. The provisions mean that Thames has no distributable
reserves so there will be no final dividend. The Thames chairman said the
directors intend to bring forward proposals for a reduction in capital to
try to resume dividend payments as soon as possible.
The company has also revalued its 9.6 per cent stake in SES, the operator of
the Astra satellite system, to Pounds 20m in line with third party
transactions.
Lord Brabourne said Thames' interest in taking part in programme services
'remains undiminished' although the company still thought it 'deeply
unsatisfactory' that the Independent Television Commission had not
re-advertised a Channel 5 licence.
Despite the high costs of restructuring Lord Brabourne said that programmes
such as The Bill, Mr Bean and Wish You Were Here, the programme library and
investments in both programme services such as UK Gold and Astra 'provide
Thames with the opportunity of benefiting from expansion in the television
industry worldwide.'
Thames shares fell 5p to 174p.

FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: BTR sells its 17.2% stake in Meggitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial holding company, yesterday severed a six-year
relationship with Meggitt, the acquisitive engineering company, by selling
its 17.2 per cent stake.
The shares were placed at 98p by Smith New Court, Meggitt's brokers, at a
tight 2 1/2 p discount to the level at which the shares closed on Tuesday
night. Meggitt's share price rose  1/2 p to close at 101p yesterday.
BTR has held the stake since it supported Meggitt's 1986 bid for Bestobell,
the electronics and mechanical component company. BTR had a 29 per cent
stake in Bestobell following its failed bid the previous year.
Last week Meggitt reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds
23m but earnings per share fell. Mr Ken Coates, Meggitt's chairman, said at
the time of the results that the company would be entering a period of
relatively quiet corporate activity.
While BTR has held its stake, Meggitt's sales have grown from Pounds 28m to
Pounds 327m but in the past five years earnings have barely increased. Mr
Coates said BTR had never commented on this.
'Right up to this week it has been a very good relationship with BTR,' Mr
Coates said.
Since a putative effort to take over USH in 1991, the company has also
suffered, and is now trading at a significant discount to its sector.
Mr Coates, said the company had grown into an international engineering
group and had considerable opportunities for further growth.
BTR's stake was never seen as hostile and the two were always likely to part
company, one analyst said.
Sir Norman Ireland, chairman elect at BTR, is a non-executive director on
the Meggitt board.
Sir Owen Green, BTR chairman, said Meggitt had become 'an engineering group
of international dimensions with strong management and a clear sense of
direction'.

Smiths reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 40.3m
in the six months to January 30.
Delays in defence procurement and the reduction in civil aircraft programmes
caused trading profits from aerospace to slump from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds
13.9m, on sales down from Pounds 184m to Pounds 175m.
The aerospace downturn was partly offset by a strong performance by the
rapidly expanding medical systems division, which increased trading profits
from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 16.1m on sales which rose from Pounds 63.8m to
Pounds 84.8m.
Overall sales increased from Pounds 307.4m to Pounds 328m. Acquisitions were
responsible for Pounds 17.1m of sales and contributed Pounds 3m to total
operating profit of Pounds 38.6m (up from Pounds 37.8m).
Industrial, the group's third division, increased trading profits from
Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.6m.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The medical systems
group will be a major contributor to the future success of Smiths
Industries.'
In spite of the heavy spending on acquisitions, Smiths still had net cash of
Pounds 5m.
Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 4.3m.
Cashflow from operations increased substantially to Pounds 51.9m from Pounds
37.9m.
Earnings per share fell to 9.2p from 10.1p. The interim dividend is lifted
by 5 per cent to 4.3p from 4.1p.

COMPAQ Computer doubled its first-quarter sales and earnings and tripled the
number of PCs shipped.
'The company's performance in the first quarter was driven by record demand
for our products from a broad base of customers,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer,
president and chief executive.
Net income in the quarter jumped to Dollars 102m (Pounds 67m) or Dollars
1.23 per share, from Dollars 45m or 53 cents per share while revenues
increased 106 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 783m.
Net earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate. The company said it had
adopted an international investment strategy that has lowered its estimated
tax rate to 24 per cent, from 33 per cent in the first quarter last year.
'We achieved these record results while driving down operating expenses,' Mr
Pfeiffer added. Operating expenses were down in absolute terms as well as a
percentage of revenues, the company said.
Mr Daryl White, Compaq chief financial officer, said market growth had been
stronger in North America than in other markets. In Europe revenues
increased by 59 per cent to Dollars 673m in the first quarter, but this was
the lowest regional growth rate. North American sales were up 159 per cent
at Dollars 795m.
He said Compaq was optimistic that sales will remain strong throughout 1993,
despite predictions from analysts that growth in PC sales will slow down.
'We are planning for slower growth, but based on first quarter momentum it
doesn't seem likely.'

<TEXT>
MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, yesterday bowed to pressure
from the Swedish vehicle maker's small shareholders and disclosed that his
annual salary is SKr9.5m (Pounds 860,000), making him Sweden's highest-paid
executive.
Addressing Volvo's annual general meeting, attended by more than 2,000
shareholders, Mr Gyllenhammar also gave details of his other benefits, the
salary package of Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and the 'golden
parachutes' paid to two former top executives who left the company last
year. Mr Gyllenhammar announced that the Volvo board would set up an audit
committee and a committee for management development and remuneration for a
trial period of a year to counter accusations by Aktiespararna, the Swedish
shareholders' association, that he presided over excessive pay deals for
himself and colleagues when Volvo was tumbling into loss.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said conditions for Volvo in 1993 continued
to be 'extremely tough'. There were benefits from the SKr9bn cost-cutting
programme and signs of upturn in the US and UK markets, but he could give no
assurance that sales volumes would rise this year. Sales in Sweden, where
new car registrations are at 1940s levels, were flat and the outlook in the
rest of Europe was bleak.
Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, the head of Aktiespararna, said Mr Gyllenhammar had
satisfied 90 per cent of his questions.

FT  22 APR 93 / Zeneca ahead in first quarter after decline in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, the bioscience business of Imperial Chemical Industries, said
yesterday that it had started 1993 on a 'firm note' and that first-quarter
trading profits were 'usefully ahead'.
The statement came in the pathfinder prospectus for Zeneca's planned
demerger, flotation and Pounds 1.3bn rights issue published yesterday. ICI
shares rose 41p to 1236p yesterday.
Zeneca also confirmed that arrangements had been made to encourage investors
outside the UK to purchase Zeneca shares.
Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said Zeneca's aim was to produce
'sustainable earnings growth supported by strong cashflow'. Mr John Mayo,
finance director, said the fall in Zeneca's trading profits from Pounds 682m
to Pounds 587m, before exceptional items, in 1992 was a 'downward
correction'.
The prospectus said that if Zeneca had had the benefit of the rights money
in 1992, and ignoring the Pounds 52m costs of the demerger, pre-tax profits
would have been Pounds 278m not the Pounds 102m reported.
The rights issue will be priced and underwritten on May 12 and demerger is
due to go ahead on June 1, subject to shareholders' approval at a meeting on
May 28.
Two syndicates of investment banks - covering the US and the rest of the
world - have been appointed to solicit purchasers for shares. SG Warburg
Securities, the global co-ordinator, will cover these purchases by buying
Zeneca rights in the market.
The intention to tap this pool of demand for Zeneca shares is expected to
add tension to the pricing of the rights issue. Mr Mayo said 'the key
objective is to reduce the cost of capital to the group'.
With Warburg, Goldman Sachs International and Barclays de Zoete Wedd will be
international marketing co-ordinators. Goldman will head the US syndicate
and Warburgs the rest of the world. The three are also primary underwriters
for the rights.
On top of the usual underwriting commissions for the rights issue, Zeneca
will pay a commission of 2.15 per cent of the value of shares sold by the
international marketing group. From this Warburg will pay syndicate members
a 1 per cent commission. Warburg will also receive a fee of Pounds 50,000
plus expenses. However, the international marketing co-ordinators will
return half their profits to Zeneca.

new car registrations are at 1940s levels, were flat and the outlook in the
rest of Europe was bleak.
Volvo cut its dividend by 50 per cent last year and decided to close two of
its three Swedish car plants after incurring losses after financial items of
SKr4.75bn.
Mr Gyllenhammar announced that he had held renewed talks with Mr Carl Bildt,
the prime minister, over the future of Procordia, the partly state-owned
food and drugs group in which Volvo is the largest shareholder. The
government last year blocked a bid by Mr Gyllenhammar to merge the two
companies, prompting calls from Aktiespararna for clarification of Volvo's
intentions.
Mr Gyllenhammar believes he will be able to reach an agreement with Mr Bildt
that would give Procordia 'a stable ownership base', but he did not
elaborate. Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, the head of Aktiespararna, said Mr
Gyllenhammar had satisfied 90 per cent of his association's questions.

'We achieved these record results while driving down operating expenses,' Mr
Pfeiffer added. Operating expenses were down in absolute terms as well as a
percentage of revenues, the company said.
'Our challenge is to sustain our growth and maintain our focus on improved
profitability by closely managing our gross margins and tightly controlling
expenses.'
Mr Daryl White, Compaq chief financial officer, said market growth had been
stronger in North America than in international markets. In Europe revenues
increased by 59 per cent to Dollars 673m in the first quarter, but this was
the lowest regional growth rate. North American sales were up 159 per cent
at Dollars 795m.
Last year Compaq moved aggressively into the Japanese market, offering PCs
at prices well below those of Japanese producers. In March, it launched 39
new PCs , and demand for these models has been particularly high, the
company said, although shortages of several components have constrained its
ability to keep up with demand.
Mr White said Compaq was optimistic that sales will remain strong throughout
1993, despite predictions from analysts that growth in PC sales will slow
down. 'We are planning for slower growth, but based on first quarter
momentum it doesn't seem likely,' he said. 'We have a large backlog of
orders.'

FT  22 APR 93 / GPA Group seeks to restructure Dollars 5.5bn debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, has given up its attempt to raise
new equity before restructuring its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of debts.
It now plans to ask its lenders to restructure the debt first, then seek new
equity. The change of tack follows problems in raising Dollars 200m through
a convertible preference share issue.
None of GPA's shareholders have so far been willing to subscribe to the new
shares at Dollars 1 compared with the Dollars 30 price at which some of the
company's unlisted shares changed hands early last year.
GPA has therefore decided to abandon its so-called 'inter-dependence'
approach to lenders and aircraft manufacturers, under which each group would
have to agree to the refinancing together. Instead it will try to reach an
agreement with its lenders first.
It then plans to go back to its shareholders and potential new investors in
a final attempt to raise new equity.
The aircraft manufacturers have already agreed in principle to cancel or
change contracts, reducing firm orders for new aircraft from nearly Dollars
11bn to between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn.
All but six of GPA's 138 banks have also agreed in principle to to defer
Dollars 1bn of debt repayments until 1996.
The two banks with the biggest exposure to GPA which have not agreed to the
refinancing are ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, and the Arab
Banking Corporation.
One of the group's core bankers said all the banks would have to sign up to
the restructuring by May 7, by which time GPA's directors plan to sign off
the year-end accounts.
Around Dollars 200m of bonds mature in May and June and bankers do not want
to make those payments without an agreement.
GPA has hired Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house, to
help it complete its restructuring. It has already taken on the US
investment banking firm James D Wolfensohn to find new investors.
DLJ's participation in the restructuring has prompted speculation in the US
that the group may be contemplating negotiating with the unsecured debt
holders. However, GPA's UK advisers denied such a move was planned.
Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the
convertible, has told shareholders that without their participation the
banks will have to take effective control.

FT  22 APR 93 / Bulls and bears examine the latest prescription: A look at
prospects for the new bioscience group as it presents its case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, extols his company's
virtues, he has more on his mind than just parental pride. There is little
doubt the flotation of his company, previously part of ICI, will go ahead.
But there is more of a question mark over the price institutional investors
are prepared to pay for the accompanying Pounds 1.3bn rights issue.
Zeneca's prospectus published yesterday contained enough to establish a case
for those bullish about the company. But it also contained plenty for the
bears.
The bulls' case - and that of the management - is summarised as follows.
Zeneca has been stifled in the past by being part of a large organisation
making anything from bulk plastics to vegetarian meat substitutes. Freed
from the dead hand of bureaucracy at ICI's Millbank headquarters, the group
will be able to join the ranks of successful pharmaceuticals groups such as
Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
The management also stresses the good prospects for Zeneca's three divisions
 -pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and seeds, and specialities.
In pharmaceuticals, Zeneca has already suffered the full brunt of the US
patent expiry of Tenormin, its best-selling product. The company has no
significant patents liable to expire in the medium-term. Management argues
Zeneca is as risk-free as a healthcare company can get.
Meanwhile, new products such as Zestril, an ace-inhibitor for hypertension,
the cancer product Zoladex and the anaesthetic Diprivan are growing fast.
The drugs pipeline, says Mr Barnes, is the group's most exciting ever in
terms of numbers and quality.
Zeneca's management argue the stock market has over-reacted to the dangers
of the forthcoming US health reforms.
Price increases may be regulated, but the reforms could include a package to
provide government-paid drugs for up to 75m people without insurance for
drugs. There might be a big expansion in market size.
Meanwhile, although the agrochemicals and seeds market is suffering,
operating profits should improve from cost-cutting. The performance of the
specialities division, which management agrees is unacceptable, can only
improve. The division also contains what Mr Barnes calls the wild card of
Quorn, the vegetarian meat substitute, which he claims could generate sales
of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 2bn.
SG Warburg, one of Zeneca's advisers, concludes that prospects are so bright
that group operating profits could increase from Pounds 587m last year to
Pounds 965m by the 1995. One final attraction is that the share price will
be underpinned by a higher than industry-average yield.
However, the bears also have some arguments on their side. Admittedly, bears
and bulls can agree the specialities division should benefit from the
pick-up in the US economy where about 42 per cent of business is located.
But the pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals divisions face a rocky future.
The US drugs market, the world's largest, is changing rapidly. The change is
being driven by managed healthcare organisations, bulk buyers of healthcare
able to negotiate substantial discounts from drugs groups. SmithKline
Beecham reckons 40 per cent of its business is with the managed sector and
expects this to be 80 per cent by the year 2000.
The growing power of the managed sector has, for the first time, created
price competition in the US, particularly in therapeutic areas where Zeneca
is strongest. Price competition in the ace-inhibitor market, where Zestril,
Zeneca's fast-growing drug, competes, has been especially bitter.
The situation is set to deteriorate further. Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten,
one of Zestril's main competitors, loses its patents in 1995 when the whole
sector will be further undermined by generic competition. Although 20 per
cent of Zeneca's US drugs turnover is to the managed sector, only at the end
of last year did it set up a unit to deal with managed groups.
As for Zeneca's much-vaunted drugs pipeline, most R&amp;D directors outside the
company are dismissive of its prospects.
Merrem, an antibiotic tipped by SG Warburg as one of Zeneca's brightest
hopes, is entering a highly competitive and not particularly fast-growing
sector. Accolate, an asthma drug also highlighted by advisers, will have to
compete directly with a compound developed by SmithKline Beecham. Proving
the efficacy of Zeneca's schizophrenia drug, Seroquel, is likely to prove
tricky.
Meanwhile, the agrochemicals industry, in which Zeneca slipped from number
two to number three last year, is in turmoil. Ciba, the Swiss group and
world's number one agrochemicals company, estimates the EC market fell 10
per cent year after the announcement of the EC's common agricultural
reforms. It reckons there will be a further 10 per cent fall this year.
Zeneca believes the EC market, where it has 40 per cent of sales, will
decline this year, but not by as much as 10 per cent.
Mr Barnes sets off tomorrow for a month-long tour of European and US
institutions. Like all good salesmen, he knows he must convince his hearers
not just about the product he is selling, but also about his price.

FT  22 APR 93 / German budget deficit could top DM65bn, Waigel warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S deepening recession could take the federal budget deficit to more
than DM65bn (Pounds 26.6bn) this year, up DM15bn from earlier estimates, Mr
Theo Waigel, the finance minister, warned yesterday.
He said extra spending by the Federal Labour Office on unemployment benefits
and retraining programmes was the main reason for the increase.
Mr Waigel's forecast came as increased worries over the extent of the
domestic recession were voiced by government officials and leading
industrialists meeting at Germany's most important trade fair, in Hanover.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the economy minister, said the country's recession was
proving deeper than expected. The drop in gross domestic product, could be
greater than the 1 per cent forecast by the government earlier this year in
its annual report, he said. A gross domestic product contraction of 2 per
cent could not be ruled out.
'We are in a deep recession. No one can seriously say how deep it is or how
long it will last,' he said. 'But minus two is the number that cannot be
ruled out.'
Meanwhile, the markets were disappointed with a larger-than-expected
increase in broad money supply, up a seasonally adjusted 3.2 per cent in
March.
The figure, traditionally the German central bank's key indicator in its
fight against inflation, also damped hopes of further substantial cuts in
German interest rates. Mr Rexrodt said the recession had revealed structural
weaknesses which prevented German companies from competing internationally.
He called for a reform of the corporate tax system and privatisation of
infrastructure and public services.
Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German industry federation BDI, said the
country could experience its worst recession since the second world war.
Government officials said yesterday the labour office would show a deficit
of DM11.5bn by the end of May. The office said in February that it had
already run out of money.
Bonn has repeatedly revised its 1993 budget forecast. In March the
government said an extra DM3bn would be added to the forecast 1993 deficit
of DM51bn to help finance the solidarity pact - the package to boost
recovery in east Germany. Germany's deficit in 1992 was DM38.6bn.

FT  22 APR 93 / Court boost for Yeltsin's hopes: President faces challenge
threat as disquiet grows on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S Constitutional Court yesterday strengthened President Boris
Yeltsin's hand by ruling he needed only a simple majority among those voting
on the two most crucial questions in the referendum to be held on Sunday.
The Congress of People's Deputies originally set rules under which he would
need the support of half the 107m electorate.
The split decision of the court was immediately welcomed by Mr Vyacheslav
Volkov, the president's deputy chief of staff, who said that 'for us now
this decision will be law'.
The court found that the Congress exceeded its powers in decreeing that all
four questions in the referendum required a majority of the entire
electorate.
By exempting the first two questions - on trust in Mr Yeltsin and approval
of his economic programme - from these constraints, the court's ruling will
allow Mr Yeltsin to claim a victory if he wins assent to one or both
questions.
The court also ruled that the turnout must exceed 50 per cent of the
electorate, which opinion polls say is likely.
The ruling clears the way for Mr Yeltsin to take immediate 'decisive action'
by presenting a 'range of urgent measures' aimed at extending the base of
private property, regulating the financial system and pursuing
constitutional change.
However, the court's confirmation of the right of the Congress to insist
that 50 per cent of the electorate is needed to confirm early presidential
and parliamentary elections means that a clear Yes for either of these
remains unlikely - though the opinion polls show a solid majority of those
intending to vote in favour of early re-elections of the parliament.
However, Mr Yeltsin's position is still far from secure. A sign that Mr
Yeltsin is no longer seen as the only flagbearer of reform came yesterday
when Mr Sergei Shakhrai, his close aide and a deputy prime minister, said he
considered himself a candidate for the presidency and hinted he might stand
if Mr Yeltsin did badly in the referendum.
Mr Shakhrai joins General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, and Mr
Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist and former deputy Soviet prime
minister, as declared candidates if Mr Yeltsin fails to win strong support.
Mr Shakhrai's low-key comments may be taken as a sign of restlessness in the
presidential camp, particularly as Mr Yeltsin has appeared uninspirational
during the campaign.
Though there is no overt disloyalty and a general recognition that he is the
only figure who can mobilise support for reform, there is an increasing
feeling that too many mistakes are being made.

FT  22 APR 93 / Plans for bus deregulation mark end for Travelcard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Transport yesterday publicly acknowledged for the first time that the
popular Travelcard season ticket scheme, allowing unlimited use of the
capital's buses, Underground and local trains, was doomed.
Mr Alan Watkins, LT's chief executive, told the cross-party Commons
transport committee that the proliferation of bus operators resulting from
the planned deregulation of London bus services would make it impractical to
carry on with the scheme.
He said the Travelcard could be replaced by a chargeable electronic 'smart
card' that would react with equipment on buses or stations to debit users
for each individual journey.
'I don't think something called Travelcard is likely to survive,' Mr Watkins
said. 'We need to give a safe berth to something of that kind, but we
believe the only way of doing that is through electronic ticketing.'
Mr David Bayliss, LT's director of planning, predicted that if a card were
introduced allowing unlimited bus and train use, it would either be
restricted to certain routes or be sold as a high-priced premium product.
The Travelcard scheme, launched in May 1983, allows Londoners to buy a
ticket for periods ranging from a day to a year and travel as much as they
like by bus, Underground or British Rail trains within the zones for which
the ticket is valid.
Critics say Travelcards are underpriced because holders in effect get free
transport around the capital for all journeys beyond a daily return trip to
work. Travelcard's many supporters say the ticket eases traffic flow by
encouraging people to use public transport.
Mr Watkins said it would be impractical to operate the Travelcard after
deregulation because it would mean trying to draw up a revenue-sharing
agreement among 40 or more bus operators. The government plans to privatise
London Buses this year and deregulate services in the capital by 1995.
Its plans were fiercely attacked in written evidence submitted to the
transport committee by Grey-Green Coaches, one of the biggest companies
operating London bus services under contract to London Transport.

Russia intends to set up a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 667m) insurance company to
help shelter foreign investors against losses if power suddenly changes
hands in the country and their projects are taken over by the government.
The company would 'guarantee foreign investors against political risk in our

FT  22 APR 93 / Lamont furious over criticism by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL cross-party committee of MPs is set to attack last month's Budget
and call for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to be replaced, in a move
that will severely embarrass the government.
A government blunder allowed the opposition minority in the Treasury and
Civil Service committee to push through a report which criticised Mr Lamont
and questioned his judgment. The chancellor was said by ministers last night
to be furious over the mix-up. The report - agreed in the absence of two
Tory members - criticised Mr Lamont's handling of a range of issues
including the Budget, the public sector borrowing requirement and the
European exchange rate mechanism. It is expected to be published on Monday.
Labour was able to push through the critical passages when Tory MPs were
absent from an important meeting, giving the opposition a de facto majority
on the committee.
The absentees were Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for
Wolverhampton South West, and Sir Thomas Arnold, MP for Hazel Grove.
Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, and Mr Giles Radice,
Labour MP for Durham North, also missed part of the meeting. It coincided
with a well-attended session in the Commons chamber on a motion criticising
Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, for his handling of the Maastricht
debate.
Tory committee members, who ended by voting against the report's adoption,
were last night playing down its significance, describing it as the sort of
'knockabout' that often took place in the Commons.
The critical passages - which also claimed the Budget did nothing to help
the unemployed - were largely the work of Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for
Hackney South and Shoreditch.

FT  22 APR 93 / Owen fails to win over Serb leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, the European Community mediator, yesterday failed in his
eleventh-hour effort to persuade Serbian president Mr Slobodan Milosevic to
swing his weight behind the international peace plan for Bosnia.
During a one-day visit to Belgrade, Lord Owen made what many observers see
as a final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to bring Bosnian Serb leaders to
heel and support the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and himself, to divide
Bosnia into 10 provinces, roughly along ethnic lines.
After a 2 1/2 -hour session behind closed doors, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman
for the mediators, admitted little hope remained that Serb leaders would
drop their opposition to the plan.
He said: 'I don't want to say last chance, but there's a particular pressure
now on everybody to see if something can't be pulled out at the last
minute.'
Lord Owen also held two rounds of talks with President Dobrica Cosic of the
rump Yugoslavia.
State-run Serbian media attacked Lord Owen for his calls for foreign air
strikes against Serbian targets. But yesterday he did not publicly repeat
his threats of military action.
Mr Eckhard, admitting the failure to overcome fierce Serb objections to the
plan, said: 'If the Serbs say 'no' as they have done today, they have no
option really but to turn it over to the Security Council.'
The Vance-Owen plan demands considerable concessions from Bosnian Serbs.
They currently control 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
but have been allocated 43 per cent of its land surface under the mediators'
proposed peace settlement, which has already been signed by the Bosnian
Croats and Moslems.
Serb leaders remained defiant even on the eve of additional punitive
measures from the international community. More economic sanctions are due
to come into effect on Monday which would virtually isolate Serbia and
Montenegro from the outside world, if Bosnian Serbs fail to endorse the
plan.
Lord Owen also had a secret meeting with Mr Radovan Karadzic, but the result
of their talks has not been disclosed.
Mr Karadzic was quoted by Tanjug news agency as telling reporters in the
Bosnian town of Zvornik that the Bosnian Serb parliament would meet on
Friday and Saturday to discuss whether to accept or reject the Vance-Owen
plan.
Asked whether the assembly would quit the peace talks, Mr Karadzic said: 'I
am convinced that our parliament will decide in that direction because it is
really not our duty to co-operate with those who are punishing us.'
Lord Owen yesterday also met Croat military leaders in an attempt to arrange
a ceasefire between Croat and Moslems forces in central Bosnia.

FT  22 APR 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance of the US bond market recently has something of a fin de
siecle feel. While the market has scored impressive gains since the
presidential election, there is a fear that the long bull market may be
drawing to a close. Thirty-year interest rates below 7 per cent have not
been seen consistently for a generation and, if the economic recovery
follows the pattern of the last 20 years, capacity constraints and
tightening labour market conditions will eventually reignite inflation. The
nervousness in the bond market over commodity prices earlier this year
underlined the point. And with short-term rates held at the inflation rate,
the strong growth seen in the fourth quarter of last year may soon be
resumed.
Perhaps. But the issue turns on whether there are any real differences
between this upturn and previous cycles. Neither borrowing nor lending
patterns will quickly recover from the shock of this recession. Personal
incomes are also still under pressure and there is little sign yet of a
substantial upturn in employment. It may be that the buoyant consumer
spending late last year was a one-off release of pent-up demand.
Bond prices have been rising for so long that the air must be getting a
little thin for some investors used to less heady levels. The bond market is
thus vulnerable to a short-term correction. But with plenty of unused
industrial capacity, much stronger economic signals will be needed before a
wholesale retreat begins.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When even a company's management argues that its largest market will not
turn up before the middle of the decade, things must be tough. The
depressing part of Smiths' analysis of the aerospace sector is that it is
probably right. Civil aircraft deliveries will continue to fall into 1994.
The 150-seat aircraft sector will probably be the worst affected, which is
bad news for Smiths, given its dependence on the Boeing 737. There is also
the risk that Boeing may redesign the aircraft with higher technology
cockpits, forcing Smiths to bid for the work again. Military prospects
hardly look much brighter.
In the circumstances, Smiths' expansion into medical systems looks timely,
even with concerns about healthcare spending. While the company has
generally bought wisely, there are limits to expansion. The recent
acquisition of Infotech and Vent Axia cost Pounds 122m but involved a
goodwill write-off of Pounds 102m. That helped cut shareholders' funds from
Pounds 330m to Pounds 248m in six months. Future targets in high-tech
medicine would probably also be highly priced with low fixed assets. Now all
the cash has been spent, Smiths must choose between debt funded bids which
would quickly erode the balance sheet's strength and paper purchases which
would dilute earnings.
The company argues that the City exists to help it overcome such accounting
niceties. Even so, there must be limited headroom for a company which will
struggle in 1995 to generate the same level of earnings it produced in 1988,
however well it is managed.

The argument over how to overhaul SEAQ, the Stock Exchange's share trading
system, is coloured by the Taurus debacle. The choice is again between a
solution engineered by the Exchange and proven technology bought from
elsewhere. Having sunk so much cash into the Taurus electronic settlement
system without result, big securities firms can hardly be blamed for
doubting the exchange's ability to manage similar technology projects.
Whichever solution is chosen, the current system of market making could do
with some fine-tuning. The liquidity of SEAQ's quote-driven market since Big
Bang has attracted business, but market makers have not earned a consistent
return on capital. The Securities and Investments Board is not helping
market makers by declining to relax rules on public disclosure of large
trades. Without that, the choice is between edging towards an order-driven
system on the model of European markets or relaxing the market-making
obligations of dealers.
The Exchange's choice of technology could determine the outcome. Since it
has no guaranteed monopoly of share trading, though, the wishes of big
securities firms cannot be ignored. The role of the Exchange as a provider
of settlement services has already been called into question. It can ill
afford another dust-up.

<TEXT>
Zeneca's pathfinder prospectus contains little to convince those sceptical
of the benefits of demerger, but at least it will not have to support ICI's
cyclical chemicals business through the next downturn. Cash transfered to
ICI amounted to Pounds 421m last year, more than half Zeneca's cash inflow
from trading and three times the amount paid over in 1990. Of course, Zeneca
has to bear its share of ICI's dividend instead - Pounds 200m before the
rights issue - but the new owners may prove less demanding in this respect
than the old.
Other promised benefits are more nebulous. Liberated from the influence of
ICI's chemical engineers, Zeneca might create a corporate culture rooted in
scientific research and marketing. But that will not deliver speedy results
even if it can be achieved. There are restructuring benefits to look forward
to, although these could equally be achieved within the larger group. The
lion's share of last year's Pounds 195m exceptional charge is being spent
reducing costs, notably in speciality chemicals and agrochemicals. Since
Zeneca expects this expenditure to be repaid within two years, that should
flow quickly to the bottom line.
Given the uncertain outlook in Zeneca's main markets, that is just as well.
Agrochemicals must live through another two or three lean years while the
reform of the CAP reduces demand. Pressure on the drugs industry from
governments shows no sign of easing. Mrs Hillary Clinton is now unlikely to
reveal details of her crusade against healthcare costs before the rights
issue is priced. The good run in pharmaceutical shares this week must be
encouraging, but there have been plenty of false dawns during the great
de-rating of the sector.

Company board compensation committees across the UK are under pressure.
There is a widespread perception, articulated even by such establishment
figures as the head of the Institute of Management, that pay structures for
company directors are driven by greed and avarice rather than logic and
incentive. But is it true that most top managers are greedy? The answer
turns out to be less than sensational, though it is a complex and tricky
problem to resolve.
Compensation for the top team is not set by management themselves. It is
usually proposed by an outside firm of compensation specialists, working to
guidelines set by the board's compensation committee (itself usually
composed only of outside directors). The committee is anxious to accomplish
two things - first, to attract, motivate and retain good talent to run the
company, and second, to protect the interests of the shareholders by making
sure that only the minimum of compensation necessary to meet these aims is
paid.
Our recent survey of top management compensation schemes* in the UK's
largest 400 companies has identified a single, well-intentioned decision,
common to some 70 per cent of the plans surveyed, which one can demonstrate
will inevitably lead to above-inflation raises for top management, year
after year.
We asked whether organisations wished to set base pay at the average level
(vis-a-vis the competition) or above, or below, average. Imagine you are a
member of a board compensation committee. Do you want to attract average
talent? Of course not. You want to attract superior people, so you will want
to pay above average to do this. So far, so good. Here's the snag: some 70
per cent stated that they desire the base pay of their top team to be either
somewhat, or a lot, above average.
However, the compensation committee is then told by its compensation
consultants that it is failing to achieve its objective - pay is not above
average, it is only average. For the committee to meet its objective, it
needs to give everyone in top management a significant pay rise.
In 12 months the compensation specialists are called back to report whether,
as a result of the weighty pay increases of the previous year, the scheme is
now meeting its objective of paying above average. Unfortunately, since
every other company did the same, top management pay is now, in each firm,
still only average - another significant rise is necessary]
This expensive roundabout continues indefinitely, year after year. The
result has been an exponential explosion in top management pay. If the
average company continues to want to pay above average, the exponential
growth will not end.
How can this vicious cycle be broken? Is the board to declare a pay cut of
20 per cent for its top management, and risk losing all its best people to
companies which have not made the cut? Or should it modify the objective,
seeking merely to match top management pay to the competitive average (with
all that implies for the board's perception of its management's perceived
value)?
At PA we can see only one solution. The main driver of compensation must
cease to be comparison with competitor companies: instead the focus must be
on increasing shareholder value. The company's objective can then be changed
to pay only the competitive average, or even below average, for base salary.
The way, nevertheless, to attract superior people is to balance such a
package by offering a significantly higher potential bonus, although only if
shareholder value is significantly increased. To underline this approach,
the form in which compensation is paid has to be more vigorously oriented
towards aligning the interests of top management with those of shareholders.
To do this, part of the bonus would be paid in shares, say in restricted
stock that cannot be sold until the results of the manager's efforts are
having an impact - good or bad - on the stock price.
Crafting such a programme is not simple. The transition from the existing to
the realigned programme carries the dangers of upsetting good managers and
distracting them from the task of running the business. Communicating the
programme is also difficult because it is likely to be more complex than the
existing scheme. The benefits, however, are significant. Managers' interests
will be closely aligned with those of shareholders. Top managers themselves
will be profoundly grateful that they will no longer be subjected to
accusations of 'greed'. And the UK might be able to escape the unproductive
vicious spiral of ever-increasing top management salaries.

FT  22 APR 93 / The people shake the pillars of state: After this week's
Italian referendums, electoral reform can no longer be avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With an apt sense of symbolism, Mario Segni, the leader of Italy's
referendum movement, chose to celebrate this week's triumph of the vote for
electoral reform in Rome's Piazza Navona.
It was in those same magnificent, baroque surroundings that jubilant crowds
toasted a plebiscite in May 1974 which introduced the controversial
principle of divorce to largely Roman Catholic Italy. That was the first
occasion since the second world war that the Italian public forced a
reluctant political establishment to recognise a social reality, when a
Christian Democrat-dominated parliament had declined to do so.
Once again, with Sunday's eight referendums, the Italian people have spoken.
An extra-parliamentary instrument was necessary to remind the politicians
that Italy is changing and that the electorate wants a political system
commensurate with such change.
'It's the victory of the Italian people, who in an overwhelming majority
have today laid the foundations of the new republic,' Mr Segni told his
supporters. 'Other peoples have obtained such reforms only after wars or
dramatic convulsions . . . This has been achieved peacefully and with a
democratic instrument.'
If the people are the winners, the politicians are the losers. They have
been arguing about electoral reform for more than a decade and have quite
simply failed to grasp the urgent need to come up with concrete proposals.
As a result of the referendum, they are now forced to adapt legislation
which introduces a first-past-the-post electoral system in the Senate, the
upper house.
Even so, Italy may risk missing a big opportunity to overhaul the
constitution if another weak government now emerges to replace that of Mr
Giuliano Amato's outgoing four-party coalition. Reform could remain
piecemeal, rather than tackling pivotal issues, such as the ill-defined
position of the presidency, the absurd duplication of the roles of the upper
and lower houses, the weak powers of the prime minister subordinate to the
party leaders, and the excessive number of parliamentarians, currently 845
strong.
When the legislature opened last June, electoral reform was a central item
on the agenda. All parties agreed the existing system of proportional
representation was to blame for encouraging small political groupings, which
in turn produced unstable coalition governments. (The Amato government is
the 51st since the end of the second world war.)
A joint parliamentary commission was set up last autumn, on President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro's insistence, to review the entire 1947 constitution. At the
commission's back was the near-certainty that the proposed referendum on
electoral reform of the Senate would go ahead, and be approved. Nevertheless
it wasted precious time in procedural arguments, while the Christian
Democrats and Socialists fought a rear-guard action to retain proportional
representation and prevent the introduction of a first-past-the-post system.
In January, the two parties belatedly changed course and the commission
finally adopted the principle of majority voting for the bulk of the seats
in both houses. But this was less out of conviction than it was a cynical
calculation to avoid what would be an inevitable referendum vote being
turned into a plebiscite on the government (which had happened with the June
1991 referendum abolishing the system of multi-preference votes). Since then
the commission has judged it prudent to await the outcome of the referendum.
This week's result has set forth two inter-related political imperatives.
First, a new government has to be formed, taking account of the overwhelming
vote in the eight referendums favouring political change. Second, parliament
 -with 16 parties that are even more fragmented than a year ago as a result
of growing internal contradictions and the shocks caused by the continuing
wave of corruption scandals - has to forge a consensus on electoral reform.
Such reform is a pre-condition for fresh elections, which are essential to
provide legitimacy to parliament. Only a new parliament can take account of
both fast-changing political alliances and the public's desire to see the
back of a political class thoroughly discredited by corruption scandals.
In the past 10 months the current parliament has received 302 requests to
waive immunity of legislators under investigation on various charges, mostly
related to corruption. Only a new parliament can have the moral standing to
take measures to deal with the very real problems created by the hundreds of
prosecutions which threaten to clog the courts for the next decade.
The choice of the next prime minister and the composition of the government
depend in good measure on how the party leaders judge the referendum. Does
it mark the beginning of a wholly new era or is it the final phase of the
first republic? On balance they are likely to accept that the transition is
still in progress. Despite the changes of the past year, including the
rebuff to the long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists in the April
general elections and the convulsions caused by the corruption scandals, the
process will only be complete after fresh elections.
This means that the life of the next government will be as short as is
practical to produce new electoral laws. It must have sufficient weight to
chivvy parliament, and possess the technical competence to manage an economy
still in recession. It must also deal with the worrying overshoot in
government borrowing requirements as well as sustain the momentum of the
privatisation programme.
The state of the country is such as to make it difficult to postpone
elections beyond the autumn, after the political feeler of partial municipal
elections due in June. But producing electoral reform may take longer - even
the referendum movement is divided over what form of majority voting is
best. The parties are also bereft of funds to fight an election this year;
one of the weekend referendums abolished state funding of parties.
Against this backdrop, Mr Segni, who emerged victorious in the referendum
fight, has obvious credentials to be the next premier. Having courageously
split with the Christian Democrats after 16 years, he is a new face and, at
53, represents a younger generation of political leadership. But he has no
organised party, and may seek a longer period for the current legislature.
He also could lose standing during the difficult transition process.
It may therefore be more practical to choose either an independent figure,
with experience of parliament, or someone with a known track record who can
find a parliamentary base broader than the current four-party coalition. In
these circumstances, Mr Amato, who has performed an extraordinary act of
survival while preparing the way for economic reform, may yet have a role to
play.
But Mr Amato, or any other prospective candidate in tandem with President
Scalfaro, must convince new allies to come on board. The Lombard League, the
one new significant force in parliament, accounting for a third of the vote
in the north, would be a sufficient ally to give credibility to a coalition
centred on the old four parties. But Mr Umberto Bossi, the Lombard leader,
is wary of such a commitment. So too are other potential allies, such as the
Republicans.
The underlying problem behind the absence of national unity in this crisis
can be found in the respective attitudes of a dispirited Christian
Democratic party (which is considering changing its name to the Popular
European party) and the communists, metamorphosised into the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) under Mr Achille Occhetto. Italian politics since the
second world war has been conditioned by their mutual antagonism.
Even now, the Christian Democrats are traumatised by the suggestion that Mr
Giorgio Napolitano, the former communist leader of the Chamber of Deputies,
the lower house of parliament, might be chosen as an above-party figure to
head a transitional government. Equally, the PDS is shackled by the
psychology of an opposition party, and is reticent about supporting any
government, essentially for fear of being associated with a discredited
political class.
For an effective solution, the political parties must recognise that they
are no longer playing a game of musical chairs in which no one ever pulls
away a chair. The electorate and the investigating magistrates have already
removed several. If the politicians do not realise this soon, Italy faces a
dangerous vacuum of authority, which is precisely what all the politicians
say they wish to avoid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE breaching of the Berlin Wall 3 1/2 years ago, a minority of
observers predicted unification would spell East Germany's industrial
doomsday. The scale of the manufacturing collapse in a state once regarded
as the jewel in Comecon's rusted crown has, however, exceeded all
expectations.
In view of competition with the west, and the shrinking of Comecon markets,
a large decline was inevitable. It has however been magnified by the
misguided post-unity drive to align wages in both parts of Germany, which
has eliminated many east German companies' survival chances.
German employers are thus right to describe as 'economic suicide' the
attempt by IG Metall, the engineering union, to force through a plan for
further large wage rises. Strike ballots will be held next week to determine
whether from May 3 eastern Germany will witness its first full-scale
industrial conflict for 60 years. IG Metall wants to sustain a 1991 accord
for a 26 per cent wage rise in the electrical and metal sectors. Employers
say they cannot afford a rise beyond east Germany's 9 per cent inflation
rate.
IG Metall, probably rightly, fears employers' success in rewriting the 1991
deal would encourage them to unravel job-protecting aspects of west German
collective bargaining agreements. Large German companies, hit by the
D-Mark's appreciation and excessive pay increases, are already intensifying
efforts to cut western manufacturing costs.
The dispute has repercussions beyond Germany's borders. By promising east
Germans speedy accession to western living standards, west German
politicians and industrialists hoped to keep east Germans sufficiently
quiescent to limit westwards migration. The ensuing large fiscal transfers
to east Germany have however stoked inflationary pressures. And these have
driven the Bundesbank into interest rate policies which have caused or
prolonged recession in much of Europe.
Even if IG Metall won a confrontation with employers, the fruits of victory
for its dwindling east German membership would be bitter. Unrealistic wage
increases would spur more plant closures, increase unemployment, and
encourage more companies to opt out of the centralised wage agreements the
union wants so fiercely to keep intact.
Germany needs the social consensus that trade unions have helped foster
since the second world war. But Germany also needs more economic flexibility
to allow companies, organisations and workers to adjust to the nation's
strained circumstances. Hastening industrial destruction in an area
representing the European Community's largest depressed region is the wrong
way either to maintain German trade unions' standing in society, or to
achieve the wider objective of making unification a success. There is still
time for a face-saving compromise. But it is fast running out.

FT  22 APR 93 / Leading Article: Private finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most intriguing elements of the chancellor's Autumn Statement was
the announcement of a new drive to attract private finance for public
services. Out went the notorious Ryrie rules which were supposed to assist
in private financing but in practice threw up insuperable obstacles. In came
new Treasury guidelines to allow the private sector to play a much greater
role in return for genuinely assuming risk. Departments have organised
seminars to attract proposals from the private sector for joint ventures.
For all this effort, however, there has so far been little progress in
attracting new funds for public projects.
Yesterday's announcement of a change of rules in the National Health Service
to encourage greater use of private finance is therefore welcome, if
somewhat timid. NHS trusts and health authorities can now involve up to
Pounds 10m of private finance in projects without Treasury approval, a
40-fold increase in the previous limit. In most cases, any new facilities
created through such projects will be additional to existing health service
plans, providing extra benefits for patients without an increase in the NHS
budget.
The immediate response of the opposition was to describe the move as
'privatisation' of the health service. This predictable, if depressing,
reflex demonstrates nothing more than the paucity of thinking by Labour and
the Liberal Democrats. Aneurin Bevan's comprehensive and universal NHS, free
at the point of use, is not altered by the private provision of health
services. The role of the NHS as purchaser of health services for all its
customers can be carried out whoever provides the services on the ground.
Far from trimming to such criticism, ministers should be much more ambitious
in attracting the private sector into the health service. A recent paper
written for the Social Market Foundation by Mr David Willetts MP proposed
six types of project which the private sector could provide for the benefit
of NHS patients. These included the sort of energy-saving and
equipment-leasing deals which yesterday's announcement will facilitate. But
the paper also proposed using the private sector to build and manage
specialist medical units, such as kidney dialysis units. It pointed out that
more services could be bought in from private hospitals. And private
healthcare companies could be used to provide a salaried family doctor
service in London and other cities starved of primary care facilities.
Joint ventures between the public and private sector should be much more
than just off-balance-sheet financing, free from the constraints of the
public sector borrowing requirement. The real benefits of private financing
will come only if the private sector is allowed to assume more of both the
risk and the management function, delivering value for money through
innovative ways of providing public services.

Two cheers, perhaps, are due to whichever Whitehall whizz-kid had the idea
of binning Britain's old Pounds 1 notes in favour of coins, which were
introduced 10 years ago yesterday.
Although twice as expensive to produce, the hard stuff withstands the wear
and tear of circulation for more than 50 times longer, with an official life
expectancy of 40 years.
Alas, whether the increased longevity is worthwhile is another question.
Valuing the coin at the full 100p on its introduction, the Central
Statistical Office says that its purchasing power 10 years later is only
61p. If the buying power continues to fall at the same compound rate, by the
time a 1983 coin wears out in 2023, its worth will be less than 14p.

After the heady excesses of the 1980s, it might have been thought that
research into financial innovation was a touch passe. Not so, as witness a
new London think-tank, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation,
just opened for business.
Sir Kit McMahon, erstwhile deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam
Cross, formerly of the New York Fed, and John Heimann of Merrill Lynch, are
among the big names supporting the venture which was dreamed up by FT
colleague David Lascelles and economist Andrew Hilton, the centre's first
director.
Most of the research to date has been focused on the risks of such
innovation to the financial system, rather than on the opportunities. So
Hilton, who will continue to work part-time for his mentor Minos Zombanakis,
says he is looking for the 'single big idea' that will change the way people
think about the financial system.
In a business where there are very few new ideas, the problem may be getting
commercial rivals to share their best secrets.

Numerous notables joined 3m Turks in Ankara yesterday for the state funeral
of President Turgut Ozal. The public figures included Shevardnadze of
Georgia and Ter-Petrosian of Armenia - hardly Turkey's most popular
neighbour at the moment. Also there were Greece's Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis and President Richard von Weizsacker of Germany.
But the notables present were less noteworthy than the absence of certain
western leaders. It was they who so much valued Ozal's support during the
Gulf war, when he cut off Iraq's pipeline and made Turkish airfields
available for US bombers, in defiance of most Turkish public opinion and
indeed of his own military top brass.
Where, oh where, were John Major, Francois Mitterrand and George Bush?
Britain was represented by Baroness Chalker, and France by its new
telecommunications minister, Gerard Longuet. Former US secretary of state
Jim Baker did turn up, but the Clinton administration made do with Warren
Christopher's deputy, Cliff Wharton.
As for Bush, gee, he'd have just loved to be there, if he hadn't been too
busy with his presidential library.

Why so much fuss about the suddenly reduced stature of Mount Everest, whose
previously estimated height of 29,029ft has been whittled down by scientists
toting laser meters?
True, it might have been worth recording if the loss had been the one of
nigh a mile and three quarters implied by the Guardian newspaper in stating
the revised height at 20,022ft 7.2in. But the real reduction is only of a
couple of yards or so, leaving the Himalayan peak at about 29,022ft.
What's more, even at the previous figure, Everest was far from being the
world's highest mountain. The same also applies, for that matter, to its
usually quoted Kashmiri rival, K2, lately estimated at 28,238ft.
All that either of them could claim to be is the tallest above the sea-level
in their particular area of the globe - which is a dodgy measure despite
being the one conventionally adopted - since how far the sea rises above the
land varies from one region of the world to another.
At least equally dodgy, of course, is the alternative yardstick of height
above the general surface of the earth itself in the locality, by which the
island of Hawaii's volcanic Mauna Kea rears up from the ocean bed to
33,476ft, almost 20,000 of which are under water.
But even that is dwarfed by the highest in terms of the nearest thing to an
absolute measure: the distance of the peak from the centre of the earth. By
that gauge, Chimborazo in Ecuador, where sea-level is far higher than at the
latitude of the Himalayas, towers about 1 1/3 miles above Everest.

FT  22 APR 93 / Leading Article: ERM remains on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR EDOUARD Balladur, the new French prime minister, meets Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in Bonn today, he will at least leave no foreign exchange crisis
behind him. The French authorities have managed to cut short-term interest
rates, while maintaining the franc firmly within its exchange rate mechanism
bands. They will now wait for the Bundesbank to give them the lower interest
rates they need. But even if the immediate crisis were to prove over,
questions about the future of the ERM would remain.
The Bundesbank is virtually certain to loosen monetary policy further, if
more slowly than France would wish and not as far as it needs. This helps
explain why Mr Balladur does not seem anxious to promote divisive
Franco-German monetary initiatives. What he has done, instead, is position
his country for future monetary discussions by promoting the independence of
the Banque de France.
Such discussions must be rather likely. The immediate crisis in the ERM may
be fading, though this cannot be assured so long as the current slowdown
lasts. But even a period of stability would not end the story. Transition to
economic and monetary union (Emu) on the lines laid down in the Maastricht
treaty looks unlikely this century. Yet the ERM's credibility has been
seriously damaged by events. The European Community is in monetary policy
limbo.
The central bank governors do not see things so apocalyptically. They regard
the agonies of the ERM as the result of a number of specific forces:
inadequate inflation convergence between 1987 and 1992; cyclical divergences
in 1991 and 1992; inflationary pressure in Germany following unification;
inadequate fiscal consolidation in many countries; and wide fluctuations in
exchange rates against the US dollar and the yen. These should have caused
greater exchange rate pressure than occurred, they argue. That they did not
is because of the expectation of steady progress toward Emu, an expectation
that was overturned by the Danish referendum.
On this view, the ERM can become fully workable once more, provided
governments allow timely exchange rate adjustment or pursue policies more
conducive to economic convergence. The view is arguable, but not convincing.
It does not allow for the instability of adjustable peg exchange rate
regimes, in the absence of exchange controls. If pre-emptive realignments
are expected, markets will force them to happen. But if such realignments
are not expected, the pressure for short-term interest rate convergence is
likely to thwart convergence of inflation.
The ERM may survive for a while without further crises, largely because the
Bundesbank must now act in ways that would also stabilise the European
economy. But the ERM is far from flawless. It has flaws, nay 'fault lines'.
Unhappily for France, there exists no simple cure.

FT  22 APR 93 / Survival through a part-exchange: Pressure is growing for a
review of London stock market operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange faces a curious paradox. It supports a successful
international share market in London that has left every other stock
exchange in Europe searching for a way to compete. By the end of last year
nearly 40 per cent of turnover in French shares was taking place in London,
not Paris. Other European equity business done in London ranged from 12 per
cent of turnover in German shares to 56 per cent of Dutch stocks.
Yet the spectacular failure to complete Taurus, the paperless settlement
system, has caused the exchange's existence to be called into question.
Before the fiasco, the central stock market authority had already been
engaged in a steady unbundling process: it had given up or lost a number of
functions, from acting as a trade association to regulating member
companies.
Now, the shock from Taurus has shaken City confidence in the exchange so
hard that this orderly process threatens to accelerate and slip beyond the
exchange's control. According to the most pessimistic observers in the City
the exchange could eventually be broken up, its remaining functions being
taken on by a number of other regulatory or commercial entities.
Pressure for a fundamental review of the exchange's operations is coming in
large part from the big securities houses in London, whose dealing
activities provide the heart of the share market. They have long felt
neglected by the exchange, and have been stirred into action by the Taurus
incident. And after three years under the abrasive Mr Peter Rawlins, the
chief executive who resigned to take the blame for the Taurus, the exchange
is finding that it has few friends elsewhere in the City or Whitehall.
Two of the market authority's main activities are likely to be shed within
the next few months. The first is share settlement (the process of
exchanging stock for cash after a share trade takes place). The Taurus
debacle left the exchange with little credibility in this area, and it has
proposed the creation of a separate, industry-wide clearing house to take on
the job.
The second activity likely to be shed is the dissemination of share prices
and company news through the exchange's Topic service, which has a dominant
share of the market for such information in the UK. Rivals such as Reuters,
which relaunched its own rival screen service at the start of this year, are
fast eating into the exchange's market and it has concluded that, to stay
competitive, it would have to make a substantial investment in upgrading its
outdated technology. The answer, likely to be agreed at a board meeting
today, is to contract out the management of Topic, leaving the exchange with
royalty income from the system, before disposing of it altogether at some
time in the future.
Together, settlement and information services brought in Pounds 101m of the
exchange's Pounds 194m of income last year. Much of this income will be
lost, though the exchange plans to remain a wholesaler of information,
collecting and processing company news and share prices and feeding them to
commercial distributors.
These developments will further eat into the exchange's cost base - one of
the main bones of contention between the market authority and its members,
who have experienced lean times themselves and baulk at funding a large
central market organisation. The exchange's staff numbers have already
fallen to about 1,000 from 1,800 one year ago. After the planned changes in
the exchange's operation staff numbers will fall considerably further.
However, costs will not fall as fast as many stock exchange members would
like. The exchange already has extensive empty office space in London, with
leases which do not expire for several years. The cost base, according to
one board member, will still be Pounds 130m, compared with nearly Pounds
200m last year.
The proposed changes raise the questions of what will be left, and whether
the exchange will survive the attack from various quarters in the City? In
the wake of Taurus, the exchange's chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, has
fallen back on what he claims is the exchange's core function: running a
regulated market which brings together the users and providers of capital.
To what extent the exchange's remaining range of activities fulfils this aim
 -and whether some functions would better be taken on by other agencies - is
an open question.
The regulation of the primary stock market (on which companies raise capital
by issuing shares) and the secondary market (on which shares which have
already been issued are traded) lies at the heart of the exchange's plan for
itself. It has been designated as the 'competent authority' for listing
companies by the 1986 Financial Services Act, and runs market supervision
and surveillance operations to regulate the secondary market.
Should it continue to do these jobs? There have been calls from rivals to
the exchange for the competent authority role to be handed over to an
separate agency, perhaps the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's
chief investment watchdog. But despite the superficial neatness of such a
move - it would bring the UK into line with other leading markets - there is
little apparent need or demand for a switch. Nor is there any sign of
pressure for secondary market regulation to be handed over to another
agency, such as the Securities and Futures Authority, which has taken on the
job of regulating securities companies.
But if there is broad consensus that regulating the primary and secondary
markets should remain the exchange's core role, there is less accord on what
systems it needs to do the job. This is the cause of the disagreement now
brewing between the market authority and London's largest securities houses.
In theory it needs only a trade reporting system, to monitor transactions in
the market, and some arrangement for the publication of market trades
(similar to the consolidated market tape in the US) to maintain a level of
market transparency.
This raises the question of whether the exchange should also maintain the
computer base on which Seaq (the market system introduced at the time of Big
Bang) runs. This takes in prices from marketmakers - which are obliged to
quote prices at which they will buy or sell shares - and consolidates these
into pages of prices, which are then displayed to users, the public face of
the stock market. These pages of marketmaker prices do much to project the
image that London maintains a liquid stock market, the competitive edge
which has helped it maintain its international position.
The computers on which Seaq runs are being subjected to an overhaul by
Andersen Consulting at a cost variously put at between Pounds 40m and Pounds
75m. According to the marketmakers, the exchange should scrap Seaq and buy
something off the shelf - probably Nasdaq, the US system on which Seaq was
initially modelled in the mid-1980s.
This could turn out to be more than a dispute over technology. Seaq lies at
the heart of the marketmaking system on which the London stock markets run -
both for domestic and international shares. Yet marketmaking has proved an
unprofitable business. A change in the market's technological base could
also raise the question of how the market operates.
The implied threat being made by the big marketmakers is this: if they do
not get what they want, they could simply take their business elsewhere. The
international bond market, after all, does not need an exchange. Prices are
carried by commercial information vendors, and settlement is through
separate international clearing houses. To create such a market, it would
only take the biggest marketmakers to agree on trading rules between
themselves and find a company such as Reuters to carry their prices.
Now that really is something to keep the exchange's executives awake at
night.

FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: Good performance in recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN NICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is good for opera that Covent Garden is in surplus but Antony
Thorncroft's report ('On song at the opera', April 17/18) that ENO is 'in
decline' is not borne out by the facts.
Paid attendances have declined by 6 per cent since last year, not 15 per
cent. That is a creditable performance in the depths of recession. More than
320,000 people (more than for any other opera company in the UK) attended
215 performances in 1992-1993, with an average seat price of Pounds 25.
Moreover, ENO increased its private-sector income to a record Pounds 1.64m
last year, with 17 out of 20 productions sponsored.
Rather than play one company off against the other, those who support opera
should concentrate their efforts on persuading the government to reverse
planned cuts to the Arts Council grant next year. Neither ENO nor Covent
Garden can afford to lose further revenue.

FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: Pressure of time, not boredom, behind short cuts
taken by junior auditing staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROLINE WILLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack's article about our research into irregular auditing
(''Bored' junior auditors take short cuts' April 8) gives a useful picture
of our work. We should like to stress, however, that it does not seem to be
boredom which is most associated with junior staff taking irregular short
cuts, but pressure imposed by time, budgets and/or a perception that
particular audit tests are not important.
Andrew Jack's report also states that our methods were criticised by 'some
academics'. As we recall, the only academic to criticise our methods when
our paper was presented at the recent meeting of the British Accounting
Association was the director of research of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). There was in fact considerable
support for our methods and the credibility of our findings from the
official discussant of the paper, experienced social researchers and other
members of the substantial audience at the presentation.
Readers of our paper will need to make up their own minds about whether we
have identified a cause for concern, but we feel it is scarcely credible
that alleged biases in design and response would produce evidence of so many
junior accountants taking irregular short cuts, if the practice was not in
fact common.
We hope that, instead of attempting to denigrate the reliability of our
findings, firms of accountants and all the accountancy bodies involved in
auditing will take our results seriously. (It is unlikely that the behaviour
we have described is confined to students and members of ICAEW.)
We have offered to work with firms of accountants to investigate further the
range of irregular shortcuts taken by staff, an offer which is still open,
and we also look to the auditing bodies to support further independent
research.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM STOPPARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his review of 'Arcadia', Malcolm Rutherford unwittingly perpetuates
a myth about Jumpers ('Order and chaos in Arcadia', April 15). I owed a lot
to Kenneth Tynan, and profited from his scrutiny, but it is quite untrue
that he cut the play by an hour during rehearsal, unilaterally or otherwise,
or needed to.
At a working dinner after the first preview, Tynan, the director Peter Wood,
and I discussed cuts and I shortened the play's coda by about 10 minutes.
The main casualty, incidentally, was Tarzan, played by Alan Mitchell, who is
Jellaby in Arcadia.

</HEADLINE>

   From Professor LEON HOLLERMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter, 'Technology crucial to debate on UK's economic
renaissance' (April 15), Professor Ian Mackintosh maintains that the
'Japanese (and other Asian) industrial economies have risen from scratch to
giddy heights largely on the skilful commercialisation of electronic goodies
for the home and the office'.
Behind 'skilful commercialisation' lies product and process technology of a
high order. Moreover, beyond the 'electronic goodies' Japan is a world
leader in electronics and electronic engineering, including semiconductors,
computers and telecommunications. It stands on the eve of producing the
256-megabit DRAM tran- sistor.
Professor Mackintosh could make a stronger case.

MANAGING TO SURVIVE: A GUIDE TO MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE 1990s
By John Harvey Jones
Heinemann Pounds 15 pp184
In the 1960s managers discovered accountancy. In the 1970s they discovered
people. In the 1980s it was growth. In the 1990s they must put away fads and
discover good management, or they will not survive the decade.
With big gestures, big generalisations and big threats, Sir John Harvey
Jones begins yet another cracking read of a business book.
The world, he says, is changing rapidly and unpredictably. New technologies,
new competitive pressures and new management theories are pouring on to the
market faster than companies can absorb them. Everything is speeding up - a
new product can only provide a lead for a short time.
Sacred cows are dying - economies of scale are less important than
flexibility. As plants become more mechanised, the gains come not from
increasing productivity, but from putting capital to better use. The
battleground has switched to marketing, branding, research and development,
and distribution. Skills are becoming more quickly outdated, and workers are
less willing to conform either in terms of behaviour or to fixed working
time.
In the 1990s, he argues, all companies have access to the same tools; the
winners will be the ones with the best strategic aims, the best motivator of
people, the best manager.
There is barely an original word in all this. But originality is much
over-rated when it comes to management books, as there is scarcely a new
management idea under the sun. Instead, the appeal of the book is that it is
lively, short, and (almost) jargon-free. Above all, it rings true.
In spite of his huge following, Sir John is no management guru. For someone
so opinionated he has few theories, and has little time for the 'instant
panaceas' of those who do. His message is more of the
different-strokes-for-different-folks variety. That allows him to pick and
choose among the latest management ideas, and provide a great service to
readers by explaining them in plain language. Once the theories are stripped
of all their usual verbiage, it is hard not to agree with Sir John, who
believes that most have their worth, but none alone will give a company more
than a short-term edge.
His discussion of 'total quality management' (squeezed incongruously into a
chapter on the environment) is a case in point. He argues that having the
quality seal will not determine who the winners are; it will only serve as
an entry ticket to the race.
Sir John's thesis is that to cope with the pressures of the decade, managers
must be visionary. They must take risks; they must have a broader vision of
all the international options. They must have a clear sense of where the
company is going. They must be committed to continual change and continual
learning. They must move fast; they must respond to environmental pressures;
and they must manage technology rather than let technology manage them.
Managers must be bold enough to be radical, and modest enough to admit
mistakes.
In spite of his insistence that there are no simple solutions, he does not
hold back on giving advice. Again this is of the distinctly sensible
variety. What should you do in a recession? The answer, he says, is to focus
on the essential parts of your business. Cut costs. Bring in cash, selling
assets even at knock-down prices. Look after your people; give the ones you
make redundant as much help as you can; keep on training those you wish to
keep.
A sympathetic view of human nature radiates throughout the book. Sir John
believes that employees want their companies to do well, and argues that
they deserve the trust of their superiors. This means managers should
delegate as much as possible, as those who do the job are best equipped to
make decisions about it. People should also be told as much as possible
about the business - the extra vision is worth the (minimal) risk that they
will run off and tell the competition. And as for office politics, anyone
who is engaging in that cannot have enough work to do. Perhaps that
management layer could be cut out altogether.
The same sense of decency colours the new relationship between customers and
suppliers. Now that companies no longer seek to do everything in-house, they
must find the fittest partners, working with them on the basis of mutual
interest rather than fighting for extra margin.
In all this there are many notes which will be familiar to readers of his
earlier books. Indeed, Sir John has been a champion of common sense for
decades. Yet the book feels up to date, with recent examples of companies
that are doing - or not doing - what they ought. One gets the impression,
however, that most businesses are not even thinking along the right lines,
let alone starting to put the winning strategy in place.
Though sensible, many of these themes are spelt out more than once, as if
Sir John had written the book at great speed. Perhaps this is to be
expected; his last book is barely cold on the presses, and given the number
of his other commitments, it is a wonder he found time to write it at all.
Its tone, however, marks a departure from previous books. Although on every
page it is clear that Sir John is more a man of action than ideas, there are
fewer personal anecdotes than in earlier works - which is just as well since
it has been a good six years since he did an executive job at ICI.
Instead, a slightly jarring evangelical note has crept in - one feels that
he is writing the book not so people will go out and buy it, but so managers
will take note and make Britain great again. But even if it is partly a
tract, it is a stimulating and useful one. It could have been still more so
with tighter editing, and some of the space saved used for an index.

FT  22 APR 93 / Letter (2): Why British industry fails to attract talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN HEENAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Crispin Hill's letter calling for academics to extol the virtues of
a career in manufacturing suffers the same credibility problem that all such
calls do from people who want others to do it but who are not prepared to do
it themselves. If all the academics, journalists and other pundits who have
suddenly realised that Britain's manufacturing base is seriously ill
actually tried it, they would find out why many of the most able avoid or
leave manufacturing. They would see that in manufacturing, incomes (below
PLC board level) are significantly lower than in the professions, job
security is less, and to get the job done you have to make the sort of
decisions and take risks those in 'the professions' avoid like the plague.
I agree that we need to raise the status of working in manufacturing, but
the place to start is to raise the relative pay levels sharply. The rest
will follow. While City slickers can charge Pounds 300 an hour to sell off
the assets of bust businesses or to pontificate about manufacturing from the
outside, can you blame anyone choosing to do that in preference to working
harder for a fraction of the money, albeit that they have the 'satisfaction'
of doing something of use to the world.

FT  22 APR 93 / Letter (1): Why British industry fails to attract talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY LEDGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following on from Crispin Hills's plea for industry to 'draw the best
pupils' (Letters, April 20), the following facts may highlight the extent of
the current problem.
The EC-supported tripartite degree involves English, French and German
students studying electronic engineering in all three countries, meaning
they graduate as trilingual engineers - surely just the kind of people
Britain needs. Yet of the six who graduated from Southampton University last
year, five are now in engineering posts abroad, and the one who stayed in
the UK has left engineering. And while most of the 160 graduates from the
10-year-old scheme have stayed in engineering, only three of these are now
in the UK.
In France and Germany, both the status and salaries of professional
engineers are far higher than here, and the damning figures above should
surprise nobody. Unless it makes comparable offers, British industry will
never attract or keep the talent it needs.

UN COEUR EN HIVER (12)
Claude Sautet
SOMMERSBY (12)
Jon Amiel
MR SATURDAY NIGHT (15)
Billy Crystal
Claude Sautet's Un Coeur En Hiver is a battle of faces. Violin-maker
Stephane (Daniel Auteuil) has large, liquid, fastidious eyes and a moue of a
mouth squeezed between babyish cheeks. Inside the overbred man, this face
seems to say, a child is clamouring to stay hidden. Fellow violin-maker
Maxim (Andre Dussollier) has playful eyes, wide lips and smile-lines as long
and deep as the San Andreas Fault. He is clearly a playboy with a taste for
debonair irony.
Then there is Emmanuelle Beart, the woman who comes between them. She, a
beautiful young violinist, is all taut complexion and perfect facial
curvature. Is she the violin played by the two (seeming) rivals in love? Or
is she the perfect melody who exploits and defeats them both?
We are moved to this delirium of metaphor by a movie that slugs one with its
own high-toned pretensions and line in lofty enigma. Nearly everyone but me
at last year's Venice Film Festival, where it won the Silver Lion and
International Critics Prize, rhapsodised about Sautet's film: a sort of
anti-love story in which a shy, icicle-hearted instrument-maker (Auteuil)
makes a play for his partner's girlfriend (Beart) and then backs off - in
fear or mischief? - to watch the emotional fall-out. The girl despairingly
returns his love, the rival rages at his partner's humiliation of her, the
'hero' retreats ever deeper into his igloo of expressionless expressiveness.
Why does this film strikes some as a masterpiece? Two words: Daniel Auteuil.
This actor - we saw him light up the role of the dim-brained nephew in Jean
De Florette - has a face so alive that it sets the air shimmering around
him. We imagine concealed passions even when there are none. In today's
great French screen-acting sweepstake, Auteuil is immobility's answer to the
hyperactive Depardieu.
But what of the film around him? It is a woman's magazine story worked up
for the arthouse crowd. Cast in basic language, it goes thus. Beautiful
Violinist involved with Charming But Shallow Womaniser is knocked sideways
by his Shy But Deep Friend. As in any six-mouchoir love story, passion must
remain unrequited. And as in any standard-issue French art film, much
symbolic play must be made with colour - note the gelid blue shirts worn by
icy Auteuil, the brief eruptions of red in the frame when passion or anger
threaten - and with well-chosen musical soundbites (tangled
string-screechings from Ravel).
This is the same Claude Sautet who made Les Choses De La Vie, a film whose
readimix tragic romance involving Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider was
ridiculed by the same critics who now rave about Un Coeur En Hiver. But what
is the difference in art and effect between the two films? None: save
Auteuil's ability to hypnotise us while one cliche-worn scene or character
slides by after another.
There is the row in the restaurant, where our pure-bred heroine, having
slapped on the scarlet-woman lipstick back home, tearfully turns all heads
as she bawls out her man. There is the girl's jealous, quasi-Sapphic friend
and manager (Brigitte Catillon), a Mrs Danvers for the Cinematheque set. And
there is the scene that sums up this film's indomitable shallowness. One
evening Auteuil goes to visit his friend and ex-music teacher (Maurice
Garrel) in the country. Stepping from his car a few dozen feet from the
house, he hears and sees the man bickering with his housekeeper-companion on
the front terrace. Tactfully, silently, he steps back, re-starts the motor
and retreats down the drive.
Have you ever started a car 'silently' twenty-odd yards from the nearest
witness? But this is a movie so in love with its po-faced contrivances that
plausibility takes a back seat to romantic and symbolic pattern-making. For
all its feints at psychological realism, the only things that distinguish Un
Coeur En Hiver from Love Story or Terms Of Endearment are the French
subtitles, the gnomic self-importance and Auteuil's acting, which hints at
depths never plumbed by the script or direction.

In Sommersby Richard Gere returns from the American Civil War to a wife
(Jodie Foster), a plantation (cotton) and a situation (is he the real Jack
Sommersby?). In and around his peeling Tennessee mansion things are soon in
lyrical turmoil, egged on - indeed over-egged - by Danny Elfman's music.
Gere's foot size is too small; his memory for friends is faulty; and Foster
notes a new, 'improved' marital personality. Instead of the old Jack, cruel
and unloving, this one is an selfless gallant who brings waves of offscreen
violin music whenever he embraces her. And instead of being a feudal bully
to the cotton-pickin' villagers, he gives them shares in his new
tobacco-plantin' venture which ends up earning Dollars 10,000.
Inspired by the French film The Return Of Martin Guerre, Sommersby boasts
some of the weirdest credits in recent history. Story by Anthony (Sleuth)
Shaffer and Nicholas (Star Trek) Meyer; direction by Jon (The Singing
Detective) Amiel; photography by Philippe (The Emerald Forest) Rousselot, in
collaboration with an uncredited Rembrandt Van Rijn. (Lots of burnished
browns and mysteriously-sourced glowing light).
One cannot say the film fails, for one would have to ask the question 'Which
film?' While Gere and Foster work their make-up off trying to bring life to
Mr and Mrs Deep South - he all perplexed staccato boyishness, she lit from
within by the candle-power she brought to The Accused and The Silence Of The
Lambs - script, direction and camerawork seem more concerned with cranking
out pretty pictures and social messages. The latter range from important
bulletins about race relations in the New South - Good lord, the war's only
just finished and here's Judge James Earl Jones on the bench - to lectures
about married love and whether it is improved by not being married.
Then there is another film still. The ghost of The Return Of Martin Guerre:
in which director Daniel Vigne and star Gerard Depardieu really did knit
together personal emotion and credible historical sweep and really did -
unlike Sommersby - set our heads ringing to questions about identity,
imposture and the subversive mysteries of love.
******
After so much romance, here is Billy Crystal setting the nightclub tables on
a roar in Mr Saturday Night. He plays stand-up comic Buddy Young Jr, a sort
of George Burns meets Mel Brooks and do you both know Jack Benny. As we
scramble to unscramble Young's career the film darts about in time,
zigzagging from childhood to second childhood via marriage (Julie Warner),
sibling rivalry (agent-brother David Paymer) and multiplying layers of
old-man latex (make-up artist, Peter Montagna).
Crystal wrote and directed as well as starring, and the strain tells near
the end. The film keeps trying to stop, only to be caught up by another wave
of would-be plot resolution and emotional uplift. We are in Buddy's twilight
years, when he must sob on all shoulders and bury all hatchets, including
those still sticking out of his family and friends.
Grin and bear it. Much of what goes before is joyous, including the hero's
motormouthed gag routines on and off the stage. He varies his friendly venom
from audience to audience: 'What's this, a Civil War Reunion?' for the
zimmer-framed oldies of a Florida retirement home, 'I can show you something
you've never seen before - your feet' to the fat heckler in the vaudeville
theatre . . .
While the jokes change, the Crystal charisma stays gloriously the same. We
saw it in When Harry Met Sally and City Slickers: the baby-faced,
twinkle-lipped bravado that takes the most innocent remark and writes
gentle, witty malice all through it.

Keith Allen and Peter Richardson who have written and directed BBC2's new
series of The Comic Strip Presents .. seem to think that the idea of a
television programme called 'Gourmet Detective' containing a successful
murder inquiry and two great recipes in each show is a joke. Given the
current state of television they are likely to see the idea pinched and put
into practice within a fortnight. The new series (9.00 BBC2) features all
the familiar comedians: Robbie Coltrane, Adrian Edmondson, Dawn French,
Jennifer Saunders, Alexei Sayle etc. Last week Sister Gabriel, the nun in
Body And Soul, saw the villain having his wicked way with one of the mill
girls up against the factory wall after going-home time. Sister G. rushed
away covering her ears but those experienced in tosh like this may suspect
that the sight and sound could prey on her mind and tempt her to wonder what
all this sex business is really like (9.00 ITV). Given that True Stories is
90 minutes long, it had better not be teasing when it undertakes to discover
the true outcome of the story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (9.30
C4).

FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: The Treatment - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Court Theatre has recently gone very American and rather
sophisticated. John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation was not the sort of
play you would have expected to see there. Ariel Dorfman's Death and the
Maiden was American as well, though Latin. Even a home grown product such as
Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a Field combined a touch
of New York with Sloane Square. David Mamet's new play about sexual
harassment in an American university arrives shortly.
All of which, you might say, is a gust of fresh air from across the Atlantic
and more than welcome. The American influence, however, has had a malign
effect on Martin Crimp, the aspiring British playwright whose new work, The
Treatment, opened at the Court on Tuesday.
Crimp is a talented writer looking for a subject. He showed great promise in
Dealing with Clair, a play set around selling a house through a female
estate agent at a time (1988) when the property market was booming. His
No-one Sees the Video at the Royal Court Studio two years ago regressed in
the sense that it seemed simply to be asserting (without proving) that there
is something degrading in market research. Stretches of dialogue are
effective; substance is lacking. Crimp wants to satirise but cannot find a
target.
The Treatment could have been the great leap forward, his first showing in
the Royal Court's main house. The aim is ambitious, for it is hard for a
British playwright to write effectively about Americans on their own
territory: they can do it so well themselves and are quite capable of
self-parody.
This is Crimp's dilemma. It is not clear whether The Treatment is trying to
imitate Mamet or take him off. If the play is meant to satirise the
Hollywood machine, it fails completely for what the piece suggests, probably
against Crimp's intentions, is that American script-writers are very
professional - more so than those who seek to debunk them. It is a very
English approach to think that Americans lack sophistication.
The plot is not simple. Essentially a girl called Anne (Jacqueline
Defferary) offers material from her marriage to be turned into a movie.
Directors and script-writers cross-question her, then seek to turn her story
into something different to her original tale. Crimp may want this to be
seen as a betrayal. Like the market research in No-one Sees the Video,
however, the attempt to rewrite seems more like a service than an act of
perfidy, the more so since Anne's story was never very clear in the first
place.
There are some nice inventions, such as the black New York cab-driver who
continues to drive despite being blind since birth, though again one wonders
 -is this satire, in which case it is painfully unpleasant, or just bizarre?
Good scenes, too, in the Japanese New York restaurant, especially from the
Brooklyn waitress.
There is also one blatant theatrical cliche: a man's eyes being put out on
stage. One never liked the scene in King Lear; it seems remarkably out of
place here.
The acting is very good, notably Sheila Gish as Jennifer, the woman who
tries to make sense of Anne's story, cannot stand cigarettes but ends up
smoking heavily in the general frustration. The direction is by Lindsay
Posner. It is the play that does not work.

FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Anne-Sophie Mutter - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening - a distant voice gradually making contact, as though from
places far removed or a time long past - intimated from the outset that this
would not be an ordinary performance of Sibelius's Violin Concerto. The mood
and the delicacy are written into the score, but that does not mean they
often come across so palpably.
The Sibelius concerto was not among the selection that Anne-Sophie Mutter
chose to play in the series of concerts devoted to her at the Barbican a
couple of years ago. Nor has she yet recorded it; perhaps it is not one of
those to which she feels closest. But it would have been difficult to come
to that conclusion from the performance she gave of it at the Royal Festival
Hall on Tuesday with The London Philharmonic.
The last time that I heard this concerto, the soloist was the very young
Midori - petite in tone, precise, perfectionist. There was little variety in
the colour of the playing and within the first couple of pages Mutter had
already traversed more ground in that respect than Midori did in the whole
concerto, pleasing though she was for other reasons.
With Mutter colour is expression; it speaks, it makes music. On this
occasion there was a lot of the full-blown romantic, dark, deep playing on
the G string that she favours for Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (the
Sibelius is its Northern younger relation) and the warmth of The London
Philharmonic's sound goes well with that. The closing pages of the slow
movement seemed to me particularly evocative, wonderfully measured,
thoughtful playing. The finale was exciting - and never a sign of strain.
With a captive audience come to see the evening's soloist, Franz Welser-Most
and the orchestra were able to offer an unusual first half. Schubert is
being featured as a running theme for a month or two and the concerto was
preceded by Joachim's orchestration of the composer's Grand Duo for piano
duet, a sort of overgrown divertimento, which could not stand as the main
item of a concert itself.
To start, they gave what sounded a sharp and well-rehearsed performance of
Nicholas Maw's Spring Music. With its rich textures bubbling with activity,
not unlike Janacek thrilling at nature's evergreen renewal, the piece seeks
to put into music 'the energy and beauty of spring'. It is an approachable
example of the music of the 1980s, deserving of a re-hearing. Are we perhaps
also seeing the green shoots of more adventurous programme-planning on the
South Bank?

FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Jenufa - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anja Silja first sang at Covent Garden 24 years ago, as heroine of the last
London Fidelio series conducted by Klemperer. Her appearances since have
been absurdly infrequent but always precious. Now she supplies main light-
and heat-source of the house's latest Janacek revival: a Kostelnicka of
searing honesty, dignity and power of presence, a point of unwavering
intensity amid the flickers of an otherwise somewhat disappointing Jenufa.
To lucky British opera-goers this portrayal was first shown, in all its
greatness, at Glyndebourne four years ago, where it emerged as the crowning
glory of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's magnificently severe production. In the larger
London theatre it takes a while to come into focus - on current form the
whole staging fails to provide this Kostelnicka with the necessary sense of
oppressive containment, and at the start of Act 2 it seemed that Silja's
soprano had been beset by a passing attack of the old wobbles.
But soon the voice had broken free of them, cutting across the spaces in a
way that revealed its incomparable qualities of fearlessness and gutsy
honesty. No touch of extraneous melodrama or calculation is permitted the
character even in the opera's deepest moments of agony - the sight of this
figure of gauntly severe moral authority gradually bent and broken is in
itself a revelation of unvarnished Janacekian insight. Once Nancy Gustafson
 -a Jenufa graceful, vocally glowing, but still dramatically pale and
sketchy - learns to dig deeper into her character, as later in the run she
surely must, the force of Silja's authority will no doubt be more resonantly
answered than it was on opening night.
When new, in 1987, Yury Lyubimov's staging used all its whirring panels,
whooshing gas-jets and balletic movement-groups to build up a tremendous
surge of 'innocent' theatricality, powerfully physical, unstintingly
radiant. Although Lyubimov has evidently been back to supervise the current
revival, that surge obstinately refused to happen on Tuesday; and in its
absence one was left regretting the aura of High Art that clings to so much
of his production methods. Jan Blinkhof's violently impulsive, vocally
unruly but also brave-spirited Laca and Arthur Davies's Steva, a finely
detailed portrait of a weakling, were both much admired in the 1988 revival;
on this occasion each seemed blurred, not enhanced, by the staging.
Other than Silja, the most telling Janacek interpreter in evidence is the
conductor, Jir Kout (house debut), who marries strong awareness of the
opera's dramatic workings to warm, natural feeling for the heart-lifting
thrust of its rhythms and shape of its melodies. A shame Covent Garden still
clings to the discredited Kovarovic revision of the score, with its
grandiose, tub-thumping ending: as WNO, Glyndebourne and many other serious
Jenufa-performing companies have now shown, the superiority of the
Mackerras-Tyrrell edition is proved beyond argument.

The first act of Scott Davidson as he walks into the room is to overturn the
'No Smoking' sign and light a cigarette. It's done swiftly, decisively and
with charm. As managing director of ICI Fibres and ICI Acrylics, he makes
the rules.
His job involves dashing from Brussels to London and other outposts of ICI
at a time when meetings with company lawyers and negotiations about the
handing over of ICI Fibres to Du Pont of the US, as part of an asset swap,
dominate the schedule. His unorthodox approach to information technology has
made it possible for him to run two ICI companies - and take an active role
in a third, ICI Materials - from Brussels.
The system Davidson uses accompanies him everywhere, in a small
briefcase-sized computer. It is an executive information system (EIS), which
keeps him in touch with his companies and serves him, wherever he is, with
information that used to come from a headquarters staffed by 420 people.
Now, partly because of the system, the Brussels head office has only 12
staff.
Scott Davidson took over ICI Fibres at the start of 1990, when it was a
Pounds 650m company. An ICI man for about 25 years, his first task was to
take control, and make people accountable for their performance, at a time
when the recession was making business tough. The lack of control over
information technology and information systems in general (estimated at
Pounds 18m) was then a major concern and one with which he found it
frustratingly difficult to get to grips.
After a chance meeting, Jon Morgan, managing director of a consultancy -
Executive Information Solutions (EISL) - specialising in EIS, quickly became
involved in identifying the needs of what Davidson calls the 'top box' of
managers. 'One of the benefits of using consultants is their objectivity in
examining what we wanted and needed. From that came a 'halo' effect, casting
light on the effect of IT as a whole.'
There were two concerns - managerial accountability and the information
systems structure. A basic difficulty was putting names to activities and
identifying people with their responsibilities.
Morgan and his colleague Gerry Cryer started a process they call 'goal
focus' which was to result in a three-year relationship with Davidson and
other parts of ICI. It also brought about various incarnations of the EIS
Davidson uses.
The aim was to replace dozens of paper reports, some of which used to adorn
the 'chart room' where hand-drawn graphs were amended daily. 'The process
sharpened our focus on people, sales and working capital,' says Davidson.
Morgan stresses that the benefits come from the process of defining the
business system, as much as the system itself. 'As with most organisations,
the individuals involved were finding it difficult to see the forest for the
trees. The goal focus process ensures that decisions are turned into
actions, and that performance is monitored and continually examined.'
The strategy for ICI Fibres was a business improvement programme that would
cut down on bureaucracy, focus on customer satisfaction, and improve
business performance. The computer system, fed by constant updates acts as
the monitor of every stage of the plan.
Davidson believes ICI Fibres was among the first companies to take the full
brunt of the recession. Without damaging the revenue, he had to take steps
to cut costs by as much as 30 per cent. 'The Business Information System
allowed us to work to targets.' He estimates a Pounds 7m saving in the first
year, resulting from the work of EISL.
In the last two years, the staff of ICI Fibres has shrunk from 8,500 to
6,000 people. The consolidation of information in one system, used by about
20 ICI Fibres managers, made it possible to decentralise the headquarters.
Despite his idiosyncratic attitude to 'No Smoking' signs, his main aim is
that all his managers obey the same rules. 'One of the things about any
organisation is that people interpret figures in the way they wish to do so.
These days, face to face or on the phone, we are all working from the same
screen.'
Typical of the figures the screen presents to the people at both ends of the
phone are exceptions against budget, the trend of raw material costs, market
share and short-term forecasts. In the case of ICI Fibres, the market
figures came from the trade group in Brussels and are shown by country and
business sector: carpets, textiles, industrial yarns, polymers and
engineering plastics.
Managers have easy access to screens that show the various goals, such as
accident rate, lost hours, waste and fixed costs, displaying actual figures,
goals and performance to date. The presentation not only consolidates the
whole picture, but makes it possible to zoom in on detail and split the
large issue down into manageable chunks. The menus are self-explanatory, and
the headings and acronyms provide a common vocabulary which means the same
to all users.
The system has another important function. Once true figures are
established, they can be used to focus on individuals. This fosters
competition, and encourages people to keep up to the mark in such areas as
lost time, sickness, conversion of raw materials to product, and conversion
efficiency.
The connections between activities are so clear that they have the effect of
pulling the whole team together. 'We tend to equate doing a professional job
with earning more money; group pride gives people personal pride. Incentives
and prizes recognise performance.'
When Davidson took over at ICI Acrylics, he needed immediate and fast
control. His brief was to integrate businesses from approaching asset swaps
with Du Pont and BASF swiftly and effectively. 'I needed a fast track on
what was going on, and a quick understanding of people's accountability. The
financial systems had to be in place before Du Pont and BASF integration
started.'
EISL went through a similar, though speedier, process with ICI Acrylics. The
system has replaced a large number of administrative procedures. Dennis
James, the head of IT, ensures a smooth information flow. Among the issues
raised - though not yet solved - is the integration of IT and information
systems in the new organisation, involving the acquired companies.
EIS is, Davidson concludes, 'not necessarily a magic wand; it's a
discipline. It is a simple way of running the business, month to month, day
to day. The bottom line is that we all deal with a document which tells the
same story: it denies the opportunity for personal interpretation.'
Buzzword
EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS were conceived as a screen-based information
service geared specifically to top executives, with easy-to-use,
ready-packaged information which would provide a complete picture of the
organisation. 'Drill down' provides detail on components, also in graphical
form.

'Beauty may be only skin-deep but ugly goes right down to the bone.' In
computer systems, an unattractive front - end usually indicates that the
underlying design is poor. The whole maintenance and future development of
the system relies upon good design.
Many executive information systems could be defined as 'a method of
presenting information which you already know, together with data you do not
want, in a form that you cannot understand'.
I was pleasantly surprised by the EIS system at ICI. It was
simple to use, elegant in design and flexible enough to be extended in the
future.
Most MDs have a few key figures that they use to keep a handle on their
business. In ICI's case, these are a number of specific goals decided by the
senior management. The EISL consultancy worked with Scott Davidson to
extract these and present them in an accessible and consistent form.
I was especially taken by the 'On Time In Full' concept used in ICI Paints.
Sales commission is paid in full only on orders that are completed on time
with no defects. A single tin missing in a delivery of 10,000 counts as a
failure. Sales personnel no longer make promises they cannot keep.
For a big order that has been delayed, the staff can be seen loading the
trucks themselves. This is a classic example of wedding reward structures to
the goals of the company.
Computers either cost you money or save it. Anyone can think of instances of
the former while real savings due to IT are much rarer. The business
benefits of ICI's system have been remarkable. Not only has
Pounds 7m been saved, it has allowed Davidson to take a grasp on two new
businesses in a short time.
In a changing business environment, it is essential that targets are agreed
and understood by everyone involved. Now all the managers are 'singing from
the same hymn-sheet'. This may not guarantee success but it eliminates a
potential cause of failure.

<TEXT>
When Pauls Food, a small UK manufacturer of private-label groceries for
supermarkets, acquired a troubled breakfast cereals plant in northern France
for Pounds 3.8m in late 1988, it knew it was taking a gamble.
Not only had the plant's losses and demoralised workforce deterred several
larger prospective buyers; but in seeking to export its private-label
expertise to continental Europe, Pauls was heading down on a road previously
untravelled by any British food company.
But, after some nervous moments, the gamble paid off. Today the French
business, H&amp;C Cereales, is the country's leading manufacturer of
private-label breakfast cereals, supplying most of its main food retailers
and a growing list of customers elsewhere in Europe. Its annual sales of
Pounds 35m are nine times higher than when it was acquired and contribute a
third of Pauls' total turnover. It has been in profit for almost three years
and is in the middle of a Pounds 10m expansion programme.
The turnround, though remarkably swift, was far from effortless. Pauls found
that building a business in France has required it to teach retail customers
at least as much as it has learned from them. And early on, the whole
enterprise almost came to grief.
Pauls, part of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, a British industrial conglomerate, had
initially planned to raise H&amp;C Cereales' output volumes to economic levels
by exporting to the UK.
However, the idea foundered on resistance from UK retailers, which
criticised the products' quality and on a weakening of sterling against the
French franc in 1989.
Though a trusted British manager had been put in charge of the business and
installed tighter financial controls, output was still well below capacity
in early 1990 and losses were continuing to mount.
'We really began to wonder whether we had done the right thing,' recalls
Alan Jones, Pauls' managing director.
He decided to stake everything on a bolder strategy. This called for H&amp;C
Cereales to go all-out to win continental business by transforming itself
from a mediocre 'me too' producer into an innovator which aspired to match
the standards of Kellogg, the industry leader.
Substantial investments have been made in sophisticated production
equipment, better raw materials, quality controls and product development.
By the end of this year, Pauls will have invested Pounds 14m in H&amp;C
Cereales, on top of the purchase price.
A crucial element in the strategy, says Jones, was the decision to offer
continental supermarkets a comprehensive range of services. This was a
novelty in France, where most private-label groceries are cheap and usually
inferior imitations of branded products and their manufacturers provide
retailers with little marketing support.
Pauls' found it had a powerful calling card in its experience as a supplier
to chains such as J. Sainsbury and Tesco in the UK, where - uniquely in
Europe - private-label is a high-margin business which competes on quality
as well as on price.
However, although French retailers envied their UK counterparts' success in
private-label, none really understood how to replicate it. 'It was quite
difficult at first,' says Jones. 'Some of our French customers took as long
as two years to learn the business. Even today, only a few devote staff
exclusively to managing private-label, as UK supermarkets do.'
H&amp;C Cereales, which employs a multi-lingual sales and account management
team based in Paris, now helps retailers in France and other continental
countries identify opportunities by supplying them with market research. It
also advises extensively on product specifications, packaging, design,
labelling and regulatory issues.
Today, the company claims 12 per cent of French breakfast cereals sales and
is the third largest supplier after Kellogg and Cereal Partners Worldwide, a
joint venture between General Mills of the US and Nestle of Switzerland.
About 40 per cent of the Picardy plant's output is exported and a second
factory may eventually be built elsewhere in Europe.
Jones thinks private-label could ultimately capture as much as a fifth of
the European breakfast cereals market which, in France, is growing by 20 per
cent annually. He is not worried that Pauls could be squeezed by its two
bigger competitors, which are spending an estimated 20 per cent of the value
of their French sales on advertising.
H&amp;C Cereales has benefited, not suffered, from their extensive marketing
campaigns, he says. 'It certainly helps that two branded multinational
players are firmly committed to ensuring that the market expands.'

<TEXT>
FKI, the Yorkshire-based manufacturing conglomerate, has finally found an
American industrialist to hold its hand as it expands its North American
business. John Rodewig, 58, president and chief operating officer of Eaton
Corporation, has been appointed a non-executive director of FKI.
Roughly half of FKI's business is in the US and the company had hired
headhunters to find a non-executive director who could proffer advice about
the US but also knew Europe. Bob Beeston, FKI's managing director, says that
Rodewig (below) was the ideal candidate. Not only has his whole career been
at Eaton, which employs 39,000 people, but he also spent ten years running
Eaton's truck components business in Middlesex. FKI's board meets around
half a dozen times a year - at least once in the US.

FT  22 APR 93 / People: Lars McBride to bank on paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lars McBride, a City corporate financier who has had to watch the shrinking
of at least two merchant banks' corporate finance businesses from inside,
has decided to transfer his skills to industry. He is taking up the position
of finance director at Portals, the papermaking and protection and control
group.
He succeeds John Lloyd, who becomes group managing director after the May
agm.
'Like many others, I fancied the idea of helping a company grow from within
rather than advising them from outside,' says 38-year-old McBride. 'This is
a British manufacturing exporter that has done well during the recession.'
Portals is the world's leading producer of banknote paper, and the second
biggest manufacturer of tea-bag paper.
McBride was until recently managing director of European mergers and
acquisitions at Chase, but the American bank has scaled back its activities
in that area. Before that he was at County NatWest - but had the misfortune
to join three weeks before the 1987 stock market crash and two months before
the onset of the Blue Arrow affair. He also had a spell at Lazards, and
qualified as an accountant at Peat Marwick.
As finance director, Lloyd had also been in charge of corporate development;
he retains responsibility for this area but says that McBride's experience
will mean that he too has 'a very significant input'.

FT  22 APR 93 / People: Rothschild family promotion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amschel Rothschild, a cousin of N M Rothschild chairman Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild and half brother of Jacob Rothschild, has been promoted to
executive chairman of Rothschild Asset Management, the fund management arm
of the still family-run merchant bank. He had been chief executive for the
past three years.
While the succession to Sir Evelyn, 62, remains unclear, 38-year-old
Amschel's elevation confirms him as one of the most prominent family members
under 60, along with 50-year-old David de Rothschild, a cousin on the French
side, who is deputy chairman. Sir Evelyn (right) has two sons, but both are
still at school.
He is reckoned to have done a good job in helping restore the fortunes of
RAM, where performance had dropped off in the mid to late-1980s. The
operation now manages assets of around Dollars 25bn, and performance has
improved across the board, particularly in the New Court unit trusts, and
unit trust-linked personal pensions.
The previous executive chairman of RAM, Carel Mosselmans, is now chairman of
Lloyds underwriting agency Janson Green, though he remains on the board. The
title of chief executive will fall away.
Amschel, a son of the late Lord Victor Rothschild, has done a fairly
extensive tour of the bank. Before moving to RAM he worked on group policy
in Sir Evelyn's office; he has also spent a spell in the treasury division,
including working on bullion.

FT  22 APR 93 / People: A sugared path to altruism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Nightingale, Tate &amp; Lyle's company secretary, is leaving in the
autumn to become National Secretary to the National Council of English
YMCAs, the Christian youth welfare charity.
The first outsider to be appointed to the position, which is effectively
that of chief executive, in the 149-year history of the organisation,
Nightingale, who has turned 50, says it had been on his mind for a while to
do something 'more altruistic'.
Last summer he became a lay board member of the City chapter behind his
Barbican home, and says he was struck at once 'both by the calibre of the
people who worked for the charity full-time, and by the power of the
organisation'. It has an annual budget of around Pounds 60m and deals with
1.5m people a year.
Also influencing his career volte face was watching his wife train to be
ordained, next September, as a Church of England deacon. He was headhunted
by Saxton Bampfylde, itself a company with strong Christian principles.
He stresses that he is leaving Tate &amp; Lyle, where he was not a member of the
slim executive board, 'with mixed feelings', and says that he was 'very
comfortable' with the new team at the top, put in place this spring. A
solicitor by training, he had, until the takeover by Nestle, previously been
a main board director of Rowntree.
Nightingale is a familiar face in the City, having been in charge of
investor relations in both his last two jobs. Communication will be one of
his principal initial tasks for the YMCA, he believes - internally among the
200 separate local associations, as well as externally.
He joins at a time when the organisation is coping with problems ranging
from finding relevant accommodation for single-parent families to the extra
strains imposed on the YMCA's emergency services by the influx of refugees.
Despite the 'very significant' drop in salary, his family, including the
three offspring aged between 15 and 20, are firmly behind the idea.

FT  22 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Middle firms in
muddle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mid-sized accountancy firms in the UK need to improve their marketing skills
if they are to survive, according to a survey* by Huthwaite, a consultancy
firm.
Most have only a basic understanding of marketing and need to restructure
their operations and approach to improve the business they generate.
The report focused on mid-sized firms - those below the Big Six accountants
 -which are sensitive about the labels attached to them and prefer to be
called 'the national firms'.
It argues that the partnership culture often acts as a break on marketing,
with partners - many of whom are resistant to the idea of selling - normally
controlling contact with clients and potential clients.
The survey suggested that the accountants tended to be highly protective,
and did not pass on any marketing leads they had to colleagues who might be
better equipped to win a new client or sell additional services to an
existing one.
Many firms used seminars as a 'reward' for existing clients rather than as a
way to bring in potential new business. Few had any formal, structured
procedures that would allow them to assess their effectiveness in marketing.
In general, the level of information was poor. One firm proudly told the
interviewers that it was setting up a database listing clients and the staff
working on them - an elementary device that should have been in place for a
long time.
Huthwaite recommends that firms should get more people involved in marketing
and should appoint someone with overall responsibility to 'cajole,
co-ordinate and coach' others.
It says rewards linked to career development as well as money should be made
available to those who are successful in generating new business.

FT  22 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A taste for
expansion - Two nationally based companies have successfully crossed
European frontiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since enthusiasm for the single market gripped the European food
industry in the late 1980s, its efforts to expand across frontiers have been
ruled by two articles of faith.
One is that smaller fry stand little chance in a sector increasingly
dominated by multinational manufacturers and powerful retailers. The other
is that acquiring local businesses and brands, rather than building sales
from scratch, is the quickest way to break into foreign markets.
However, Molkerei Alois Muller, a privately-owned Bavarian dairy company,
has defied this conventional wisdom by seizing leadership of the UK yoghurt
market from under the noses of long-established competitors, including some
of Europe's biggest multinationals.
Until six years ago, the Muller name was unknown outside Germany, where it
has grown in the past two decades from a village dairy with four employees
into a business with sales last year of Pounds 250m and 11 per cent of the
domestic dairy products market.
By last year Muller had become Britain's 26th largest grocery brand,
out-selling old favourites such as Birds Eye frozen foods, Mars bars and
Heinz tomato ketchup. Today it commands more than a fifth of the Pounds
450m-a-year yoghurt market.
That puts it well ahead of Ski, made by Express, part of Northern Foods, and
Unigate's St Ivel Shape, which together dominated the business a decade ago:
today their share has dwindled to less than 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the
world's two biggest yoghurt brands - Danone, made by France's BSN, and
Chambourcy, made by Nestle of Switzerland - hold barely 2 per cent of the UK
market.
Muller owes its UK growth largely to one product, its 'twin-pot' Fruit
Corner, which still provides more than 80 per cent of its UK sales. Though
hardly embodying a technical revolution, even competitors admit its mild
flavour, creamy consistency and separate compartments for yoghurt and fruit
were new to British consumers.
'Previously, yoghurts sold in Britain were samey, boring and of low quality,
verging on commodities,' says Ken Wood, managing director of Muller's UK
subsidiary. 'There was lots of marketing but no real product innovation.'
Furthermore, yoghurt consumption, at 5.35kg per head annually, is a quarter
the level in Germany, where it is eaten by 80 per cent of the population,
compared with 50 per cent in the UK.
These conditions made Britain a natural choice for Muller's first
cross-border foray. Wood was hired to lead the attack in early 1986 from
Express's Eden Vale unit, then owned by Grand Metropolitan, where he was
marketing director.
For several months he banged at supermarket doors, to be told that Muller's
products were faddish, too expensive or otherwise unsuitable. Then, in March
1987, Tesco agreed to test them in 170 stores, where they sold well.
Wood's next step was to buy commercials on Border Television and arrange for
selected outlets in the region to stock Muller yoghurts on a trial basis.
The positive results helped convince previously sceptical retailers to take
Muller seriously. Today, its products are stocked by outlets handling 95 per
cent of UK grocery sales and backed by a Pounds 5m annual television
advertising budget.
Wood says he also won over supermarkets by promising that Muller would soon
make its yoghurts in Britain. A year ago it opened an ultra-modern Pounds
30m plant near Market Drayton, Shropshire, which is currently producing
about 500m pots of yoghurt a year. Today, Muller employs 250 people in the
UK and is already expanding the plant.
Wood attributes much of the company's success to the dogged perseverance and
entrepreneurial attitude of its owner, Theo Muller. But even Wood is bemused
by the speed of growth in the UK.
'It seems you can gain critical mass for a brand which, for no apparent
reason, then achieves its own momentum,' he says.
Some competitors, however, think the company risks over-reaching itself.
They point out that its sales are still based heavily on one product line
which has yet to prove long-term staying power and has recently attracted
hordes of imitators.
Wood insists the UK yoghurt market, which is growing by 10 per cent
annually, still offers plenty of potential. He is widening its yoghurt range
and may start selling other products, such as flavoured milk drinks, which
have proved popular in Germany. The Shropshire plant may also supply markets
in France, Belgium and Scandinavia.
Perhaps the strongest reason for Wood's confidence is his belief that Muller
has little to fear from a cosy club of traditional UK dairy producers, which
have been lulled into complacency by 60 years of milk supply monopoly and
little international competition.
'The fact that there are now 15 Fruit Corner look-alikes shows they still
haven't learned the lesson,' says Wood. 'It is so much easier to copy than
to innovate. That's what they've always done in the past.'

new guidance on goodwill and intangibles

WHEN senior executives at Hoover last year launched a high-profile campaign
to offer free flights to the US in exchange for their vacuum cleaners, they
may have hoped to change the image of their brand. If so, the aim was
successful - except that the image went down instead of up.
Angry customers unable to fight through the small-print and claim their
tickets besieged the switchboards. Three top UK executives were branded with
blame and forced to leave the company. A name so carefully cultivated since
1908 that it had become an accepted part of the English language was damaged
almost overnight.
When Philip Morris decided to cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes earlier
this month, it sent a frisson through companies with branded goods
everywhere. The world's most valuable brand - worth Dollars 31bn according
to a recent estimate and supported by an annual Dollars 100m marketing
expenditure in the US alone - seemed under threat.
Events such as these are causing new attention to be given to the subject of
brands and their valuation, just at a time when British business is holding
its breath in anticipation of new guidance from the Accounting Standards
Board (ASB).
It is a topic which demands attention, as a growing number of companies face
the issue of how to report acquisitions and investments in their accounts,
and while there is little regulation of the existing position.
The annual survey of accounts by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales in 1990-91 showed just 2 per cent of all companies and 6
per cent of large listed companies had brands on their balance sheets. The
figures in the 1992-93 edition have risen to 15 per cent and 30 per cent
respectively.
These proportions might have been considerable higher had not acquisition
activity dropped off sharply as the heat of the 1980s was doused by the cold
shower of recession and the end of the bull market.
Now at last, after considerable delay, it looks as though the ASB is poised
to deliver a missive. The latest timetable suggests delivery of a discussion
draft by late summer or early autumn this year.
The focus will not be on intangible assets and brands in general, but on
accounting for goodwill - the difference between the purchase price of an
acquired company and the value of its net assets.
As a paper sponsored by the ASB from five academics at Manchester University
last year argued, goodwill includes three separate elements: the fair value
of separately identifiable intangible assets; the present value of benefits
such as market imperfections; and over- or under-payment.
The new paper is likely to argue that there are three ways to deal with
goodwill: to write it off over a fixed period, set it against reserves, or
keep it in the balance sheet while it maintains its value.
Current thinking seems to be that the ASB is willing to accept retention of
goodwill in the balance sheet as long as it is satisfied that any diminution
in values can be reliably tested. This question of robustness is the
problem.
The ASB is likely to recommend adoption of the technique generally used by
industry - based on projections of future cash flow. This must be verified
by regularly comparing actual cash flow against that originally predicted at
the time of the acquisition of an asset.
This approach is currently being 'field tested' with a number of companies
to see whether it can work in practice.
One is Reed International. Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director, says: 'We
think it is perfectly feasible. We have been undertaking (brand valuations)
for four or five years.'
But opinion is strongly divided - not least among members of the ASB itself.
A recent report on brands* highlighted both the variety of existing
treatments of intangible assets in countries around the world and the split
of expert views.
Mr Art Wyatt, a partner with Arthur Andersen and former chairman of the
International Accounting Standards Committee, warned that no transaction
exists to trigger recognition of brands and other intangibles, and no
exchange transaction takes place to validate their measurement. He questions
whether 'the financial community is ready for reflection of undisciplined
entries for non-events'.
Mr Dennis Beresford, chairman of the US Financial Accounting Standards
Board, says brand accounting is 'a squall in a large storm' affecting the
growing use of 'soft' assets which will increasingly challenge the
traditional view of the balance sheet as simply 'a repository of
transaction-based hard assets and firm liabilities'.
Mr Peter Cartmell, finance director at Cadbury Schweppes, said his company
decided to introduce brand valuations in its 1989 accounts after some
significant acquisitions for three reasons: the value of their brands was
increasing and would not be appreciated by less sophisticated investors;
Stock Exchange regulations were relying purely on audited accounts rather
than any underlying reflection of company value shown by the share price;
and lower shareholders' funds would lead to a lower credit-rating, higher
financing costs and more onerous borrowing procedures.
A journal article published last winter by Christopher Napier and Michael
Power from the London School of Economics poured scorn on claims in a 1992
report from Arthur Andersen - sponsored by companies which include brands in
their balance sheets - that a consensus was growing on valuation.
The academics argued that the Andersen report was as much about marketing
and defending the firm's own valuation techniques as about assessing the
true level of consensus.
But while the theoretical debate goes on, the reality is that companies are
developing and using a wide range of brand valuation techniques. Mr Michael
Birkin, group chief executive of Interbrand, one of the leading brand
consultancies, says that virtually all branded-goods businesses use
valuation techniques for internal purposes.
While many companies have held back from reporting brand values in their
accounts, they use valuations for activities including internal brand
management, mergers and acquisitions, tax planning and litigation work.
Mr Birkin stresses that the Hoover and Marlboro incidents do not suggest
that putting values on brands in company accounts is pointless, but rather
show the need for regular revaluations.
The question is how far accountancy decides to catch up with reality. Nigel
Stapleton warns that any valuation techniques developed by the ASB should
not depart too far from the way businesses value brands for their own
purposes.
But while the ASB focuses on acquired goodwill, pressure will continue to
mount on the subject of internally-generated intangibles. These include not
only brands, but equally even less measurable assets such as the value of
staff.
Even the academic study sponsored by the ASB recommended that
internally-generated intangibles should be valued as well as those which
were acquired, to ensure consistency. The ASB's own attack on the balance
sheet and its definition of assets in the statement of principles appears to
argue in this direction.
But personally, Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, shares Art Wyatt's
scepticism on the subject. 'Their measurement is not reliable enough,' he
says. 'There has been no market transaction to prove their worth. I think
one day we will consider the subject, but it may be a long way off.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party unity thwarts
referendum move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR AND the government joined forces in the early hours of this morning
to reject Euro-sceptic demands for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty, as
the bill's marathon five-month committee stage entered its final lap.
A proposal to delay the bill's entry into force until 1996 unless a
referendum was agreed to in the meantime was defeated by 363 votes to 124.
The referendum debate, which could act as a curtain-raiser for a similar
debate in the Lords in June or July, came after MPs had given a ringing
endorsement to deputy speaker Mr Michael Morris's handling of their tortuous
deliberations.
Starting his speech just before midnight, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, said that allowing a decision on Maastricht to be made not by
parliament but through a referendum would be 'a shirking of the
responsibilities we were given only a year ago.'
The Commons was 'doing its job' by preparing for the final decision that 'it
 -it - will take at third reading.' It was 'certainly not for fear of a
negative result' that the government opposed holding a referendum on the
issue, he said.
In a relaxed and buoyant address, Mr Hurd allowed frequent interventions
from Tory Euro-sceptics, rebutting one suggestion the government had hurried
the bill along by saying it was not the general view that it had been
'hustled through.'
It was 'odd' that those who put the most emphasis on the sovereignty of
parliament felt it needed to be 'buttressed' by a referendum, he said.
For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, foreign affairs spokesman, said reliance on
referendums was 'the biggest single threat to the authority of parliament
and the undermining of parliamentary democracy.'
Liberal Democrat president Mr Charles Kennedy said the issue deserved a free
vote among MPs - and confessed that his own party was split.
He said that, for example, he backed a referendum while Liberal Democrat
European affairs spokesman Sir Russell Johnston opposed one - even though
both wanted to see Maastricht ratified.
Earlier, the endorsement of Mr Morris came when a motion criticising him for
not allowing a vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment was heavily
rejected by 450 votes to 81 after a three-hour debate.
Little extra light was shed on whether MPs would have the chance to vote on
the amendment - known as amendment 27 - which would remove the protocol
containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. But it was
confirmed that the vote could not come in what remained of the committee
stage.
Labour is pressing for a vote at the report stage, which is set to follow
the current line-by-line consideration and will be presided over by Miss
Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker.
But Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday argued it would be difficult for Miss
Boothroyd to allow this course of action if another social chapter-related
Labour amendment - known as new clause 74 - which the government has
accepted, was duly passed during the committee stage.
MPs are likely to debate this new clause today in what will be the bill's
23rd - and possibly last - day in committee.

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine sees dilemma on PO
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, admitted in the
Commons yesterday that the government faced a 'dilemma' over the
privatisation of the post office.
He explained that the problem at the heart of the matter was that of
honouring pledges that the universality of price and service provided in all
parts of the country was 'non-negotiable', while relieving the post office
of the constraints imposed by the public sector so that it could become more
competitive.
Mr Heseltine rejected a demand by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and
industry secretary, that the whole idea should be dropped following the
recent disclosure that the necessary legislation would not be introduced in
the next parliamentary session.
Two Tory backbenchers, Mr David Nicholson (Taunton) and Mr Patrick Cormack
(Staffordshire South), expressed reservations about changing the post
office's present status.
Mr Simon Hughes, for the Liberal Democrats, urged a relaxation of the
constraints associated with the public sector and insisted that 'privatising
the post office would be a privatisation too far'.
Mr Heseltine accused Mr Hughes of providing a classic example of 'trying to
have it both ways'.
As for it being a privatisation too far, he emphasised: 'We will decide
whether we are going to embark on the journey or not'.
Mr Heseltine described suggestions that the post office could be given
commercial freedom without being privatised as being divorced from the
reality of public sector accounting.
He said: 'There has never been a government which has been able to set free
a public sector enterprise outside the discipline of the public expenditure
round and Treasury control.'
Mr Heseltine also stressed that the post office was coming under increasing
competition from technology such as fax machines and courier services.
In a written reply Sir John Cope, paymaster general, cited 'commercial
confidentiality' when refusing to disclose the additional costs incurred by
the post office as a result of the recent VAT changes in the treatment of
intra-EC freight transport services.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, yesterday urged British Coal to move
'rapidly' to place on the market mines like Bevercotes in Nottinghamshire
which it no longer requires.
Mr Richard Alexander (C Newark) complained that private sector interests
were not being given an early opportunity to view mines which British Coal
planned to close at the end of the month.

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: N Ireland water sell-off delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has angered Scottish MPs and fuelled suspicions that it is
deliberately wooing Northern Ireland MPs by shelving until after the next
general election the privatisation of Northern Ireland water.
Labour and the Scottish Nationalist party seized on the decision to demand
that the controversial plan for the privatisation of Scottish water also be
postponed - a call rebuffed by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary.
Northern Ireland water privatisation was promised in the government's
election manifesto. But Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, told
MPs late on Tuesday that for 'technical reasons' the sell-off had to be
postponed.
Ministers said yesterday that a report by consultants Touche Ross had
concluded that the time needed for reforming water charges and to collate
data on consumer and environmental issues ruled out privatisation before the
next election.
The NIO favours privatisation via flotation rather than a trade sale.
Ministers insisted that the commitment to privatisation remained.
The delay will help Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restart
political talks on province's future following local elections on May 19.
Unionist and nationalist parties are opposed to water privatisation and
welcomed the move.
'We hope it will be the harbinger of things to come,' said one Ulster
Unionist MP who believed the delay was intended to help win his party's
support for political talks.
In the past year the government has looked to Unionist MPs to help avert
Commons defeats on coal and, to a lesser extent, on Maastricht.
The decision will not have been hard for Northern Ireland ministers who are
not among the most enthusiastic supporters of privatisation. Reform of water
charges is expected to lead to controversy, with many of the less well-off
households affected being in nationalist communities.
Scottish water privatisation has been linked by the government to
restructuring of Scottish local authorities. Mr Lang said: 'The
circumstances in Scotland are different from those in Northern Ireland. Our
purpose - and we have reached no decision yet - is to achieve the best
solution for Scottish circumstances.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letter highlights Labour fears on
housing benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURE arrangements for housing benefit for housing association tenants
facing rent rises are in doubt, Labour said yesterday, following a
minister's refusal to guarantee that increases would be met.
Mr John Battle, the opposition housing spokesman, highlighted the issue
after a letter from Mr Alistair Burt, the junior social security minister,
earlier this month.
On housing association rents, Mr Burt wrote: 'Although the Housing Benefit
scheme can meet reasonable rents in full (and reasonable rent increases if
the customer is in receipt of benefit), it cannot be assumed that housing
benefit will automatically increase to meet housing association rent
increases'.
The question has been given added force by the cut in housing association
grant and the government's drive towards market rents.
Mr Battle attacked the government for allowing the two departments involved
 -the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment -
to contradict each other.
'At present the housing minister says social security will pay - something
the social security minister has just denied. As housing association rents
are already escalating, tenants have a right to know how they are to meet
the cost of the increases,' he said.
The letter reflects the tension between the two departments over aspects of
housing policy in this area.
One of the aims of the inter-departmental review of housing benefit is to
resolve the problem of the effect of the DOE's plans for improving
conditions for council and housing association tenants, at the cost of
higher rents, on the DSS budget which bears much of the impact through
housing benefit spending.

Mr John Smith, party leader, won support at a meeting of the parliamentary

However, more than 50 Labour MP last night signed a Commons motion urging

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: ICI chairman defends job units
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMONS committee yesterday suggested that shareholders of Imperial
Chemicals Industries (ICI) might force the group to disband units that help
redundant staff find new jobs if they were more aware of their activities
and associated costs.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, told the employment committee that the
company - which employs 50,000 people today compared with 140,000 in 1970 -
had redeployment units on its sites. These helped employees being made
redundant find alternative employment, both inside the group and externally.
The units are successful - at ICI Agro-Chemicals 80 per cent of the
division's staff affected by redundancies over the past two years have had
new jobs within six months.
Sir Denys agreed with the committee that the Employment Service did a
similar job - but he said that it came in at a later time when the
individual was jobless.
Labour MP Mr Ernie Ross said he would like his committee to recommend more
in-house units like those at ICI. But he was worried that if the job units
were given such prominence in a government report 'greedy' ICI shareholders
might call for their abolition. Sir Denys said the sums spent on the units
were 'relatively modest' and that he had no such fears.

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major to hold TV press meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major is planning to hold occasional televised press conferences at
Downing Street, which could possibly be broadcast live, Ralph Atkins writes.
The prime minister's office said yesterday that Mr Major sees the move as a
chance to get his message across more directly. However it stressed that
they would not be held on a regular basis.
Mr Major does not believe the 'bear pit' atmosphere of his twice-weekly
Commons questions sessions allow for a calm explanation of his thinking. He
is also instinctively wary of the lobby system of unattributable briefings
and press conferences could be used particularly when the Commons is in
recess.
The prime minister's office also said yesterday that Mr Major wants to 'grab
the agenda' on the development of the European Community after Maastricht in
a series of speeches starting today.
Britain has too often been forced into responding to an agenda set by the
France-Germany alliance, an official said: 'We have been left rather
dragging our heels.'
Mr Major will develop his theme of an enlarged, free market European
Community when he addresses the Conservative Group on Europe tonight - a
meeting marking the 20th anniversary of Britain's entry into the EC.

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Whitehall isn't working - Political
Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the habit in politics to shoot the messenger. The Conservatives are
especially susceptible. Those who watched the party's 1990 conference will
remember the opprobrium heaped daily on the image-makers.
No matter that the very real issues of Europe and the poll tax were driving
the Thatcher administration to self-destruction. Somehow the fault lay not
with the policies but with the presentation.
So it is hardly surprising that Mr Major's team in 10 Downing Street has
emerged as a target for the disenchanted, the disgruntled and the plain
frightened among the government's supporters.
A happy ending is now in sight for the Maastricht bill. The economy is at
last showing real signs of life. But it will take a long time for the
Conservative party to recover from its year of trauma. The prime minister's
policy unit, headed by Mrs Sarah Hogg, is accused of failing to provide
drive and direction to the government's policies. His political advisers are
said to be out of touch with the mood in the bars and lobbies of the
Commons.
His press office, headed by Mr Gus O'Donnell, is said to lack the acute
political antennae and the professional fire-fighting skills needed in such
dangerous times. Witness the public relations fiasco which followed the
imposition in the Budget of value added tax on domestic fuel. Even Sir Robin
Butler, as distinguished a cabinet secretary as any in recent memory, is
accused of dithering and delay.
There is no evidence of a dark conspiracy. Some of the attacks can be
readily dismissed. There are those in the government still with nostalgic
memories of the Stalinist certainties of the mid 1980s. Then no one dared
blow their nose without permission from Number 10. They need to be reminded
that Mr Major promised to replace his predecessor's conviction with
consultation and consensus.
The Euro-sceptics find it convenient to attack the Downing Street machine as
a way of venting their fury over Maastricht. A still-inexperienced prime
minister is being led astray by advisers and officials implementing their
own agenda. Others are just fed up with being battered by their constituents
and the media. There is no disloyalty in saying Mr Major is being let down
by those around him.
But the unease is sufficiently widespread - and in enough cases objective -
to be taken seriously. The prime minister's office, the underlying message
runs, isn't working. And when Downing Street isn't working, nor is the
Whitehall machine.
Civil servants complain that relatively uncontroversial decisions are
deferred. Ministerial pending-trays are full. Out-trays are empty. Instead
of driving decision-making across Whitehall, Downing Street is
over-cautious. No one is stepping in to break the deadlock in
inter-departmental squabbles. Reviews and initiatives are substituted for
decisions.
There are plenty of examples. Only yesterday the Overseas Development
Administration was forced to admit to MPs that Whitehall had still to
approve a trade and aid policy promised two years ago. After 20 years of
argument on the subject, the Treasury wants yet another review on whether
Britain should align its summertime with the rest of Europe. Such
non-decisions are trivial in themselves. But there are too many of them.
There are more important cases also. Legislation to equalise the pension age
has been put back a year amid fears of agitation on the back benches. Number
10 is said to be less than enthusiastic about getting to grips with the
Sunday trading mess.
Within Downing Street much of the criticism is seen as sour grapes. The
prime minister focuses on the big issues of the day. Some departments then
feel neglected. In others the complaint is that Mrs Hogg interferes too much
not too little. No one could accuse the government of shirking hard
decisions over coal or taxation. Once Maastricht is out of the way, it will
be clear it has not lost its momentum. Public relations will be spruced up
with on-the-record prime ministerial press conferences.
That may prove right. But instinctive activists in the Cabinet are among
those warning against indecision and drift. A preference for pragmatism over
ideology makes it more rather than less important for Downing Street to
demonstrate its grip. With the storm clouds over Europe and the economy
lifting, Whitehall needs to get back to work.

FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory candidate pledge on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate in the Newbury by-election, promised
yesterday to do 'everything I could' to prevent a further widening of Value
Added Tax beyond its imposition on domestic fuel announced in last month's
Budget.
His comments, after he had been challenged over the Tories' election pledges
not to raise taxes, were seized on by his opponents.
The main challenger in the Tory seat, Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat
candidate, said: 'I think there is now a widespread feeling in this area
that the government was re-elected on the basis of a whole series of false
pledges . . . think now people are no longer going to trust the government's
pledges.'

take decisive military action'. Some Labour MPs continue to press for the
sending of ground troops.
Mr Smith has hardened his position over the last week. To the surprise of
some, however, pressure for taking a stronger stance has come from leftwing
MPs who were nervous about Britain's military involvement in the gulf war.

FT  22 APR 93 / Private funding for NHS is boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL freedom of hospitals and health authorities to use private
finance is to be considerably widened, Mr Tom Sackville, junior health
minister, said yesterday.
NHS trusts and health authorities now need Treasury approval for all
contracts involving private finance in excess of Pounds 250,000. At a
seminar yesterday organised by the Social Market Foundation, an independent
think tank, Mr Sackville announced a 'very substantial increase in
delegation' by lifting the limit from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 10m.
'Up to now, our delegated limits have been so low that almost all private
finance schemes had to come to Whitehall,' he said. The Pounds 250,000 was
so low that it had 'quite simply put people off' seeking collaborative
projects between the public and private sectors. Some potential schemes had
foundered because of the real and psychological barriers of having to obtain
approval.
Mr Sackville's announcement adds substance to a policy that has been
developing in the Department of Health since the Autumn Statement, when the
chancellor outlined proposals to ease the use of private finance in the
public sector.
There are some long-standing examples of private-sector investment in NHS
hospitals, from the shared use of expensive technology to privately managed
shopping malls.
Before last year's general election ministers were anxious to avoid
extending a policy that might inflame opposition allegations that they
intended to privatise the NHS.
Similar charges were renewed yesterday, with Mr David Blunkett, shadow
health secretary, accusing the government of trying to 'fudge the difference
between private and public health care'. Ms Liz Lynne, for the Liberal
Democrats, described the proposals as the 'slippery slope towards
privatisation'.
However, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is confident that the
government has succeeded in demonstrating that its 1991 health reforms were
not the first step to privatisation. She believes the public will regard
appropriate private-sector investment as a sensible way of expanding the
NHS's Pounds 2bn annual capital expenditure. Mrs Bottomley has a further
incentive - public spending pressures are severely limiting the scope for
extra public finance, and hers will be one of the first Whitehall
departments scrutinised for savings under the government's forthcoming
public-spending review.
Ministers see scope for private-sector involvement in a wide range of NHS
activities including waste incineration, energy conservation and the
provision of hospital accommodation used by both public and private
patients.
Some private-sector managers would like the government to go further, and
take account of private hospitals in overall health planning.

FT  22 APR 93 / Weinstock seeks aid for aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD WEINSTOCK, chief executive of GEC, yesterday said that Britain has been
'outmanoeuvred' by foreign governments in the aerospace business because of
its unwillingness to collaborate with industry.
He told the Commons trade and industry committee that while Britain
discussed government help for industry, other countries 'just did it'. He
added that the government must intervene to help Britain's aerospace
industry to avoid 'continuing industrial decline'.
Lord Weinstock said the most efficient help would be through technology
demonstrator programmes, in which the cost of building the first example of
a new technology was shared between industry and the government.
Mr Anthony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty Aerospace, part of TI Group,
said help was needed for such projects as the next generation of landing
gear for ultra-large passenger aircraft. 'The dialogue (with the government
over assistance) is now more constructive, but it is still dialogue,' he
said.
Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, warned that skilled workers who lost their jobs in the
aerospace industry would be tempted to seek careers elsewhere. They would
not be available if industry wanted those skills again.
Lord Weinstock also criticised Ministry of Defence procurement policy which
had meant that foreign companies were now involved in most contracts. He
argued that the ministry might save some money by buying from a foreign
contractor, but the real cost was picked up by other government departments.
He said that the French government put in 'hundreds of millions' of pounds
to help its industries, and argued that spending on defence contracts should
be regarded as spending on technology development.

FT  22 APR 93 / Barclays may not pass on rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK yesterday indicated that it would not pass on base rate cuts
to business borrowers if the base rate, now 6 per cent, falls below 5 per
cent.
The bank announced that it was cutting the minimum interest rate for its
200,000 business borrowers from 6 per cent plus the customer's lending
margin to 5 per cent plus margin. But Mr Bill Gordon, banking division
managing director, said any further reduction in the bank's minimum interest
rates 'would make it difficult to provide its depositors with a satisfactory
return'.
National Westminster, the other leading lender to small and medium-sized
businesses, has already indicated it may not pass on base rate cuts below 5
per cent, saying that a decision on whether to do so would depend on
personal savings rates.
Both banks have been careful to reduce minimum rates in advance of base rate
cuts over the past year.
They have faced controversy - and a Bank of England inquiry - over the
passing on of interest rate cuts.

FT  22 APR 93 / Union to press for rights at Honda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU, Britain's largest manufacturing union, is planning a recruitment
and recognition campaign at Honda, the only Japanese car company operating a
non-union plant in Britain.
Mr Michael Jones, Honda's plant manager at Swindon, Wiltshire, said: 'We
just wish to be left alone to achieve our objectives. We work quite happily
together without having a third party.'
Only a handful of the 1,200 Honda workers - associates as the company calls
them - belong to a union. Mr Jones said the company was 'totally committed
to the teamwork approach' and there had been 'no requests' from workers to
have unions recognised.
Honda, like other Japanese car companies in Britain, has a wide range of
employee benefits including private medical insurance.
Mr Jones addded: 'There is no them and us here. We are all us.' Honda staff
have just received a 3.7 per cent pay increase.
The manufacturing union has negotiated single-union agreements at Nissan and
Toyota, the other two Japanese car companies in Britain.
Mr Roger Butler, union executive officer for south-east England, said it
would 'not leave a stone unturned in our campaign to target Honda'. He said
Honda's close links to the unionised Rover group may assist the union in its
efforts.

FT  22 APR 93 / Management 'shambles' admitted at health authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS in the West Midlands Regional Health Authority resulted
in at least Pounds 10m-worth of expenditure for which little or no value was
received, a report to the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday.
MPs on the committee have been examining aspects of the authority's
administration since a district auditor's report last year concluded that a
consultancy exercise designed to save Pounds 50m had cost up to Pounds 4m.
Sir Duncan Nichol, National Health Service chief executive, yesterday
admitted that the overall situation revealed by the auditor had been a
'shambles'. He accepted that his NHS management executive should have become
aware of the West Midlands problems sooner than it did.
Following the consultancy investigation, the district auditor carried out
further inquiries and concludes in a report that the authority was suffering
from 'general management problems'. The report finds that the authority's
board failed to exert sufficient control.
A decision by the board to set up a separate regionally managed services
division to oversee peripheral activities, says the report, was valid. But
the board's subsequent action in leaving the division's director to operate
without effective direction and control was an 'unacceptable abrogation of
responsibility'.
The then regional general manager had failed to report significant
developments to the board or control the actions of senior officers. 'Many
of the RHA's management controls did not work. The arrangements set up to
monitor internal activities failed to identify problems and did not
facilitate prompt action when it was needed.'
Numerous developments had depended on business plans that were 'uniformly
speculative and unrealistic'. Neither the board nor senior officers
reappraised plans in the light of changing circumstances.
The report says financial control at the health authority had fallen below
the standards generally expected of a public body.

FT  22 APR 93 / Small business audits reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will today hold out the prospect of a significant reduction
in the regulatory burden on small business with the formal opening of public
consultation on scrapping the audit requirement for small private companies.
But the ambition of the Department of Trade and Industry to abolish for all
unquoted small companies the requirement for independent annual audit of
their accounts still faces fierce Treasury opposition. The Inland Revenue
has persuaded the Treasury that the audit requirement is an essential
element in reducing potential fraud.
The DTI consultation paper is therefore expected to foreshadow a more
limited relaxation of the rules, concentrating initially at least on limited
companies in family ownership and with a relatively low annual turnover.
One suggestion is that the requirement be abolished initially for businesses
whose turnover is below the Pounds 36,600 threshold for value added tax.
That would help about 250,000 companies. But the Institute of Chartered
Accountants recently won widespread backing among bankers, businesses and
accountants for a proposal that only those companies with a turnover of more
than Pounds 300,000 a year be subject to annual audit.

FT  22 APR 93 / Heseltine urges academic help for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW WAYS must be found to harness the 'intellectual horsepower' of
universities and colleges to help small and medium-sized businesses to grow
and create jobs, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told
Manchester Business School.
He suggested that, in future, businesses would have access to databases at
the government's new one-stop shops to find out who the best experts were to
help with technical problems.
A wider spread of management training was also essential, Mr Heseltine told
a meeting of the school's staff and students, and industrialists who support
the school.
'Small and medium-sized firms are the key to increasing competitiveness,' he
said. 'In the short term, running courses for large companies offers a great
attraction to business schools and academia because of the companies'
commitment. Relationships are easy.
'But ways have to be found of reaching many more medium-sized and smaller
enterprises to improve managerial skills. The adoption of training by these
companies remains relatively low.'
Another difficulty was reaching most companies - chambers of commerce, the
Confederation of British Industry and other trade or business associations
covered less than 50 per cent of the 3m businesses in Britain, he said.
Numbers of businesses had grown from 1.8m in 1979 and there were 400,000
start-ups last year, in spite of the recession. Small and medium-sized
enterprises would be the main sources of new jobs for the rest of the
decade.
Mr Heseltine said jobs would not be created by large companies because they
wanted to protect hard-won productivity gains.
He concluded: 'Jobs will come in small and medium-sized enterprises in an
unpredictable way. You cannot plan it in a capitalist society, but they will
come. We have to help that process.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Council joins in airports dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVERPOOL Airport's attempts to block expansion of Manchester Airport and
force airlines to fly to Merseyside has been attacked by Bolton Borough
Council.
Manchester plans to build a second runway in the Cheshire green belt and to
expand capacity from 12.5m to 30m passengers a year. The plan, which will be
subject to a public inquiry next year, is opposed by local and environmental
groups.
Liverpool Airport, which handles 400,000 passengers a year, is proposing its
own underused runway as an alternative, with a 30-mile train link between
the airports.
Mr Bob Howarth, leader of Bolton council, and Mr Brian Collinge, its chief
executive, said in a joint statement: 'If Liverpool were to deny Manchester
a second runway, international traffic, particularly American, would
transfer to Europe or London.
'Airlines are not prevented from operating to Liverpool now and it is wrong
to assume denying Manchester a second runway will suddenly cause
international traffic to be attracted to Liverpool.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Private investors urged to buy gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is taking steps to encourage private-investor purchases
in gilts as the government battles to fund its growing budget deficit,
Philip Coggan writes.
For the forthcoming auction of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock 1998, the Bank
will be publishing for the first time shortened application forms in the
national press. These are designed specially for private investors making
so-called non-competitive bids - where the price is set by the market.
The Bank said falling inflation and interest rates had increased
private-investor enthusiasm for gilts. It did not want to mount an
aggressive mass-marketing campaign for gilts but it could provide
information and easy dealing facilities.
To meet the first objective the Bank published a free booklet earlier this
month to explain the intricacies of gilts to the small investor. About
60,000 people have requested the guide, and some 300,000 booklets have been
placed in post offices.
To improve dealing facilities, the Treasury recently increased to Pounds
25,000 the amount of stock which could be bought via the cheap dealing
service at post offices.
Investing in gilts - a guide for the small investor. Available from post
offices or by phoning 0800 616814.

FT  22 APR 93 / Governance changes 'not productive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST innovations in corporate governance have had little effect in
improving the performance of British business, according to a study released
today.
It says that adding non-executive directors to the board or splitting the
roles of chairman and chief executive, as the recent Cadbury committee on
corporate governance recommended, have hardly any impact on earnings per
share or other key financial indicators.
The study comes in the latest edition of the Corporate Register published by
Hemmington Scott, the information group, and covers all 1,533 UK-quoted
companies, excluding investment trusts.
Mr Peter Scott, who co-ordinated the research, said: 'One can't point to any
empirical evidence that this kind of governance has made any practical
difference. I think the jury is out.'
Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Cadbury committee, said use of the
indicators referred to was 'superficial' and gave no indication of the
quality of the non-executive directors involved.
The research does not consider the non-financial benefits which
non-executive directors might bring to a board. But the Cadbury committee's
voluntary code relies on shareholders to exert pressure on companies for
better corporate governance.
The findings indicate that they have little financial incentive to lobby for
these changes. The study shows that for the median-quoted British company
there was no earnings per share growth over the past five years, but for the
median company, with a combined chairman and chief executive, reported
earnings increased by 1.7 per cent.
For the best-performing quarter of companies earnings per share rose 12.6
per cent, but the figure was up 13.9 per cent for companies with no
non-executives and 13.4 per cent for those with a combined chairman and
chief executive.
Just 8 per cent of quoted companies now have no non-executive directors and
only 21 per cent have a combined chairman and chief executive, the study
shows.

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European
Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997.
It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee and in view of Germany's
difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in preparations for
the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and the European
Central Bank.

<TEXT>
SCEPTICISM about whether employers will take part in the government's new
Workstart programme has been expressed by the independent Employment Policy
Institute.
Workstart, under which employers will be given a government subsidy of
Pounds 60 a week for taking on the long-term jobless, was announced in last
month's Budget. The institute said: 'The most immediate task facing those
responsible for the pilots will be to gain the interest of employers.'
It suggests that the pilot schemes should experiment with different levels
of subsidies in the range of Pounds 60 to Pounds 150 a week.
It also said that problems had arisen with previous job subsidy experiments,
including the displacement of existing workers and the provision of
subsidies for workers who would have been taken on anyway - 71 per cent of
the subsidised recruits under a 1978 experiment would have been taken on
without the subsidy.

FT  22 APR 93 / Sunday ban 'discriminatory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR WOMEN shopworkers are claiming that an enforced closure of a West
Yorkshire branch of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, under the 1950 Shops Act is
discriminatory because a ban on Sunday working in the retail sector affects
women more than men.
Their challenge in the High Court, which begins today, marks the last round
in the battle between retailers and local authorities in England and Wales
over Sunday trading, because all other avenues have been exhausted.
The women are suing Kirklees council in West Yorkshire for lost wages after
the enforced Sunday closure of the chain's Dewsbury store for 12 weeks in
1991.
They are also seeking an injunction preventing the council from forcing a
closure of the store on Sundays on the grounds that this will take away
their right to Sunday employment.
The court will also hear a fresh application by the council for an
injunction to close the store on Sundays after last October's ruling by the
European Court of Justice that the 1950 Shops Act, which governs Sunday
trading in England and Wales, is not incompatible with European law.
When the council obtained a temporary injunction to close the Dewsbury store
in 1991, B&amp;Q offered the women alternative Monday-to-Saturday work. All but
one said they were unable to accept because of family arrangements.
B&amp;Q, which is opposing the move to close the store, says it has 'a mass of
statistical evidence' to support the contention that women are
disproportionately affected by Sunday trading bans.
More than 60 per cent of its Sunday staff are women, it says, and it has
evidence that enforcement of the Shops Act across England and Wales would
lead to the loss of between 120,000 and 150,000 part-time jobs in the retail
sector, 80 per cent of which are taken by women.
B&amp;Q will argue that the 1950 legislation is discriminatory and should not be
enforced. Mr Tony Askham, B&amp;Q's solicitor, said the 1989 Employment Act
specifically provides that any legislation which is discriminatory on
grounds of sex and predates the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act should be
treated as 'of no effect'.
In addition, he said, European law imposes on the government and local
authorities an obligation to uphold the principles of equal treatment in the
Treaty of Rome and the 1977 equal-treatment directive.
If there is a case that the 1950 act is sexually discriminatory then it is
up to a local authority trying to enforce the law to show that the purpose
of the legislation is objectively justifiable on grounds unrelated to sex,
headded.
Both sides and the government appear to accept that the case might have to
go to the European Court and take up to two years to resolve.
The only hope of short-circuiting the issue lies with the government
bringing forward legislation to reform the act.

FT  22 APR 93 / Virgin Radio banks on seductive powers of Mrs Robinson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN Radio, the UK's first national commercial rock station, was playing
the 1960s hit Mrs Robinson yesterday. It was, however, a version by the
Lemonheads, not the original by Simon and Garfunkel.
The difference perhaps helps to define the new station's place in the
market. Virgin, which is launched officially on April 30, aims to broadcast
the best adult album rock music of the past 25 years, aimed at the 20 to
45-year-old market.
'We are too old for the charts and too young for the gold stations,' says Mr
David Campbell, chief executive of the station. Virgin Radio is 75 per cent
owned by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group with the remainder held by Apax,
a venture-capital group.
Although there are still eight days to the launch, the sound of Virgin Radio
1215 AM can already be heard all over the country.
Mr Campbell decided to use the transmitters he had available from the
beginning of this month. The station can do anything at the moment apart
from take money for advertising before the official launch.
From Monday Virgin Radio will be broadcasting 24 hours a day and even
transmitting examples of the advertisements that will run from April 30  -
without charge.
Virgin bid Pounds 1.8m for the licence in a joint venture with former
breakfast broadcaster TV-am which has since sold its stake. The total
investment will be about Pounds 12m. The station will be run with a total
staff of 42, including 15 presenters.
Virgin Radio has guaranteed advertisers an audience of 3.3m - although this
may be on the conservative side.
In its first few months on air Classic FM quickly reached more than 4m
listeners a week.
Mr Campbell says the station is already ahead of its projections. It is
believed that more than Pounds 2m in advertising will have been booked by
the time of the launch.
Ten 'founding advertisers' include three using UK commercial radio for the
first time - Perrier, Hewlett Packard and a new product from Ambre Solaire.
A fourth, Carling Black Label, is returning to commercial radio for the
first time in six years.
Mr Campbell believes that Virgin, together with Classic FM and Atlantic 242,
which broadcasts over much of the UK from the Irish Republic, will together
boost commercial radio so that it starts earning more than its traditional 2
per cent of total advertising revenue.
Mr Ray Kelly, chief executive of Carat (UK), the media space buyer, believes
national commercial radio will broaden the advertising base of radio as a
whole. Being on AM rather than FM is, however, the downside for Virgin, he
says.
'On FM Virgin would have been a real success. On AM it remains to be seen.'

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European
Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained
in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published
yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident
that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to
fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997.
It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria
within the next four years, says the committee, but in view of Germany's
present difficulties this may not happen.
In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread
belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the
community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997. The
view among most member states is that there should be considerable
flexibility in interpreting the convergence criteria, a view not shared by
Germany.
Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean
that prospects for monetary union would disappear, says the report.
'It is important not to underestimate the strength and depth of commitment
to monetary union amongst politicians elsewhere in the community,' it says,
adding that a number of member states would probably seek to create an
alternative institutional framework to pave the way for monetary union
should the Treaty be rejected.
The committee believes political pressure on the UK from other member
countries to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism will grow.
Non-membership following UK ratification of the Maastricht treaty would
'cause difficulties' it says.
The report says that only limited progress has been made in practical
preparations for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and
the European Central Bank, 'a fact that may reflect the wider uncertainties
surrounding the prospects for monetary union'.

<TEXT>
PEOPLE under the age of 20 have been worst affected by rising unemployment,
a report from the Trades Union Congress claimed yesterday.
The report, published on the eve of today's unemployment figures, draws on
the government's Labour Force Survey which, unlike official totals, includes
people without work as well as those claiming benefits and available for
work.
The TUC report shows the unemployment rate for people under 20 is nearly 20
per cent, compared with slightly more than 7 per cent for those aged 35 and
over.
The number of 16-to-19-year-olds in work fell 25 per cent, compared with 2
per cent for those over 25. Youth Training, the scheme for
16-to-19-year-olds, took 384,000 in 1989-90 but only 293,000 in 1991-92, a
24 per cent fall. Only one in three YT leavers went straight to a job.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'These findings emphasise the
need for the government to make full employment a clear priority for
economic policy and to introduce an emergency work programme.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Housing grant cut may be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is prepared to reconsider its plan to cut grants to housing
associations to build or buy homes for rent, Sir George Young, housing
minister, indicated yesterday.
The plan, announced in the chancellor's Autumn Statement, would have cut the
grant from an average last year of 72 per cent of the cost of new housing to
60 per cent next year and 55 per cent in 1995. The balance is raised on the
capital markets.
Questioned by the cross-party Commons environment committee, Sir George said
reducing the grant to 55 per cent by 1995 was a 'target', not a
'commitment', and would be reconsidered if the cuts looked likely to force
up rents unduly or to make it harder for associations to attract the private
finance they need.
Some financial institutions had warned that associations would find it
difficult to borrow 45 per cent of the cost against the security of a
tenanted home.
The extra interest charges would have pushed up rents by 70 per cent
according to a study by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The National Federation of Housing Associations said these rises would have
left up to 85 per cent of tenants dependent on housing benefit.
Sir George said he was prepared to see some rise in rents, especially if the
economic recovery raised incomes. The increasing proportion of tenants on
housing benefit indicated that the housing budget was better targeted on
those most in need.
However, no decision had yet been made on the level of housing association
grant for the next two years.
Sir George said he would make a judgment later in the summer about the grant
rate for next year after consulting financial institutions about their
readiness to fund associations at given rates.
Sir George also said that there were no plans to change the legislation on
government grants to enable them to be paid to private property developers.
The minister said he had an open mind on the desirability of such a change
and would welcome views from MPs.
However, he would want to be satisfied on questions such as the
accountability of developers for public money and the level of rents.

FT  22 APR 93 / Tanker route scheme attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT plan for a traffic separation scheme for the sea route between
Fair Isle and the southern tip of Shetland, scene of the Braer tanker
disaster earlier this year, was unnecessary, ill-conceived and could be
counter-productive, professional mariners told the Donaldson inquiry
yesterday.
The criticism came from two witnesses appearing for the Nautical Institute,
an international body with 6,000 members in 100 countries, on the second day
of the hearing investigating the wider implications of the Braer disaster.
Captain Peter Russell, an experienced pilot and institute fellow, said he
could see no advantage in the plan, which would require expensive radar
surveillance equipment to be effective.
He said too few ships used the channel to justify special routing
procedures.
He said: 'If you put it in when it is not needed mariners will treat it with
derision.'
Mr Julian Parker, institute secretary, said that in cases such as the Braer
accident better ship-to-shore communications and a faster response time by
the emergency ser-vices were the key to pre-venting pollution, not the
presence of radar surveil-lance.
The two institute witnesses voiced concern over declining standards among
crews, growing problems with safety equipment and increasingly frequent
mechanical breakdowns, which now account for a quarter of all large tanker
'casual-ties'.
The inquiry, being held in London, also heard that there are growing
problems with communications at sea where English is meant to be the
international language.
The inquiry continues.

FT  22 APR 93 / Tarmac venture wins Pounds 85m order
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-US joint venture involving Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction
and building materials group, is part of a consortium which has won an
Pounds 85m order to build a 100MW gas-turbine power station in Brunei.
Tarmac, Black &amp; Veatch, the US power plant engineers, and General Electric
of the US which will supply turbines, are to build the power station in
Bandar Seri Begawan, the Brunei capital. It will be close to the existing
Gadong power station.
Tarmac and Black &amp; Veatch two years ago formed TBV Power to bid for power
station work. The Brunei deal takes the value of orders won by the joint
venture to almost Pounds 360m. Mr Brian Staples, chief executive of Tarmac,
said the contract could pave the way for other orders in the south-east
Asian market. TBV Power is exploring opportunities in countries such as
Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Construction in Brunei is due to start almost immediately and is expected to
be completed by spring 1995.

FT  22 APR 93 / Lloyd's uses TV to promote plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON yesterday unveiled details of an innovative publicity
campaign to accompany the launch of its business plan next Thursday.
The plan will outline ways in which Lloyd's expects to increase efficiency,
boost profitability and attract fresh capital, following losses of more than
Pounds 5bn over the last five years.
The market is spending several thousand pounds to buy television time from a
new commercial business channel, which is broadcast nationally in the early
hours of the morning by BBC transmitters.
Lloyd's is also holding press conferences to Toronto and New York by
satellite as well as a press conference in London.
The TV programme, which will feature presentations by Mr David Rowland,
chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, is one of a handful to be
broadcast by The Business Channel - a joint venture between BMH
Communications and the BBC.
Nuclear Electric, Cable &amp; Wireless and Scottish Power have made use of the
channel since it was launched last May. Lloyd's has taken a 15-minute slot
early on Friday morning. The service typically costs up to Pounds 60,000 per
hour.
Mr Peter Hill, head of communications, said: 'The broadcast gives us speed
to communicate the implications of the business plan.'
Lloyd's will spend a further Pounds 1,500 on British Telecom facilities for
its satellite press conferences to north America: 1,600 of the market's
20,000 Names - the individuals supplying the market's capital - come from
the United States and 300 from Canada.

FT  22 APR 93 / Rail union fails to settle dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rail dispute remained unresolved last night. After nine hours of
discussion the executive of the RMT, the main rail union, failed to reach a
decision on whether to support or reject British Rail's final proposals to
resolve a conflict which has already brought two one-day shutdowns of the
network.
An RMT spokesman said the dispute remained 'unresolved'.
The executive will resume its deliberations today but it remained unclear
last night whether this would produce any definitive verdict on BR's peace
plan.
The RMT executive appears to be evenly split between those who want to
settle and those who wish to press ahead with more disruption in the
campaign to achieve a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and a
moratorium on the extension of contract work.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee-relations director, said the BR board had
gone as far as it could to meet the union's demands.
The BR document presented to the union leadership late on Tuesday night
confirmed that it does 'not foresee the need for compulsory redundancy among
its existing general staff during the next couple of years, providing there
is opportunity for voluntary severance and staff avail themselves of the
opportunities for redeployment and retraining spelled out in the various
agreements'.

up to 2,400 of the finest examples were at risk.
The MPs of the Commons public accounts committee said that the position at
Stonehenge, a site of national and international significance, could only be
described as a 'disgrace'.
The committee's report directs its fire at the National Heritage Department
and English Heritage, the main government-sponsored body responsible for
preserving listed buildings and national monuments.
It acknowledges that both have announced plans to greatly improve their
stewardship. But it adds: 'We are concerned that the physical condition of
up to 2,400 properties in the highest Grade I and Grade II categories could
be at risk.'
In a blunt warning the MPs add: 'We expect the department and English
Heritage to establish the full extent of the risk to such properties and the
priorities for repair and preservation as the basis for an action plan to
remedy the position as soon as possible.'
Turning to the 'national disgrace' of Stonehenge, the report says that
English Heritage had acknowledged all the public criticism of the condition
of the site. It was seeking more money from the government to implement
improvements.
More generally it talks of 'protracted delay and indecision' in the
improvement of heritage records, a seven-year slippage in the target date
for the listing of all monuments, and the absence of any clear action plan
to preserve the heritage they represent.
The MPs say that the National Heritage Department must ensure that
individual properties are only transferred into public ownership if
sufficient funds are guaranteed for their future care. At the same time
local authorities and government needed to be much more vigorous in
enforcing repairs on listed buildings in private ownership.

FT  22 APR 93 / Grouped art sale forces buyer to double price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MYSTERY purchaser had to pay Pounds 1.5m for a group of seven 17th-century
Italian canvases at Sotheby's yesterday - after first bidding a total of
Pounds 690,000 for the individual lots.
It is not unusual for an important group to be offered in separate lots and
then to be offered as a single lot. But it is unheard of for that lot to
make more than double the cumulative price of the individual lots.
The grandiose canvases illustrating events of Medici history were
commissioned by the French queen Marie de' Medici to decorate the Luxembourg
Palace. The paintings were executed by different artists in Florence in
1623-27.
Bidding began slowly in the initial sale. Then the more decorative Medici
marriage portraits confounded expectations by raising bids of Pounds 150,000
and Pounds 140,000 respectively. All seven pictures were knocked down to the
same bidder for a total of Pounds 690,000.
Bidding for the whole group started at Pounds 690,000. Two new bidders
intervened and the original mystery purchaser was this time obliged to pay
Pounds 1.5m, or Pounds 1,651,500 with premium, for his pictures. The morning
sale totalled Pounds 3,555,387 with 16 per cent bought in.

FT  22 APR 93 / Businesses report recovery in Wales and east Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY appears to be under way in Wales and the Bristol region,
according to quarterly economic surveys to be published today. A chamber of
commerce business trends survey also suggests a return of confidence to the
east Midlands.
In Wales, 71 per cent of manufacturing companies surveyed for the Wales
Chamber of Commerce expect turnover to improve in the next 12 months - the
most positive finding for several years. A total of 57 per cent of companies
in the service sector expect an improvement, and in both sectors only 8 per
cent visualise a fall.
Hopes for higher profitability are also rising, with 54 per cent of
manufacturers and 44 per cent of service companies expecting to see this.
'The financial picture across Wales is one which shows that confidence is
returning to the economy,' said Mr Graham Hall, leading executive of the
chamber.
The Wales chamber says that cashflow is a cause of concern, with nearly a
third of companies reporting a deterioration. The warning is repeated by
Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, which points out that more
businesses are likely to fail in the early stages of recovery than in the
depths of recession. The Bristol chamber also warns that the recovery may be
weak at first.
The chamber reports that, of about 400 businesses surveyed in Bristol and
the surrounding area, 36 per cent of manufacturing companies and 39 per cent
of those in the service sector said there had been a rise in domestic sales,
compared with about a quarter reporting a fall. Orders showed a similar
finding.
On export sales, the balance was even more positive and on export orders,
the chamber says, 'the picture is one of continuous improvement with
manufacturing companies increasingly bullish'.
The chamber sees signs that the rise in unemployment may be flattening.
There are similar findings in Wales. During the three months, 42 per cent of
the 600 Welsh companies surveyed reported that UK sales were the same as in
the previous quarter and a third said there had been an improvement. Export
orders are more buoyant with nearly half the manufacturers reporting a rise.
Nearly 30 per cent of smaller businesses expect to recruit labour in the
next quarter.
Confidence has apparently also started to seep back into the east Midlands
economy. More than half the companies taking part in the latest business
trends survey of the regional chambers of commerce expect turnover to
improve and slightly less than half expecting profitability to increase.
The survey, published yesterday and covering 450 companies in one of the
most economically diverse of the UK regions, shows that recovery is
potential rather than actual.
The proportion of companies operating at full capacity in March was 5
percentage points lower than last December at 22 per cent. Although there is
some indication that companies are beginning to revise upwards their
investment intentions and 30 per cent of companies, against 24 per cent last
December, reported improved cashflow, order books have been at best stable.
During the last three months there has been a modest improvement in export
orders, with 38 per cent reporting an increase in March compared with 36 per
cent in December.
In the aftermath of sterling's departure last September from the exchange
rate mechanism, half the companies surveyed said the price of materials was
their main worry, replacing concern with lower interest rates.

FT  22 APR 93 / Employers' bodies seek one voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'
Federation yesterday announced a fresh attempt to work together more closely
in a move to create stronger and more effective links between industry and
the government.
The two industrial organisations are commissioning McKinsey and Company, the
consultants, to identify ways in which industry can better represent itself.
The announcement raised speculation that the study could be the first step
in a merger of the two bodies. The federation, and most of its large
members, belong to the CBI, but one observer said yesterday: 'It's not a
takeover.'
The two bodies held exploratory talks in 1991 to identify a basis for
greater collaboration but these fell through. To the federation's surprise
the CBI then set up its own National Manufacturing Council, with which the
federation has been co-operating.
With two new heads appointed since 1991 - Mr Howard Davies at the CBI and Mr
Neil Johnson at the federation - it was considered sensible to re-examine
closer links.
The two bodies said: 'We hope this study will lead to a stronger voice for
industry, the closest possible collaboration between two leading industrial
organisations, and improved services to our members.'
McKinsey will start work immediately and is expected to make a preliminary
report in June.
Officials of the two bodies yesterday described the status of the
discussions as preliminary, so it was not possible to say exactly where they
would lead. However both are clearly attaching some importance to the study.
A steering group has been set up to guide it, made up of Mr Noel Davies,
chief executive of VSEL Consortium; Mr Ian Dixon, chairman of Willmott
Dixon; Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of Allied Lyons; Sir David Lees,
chairman and chief executive of GKN; Mr Graham Mackenzie, chief executive of
United Engineering Steels; and Mr Nigel Whittaker, group corporate affairs
director at Kingfisher.

FT  22 APR 93 / School chiefs warn of resignations: Governors angry at
letter from Patten stressing a 'duty' to ensure that tests are carried out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOL governors yesterday predicted 'mass resignations' if they were asked
by the government to enforce the national curriculum tests in the face of a
teachers' boycott.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week sent a letter to every
school governing body in England and Wales telling governors they have a
'statutory duty' to ensure the national curriculum tests are implemented.
He also said that it was a teacher's 'professional and contractual duty' to
administer the tests. Copies of the letter were to be sent to head teachers.
The Appeal Court will announce tomorrow whether it is will overturn an
earlier High Court decision not to bar teachers' unions from boycotting the
tests.
Mr Walter Ullrich, of the National Association of Governors and Managers,
said: 'We regard this (Mr Patten's letter) as very bad advice. If governors
felt that they might at any time be used as a coercion instrument you would
get mass resignations.'
He pointed out that governors were volunteers, and could easily resign
without financial loss. 'Governors are unpaid public servants trying to do a
decent job and expecting the government to be on their side in promoting
good education, not having a private political battle with the teachers and
misusing them.' The group is calling for the tests to be made voluntary this
year.
The leaders of the two associations for head teachers, neither of which is
affiliated to the TUC, also reacted to the letter with anger.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'The government's tactics seem to us to smack of a macho
management approach which we thought was a thing of the past.'
The association is calling for the tests to be abandoned for this year. Mr
Hart said: 'Despite protestations to the contrary, nothing would be lost by
cancellation and much would be gained.'
The Secondary Heads' Association, whose annual conference Mr Patten will
address tomorrow, was also angered. Mr John Sutton, general secretary, said:
'The general exhortation to do one's duty will not go down well because this
great difficulty is not one of our making, and we advised him time and again
on how to avoid it. A period of quiet from Mr Patten would be perhaps most
useful.'
Heads and governors would play a much less important role if the Appeal
Court rules that a boycott is unlawful. Mr Justice Mantell ruled in the High
Court last month that teachers were engaged in a legal trade dispute because
their complaint related to the terms and conditions of their employment.
This followed an action brought by Wandsworth council in south-west London,
against the NASUWT teachers' union, which is already boycotting preparations
for the tests.

FT  22 APR 93 / Supermarket queue times 'could be cut'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMER QUEUEING times at some supermarket checkouts could be cut by up to
a third if checkout counters were redesigned, according to research carried
out by the University of Birmingham.
At the same time, many of the illnesses and injuries suffered by operators
could be avoided if checkouts were designed according to simple ergonomic
principles, the research found.
Supermarket customers interviewed by the researchers reported irritation if
they were delayed by more than a couple of minutes. This was particularly
the case when the operator was unable to serve because a previous customer
was still packing shopping.
Many shoppers suggested longer counters so they could unpack all their items
while the previous customer's shopping was being scanned and paid for.
Two thirds of customers wanted their shopping to be packed for them, with
some saying it ought to be part of the service. Elderly people and shoppers
with small children particularly wanted help. Few supermarkets in the UK
offer packing, in contrast to the US where it is normal for customers to
have their goods packed and carried to the car by staff.
About one third of operators questioned experienced work-related aches or
pains even before they started their shift; by the end of the shift, two
thirds reported discomfort.
The main problems were found to be work surfaces and equipment positioned so
high that operators had to work with raised shoulders; inadequate leg
clearance beneath counters; and inappropriate seating. Reaching and lifting
items for scanning and packing, and bending and reaching under the counter
for bags were the two tasks that caused the most problems.
Developments in technology in recent years mean that operators can typically
deal with 800 or more items of shopping an hour. However, the researchers
found that some poorly-sited scanning equipment meant that operators
experienced greater discomfort and had to slow down.
Mr Terry Fielding, managing director of Potrafke, the checkout manufacturer
which commissioned the research, said it was estimated that productivity
gains of 15 per cent to 30 per cent could be achieved without much
difficulty if the ergonomic principles highlighted by the report were
applied.

FT  22 APR 93 / Sir Philip Shelbourne: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Philip Shelbourne, who died last Thursday aged 68, was a merchant banker
and chairman of Britoil, the largest oil exploration group operating in the
North Sea until it was taken over by British Petroleum in 1988.
Sir Philip started his career as a barrister, moving to a partnership at
Rothschilds merchant bank in 1962. He was chairman of Samuel Montagu when he
was appointed chairman of the British National Oil Corporation in 1980.
Sir Philip enjoyed power and influence, according to close associates, and
his appointment to the corporation was controversial because of his lack of
industry experience. Sir Alastair Morton, the corporation's managing
director at the time and now chairman of Eurotunnel, resigned.
The government sold 51 per cent of the corporation to the public in 1982,
with the rest sold three years later. This left it vulnerable to takeover
and BP launched a hostile bid in 1987. When BP was successful, Sir Philip
retired.
But in the course of the takeover bid the terms of his contract with Britoil
became public, causing a furore. His retirement package included a Pounds
40,000-a-year salary and a Pounds 92-a-day lunch allow-ance.
It was widely seen as a symbol of corporate excess at a time when oil
companies were strapped for cash. BP terminated the package when it took
over the company.

FT  22 APR 93 / Homes Assured 'slid into chaos' before collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Homes Assured, the mortgage brokers, allowed the company to
trade fraudulently for nine months before it collapsed with debts of Pounds
9m in 1989, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
From the outset, Homes Assured, which was set up to arrange mortgages for
council tenants buying their own homes, was never adequately capitalised and
its finances soon slid into chaos, said Mr Michael Kalisher QC, prosecuting
for the Serious Fraud Office.
By November 1988, Homes Assured was hopelessly insolvent and should have
stopped trading, he said. The company avoided one attempt by creditors to
put it into liquidation by showing a court bogus accounts. It also took out
short-term loans and stopped paying staff wages and other bills in an
attempt to survive.
However, such attempts only delayed the inevitable and the company was
forced into liquidation in August 1989, Mr Kalisher told the court.
He was opening the prosecution of Mr Anthony Dobson, a former Homes Assured
director, Mr Michael Robinson, the company's managing director and Mr Keith
Woodward, another director.
Mr Dobson faces three counts of fraudulent trading, Mr Robinson two similar
charges and Mr Woodward one of fraudulent trading and one of furnishing
false information. All deny the charges.
After the company was set up in late 1987, it was supported with Pounds
250,000 in capital from the Bank of Boston, Mr Kalisher said. To attract
this investment, Mr Dobson lied by withholding the information that he had
averted personal bankruptcy by reaching a voluntary agreement with creditors
to repay debts of Pounds 600,000. The bank would not have made this
investment had it known of his personal circumstances.
Homes Assured initially appeared solvent, but the absence of genuine profits
was concealed by the large advance payments it received in commissions from
life assurance policies sold.
However, its troubles mounted when commissions on cancelled policies had to
be returned, overheads rose unchecked and its tied agency status with the
Legal &amp; General was lost.
'Each of the defendants knew when they continued to trade after November
that there was no real prospect of Homes Assured paying these debts. They
continued to trade despite that and intentionally defrauded the creditors of
Homes Assured or its subsidiaries,' said Mr Kalisher.
Sir Edward du Cann, the former Tory MP and chairman of the Conservative
party, was a vice-chairman and director of the company and played an active
role in raising finance, Mr Kalisher said. However, he would not be called
to give evidence.
The trial, which is expected to last about four months, continues today.

TAIWAN has postponed the deadline for bids on a 2,500MW nuclear power
station, the country's fourth.
Taipower, the state utility, is understood to have ordered the delay - the
deadline was yesterday - because of uncertainty about the bid price
mechanism.
Nuclear Electric, Britain's state-owned generator of nuclear power, is
bidding for the project in partnership with Westinghouse of the US. Their
design would be identical to that of Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised
water reactor which the companies have nearly completed.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US-EC procurement pact, agreed yesterday, can be seen as offering
considerably more than half a loaf for both sides.
The US is still to impose sanctions, as required by Congress under US law,
for the EC's failure to remove discriminatory provisions to US
telecommunications companies in the utilities directive. However, the
retaliation will be minuscule compared with the billions of dollars in
contracts now open to bidding by companies from both sides.
US companies, it is estimated, will gain Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) in
bidding opportunities in the market for heavy electrical equipment.
EC companies will gain Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn in opportunities as a result
of the US waiver of Buy American requirements imposed in bidding by the
Tennessee Valley Authority and other federal power administrations.
The US has also agreed to allow EC companies to bid without discrimination
on contracts issued by the Departments of Energy and Transportation and the
US Army Corps of Engineers. Both sides agreed to extend the protection of
the Gatt government procurement code to each other's services providers -
which opens up the bidding process in a fair, transparent process.
Despite their failure to resolve totally the telecommunications issue, the
agreement can be considered a significant achievement for the negotiating
skills of both Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Mickey Kantor, the top EC and US
trade officials, in their first crisis since taking office in January. At
the end, the two men seemed to have attained a close personal rapport which
they will need to settle other bilateral disputes and to bring the Uruguay
Round to a successful conclusion this year.
US company spokesmen yesterday were declaring the deal a breakthrough. A US
trade official said: 'From our perspective opening this (electrical
equipment) market is historic. It has been a trade objective of the US
government since 1976.'
'Our companies are saying this is very positive,' said Mr Harry Freeman,
executive director of the MTN coalition which lobbies for the Uruguay Round.
'Two tough negotiators working on tough issues have made some real progress.
I feel much better about the whole EC relationship and the prospects for the
Gatt than I have in a long time.'
'If this means that we can now move toward seriously winding up the Gatt
round, we are overwhelmed and very pleased,' said Mr Will Berry, president
of the European-American Chamber of Commerce. 'If this, however, remains a
distraction and an obstacle to conclusion of the Gatt, we would be
disappointed.'
Company representatives yesterday, briefed on the progress made in the talks
on a tariff reduction package for the Uruguay Round, were enthusiastic about
the heavy schedule of talks agreed.
These are designed to get a market access deal approved by the Group of
Seven industrialised countries to Geneva in July.

Taiwan currently has a nuclear power capacity of 4,924MW supplied by six
units, and 38 per cent of its electricity comes from nuclear power. It is
one of a number of Asian countries which could provide export markets for
the nuclear power industry in coming years, given rapid economic growth
which is putting increasing strain on infrastructure.
Nuclear Electric says success for its bid in Taiwan would produce Pounds 1bn
in export orders for UK industry and could provide 10,000 British jobs. It
says its bid is competitive in spite of the high costs of the Sizewell B
plant which were driven up by factors such as licensing. The Taiwan plant
would also benefit from economies of scale.
Westinghouse invited Nuclear Electric to be its partner in the Taiwan bid
immediately after the British company issued the design of its planned
Sizewell C unit last year.

THE THAI cabinet has approved a plan to build Bangkok's second airport at a
cost of at least Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.11bn), a government spokesman said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
He said the Airport Authority of Thailand would carry out the initial work,
preparing about 8,000 acres of land in the south-eastern suburb of Nong Ngu
Hao, about 20 miles from central Bangkok.
The capital's existing Don Muang airport will reach full capacity by the
turn of the century despite a recent government decision to expand it to
serve 25m passengers a year, compared with 17m now.
The Nong Ngu Hao airport is planned to have an initial capacity of 30m
passengers a year by the year 2000. The project will be fully completed by
2020 when its annual capacity will be at least 55m passengers.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC to curb Czech and Slovak steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed to limit imports of steel from the
Czech and Slovak republics over the next two years. The decision is part of
an effort to protect the EC's struggling steel industry from recession,
overcapacity and cheap imports.
The Commission announced that the agreement would allow a 'progressive
increase' in imports until 1995, 'balancing the twin imperatives of
restructuring for the (Community) steel industry and gradual opening of
trade with (east and central Europe)'.
Officials were not immediately able to give more precise information about
the restrictions or the products affected, but further details were expected
to emerge later.
Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, had been arguing for a relatively
generous increase in imports of 35 per cent up to 1995, compared with 1991
figures. But his colleague, Mr Martin Bangemann, responsible for industry,
wanted to a 20 per cent limit, following complaints from EC producers that
imports of cheap east European steel were destabilising the Community
market.
Mr Bangemann and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, met EC
steelmakers last night in Germany to discuss the industry's closure and
restructuring plan. Producers have until the end of September to come up
with realistic capacity cuts, to be backed by a package of commercial and
financial measures agreed by Community members.
EC industry ministers said in February they would support tariff-quotas on
imports of individual steel products from the east alleged to be undermining
the EC market. The Community had already agreed in principle to restrict
Czech and Slovak steel imports, under the terms of trade agreements with the
two republics. Yesterday's decision should bring those restrictions in line
with the terms of the general support plan.

THE UK Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has announced it is
supporting a Dollars 225m line of credit to three South African companies to
finance expansion of a stainless steel plant in eastern Transvaal, Reuter
reports.
It is the largest line of credit the ECGD has supported to South Africa and
will help buy capital plant and equipment for Columbus Joint Venture's
Middelburg site.
Columbus Joint Venture is a partnership between Highveld Steel and Vanadium
Corp, Samancor and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.
Davy International will design, install and commission hot and cold rolling
mills to expand production to 500,000 tonnes of steel by 1995, the
department said.
Davy's British sub-contractors will also benefit from the financial package,
said the ECGD. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, has co-ordinated the
non-South African element of the financing.
A project line of credit is a loan from a bank in Britain to finance
purchases by a single overseas buyer from British exporters. Up to 85 per
cent of the value of the purchases may be financed in this way.
ECGD guarantees the lending bank full repayment of the loan and a reasonable
return.

FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: Atlantic flights free-market plan - A look
at the prospects for new Anglo-US airline treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNTDOWN to a possible revolution in transatlantic air travel began
this week.
Britain and the US have given themselves a year to scrap a 16-year-old
treaty governing air transport between the two countries and to replace it
with a free-market alternative that promises more choice and convenience
while keeping a lid on fares.
'It is an ambitious timetable,' said Mr Federico Pena, US transportation
secretary. His UK counterpart, Mr John MacGregor, confirms 'there will be
difficult decisions by both sides'.
A new treaty may also trigger changes between the US and other countries,
especially France, Germany and Japan, which are unhappy with their own
bilateral arrangements.
The rulebook that the US and UK want to scrap, the 140-page Bermuda 2
agreement, was signed in 1977. It replaced the post-war Bermuda agreement
and specifies, for example, that only two named US carriers, American
Airlines and United Airlines, can land at the world's busiest international
airport, London's Heathrow.
The question of access to Heathrow will be central to the US position in
talks with the UK. Washington has long argued that British Airways controls
most of the landing slots at the best times of day, preventing efficient
competition between the two countries' carriers.
But the UK is likely to be wary of taking steps that would undermine the
position of BA, one of the country's most successful companies. Opening up
Heathrow might also allow in US carriers operating under Chapter 11 of the
US bankruptcy code which shields them from paying debts. Even solvent US
carriers have argued that compet-ition from Chapter 11 rivals such as TWA
and Continental is unfair.
The UK's biggest concern is that its airlines cannot fly beyond a handful of
US 'gateway' cities, their first and only landing points. Nor can they buy
control of US carriers to reach the vast domestic US market; US law prevents
foreign control of airlines.
These mean that someone who wants to go to Britain from any but the largest
US cities has little choice but to fly with a US carrier, both for the
domestic and transatlantic flights.
Yet the Clinton administration may find it difficult to introduce more
competition into a market where almost everyone loses money. Only one US
carrier made a profit last year, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines.
Washington may also pre-empt the talks on foreign control of US airlines.
This is one of the areas to be addressed by an airline commission, initiated
by Mr Pena, which is scheduled to report its findings by late summer.
Air transport officials in Paris, Bonn and Tokyo will watch closely the
progress of the US-UK talks. France has abandoned its own bilateral
agreement with the US and wants tight limits on US market share of the
routes between the two countries: Air France's market share has fallen to
one-third.
Without the framework of the agreement US and French officials will have to
meet every six months to discuss the next season's services between the two
countries.
Mr Pena said he hoped that rapid agreement between the UK and US 'would
encourage France and the US to come to the negotiating table'.
The German bilateral agreement is set for renegotiation this autumn, but
positions are already hardening. This month Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's
chairman, said that existing rules gave US carriers an unfair advantage.
Tokyo is locked in a dispute with the US over whether US carriers travelling
to south-east Asia and Australia via Japan should be allowed to pick up
large numbers of Japanese citizens on the way.
'We have had discussions with the Japanese. We have not made significant
progress,' said Mr Pena.
If Bermuda 2 is replaced by a free-market alternative, it could strengthen
the US case in these debates with France and Germany.
But it will not be an easy task to draft a full treaty agreeable to both
London and Washington in a single year. Mr MacGregor is already talking of
signing an interim deal if necessary, one that perhaps postpones some of the
more difficult decisions.

FT  22 APR 93 / Clinton pledge to sign biodiversity treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised that the US would sign the
biodiversity treaty, which former President George Bush rejected last year
at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The treaty, which lays down obligations to list, monitor and protect
endangered species, is open for signature until June 3.
The Clinton administration has shared many of Mr Bush's reservations about
the treaty, which has been criticised for vagueness which could imply a
threat to the intellectual property rights of US biotechnology companies and
over an apparently open-ended commitment for developed countries to finance
less developed nations.
However, the US has prepared an interpretative statement explaining its
reading of the treaty, and has been working with other industrialised
countries to get them to sign on to these interpretations.
Mr Clinton also promised that the US would move to meet its obligations
under the global warming treaty, also agreed in Rio last year, by
stabilising its emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
He promised to develop a plan by August to meet this commitment.
The administration has been divided about how aggressively to pursue this
goal, with Treasury and Energy Department officials, as well as influential
members of Congress such as Mr John Dingell, warning that explicit measures
to curb emissions needed to be analysed to determine their impact on the
economy.
Environmentalists had initially expected much of the Clinton presidency, but
Mr Clinton has found that he faces much the same practical constraints on
action as his predecessor.
The Bureau of Land Management, which manages 270m acres of federal
government lands mostly in the West and Alaska, has dropped plans to allow
logging in Oregon within the habitat of the spotted owl.
The sale of timber on 1,700 acres of federal land had been allowed last year
during the Bush administration after a cabinet-level committee known as the
'God Squad' voted to override the Endangered Species Act, which requires the
administration to protect the owl's habitat, in the interests of preserving
timber jobs.

FT  22 APR 93 / US to set training standards: National vocational standards
considered

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday announced a series of educational and
training reforms including plans for a new national system of vocational
qualifications along European lines.
The Dollars 420m package, known as Goals 2000: Educate America Act, is
intended to help the US achieve 'world class' educational standards by
defining more precisely what students need to learn, improving assessment
techniques and introducing new forms of certification for non-graduates.
It differs from initiatives launched by the Bush administration mainly in
putting no emphasis on efforts to increase parental choice or competition
between schools.
Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said he was setting up a national
skills standards board consisting of business, labour and educational
leaders to 'identify essential occupational skills and create a voluntary
system of standards, assessments and certification'.
The plan was to bring the US into line with other industrialised countries
by creating a set of nationally recognised credentials for the three
quarters of the population that lacks college degrees.
Mr Richard Riley, the education secretary, announced the formation of a
national educational standards and improvement council to oversee school
reforms.
The council would set 'contents standards' defining what students should
know and be able to do in each subject area and devise assessments to
measure student achievement and school performance. The standards and
assessments would be voluntary, reflecting states' primary responsibility
for education under the US constitution.

The bank also reported a year-end current account deficit of Dollars 22.8bn,
and surplus in the capital account of Dollars 26bn. The current account
deficit was far above the government's implied estimate of Dollars 19.2bn
made in last year's budget.
Bank figures confirmed that the economy grew by a sluggish 2.6 per cent last
year.

FT  22 APR 93 / Republicans block US stimulus bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton faced an important legislative reversal yesterday
after Senate Democrats again failed to overcome Republican resistance to his
economic stimulus package, in spite of his agreement to reduce it by Dollars
4bn to Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.9bn).
The White House refused to admit defeat yesterday morning, but Democratic
senators acknowledged that they could see no way of breaking Republican
opposition.
A vote on the bill yesterday produced no defections among Republicans, who
have maintained their filibuster since before the Easter recess. As long as
they remain united, they can deny the Democrats the three-fifths majority
needed to force an end to debate and bring the measure to a vote. One
Democrat, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, continued to vote against his
party, leaving the vote at 56-43, four votes short of the 60 Mr Clinton
needed.
Mr Clinton may now be forced to fall back on a much-reduced version offered
by Senator Mark Hatfield, a moderate Republican. That proposal would salvage
only Dollars 6bn of the Dollars 16bn the administration originally proposed.
However, some members of Congress argued that it would be best for the
president to cut his losses before the perception spreads that he is
powerless to break Washington gridlock.
'You move on to other things. I don't think it serves the president to
belabour this further,' said Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, one of Mr
Clinton's Democratic allies.
Most economists argue that the stimulus bill, which the administration
claimed would, in its original form, have created 500,000 jobs, is far too
small a cash injection to have any appreciable effect on the huge US
economy, and is in any case no longer needed, since the economy is now on
its way to recovery.
Some recent weak economic statistics have given the administration
ammunition for arguing the stimulus is still needed to 'goose' the recovery.
But a popular, if cynical, interpretation of Mr Clinton's insistence on the
need for the bill is that he wants to claim the recovery as his own, rather
than something well under way before he took office.
Political analysts remain divided over the Republicans' prospects of
repeating their show of strength on future legislation. Party line votes are
rare in Congress, especially in the Senate, and most believe that defeat on
the stimulus bill does not portend a string of failures on Mr Clinton's
other legislative proposals.

<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES voters have sent two candidates for mayor to a run-off election
in June but have rejected a measure that would have put 1,000 extra police
on the city's streets.
The city is choosing a successor to Mayor Tom Bradley, its first black
mayor, who has held the office for the past 20 years. While Mr Bradley
himself is retiring under the cloud of last year's riots, the election has
been largely overshadowed by the Rodney King beating trial.
Mr Bradley was due yesterday to meet Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary,
who is spearheading the Clinton administration's efforts to boost
California's flagging economy. The latter has suffered from the effects of
defence industry cuts and now faces the closure of several military bases.
Tuesday's mayoral race in the second-largest US city attracted two dozen
candidates, none of whom won a majority. The top two candidates, Mr Richard
Riordan, a conservative businessman, and Mr Michael Woo, a Chinese-American
known as one of the city's most liberal councillors, will face a run-off on
June 8.
Mr Riordan, a white multi-millionaire, won 33 per cent of the vote. He
campaigned on the slogan 'Tough enough to turn LA around' and attacked Mr
Woo as an ineffective politician who could not rehabilitate the seedy
Hollywood section of his city council district.
Mr Woo, the grandson of Chinese immigrants, won 24 per cent of the votes. He
promised to provide Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) in city-backed loans to
businesses in impoverished South Central, a mostly black and Hispanic
district that suffered badly in last year's riots.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN voters yesterday decided overwhelmingly to keep the country's
presidential system, according to exit polls. Voting in a binding
plebiscite, they also opted to maintain a republican form of government
rather than revert to a monarchy.
The DataFolha polling service indicated that 58 per cent had favoured a
presidential system, against 26 per cent for the parliamentary option; 16
per cent rejected both choices. The republican option secured 71 per cent,
according to its exit poll, while only 11 per cent wanted a monarchy.
Political leaders who campaigned for a parliamentary system accepted defeat
early, partly because polls consistently predicted a big victory for the
presidential system.
Many opinion leaders said that political reforms had to move ahead even
though the system of government would remain the same. They mentioned party
reform, the adoption of mixed district elections, campaign finance reform,
and changes to increase the number of congressmen in highly-populated states
which are under-represented in Congress.
Abstention rates were not immediately available, but the lack of queues at
polling booths seemed to indicate a low turnout even though voters are
required by law to cast ballots. A pre-election poll showed 57 per cent
would not vote if not obliged to.

BOLIVIA has failed to meet some terms of an agreement with the International

delay a rescheduling of the country's debt to the Paris Club of creditor
nations.
The main sticking point is understood to be the country's public sector

Mr Pablo Zegarra, minister of finance, said the IMF had been insisting on a
public sector deficit figure of 3.2 per cent this year, which the government
was unlikely to meet. The deficit reached 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1991.

BOLIVIA has failed to meet some terms of an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, government officials have confirmed. The development could
delay a rescheduling of the country's debt to the Paris Club of creditor
nations.
The main sticking point is understood to be the country's public sector
deficit.
Mr Pablo Zegarra, minister of finance, said the IMF had been insisting on a
public sector deficit figure of 3.2 per cent this year, which the government
was unlikely to meet.
The deficit reached 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1991 and has averaged 4 per cent
over the four-year government of President Jaime Paz Zamora.
The IMF had also envisaged a drop in Bolivia's inflation rate from around 15
per cent in 1991, to 7.5 per cent by the end of 1993. Mr Zegarra predicts
inflation will reach 9 per cent by year end.
In September the IMF extended for a fourth year an enhanced structural
adjustment facility, a concessional lending facility.
The main significance of the development is not the loss of IMF credit -
only about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) of the credit remains to be disbursed
 -but the impact on a Paris Club debt deal. The current agreement runs out
at the end of June. At end-1991, some Dollars 1.5bn of Bolivia's Dollars
4.1bn debt was owed to bilateral government creditors.

THE French pharmaceuticals company Roussel-Uclaf has agreed to license its
controversial RU-486 abortion pill to the Population Council, a New
York-based non-profit group, for tests and production in the US.
The company has been particularly reluctant to market the drug in the US,
because anti-abortion groups have threatened to boycott its other products.
The US Food and Drug Administration complained that Hoechst, Roussel-Uclaf's
German majority shareholder, blocked the licensing of RU-486 to another US
producer.

FT  22 APR 93 / Dream comes true as Eritrea heads for independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ASMARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AFRICAN dream that goes back three decades is set to become reality.
Over the next three days some 1.2m Eritreans will vote in a referendum which
offers independence for what most of the world has regarded as a province of
Ethiopia.
The suggestion that the outcome of the United Nations-monitored poll will be
other than an overwhelming Yes is dismissed by most Eritreans with good
humoured laughter or a dismissive wave.
The goal has sustained the people of Eritrea, a rugged territory the size of
England, through war, drought and famine. Eritrea, which lies along the Red
Sea just above the Horn of Africa, in 1961 began its battle for independence
 -or as Eritreans see it, the recovery of a lost sovereignty.
First against Emperor Haile Selassie and then President Mengistu Haile
Mariam's Soviet-backed Derg regime, a guerrilla force took on one of
Africa's biggest and best equipped armies. In May 1991 the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front (EPLF) overthrew Col Mengistu's forces and liberated the
territory.
The new government in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front, (EPRDF) immediately supported the EPLF's bid for autonomy
and a referendum on the issue. This week's vote will finally secure
international recognition and end the long dispute over the colonial
boundaries laid down by Italy, Eritrea's colonial ruler from 1890 until its
defeat by Britain during the second world war. After 1941, Eritrea became a
British protectorate until its UN-sanctioned federation with Ethiopia in
1952.
A commitment to multi-party democracy has formed a central tenet in the
EPLF's policy since 1987 and Mr Issaias Afewerki, secretary-general of the
Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE), insists the front will be dissolved
once a constitutional government is established. But there is still no
organised opposition and parties based on ethnic or religious affiliations
are outlawed.
With official UN recognition, Africa's first state since colonial days to
mount a successful secession is now set to receive more than Pounds 88m for
reconstruction projects from aid agencies and the World Bank. But the PGE
puts the cost of reconstruction to bring the country back to its pre-war
industrialised state at Pounds 1.3bn.
The country's infrastructure and vital Red Sea port Massawa have been
shattered, 80 per cent of its citizens depend on food aid and the annual per
capita income is a mere Dollars 77 (Pounds 51). The war ravaged the
country's agriculture, on which more than 90 per cent of the population
depends, and a third of its topsoil has been lost. The country also faces
the imminent return of 750,000 refugees, many of whom had fled to
neighbouring Sudan.
Mr Haile Woldense, economic development and co-operation secretary, says
foreign investment to kick-start indigenous industry is a high priority to
avoid the vicious cycle of aid dependency and international debts which has
gutted the optimism in many African nations. 'If it is available, foreign
support is good but we cannot have programmes based on the expectation of
foreign support,' he says. To promote self-sufficiency, the PGE has already
designated seven factories for outright sale and another six will be given
corporate status.
Eritreans exemplify the cliche that a nation's greatest resource is its
people. After demobilisation, over 75,000 EPLF fighters stored their AK-47s
in central depots and volunteered two years' unpaid labour towards
reconstruction. The EPLF forces, a third of whom were women, sought to lay
the groundwork of Eritrea's political and economic independence. In exchange
for lodging and food rations, they are now building roads and dams, planting
trees and have cleared more than 250,000 landmines.
Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia will be delicate. Ethiopia will become
landlocked, losing control over the ports of Massawa and Assab, although the
PGE has guaranteed it access.
The most visible opposition to Eritrean's imminent secession has come from
Amharic students in Addis Ababa who demonstrated against the UN's
intervention in the referendum process. During the visit in January of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Ethiopian troops fired into the
crowd killing one and injuring several others. Mr Afewerki dismisses the
protesters as 'remnants of the Mengistu regime and the imperial era' and
regards Eritrea's relationship with Ethiopia as mutually beneficial.

INDIA said yesterday that investigations into the series of bomb blasts that

Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
In a statement to parliament yesterday, Mr S B Chavan, the Indian home
minister, stated that India had proof of Pakistan's involvement in the
blasts, which killed 250 people.
Mr Chavan said that the investigation by the Bombay police had revealed,
among other things, that there was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan with Mr
Dawood Ibrahim, the Dubai-based don of the Indian underworld, and Mr Ibrahim
Abdul Razak Memon, a close aide of Mr Dawood, to destabilise India.

<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank said yesterday it had agreed to resume aid to Kenya which was
suspended in November 1991 after the government failed to honour economic
reform commitments, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
The decision in effect ended a bitter row between Kenya and western donor
institutions and followed a devaluation by the government on Tuesday of the
shilling, the second in two months.
Mr Edward Jaycox, the bank's vice-president for Africa, said a tranche of
some Dollars 170m (Pounds 112.5m) in quick-disbursal aid was immediately
available from a previous agreement and would clear the way for future
financing.
'Kenya has met the conditions. The president and his economic team have
reaffirmed their commitment to reforms in a very convincing way,' Mr Jaycox
said.
He added that the World Bank was now in a position to resume financial
support and he expected an agreement within the next 10 days. The government
had agreed to reverse a rapid increase in money supply and to bring
inflation, now running at 40 per cent, under control.
World Bank officials said the agreement should trigger more support from the
International Monetary Fund and western donor nations, who also cut off aid
in November 1991.

FT  22 APR 93 / Palestinians to resume peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB negotiators agreed yesterday to resume Middle East peace talks in
Washington next Tuesday after an interruption of more than four months
caused by Israel's deportation of over 400 Palestinians.
The decision was announced in Damascus following a final meeting of
representatives from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the Palestinians. Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in
Damascus after a bruising session with colleagues in Amman during which he
only narrowly secured approval for the resumption of talks with Israel.
Two members of the Palestinian negotiating team immediately announced their
resignations and the leader, Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, said he had been
surprised by the Damascus decision. 'Our recommendation to the PLO
leadership was that we should not go until Israel has responded to our
requests.'
During violent protests in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, Israeli troops
shot and killed a Palestinian youth and wounded dozens more. Israeli
helicopter gunships later attacked two villages in south Lebanon after
guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets at the border town of Metulla and the
western Galilee area.
The Arab decision to resume negotiations was welcomed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, and by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state. Mr Christopher said the decision would be welcomed by the entire
world community and he again pledged that the US intended to become a 'full
partner' in the peace process.
Next week's talks, the ninth round since the inaugural session in October
1991, could decide the fate of the peace process. They will be open-ended
and the pressure that had to be applied to win Palestinian participation
underlines the bitterness within the occupied territories at the failure of
their negotiators to make any substantive progress towards
self-determination. In a statement issued after their meeting in Damascus,
Arab foreign ministers laid the blame for the impasse on the 'continued
obstacles' created by Israel.
They condemned 'Israeli aggression against Lebanese territory', the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, the mass
deportations of Palestinians, 'the blowing up of houses and killing of
civilians', and urged a lifting of the order which for more than three weeks
has sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The foreign ministers said the decision to return to Washington was based on
the assumption the US would implement all the assurances and undertakings it
had given during recent discussions. Mr Christopher praised Egypt and Saudi
Arabia for persuading the Palestinians to resume talks, but made no mention
of assurances given to the Arab delegations. He said a statement was
expected from Israel.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN police said yesterday they believe there was a right-wing
conspiracy to murder black activist Mr Chris Hani, who was buried on Monday.
In a pre-dawn raid they arrested five more right-wing whites, including Mrs
Gaye Derby-Lewis, Australian-born wife of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, a leading
Conservative party member already in custody for the same reason.
The Conservative party is the official parliamentary opposition, and the new
arrests lend weight to suspicions that the conspiracy to murder Mr Hani
extended well beyond extreme-right fringe groups, to the top of the
right-wing establishment.
They have provoked a crisis in the Conservative party, whose leader, Mr
Andries Treurnicht, seems likely to retire after a heart bypass operation
earlier this week.
Political analysts say the Conservative party's defeat in last year's white
referendum left white radicals with no constitutional avenue for resistance.
Yesterday's arrests suggest that some, at least, may have turned to
violence.
Meanwhile, at least nine people were injured when a car bomb exploded in the
coastal town of Amanzimtoti yesterday.

<TEXT>
SINO-BRITISH talks about Hong Kong's future constitutional arrangements,
which begin in Beijing today, promise to be among the most difficult the two
countries have had since they first sat down to negotiate the colony's
change in sovereignty more than a decade ago.
After six months of verbal warfare, British representatives in the Chinese
capital are bracing themselves for intricate talks that may drag on for
months and carry with them no guarantee of a successful conclusion.
On the eve of talks, Beijing has muted its more extreme rhetoric, but this
week Mr Lu Ping, head of China's Hong Kong and Macao office, firmly restated
so-called 'guiding principles' which call for strict adherence to prior
agreements in the lead up to 1997.
At issue for Britain is the way in which Hong Kong elects its 60-member
Legislative Council (Legco), the colony's lawmaking body, in 1995. Proposals
by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, envisage a broadening of the franchise so
that a greater number of Legco members are popularly elected.
For China it is how to secure a legislature that it has had a hand in
fashioning, and possibly how to see off Mr Patten, once and for all.
In Beijing's latest pronouncement, Mr Lu said in yesterday's People's Daily,
the Communist party newspaper, that Mr Patten's plans for elections could
not be used as the basis of negotiations.
He also emphasised that 'all the Legco members elected in 1995' must be
approved by the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong special
administrative region. This body was not due to come into operation until
1996, but its birth may be brought forward if talks fail.
In effect, China is demanding in advance the right of veto over candidates
for the Legco elections. This will prove a difficult, if not impossible,
pill for the UK to swallow.
A successful conclusion to talks holds with it the promise of Chinese
approval for the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project, which has
been in limbo ever since Mr Patten's appointment as governor was announced a
year ago.
Success may also bring in its wake a more constructive attitude by Beijing
to the technical aspects of the colony's handover which are meant to be
discussed by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. Today, the JLG is barely
functioning.
Initially China is not expected to reveal much of its hand. It will take the
UK team to task over Mr Patten's alleged violations of the 'sacred texts' -
namely the 1984 Joint Declaration, the 1990 Basic Law and a series of
exchanges between foreign ministers in 1990 - which, it will claim, were
high points in bilateral co-operation and mutual understanding.
It believes Mr Patten's proposals run counter to the spirit, if not the
letter, of these agreements, by broadening the democratic process in the
lead up to 1997. Put simply, China fears a less than pliant Legco; it is
also concerned about a Hong Kong democratic model inspiring liberal elements
on the mainland.
The British assume that the subject of the talks will be about Hong Kong's
1995 elections. Yet the risk exists that China may use the negotiations to
increase its influence over the governing of Hong Kong much as it sought to
do in 1990 and 1991 over the airport.
Officials believe that the most contentious parts of Mr Patten's seven-point
plan, include his proposal for a democratic election of an electoral college
to choose a sixth of Legco members; and, that the voting pool for nine other
seats comprise Hong Kong's entire working population of 2.7m.
These are controversial - both in Beijing and among sections of Hong Kong's
elite - but if China wants to drag out the talks it could cavil over others:
specifically Mr Patten's proposal that the 20 seats of the 1995 Legco be
decided on the basis of voting in single-member constituencies.
British officials are hoping that international factors may now be weighing
more heavily with Beijing; indeed, this may explain both China's decision to
cool propaganda attacks on Mr Patten, and its agreement to resume talks.
China wants membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - a
symbol of its acceptance by the world trading community. Similarly it wants
to host the Olympics in 2000, and a continuing row over Hong Kong would not
help its chances for that decision, due on September 23.
But a lingering worry for British officials is that China may use the talks
to filibuster, so as to defeat Mr Patten through diplomacy where bombast has
failed.
Since last week's announcement of talks Mr Patten has been successful in
winning Hong Kong's support for one key requirement of any agreement: that
those who stand for election in 1995 serve until 1999, the first two years
of Chinese administration. A poll published in the Sing Tao newspaper showed
that 73 per cent of respondents want those elected in 1995 to continue to
sit in Legco after the change in sovereignty.
But if Hong Kong's clear desire for China to concede that point poses
difficulties for Beijing, Mr Patten will not be immune from problems
himself. During the talks the governor, who will oversee the conduct of
negotiations from Hong Kong, may find he is torn between his heart and his
head.
Those close to him say he would be unhappy with a agreement that did not
command the support of Hong Kong democratically-elected politicians.
But, said one foreign office official, such an aim would be impractical: 'I
do not see how he could throw out a deal on the basis of the minority not
liking it. It would not be practical politics and there would be uproar in
Hong Kong.'
Mr Patten is a long way from having to make that decision. Last month he
demonstrated his preparedness to confront China when he published, to
Beijing's horror, his version of legislation for the 1995 elections.
Yesterday China warned that it would not be prepared to countenance another
such move. Mr Lu warned that 'if the present Hong Kong government clings
obstinately to its course . . . then objectively and unavoidably it would
become a 'lame duck' government.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Tokyo attacks Clinton for pushing up yen

THE YEN'S rapid ascent against the US dollar, fuelled by recent remarks by
President Bill Clinton, yesterday threatened to provoke an open war of words
after the Japanese foreign minister described the president's comments as
deplorable.
The dollar ended Tokyo trading yesterday Y0.10 down at Y110.35 after falling
to an historic low of Y109.90 during the day.
The Japanese currency's sharp increase followed comments by Mr Clinton's at
the weekend that a stronger yen would help to reduce Japan's trade surplus.
The clash over the yen means that less than three months into the life of
the Clinton administration there is mounting tension with Japan on the three
main aspects of their economic relations - exchange rates, the amount of
stimulus being provided by Japanese macro-economic policy and trade
negotiations where the US is pressing for market share targets for US goods
in Japan.
The sense of siege in Tokyo's Otemachi financial district was echoed by
mounting frustration in Nagatacho, the political district, with what many
Japanese politicians regard as unwarranted US intervention in Japan's
economic policy.
Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, was the most outspoken. Mr Muto openly
criticised Mr Clinton, saying: 'It is extremely unusual for a head of state
to refer to currency exchange rates and a departure from the norm for
someone with top authority to say something like that.'
Mr Muto's comments were echoed by warnings from business leaders about the
likely damage to Japanese growth. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the
Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said the yen's rise
would fetter Japan's economic recovery and expand the trade surplus in the
short run. Mr Isao Yonekura, his deputy, said the rise would 'throw cold
water on the economy' just as it is recovering.
The growing criticism of US policy will put increasing pressure on Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, to take a tough line over trade negotiations
with the US. Mr Miyazawa has unsuccessfully attempted to play down the
significance of Mr Clinton's remarks in an attempt to head off possible
direct conflict with the US.
Mr Miyazawa and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, who are close
political allies, had hoped sustained intervention by the Bank of Japan
would slow the yen's rise. The central bank intervened throughout yesterday,
the third day in a row.
Mr Hayashi again appealed for calm, offering exporters the hope the yen's
rise was a temporary product of speculation.
Finance ministry officials are urging patience, arguing that the US
administration is still working out the balance between its macroeconomic
and exchange rate policies. Officials argue the Clinton team does not
realise how a stronger yen could damage the US economy through slowing
Japanese growth and weakening the Tokyo stock market, which could affect
stock markets elsewhere.
The yen's rise partly reflects economic factors. Mr Robert Feldman,
economist at the Tokyo branch of Salomon Brothers, the US securities house,
said the yen was moving to a new trading range of about Y108 to the dollar
from its previous range of about Y120.
According to Mr Feldman this reflects the scale of the Japanese trade
surplus, which amounts to 3.3 per cent of gross national product, the need
to stimulate an outflow of long term capital from Japan and the gap between
US and Japanese interest rates.
However, the yen's ascent from about Y125 to the dollar at the turn of the
year has been intimately linked to US policy and pronouncements.
The yen was first lifted by Mr Clinton's budget cutting plan which helped to
lower US interest rates. That was followed by comments by Mr Fred Bergsten,
an influential US economist, that the yen should rise by about 20 per cent.
On February 19 Mr Bentsen told reporters he favoured a stronger yen and last
weekend Mr Clinton said a stronger yen was one factor which could reduce the
Japanese trade surplus.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday signalled that relaxation
of the centralised industrial relations system would be a top priority for
the re-elected Labor government.
Mr Keating used his first public appearance since Labor's surprise victory
in last month's election to foreshadow a further weakening of the Industrial
Relations Commission (IRC), the statutory labour tribunal.
The IRC relaxed its supervision of national wage bargaining two years ago
after strong pressure from the government for a move to direct bargaining
between companies and employees.
However, the impact of company-level bargaining has been limited by the
IRS's continuing right to veto agreements, the complexity of overlapping
state and federal regulations, and the exclusion of non-unionised
workforces. Only about 800 company-level agreements have been signed.
Mr Keating said the IRC was unsuited to the 'flexible' industrial relations
system envisaged by the government, which would reduce national awards to a
'safety net' for workers unable to reach workplace agreements.
The government is expected to introduce legislation later this year to
weaken the legal standing of the IRC and reduce its powers to order
compulsory arbitration.
However, the government may have difficulty in forcing legislation through
the Senate, the upper house of parliament, where the balance of power is
held by minority parties opposed to reform.

INDIA said yesterday that investigations into the series of bomb blasts that
rocked Bombay on March 12 clearly revealed Pakistan's organised support and
involvement in the 'planning and execution' of the terrorist attack.
In a statement to parliament yesterday, Mr S B Chavan, the Indian home
minister, stated that India had proof of Pakistan's involvement in the
blasts, which killed 250 people. The minister said Pakistan had given
shelter to members of the Memon family, prime suspects in the case,
despatched arms and explosives to the Indian coast, and trained people
involved in the blasts.
Mr Chavan said that the investigation by the Bombay police had revealed,
among other things, that there was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan with Mr
Dawood Ibrahim, the Dubai-based don of the Indian underworld, and Mr Ibrahim
Abdul Razak Memon, a close aide of Mr Dawood, to destabilise India.
Meanwhile, Mr Ziauddin Bukhari, a prominent Moslem League politician and a
former member of the state legislature, was shot dead yesterday in south
Bombay by four unidentified gunmen.
Maoist rebels killed at least 17 people, including 10 policemen, in an
attack on a market town in Maharashtra state, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported yesterday, Reuter adds.
The rebels set off a landmine under a police vehicle on Tuesday and opened
fire on bystanders. The People's War Group, a Maoist organisation was
believed to be responsible.

FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Belgrade is hit by economic crossfire -
Citizens are bearing the brunt of war and UN sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OJANA Popovic, a clerk in a Yugoslav transport company, is struggling to
make ends meet on a monthly budget of about Dollars 50 (Pounds 33). After
nearly two years of war and 10 months of sanctions, an atmosphere of
impending doom grips Belgrade. Worried about the war in Bosnia and the
possibility of violence spreading to Serbia, Mrs Popovic complains little
about her plummeting standard of living.
The Popovic family used to lead a comfortable life. A few years ago, Mrs
Popovic and her husband, a retired doctor, thought their two children's
future was secure. Mirjana was completing her medical internship and Milan
had just graduated from medical school.
'In 1990, I could buy a pair of Italian shoes each month. Now I am still
waiting to receive my December wages. At 20,000 dinars, it will be worth
less than two dollars on the black market,' says Mirjana.
Mrs Popovic says inflation makes it impossible to plan. 'It eats up our
earnings. When I get paid, the only thing to do is buy as much food as
possible,' she says.
Mrs Popovic, like most of her co-workers, uses office hours to scour
Belgrade stores for basic items and scarce imported goods.
Staple goods are in short supply as producers and grocery stores withhold
stocks in a bid to buck government price controls.'
'Before the December elections, each worker was given about 30 kilos of
sugar, oil, and flour,' she says, shaking her head at what she sees as
electioneering by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic.
A network of relatives and friends helps feed her family. Some people rely
on relatives abroad, or on farm produce from country cousins.
Mirjana and her brother live at home. She says there is little hope she
could ever earning enough to rent a flat.
'That is just one of the reasons why so many doctors and engineers are
trying to go abroad.'
High unemployment and low wages have driven many professionals to queue
outside foreign embassies seeking work anywhere outside Serbia. Mirjana was
hired as a psychiatrist in an election scheme of the ruling Socialist party
 -still technically unemployed, she receives a salary of 40 per cent of the
minimum wage, equal to Dollars 30.
The Popovics rarely drive any of their three cars. Petrol, rationed at 15
litres per month, is unavailable anyway, except on the black market, where
prices continue to rise. City transport lines have been cut because of the
oil blockade, causing long waits and crowded buses.
'Everyone has short tempers. I was riding to work, happy to have a seat,
when a huge argument erupted among the passengers, jammed in the bus. One
man said 'this is what you deserve for voting for Milosevic',' says Mrs
Popovic.
A sense of uncertainty and hopelessness has taken hold of their lives, says
Mrs Popovic, who spoke on condition her real name was not used. The
49-year-old remembers Belgrade after the second world war. 'Bread was
rationed at half a kilo per person. But then no one had anything and,
together, we all waited for better days. Now we have no prospects.'

LORD OWEN, the European Community mediator, yesterday failed in his
eleventh-hour effort to persuade Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to
swing his weight behind the international peace plan for Bosnia.
During a one-day visit to Belgrade, Lord Owen made what many observers see
as a final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to bring Bosnian Serb leaders to
heel and support the plan, devised by himself and Mr Cyrus Vance, to divide
Bosnia into 10 provinces, roughly along ethnic lines.
After a 2 1/2 -hour session behind closed doors, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman
for the mediators, admitted little hope remained that Serb leaders would
drop their opposition to the plan.
He said: 'I don't want to say last chance, but there's a particular pressure
now on everybody to see if something can't be pulled out at the last
minute.' Lord Owen, who also held talks with President Dobrica Cosic of the
rump Yugoslavia, is due to return to Belgrade tomorrow for talks with
President Milosevic, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and the
Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
Mr Eckhard, admitting the failure to overcome fierce Serb objections to the
plan, said: 'If the Serbs say 'no' as they have done today, they (Lord Owen
and Mr Vance) have no option really but to turn it over to the Security
Council.'
The disarmament of Moslems in Srebrenica, the besieged eastern Bosnian town,
was completed and the town demilitarised by noon yesterday, the UN said.
But a Bosnian Serb army leader claimed Moslems had reneged on an agreement
to give up weapons and had handed in only a small quantity of arms, 'mostly
outdated and unusable'.

FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Tighter sanctions unlikely to hasten
war's end - As the UN prepares to tighten the noose around Serbia, Laura
Silber assesses the growing impact on the republic's economy and the
defiance of its political leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE STRINGENT United Nations sanctions to tighten the noose around Serbia
will accelerate the economic decline of the republic, but they are unlikely
to bring a swift end to the war in Bosnia, according to analysts.
Additional sanctions, due to come into effect on Monday, include the
freezing of Serbian financial assets abroad, the stationing of monitors on
board Danube river traffic, the banning of transshipments across the former
Yugoslavia - reduced to Serbia and Montenegro - and the imposition of a
maritime exclusion zone along the Adriatic coast.
'The sanctions contain some very serious provisions. If implemented they
will really hurt the economy,' claims one Belgrade-based diplomat.
Serbians economists agree that any new sanctions will accelerate the
deterioration in the economy which, despite widespread sanctions-busting,
has declined steadily from the combined impact of 10 months under the
existing regime of UN sanctions, two years of war and the loss of trade with
the former Yugoslav republics. But the international community has been
disappointed that sanctions have done nothing to stop the war in Bosnia or
to foster public opposition to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Official economic statistics are incomplete, but diplomats believe those
that are available highlight the extent of the economic damage.
The annual rate of inflation last year was almost 20,000 per cent, the
highest in the world. Inflation last month rose by 225 per cent, and shops
rarely display prices because they are changed at least once a day.
Industrial production in March fell by 40 per cent compared with the same
month last year.
In 1989 Serbia accounted for about 30 per cent of the old Yugoslavia's gross
national product of Dollars 77bn (Pounds 50bn).
But the latest estimates suggest last year's GNP fell to about Dollars 12bn.
The burden of supporting ethnic Serbs in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia
consumes about 20 per cent of GNP, according to economic analysts.
The value of the dinar was devalued last week by 98 per cent, from the
previous rate of one dollar to 750 dinars to 37,500. Two days later the
dollar had jumped 20 per cent above the official rate on the lively black
market.
In spite of the grim picture, diplomats do not expect the economy to grind
to a halt. 'It is very difficult to hermetically seal a country,' said one.
But just how vulnerable has the Serbian economy proved to be to the current
sanctions? The oil embargo, for example, has slashed road traffic. On the
nearly deserted motorway running through Serbia peasants driving oxen are
now a common sight.
Petrol is officially rationed at five litres per car per month. But it is
unavailable except at the black market price of DM3 (Pounds 1.26) per litre.
Serbia was the breadbasket of the former Yugoslavia, and farmers suffer from
a lack of diesel fuel and fertilisers derived from oil. But economists
believe there will be no chronic shortages of food, as the spring planting
has been completed.
Loopholes have allowed Serbia to import oil via Serb-held areas in Bosnia
and Croatia and through former Yugoslav republics. The Serbs have stockpiled
an unknown quantity of fuel to supplement domestic oil production, which in
1991 amounted to 79,500 barrels a day, about 25 per cent of demand.
Individual Serbs have been hit hard by the deteriorating economy. The
average wage has plummeted to the black market equivalent of DM27 per month,
while consumers face periodic shortages of staples such as sugar and flour.
Many Serbs, however, have been cushioned by the very high interest rates
available for hard currency savings deposits. Many pensioners in particular
had made ends meet on their monthly interest payments.
But the recent crash of one of the private banks offering such high rates
stirred public protest, and the Serbian government is desperately shoring up
Dafiment, the biggest private bank with several million such accounts.
Other Serbians have actually profited from sanctions. Belgrade
criminologists say as much as 10 per cent of the 9.8m Serbians have made
money out of sanctions-busting.
Ironically, sanctions have weakened opposition to Mr Milosevic, who has used
them to whip up anti-western sentiments which have found fertile ground in
the isolated political landscape of Serbia.
'Serbia will never bend to the will of the west,' promised Mr Milosevic, who
has boasted of new oil discoveries.
And there are no signs that war-weary Serbs are about to buckle. They
grumble about the 'unjust' sanctions, but most of their ire is still
targeted at the west.
'Serbs are not guilty. Sanctions should be imposed on the people who deserve
them, the Slovenes, Croats and Moslems,' said a clerk waiting in vain to
withdraw money from the Dafiment bank.
The state-run media constantly bills Serbs as the victims of the war and
says sanctions are a western plot to destroy Serbia. And the Serbian
government has showed no sign of backing down to western pressure and
threats of military intervention.
Mr Zoran Lilic, parliamentary speaker, recently dismissed attempts to seal
off Serbia.
'While we have food, the world cannot do anything to us,' he said.

The disarmament of Moslems in Srebrenica, the besieged eastern Bosnian town,
was completed and the town demilitarised by noon yesterday, UN General
Lars-Eric Wahlgren said yesterday in a statement released in Zagreb.
Moslem troops surrendered their weapons to United Nations peacekeepers under
a ceasefire agreement between the warring Serb and Moslem sides signed last
weekend.
'From reports I have received from my officers in Srebrenica I can confirm
that from noon today the town has been demilitarised,' the commander of UN
peace-keepers said.
A spokesman for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor), said earlier there were
only a handful of Moslem soldiers left in Srebrenica after months of fierce
fighting in which hundreds have died.
He said the remaining fighters had probably fled to the hills, taking their
arms with them.
Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner of Refugees resumed aid convoys carrying
food for the remaining 30,000 inhabitants of Srebrenica. But UN aid workers
thought it unlikely the trucks would be able to resume evacuation of
wounded, sick and elderly people.
The UN has been using French and British helicopters to bring out the most
serious cases and nearly 500 have already been evacuated by this means.
Unprofor wants to fly out 100 more.
In central Bosnia, sporadic clashes between Moslem and Croat fighters
continued around the town of Vitez, in spite of a UN-mediated truce. Some
250 people have been killed in this latest round of fighting between the two
formally allied factions. British officers of UN forces reported numerous
atrocities in the area.

<TEXT>
MR Giuliano Amato yesterday bowed out as leader of Italy's 51st post-war
government, telling parliament the results of Sunday's referendums had
brought an end to his 10-month-old four-party coalition.
In a short but forceful speech the 54-year-old Socialist premier said only a
new government could legitimately cope with the overwhelming vote for change
registered in the eight referendums.
Mr Amato is not expected to hand in his formal resignation until either
today when parliament stages a one-day debate on the nature of a future
government or until such a government is formed. President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro has let it be known he would like to be in a position to invite a
candidate to form a new government by the weekend.
Mr Amato was heard mostly in sombre silence as he listed the country's
problems in coming to terms with a political transition that risked a
serious vacuum of power. He went out of his way to hold an olive branch to
the former communist, Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
He said they had to be given the benefit of the doubt for having the courage
to adopt a new political identity having left behind their communism. This
appeared to be a major attempt to convince both Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS
leader, to support the next government, and to force the Christian Democrats
to drop their opposition to the PDS.
Mr Amato did not offer any justification of his time in office. Instead he
urged the next government to maintain his policies of fiscal austerity,
privatisation and focusing Italy towards its European vocation. He gave no
hint as to whether he was prepared to continue as premier, but the tone of
his speech suggested he was willing if asked. The onus of the choice would
lie with parliament, reminding deputies if all those discredited by
association with corruption scandals were now excluded, few groupings would
be left.
The end of the Amato government, composed of Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, came on a day when events
dramatically underlined the collapse of the traditional parties.
Mr Salvo Ando, the Socialist defence minister, was notified he was under
investigation for alleged vote buying involving Mafia elements in his native
Catania. He was the seventh member of Mr Amato's government to have been
caught up in a corruption scandal. At the same time Mr Claudio Martelli, the
former Socialist justice minister, received his third warning that he was
under investigation for alleged corruption. This warning related to an
alleged kickback of L400m (Pounds 165,500) on a power station contract at
Brindisi for which his secretary, Mr Sergio Restilli, was also arrested.
The day also saw Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat
politician and seven times prime minister, appear for the third time before
a Senate commission to argue against having his immunity waived for alleged
Mafia associations. Meanwhile, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist
leader, was questioned by a Belgian magistrate investigating alleged
irregularities in the sale of Augusta helicopters to the Belgian armed
forces.

The leaders of the Moscow coup attempt, now facing trial in the Russian
supreme court, yesterday launched a public relations campaign to put across
their version of events, writes Gillian Tett in Moscow.
Although the trial began last week, amid considerable poltical controversy,
it was suspended after one day, ostensibly because one defendant suffered a
stroke. Looking subdued but defiant, the coup leaders yesterday reiterated
their claim that former Soviet leader Mr Mikhail Gorbachev had been
implicated in the coup, and that President Yeltsin's control of the media
was denying them a fair trial.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, may call on his ministers to
set an example of austerity by taking a 10 per cent pay cut, the government
confirmed yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
Mr Balladur has already told ministers to put on a 'hair shirt' by cutting
entertainment and travel costs.
Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, the budget minister and official government spokesman,
said that when the government was weighing new taxes and asking for public
sacrifice to stem the ballooning budget deficit, 'it is quite natural that
those demanding such efforts should set an example'.
French cabinet ministers earn a basic FFr45,000 (Pounds 5,440) a month, but
get fringe benefits which in some cases include housing. Mr Sarkozy, who is
charged with finding an immediate FFr20bn budget saving, said he could not
exclude a freeze on civil service pay as well. Some 40 per cent of the
budget goes in pay, he said, and this could not be regarded as untouchable.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S industrial output is continuing to grow, with first quarter sales
up 5.4 per cent on last year, according to the Central Statistical Office.
At the same time export earnings are falling, and low rates of return in
farming threaten a decline in food output for a second year running.
The rise in production was mainly due to increased output in the shipping
and motor industries as well as the chemical and textile sectors.
Retail prices in the quarter were 39 per cent higher than last year,
matching last year's inflation rate. Trade payment figures for the first two
months of the year show exports at Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.19bn), down by 17
per cent and imports at Dollars 2.1bn, up by 8 per cent on last year.
Net domestic assets have grown by 11 per cent from the beginning of the year
to 312,985bn zlotys at the end of March - about the rate prescribed by
Poland's agreement with the IMF.
The budget deficit after three months stood at 24,000bn zlotys or almost a
third of the way to the 82,500bn zloty ceiling imposed by the IMF. The end
of March also saw 2.6m people registered as unemployed.

<TEXT>
Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director of Italy's Fiat industrial group,
yesterday appeared before magistrates investigating political corruption,
writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The move represents a considerable climbdown
by Fiat, which has been heavily implicated in allegations of kickbacks to
politicians on public sector contracts. Until now the company has been
reluctant to co-operate, resulting in the lengthy incarceration of numerous
managers.
However, Fiat's approach has recently changed as the arrests have moved up
its corporate ladder. Just before Easter, magistrates issued a cautionary
warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer and the
most senior executive so far involved. In spite of strict security,
yesterday's meeting, in Milan's main police station, attracted considerable
attention.

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the European parliament yesterday accused the European Commission
of neglecting environment policy in favour of economic objectives.
Euro-MPs said they wanted principles of environmental protection integrated
into all EC policies.
But Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, denied the
charges. 'It isn't true that the Commission is treating environment policy
as though it were some sort of hindrance (to other objectives),' he told
MEPs. 'On the contrary, we regard it as a fundamental part of policy.'
Socialist deputies - the largest group in the parliament - are pressing for
adoption of a strict timetable for a new European environmental action
programme, which they believe could replace the single European market as a
central Community objective.
Mr Ken Collins, the British Labour MEP who heads the parliament's
influential environment committee, said the commissioner's statement was
'unadventurous, cautious and, frankly, unconvincing'.
He said he wanted the exact costs of neglecting environment policy to be
laid out by the Commission, in the same way that Brussels estimated the
costs of resisting a single market six years ago.
Mr Paleokrassas replied that the Commission was already preparing a
timetable for further measures as part of the EC's fifth environmental
action programme.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds the EC
presidency, agreed with MEPs that it was 'scandalous' that EC members had
yet to decide on the site for a European environment agency, thus hindering
implementation of 'green' standards in the EC.
EC environment and energy ministers meet tomorrow in Luxembourg for a
so-called 'climate council', at which they will discuss proposals for a
Community carbon tax.
The European parliament yesterday voted to strengthen EC rules restricting
cosmetics tests on animals. MEPs agreed to amend a delicate compromise
between member states to outlaw such tests completely from the year 2000.
However, the European Commission has refused to support the amendment, which
means the original compromise between member states will almost certainly
survive intact. According to that agreement, cosmetics tests on animals will
be banned from January 1 1998, but only if alternative testing methods have
been discovered.

FT  22 APR 93 / Hundreds of Czech companies face bankruptcy under new law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of Czech companies are bracing themselves for a tide of claims from
creditors when a new bankruptcy law comes into effect today.
It is unclear how many companies might be affected, but western consultants
estimate that up to one third of the 1,500 companies sold last year through
the voucher privatisation programme are technically bankrupt.
Many others are on the brink of bankruptcy.
After 40 years of safe but uninspired communist management, Czech companies
face a big shake-out as they adapt to a market economy and foreign
competition.
Their immediate problem is a mountain of debts which makes them vulnerable
to bankruptcy proceedings under the new law. The collapse of traditional
markets in the former communist bloc, recession at home, and the impact of
the break-up of Czechoslovakia, have intensified companies' financial
difficulties.
Debts have mounted rapidly as companies have stopped or delayed payments to
one another. Unofficial estimates suggest inter-company debt is above
Kcs200bn (Pounds 4.6bn).
The government hopes the law will help to clear up at least part of the
debt, while giving indebted companies a breathing space to negotiate with
their creditors.
Unlike an initial bankruptcy law approved in 1991 which was suspended
because it left companies without defences against claims by creditors, the
new law establishes a protective period of three to six months during which
debtors and creditors can attempt to reach a settlement. Failing that, the
company will be declared bankrupt and its assets seized.
Lawyers say the bankruptcy process is rapid. Debtors and creditors can file
for bankruptcy in a district or municipal court. Debtors have 15 days to
apply for three months' protection, and creditors have 30 days to file
claims after which time they are deemed to have waived their rights.
'This is a very aggressive bankruptcy law. Major creditors will need to
watch developments closely and move quickly,' says Mr Daniel Arbess of White
&amp; Case, the US law firm.
Once proceedings have began the company cannot dispose of assets. The courts
can also declare void any transaction concluded by the company during the
previous three years if the transaction was made with intent to 'curtail'
the creditors' rights.
Lawyers say this clause is a potential minefield for foreign investors
because it is open to widely differing interpretations. Under many joint
venture agreements signed in the past three years, important assets of local
companies have been transferred to joint ventures. Many of the local
companies' liabilities were left out of the venture for legitimate business
reasons, but lawyers fear anyone with a grudge could claim these agreements
were designed to defraud creditors.
'Foreign investors had better be very careful in establishing joint
ventures, and make sure everything is very transparent,' Mr Arbess says.
While an initial rush of bankruptcy proceedings is expected, the full impact
of the law is likely to take some time. 'The courts have no expertise in
bankruptcy. You have a fancy bankruptcy law, but it's a big question whether
the courts will be able to operate within the timetable set by the law,'
says another lawyer.
In any event, proceedings against companies privatised through the voucher
programme can only begin two months after the companies' shares have been
distributed - this has been indefinitely postponed in the Czech Republic
because of a dispute with Slovakia - while proceedings against other
privatised companies have to wait until at least one third of the shares are
distributed.

FT  22 APR 93 / Bundesbank damps rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of further substantial cuts in German interest rates following today's
meeting of the Bundesbank policy-making council were damped yesterday after
the German central bank released figures showing that broad money supply
climbed at twice economists' expectations in March.
Broad money supply, traditionally the German central bank's key indicator in
its fight against inflation, grew at an annualised and seasonally adjusted
rate of 3.2 per cent. Economists had hoped for an increase of at most 1.5
per cent after a slight reduction in M3 in both January and February.
Disappointment with the figures, combined with poor news coming from Bonn
about the scale of Germany's public sector public sector deficit, helped
prompt a fall in German bond prices. Yields on 10-year bonds climbed from
6.59 to 6.63 per cent, a pattern reflected in other European bond markets.
A contradictory impulse came from the Bundesbank's money market operations
yesterday. The central bank cut the securities repurchase rate, the
so-called 'repo' rate at which it offers wholesale funds to the country's
banking system, to 8.09 per cent from 8.11 per cent a week ago. The move was
in line with a sequence of small cuts in recent weeks.
At the same time, the Bundesbank injected a net DM5.8bn into the banking
system, helping to drive overnight money market rates down sharply, from
8.20 to 8.09 per cent. This led to speculation that in spite of the M3
figure the Bundesbank may today cut money market rates still further, for
example by announcing a fixed rate of less than 8 per cent for next week's
repo.
The Bundesbank blamed high credit growth for the increase in M3, which
includes cash, current accounts and short-term deposits. Bank lending to the
private sector was DM23.2bn last month, a fraction below the DM24.1bn in
March last year. Over the last six months, bank lending to the private
sector rose at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 9 cent, the
Bundesbank said.
Economists said that much of the increase was attributable to special
factors such as an unexpected rise in public sector borrowing. They pointed
out that even if the March figure was disappointing, it did nothing to alter
expectations that the target for M3 growth this year - 4.5 to 6.5 per cent -
would be met comfortably. Last year M3 grew at 9.4 per cent compared to a
target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, the worst performance since targeting was
introduced 18 years before.
On March 18 the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by 0.5 per cent to 7.5 per
cent, leaving the lombard rate at 9 per cent. The central bank is holding a
press conference today, saying it wanted to present its 1992 annual report
in detail. However such press conferences are unusual and the central bank
may take the opportunity to cut rates further.
Denmark's Nationalbank, the central bank, reduced its key money market rates
from 10.25 to 10 per cent yesterday, describing the move as bringing Danish
rates into line with falling interest rates in other European centres,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The Danish krone came under speculative pressure in early February, when
money market rates for a few days rose to over 40 per cent, but interest
rates have since then come down steadily.

FT  22 APR 93 / Red Cross urges control of 'callous' landmines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday launched a campaign
to focus arms control efforts on one of the most common and callous of
weapons, the anti-personnel landmine.
A symposium aimed at increasing awareness about the effects of mines,
reckoned to cause 800 deaths and 450 injuries every month, is being held
this week in Montreux, Switzerland.
The initiative has come from Red Cross and Red Crescent medical staff who
see mines being used increasingly to terrorise civilian populations.
Dr Robin Coupland, a British surgeon with the Geneva-based organisation,
said records from five ICRC hospitals in Asia and Africa showed that, out of
more than 17,000 war-wounded patients, 24 per cent were mine victims. A
third of these needed one or both legs amputated.
The aim is to build up pressure on governments ahead of a review of the 1981
United Nations convention covering 'inhumane' weapons. A conference, which
France's President Francois Mitterrand called for while visiting Cambodia in
February, could be held at the end of the year.
The convention restricts the indiscriminate use of mines. But it applies
only to international conflicts, and many countries including Britain and
the US have yet to ratify it. Although the ICRC is not tabling specific
proposals, suggestions for strengthening control include the prohibition of
certain kinds of mine, regulation of manufacture and an export ban.
Mr Ed Cairns, a policy adviser to Oxfam, the British overseas aid
organisation, said: 'The onus is on governments that oppose such measures to
come up with alternative solutions to protect civilian populations.'
The US Congress last October introduced a one-year moratorium on exports of
anti-personnel mines.
The former Soviet Union and China are the biggest supp-liers among more than
35 countries making mines. Italy's role as leading western European supplier
was highlighted in early 1991 when seven executives of the company Valsella
Meccanotecnica were convicted for illegally exporting 9m mines to Iraq in
the 1980s.
Anti-personnel mines come in two main categories: blast mines, detonated
just beneath the surface, and fragmentation mines, which explode above
ground, hurling metal fragments or ball bearings.
Types range from the pocket-sized Russian 'butterfly' mine, widely found in
Afghanistan, to the Italian Valmara 69 used by the Iraqis, which bounces
into the air and fires 1,000 metal splinters over about 25 metres.
Small mines known as 'toe-poppers' are designed to maim rather than kill,
with the idea that a wounded soldier will require assistance from several
others.
Detection and clearance is made much harder by modern plastic mines with
only tiny metal components.
The number of uncleared mines across the world is estimated at more than
100m. In the Falkland Islands, for example, 11 years after the UK-Argentine
conflict there are reckoned still to be about 15 mines per head of
population. In former Yugoslavia mines are expected to pose a threat for
decades.

FT  22 APR 93 / Drug sales fall after Bonn health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE overtook Germany as western Europe's largest prescription drugs
market in the first two months of the year, according to data from IMS
International, the specialist pharmaceuticals market research company.
German sales have been affected by a price freeze. The market has fallen
about 15 per cent since healthcare reforms introduced at the beginning of
January.
The company estimates sales in the seven largest western European markets -
which represent about 85 per cent of the whole western European market -
were Dollars 7.32bn (Pounds 4.84bn) during January and February.
Purchases by pharmacies - about 80 per cent of total drugs sales - reached
Dollars 2.09bn in France compared with Dollars 1.6bn in Germany.
Italy was the third largest market with sales of Dollars 1.59bn, followed by
Spain (Dollars 783m), the UK (Dollars 758m), and Belgium (Dollars 253m).
Sales in the Netherlands were estimated at Dollars 248m, although the figure
was extrapolated from January data. The figures exclude sales to hospitals.
The biggest selling type of drug were cardiovascular medicines, although
sales were down 2 per cent at Dollars 1.52bn. Alimentary and metabolism
drugs, which include ulcer treatments, dropped 1 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn.
Respiratory medicines were static at Dollars 756m.
However, anti-infectives, which include anti-virals and antibiotics,
increased 6 per cent to Dollars 805m, while central nervous system
treatments increased 2 per cent to Dollars 800m.
IMS International figures for 1992 suggest the seven countries had sales of
Dollars 49bn, up 8 per cent on 1991.
Cardiovascular sales were up 7 per cent at Dollars 10.86bn, alimentary and
metabolism increased 8 per cent at Dollars 8.34bn, central nervous system
rose 9 per cent to Dollars 5.32bn, anti-infectives increased 9 per cent to
Dollars 4.46bn, and musculo-skeletal were up 5 per cent at Dollars 2.82bn.
The fastest growing areas were cytostatics, used to treat cancer, up 20 per
cent at Dollars 1.15bn, and blood and organ treatments up 13 per cent at
Dollars 2.5bn.

FT  22 APR 93 / Major to join attack on EBRD spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, ROBERT PESTON and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected on Monday to use the keynote
address of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development annual
meeting to criticise the bank for its lavish spending on new London offices.
He is also expected to back the call from Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance
minister, for greater openness at the bank when he addresses the EBRD's
governors' meeting on Monday in London.
Mr Major's criticisms are expected to be diplomatically worded but indicate
government concern that the bank has acted insensitively. It also emerged
yesterday that Mr Don McCutchan, the only director of the EBRD to vote
against its 1993 budget, is being removed a year and a half earlier than he
expected.
Mr McCutchan, a Canadian, has been one of the most consistent critics of the
bank's expenditure on its office furnishings, parties, entertaining and
administration.
On December 14, he was the only director to vote against the 1993 budget of
Ecu136m (Pounds 108m) for administrative expenses, up from Ecu103.5m in the
previous year. The bank's 23 directors are public officials representing the
56 countries and international agencies which own the bank. On March 5, Mr
Jacques Attali, the bank's president, and Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian
prime minister, met in Ottawa.
An EBRD director said that days later, Canadian officials arrived at the
bank to conduct an inquiry into Mr McCutchan's fitness as a director.
EBRD directors said Mr McCutchan was exonerated by the report. 'If anything,
it made him appear too good, like Mother Teresa,' commented a director.
A Canadian government spokesman said yesterday that Mr McCutchan would hold
his post until this summer and then return to Canada as part of the normal
rotation of diplomatic officers. However, a friend of Mr McCutchan said he
had not been expecting to return to Canada until the summer of 1994.
The EBRD refused to make any comment on Mr McCutchan. At the weekend, Mr
Attali said Mr Mulroney had 'just telephoned me to express his support',
after widespread criticisms that the bank's internal expenditure had run out
of control in its first two years of operation.
Mr Attali yesterday met Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Lamont said the
bank's audit committee, composed of eight directors and independent of the
bank's day-to-day management, should inquire thoroughly and quickly into
reports of excessive spending on fitting out the bank's new headquarters in
London and other costs, such as hiring private aircraft to ferry Mr Attali
to appointments.
Britain supports demands by directors that the committee should have
external help in carrying out its investigation rather than relying on the
internal auditors used normally by the bank. The outside help could be
provided by a firm of accountants or chartered surveyors.
During the meeting, Mr Lamont said it was vital the issues raised by the
EBRD's spending did not interfere with its efforts to help establish
market-based economies in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

FT  22 APR 93 / MPs vote against treaty referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs early this morning voted decisively against a British referendum on the
Maastricht treaty, marking a further victory for the government over Tory
and Labour Euro-sceptics.
The rejection of a referendum by a majority of 239 votes came as the Commons
was expected today to complete its detailed line-by-line consideration of
the Maastricht bill, which it began last December.
Although a comfortable win had been expected, the vote is an important
milestone in the government's battle to secure ratification of the treaty
and will come as a welcome boost to its morale.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, argued that to allow Britain's final
verdict on Maastricht to be delivered in a referendum and not by parliament
would amount to 'a shirking of the responsibilities' MPs were given in the
general election last April.
Labour's front bench made common cause with the government by voting against
a referendum but opposition came from Euro-sceptics in both leading parties.
The Liberal Democrats were split, with about half voting for a referendum.
The result, delivered just after 2am, left referendum supporters pinning
their hopes on the House of Lords where a debate on the subject  - with the
possibility of a less clear-cut outcome - is anticipated in June or July.
Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Lord Tebbit, the former
Conservative party chairman, are expected to spearhead a campaign in favour
of a referendum when the bill reaches the upper house after its third
Commons reading later this summer.
Lord Healey, former Labour chancellor, this week served warning that the
Lords vote could present a significant obstacle to the government's plans
when he said its recent Commons manoeuvrings had made 'a lot of people like
myself' more inclined to vote for a referendum.
The government's next concern will be to shepherd the bill through its
Commons report stage, which it hopes to complete before the second Danish
referendum on Maastricht on May 18.
Labour still hopes to use this stage to corner the government into embracing
the treaty's social chapter.
If the Danes vote Yes, a third Commons reading would be expected to follow
before the end of May.

FT  22 APR 93 / Exchange advised to drop Pounds 40m computer project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE of the City's biggest securities houses have produced a study
questioning the need for the London Stock Exchange's latest Pounds 40m
computer project, just a month after the exchange scrapped its Taurus
development.
The study, by Booz Allen, the management consulting firm, concludes that the
exchange should buy an existing computer trading system that another stock
market uses rather than attempt to rebuild its own ageing Seaq system. The
aborted attempt to build Taurus - the paperless settlement system - from
scratch, rather than buying existing technology, cost the City an estimated
Pounds 400m.
The Booz Allen report is believed to add that Nasdaq, the over-the-counter
US share trading system on which London's own Seaq trading system was based
in the mid-1980s, would best suit London's needs.
The study was commissioned by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Kleinwort Benson,
Smith New Court, UBS and SG Warburg Securities. Between them these are
London's biggest marketmakers - firms which undertake to quote firm prices
at which they will buy and sell shares - accounting for about 70 per cent of
all marketmaking business. Executives from some of the five houses yesterday
played down the significance of their unprecedented joint study. They said
they were not trying to force the Stock Exchange immediately to abandon its
current development, which is being undertaken by Andersen Consulting and
has been under way for a year.
However, the issue is likely to figure prominently at an exchange board
meeting today, called to review the exchange's future for the first time
since the decision to abandon Taurus. The chairmen of three of the five big
houses sit on the board - Mr Rudi Mueller of UBS, Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell of
Warburg Securities and Sir Michael Richardson of Smith New Court. The
exchange said it was considering the Booz Allen report, but the study did
not mean it was planning to halt work on its current development. Work on
the Andersen project is believed to have been approved to the end of June.
The exchange has consistently argued that its in-house project, the cost of
which has been estimated at anything from Pounds 40m to Pounds 75m, is
necessary to overhaul its current computer base, which is becoming
increasingly expensive.
The five securities houses brought in Booz Allen after they became concerned
about the potential costs of the Andersen project. Two of them said
yesterday there was no reason why the Andersen system should not go ahead,
provided the exchange agreed to abandon some of its aspects to reduce costs.
The exchange's board is also expected today to agree to contract out the
running of Topic, its share price and company news service. Telekurs, the
Swiss-based information provider, is believed to be the operator selected to
run the system.

FT  22 APR 93 / EC and US reach partial agreement in trade dispute:
Breakthrough is hailed but Washington still plans some sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and European Community last night reached partial agreement in their
trade dispute over public procurement contracts although Washington still
planned to impose reduced trade sanctions.
As part of the agreement both sides agreed to open their government
procurement markets in a move that will be worth billions of dollars to both
in bidding opportunities in goods, services and heavy electrical equipment.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said in Strasbourg that the EC and
US had 'withdrawn from what could have been the brink of a trade war'.
But he said he and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, had failed
to defuse completely the trade dispute and that the US could still ban EC
telecommunications companies from competing for US government procurement
contracts.
The EC has reserved the right to retaliate. 'I think we have achieved a
breakthrough but not a full solution,' Sir Leon said. Mr Kantor said the
deal fell short of US demands.
He said the sanctions, which had been due to come into effect today, would
be smaller than threatened to reflect the compromise.
The US has to submit new formal proposals if it wants to impose a ban in the
telecommunications equipment sector alone.
It is estimated that any sanctions could be less than Dollars 25m (Pounds
16.50m) while the EC stands to gain Dollars 5bn to Dollars 10bn in bidding
opportunities in heavy electrical equipment alone, and the US Dollars 20bn.
Sir Leon said a process had been started through which he was sure the
'indefensible and pernicious' Buy American provisions, which give preference
to US contract tenders, would be eliminated below federal level - in areas
such as public transport, waterways, ports and airports.
The European Commission will recommend that provisions in the EC's new
utilities directive, which discriminate in favour of EC bids, should be
lifted for heavy electrical equipment.
However, the provisions will be retained for telecommunications equipment
and Sir Leon said: 'We fully reserve the right to react in whatever way we
think proper when we see what the Americans actually intend to do.'
The Commission would have to submit a proposal for reprisals to member
states, which are said to be divided on the question. Sir Leon said that
problem would be considered only when the US had decided what reduced
measures to take in the telecommunications sector. The UK, Germany and the
Netherlands are concerned to avoid a possible trade war with the US, but the
new French government may take a more aggressive attitude on sanctions.
Last night Britain's Department of Trade, expressing full support for the
line taken by the EC, said it was pleased there had been at least a partial
result.
The US will remove its Buy America preferences on the Tennessee Valley
Authority and the five federal power administrations of the Department of
Energy. Sir Leon hailed US agreement to ask all 50 states, as well as big
cities and utilities, whether they would withdraw Buy American provisions in
local procurement rules. He said 33 states had said they would abandon such
provisions.
Sir Leon said the consultation with states on the Buy American clauses would
not go on indefinitely. The agreement between the two trading partners could
be revoked after a year.
Following fierce disputes about the statistical assessment of the two very
different public procurement markets, the two sides have also agreed that an
independent study should be conducted, to compare the openness of EC and US
public contract procedures.
Sir Leon and Mr Kantor met in Washington earlier this week for talks but
failed to resolve their differences, although officials said they came
close. 'You wouldn't believe the number of offers we have put to them,' an
EC official said yesterday. 'No stone has been left unturned.'

FT  22 APR 93 / Christies buys City art and coin dealer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIES International, the auctioneer, yesterday bought Spink and Son, its
neighbour in the heart of London's art market and one of the oldest of the
City's fine art dealers.
The sale is worth up to Pounds 16.3m to Andrew Weir, the private shipping
and hotels company that owned Spink, and is significantly below the Pounds
50m sought in 1990 when the company first went on to the market before the
Gulf war.
While Christies' purchase has been taken as further confirmation of faint
stirrings in the art market, it also demonstrates the extent to which the
market has fallen.
The deal will involve Christies in some little-known duties in addition to
giving it an ability to deal in fine art coins, medals and oriental works.
Spink, as official medallist to the Royal Household, has to ensure that the
Queen and Prince Philip are correctly attired with medals and other
decorations on public occasions. It will continue to trade under the name
Spink from its premises in King Street, St James's. But the deal marks
another change of fortune for a company founded in the City of London in
1666, the year of the Great Fire.
Its more recent record, however, has been patchy. From a profit in 1989 of
Pounds 2.1m, the company was making similar losses within two years. Last
year it made losses of Pounds 700,000 on sales of Pounds 21.7m at the
trading level.
The sale of Spink will also raise questions in the art world as to whether
there is a potential conflict of interest. Christies, as an auctioneer,
would be expected to sell at the highest price possible, while Spink, might
be expected to want to buy at the lowest.
Lord Carrington, Christies International chairman, will chair a compliance
committee to ensure what the company calls a 'proper separation and
identity' of Christies and Spink.
Christies is paying an initial Pounds 7.1m in cash and to settle
inter-company debts. It will also pay up to Pounds 1.7m if Spink's tax
losses are realised and up to Pounds 7.7m as and when the company's stock is
sold. Christies will retain Pounds 3.9m from the sale proceeds of these
assets.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement 1993:
Compact breathing machines - PneuPAC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEEPING the patient breathing is an essential task of emergency rescue and
hospital services, but respiratory devices are also needed at many outside
locations where accidents and illness can suddenly disrupt people's lives.
PneuPAC, the small privately-owned company which has won a Queen's
technological award for its range of gas-powered lung ventilators, sells its
equipment to industry (notably the mining, chemical, shipping, and leisure
sectors) and the military, as well as to health and ambulance services in
Britain and abroad. It claims to be the world's leading manufacturer of
small gas-powered ventilators.
There are actually four PAC ventilators. They are designed for use in rescue
work (the simplest model), by paramedics, for treatment while in transport,
and for anaesthesia in hospitals (the most complex model) where they are
found in emergency rooms, intensive care facilities, recovery rooms, and
operating theatres. About 40 per cent of pneuPAC's lung ventilator sales are
made overseas, especially in Japan and Germany.
The ventilators are very economical on gas use, using only 10 ml
(millilitres) for every breath delivered. They are also compact, robust and
shock-resistant, being designed to withstand tough and abusive use in
difficult locations; each product has only one moving part, contained in the
high stability pneumatic oscillator. PneuPAC says that its main competition
comes from a higher priced German product.
The pneuPAC ventilator system functions by first monitoring the patient's
breathing to see if this is at an adequate level.
If this is so, spontaneous breathing is maintained from a demand valve. If
breathing becomes inadequate, then automatic ventilation is introduced,
synchronised with the last spontaneous breath to avoid 'fighting' between
the patient and ventilator.
By means of a special high performance gas mixing device, 45 per cent oxygen
can be provided over a wide range of parameters, thus reducing the demand
for supply gases by two-thirds of that required by other products, pneuPAC
says. This is especially important where cylinder gas supply is difficult to
obtain or expensive.
Set up in 1974, pneuPAC is part of a group of companies called Instruments
and Movements which employs 300 people.
Because pneuPAC makes its own component parts, it can combine advanced
research and development work with the production of specialist products for
unusual applications. For the lung ventilator range, pneuPAC first worked
out the present and likely future needs of the overall market and then
developed a range of new pneumatic elements to meet these.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Downturn hits Japanese
retailers' profits

THREE leading Japanese retailers yesterday underlined the depth of the
depression in Japan's consumer markets by reporting large falls in profits.
Takashimaya, a leading department store group which this week opened a
prestige store in New York, reported a 63 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
for the year to February 28.
Significantly, Takashimaya blamed the fall on growing competition between
retailers, which is cutting into profit margins, as well as the slump in
consumer confidence, sluggish growth in incomes, and doubts over the
employment outlook.
Takashimaya's sales fell by 6.5 per cent to Y784.96bn (Dollars 6.885bn),
operating profits plunged 58.8 per cent to Y7.28bn, and pre-tax profits slid
63 per cent to Y4.93bn.
All but one of Takashimaya's stores reported sales declines, with the main
outlet in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, recording a 9.5 per cent fall.
In spite of the sluggish outlook for consumer spending, Takashimaya expects
a modest increase in capital spending, to Y27bn. It plans to open stores in
Singapore and Taiwan this year. The company's expansion programme has left
it carrying a heavy depreciation charge.
Sanwa Bank, the group's main bank, has moved Mr Kazui Nishina, its
vice-president, to become Takashimaya's vice-president, signalling an
intensification of its involvement in efforts to restructure Takashimaya.
Sogo, another Japanese department store operator which has expanded rapidly
since the late 1980s, reported a 47.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y3.82bn for the year to the end of February.
Sogo's sales fell by 9.8 per cent to Y280.04bn, mainly due to a 13.4 per
cent fall in sales of luxury goods such as jewellery and paintings.
Daiei, the supermarket operator reported a 12.7 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits, to Y24bn, in the year to February 28, on sales 0.5 per cent lower
at Y2,015.23bn.
The decline at Daei, although lower than the falls at the department stores,
reflects the spread of the consumer slowdown to basic goods. Clothing and
foodstuffs make up more than 50 per cent of Daei's sales.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Insurance arm helps boost Sears,
Roebuck to Dollars 435m

A STRONG contribution from its Allstate insurance subsidiary helped Sears,
Roebuck, the US retailing and financial services group, to after-tax profits
of Dollars 435m in the first three months of 1993.
This compared with profits of Dollars 274.2m last year, before charges
related to accounting rule changes, which translated into earnings per share
of Dollars 1.13, against 75 cents. Group revenues increased from Dollars
11.02bn to Dollars 11.3bn.
However, on the troubled merchandising side, where Sears is attempting a
significant overhaul, the underlying improvement in profits was modest. This
division made a profit of Dollars 63.6m, on sales 2.1 per cent higher at
Dollars 6.11bn.
In the previous year, the loss before accounting changes was Dollars 23.8m,
but Sears suggested the comparable 1992 figure - after adjusting for a
restructuring charge and the impact of businesses which Sears is quitting -
was a profit of Dollars 51.7m.
Allstate, the property-casualty insurer, managed a strong advance in profits
from Dollars 255.3m a year ago to Dollars 320.1m, despite the storm damage
claims resulting from the severe winter weather.
Catastrophe losses were Dollars 224.6m, compared with Dollars 122.4m a year
earlier, but Allstate's underwriting loss still narrowed, from Dollars 218m
to Dollars 159.3m. Sears said yesterday the flotation of up to a 20 per cent
stake in Allstate is now scheduled for June.
The company's 'discontinued businesses' - which include the Dean Witter,
Discover operations, which are being spun off, and Coldwell Banker, which
Sears is in the throes of selling - contributed Dollars 118m, compared with
Dollars 144.1m last time.
K mart, the large discount retailer which also takes in several specialty
store chains, warned that earnings per share in the first quarter of 1993
would show a fall from last time's 26 cents.
It blamed the weather and said that it still expected higher earnings for
1993 overall.

A switch in sentiment in the water and electricity sectors sent shares in
both racing forward. Panmure Gordon was one of a number of brokers seeking
to take advantage of the sectors' recent underperformance.
Analyst Mr Angelos Anastasiou said the run-up to the results in a month's
time will begin to anticipate the expected good results and dividend rises
to be reported in the season. He believes both sectors will outperform the
market in this period.
Kleinwort Benson was another house to switch its 'take profits' advice to a
buy on the water stocks. Among these, Southern forged ahead 12 to 529p,
Wessex 15 to 628p and South West 13 to 541p. In the electricity group,
Yorkshire added 5 at 527p, Norweb 8 at 526p and Manweb 7 at 532p.

FT  21 APR 93 / Norwegian power link to UK studied
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of European power and engineering companies are studying a new
undersea link between Britain and Scandinavia which would allow Norway to
export cheap hydro-electric supplies.
National Grid, the privatised UK electricity distributor, is taking part in
the study scheme along with Eastern Electric, the largest of the 12 regional
electricity companies in England and Wales.
Kvaerner A/S, one of Scandinavia's largest industrial groups and a leading
member of the consortium, said the 456-mile link between Lista, in Norway
and Walpole, eastern England, could cost pounds 380m.
Other partners in the study include Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss
power engineering group; Siemens of Germany; and Alcatel Cable of France.
National Grid said that it joined the study-team following an invitation
from the Norwegian-led consortium. But it warned that it would be several
months before initial studies are completed.
The proposed link, which could be operational by the late 1990s, would have
just under half the capacity of the existing cross-Channel Anglo-French
electricity inter-connector.
Although a National Grid spokesman said that the planned cable 'would have a
capacity for a two-way flow', Norwegian power officials regard its main
importance as an export line.
National Grid said a decision on whether to proceed with a full-scale
feasibility appraisal will be taken 'once we have fully assessed the present
study'. The threat of future supplies of Norwegian hydro-power will put
further pressure on domestic deep-mined coal as a viable means of
electricity generation.

<TEXT>
KRUPP, the German industrial conglomerate formed through merger of the Krupp
and Hoesch groups, returned a loss of DM250m (Dollars 156m) in 1992.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said the poor result reflected high
losses in the steel divisions, and the mounting costs of financing
restructuring plans.
The two groups merged in the middle of last year and these are the first
consolidated figures to be reported.
All the group's other divisions, which include machinery, buildings,
automotive parts and trading services, showed positive results, the company
said.
Mr Cromme said the merger would allow cost-savings of up to DM500m.
Part of the group's restructuring includes the closure of its Rheinhausen
steel mill in the Ruhr valley, where 2,000 workers are employed.
Thyssen, the industrial conglomerate hit by high losses in its steel
division, said yesterday that group sales for the six months ending March
declined by 8 per cent, to DM16.4bn.
Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steel producer, announced further
production cuts last month. For the five months ending February, sales in
the steel divisions were 20 per cent lower than the same period the previous
year.

<TEXT>
NATWEST Bancorp, the US subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, yesterday
disclosed a doubling of pre-tax profits for the first quarter of the year,
marking its fifth quarter of recovery from losses at the turn of the decade.
Net income for the quarter rose from Dollars 30.1m to Dollars 60.7m (Pounds
40.1m). The result included the recognition of Dollars 9.5m of federal tax
benefits which had previously not been recorded.
The bank achieved a 13.03 per cent return on equity (7.03 per cent). Its
ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 7.94 per cent (6.47
per cent) and total risk-asset ratio to 12.69 per cent (10.97 per cent).
Mr John Tugwell, NatWest Bancorp's chairman and chief executive, said the
bank had put a difficult period behind it and was now building on a strong
recovery. He said there had been steady improvements in asset quality.
The provision for loan losses in the quarter was Dollars 30m (Dollars
30.5m), while loan charge-offs fell sharply to Dollars 27.9m (Dollars
61.7m). The allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet was Dollars 612m,
or 4.42 per cent of total loans outstanding.
National Westminster's shares closed 11p up at 472p.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993:
Not-so-invisible earnings - Finance and insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER OF financial firms have won export awards, underlining the growing
importance of invisible earnings to Britain's balance of payments.
They include two merchant banks, an investment management firm and a
reinsurance firm registered with Lloyds of London.
Banque Paribas becomes the first French bank to win the award, in
recognition of its export finance unit in London, which has had particular
success in North Africa and Asia. Projects in which it has been closely
involved include a large power station in Morocco and the revamping of
liquefied natural gas facilities in Algeria.
Most of the financings in which the unit were involved were originated by
Paribas and were connected with big international projects in energy and
heavy industry, such as steelworks.
In addition, umbrella facilities such as general lines of credit were
established, resulting in the financing of more than 60 UK export contracts,
with values ranging from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 12m during the past three
years.
West Merchant Bank, another City institution, owned by Westdeutsche
Landesbank (Europa), won the award in recognition of the two-thirds of its
earnings won overseas - from fees for a wide range of advisory services and
from underwriting commissions or trading profit on the placement of
securities for residents in the US, Europe, Latin America and South Africa.
Schroder Capital Management International, a unit of Schroder Investment
Management, has been cited for winning significant fund management business
in North America to complement its position as a leading manager of UK
pension fund assets.
It now manages more than Pounds 5bn for 80 clients, and employs more than 60
people in London and New York.
R. Mears &amp; Co., the insurance and reinsurance brokers registered at Lloyds,
takes a second export award in three years because of the accelerating
growth in its brokerage income to Pounds 3.5m last year from Pounds 650,000
since 1987.
Nearly all the income is earned overseas from a broadly based portfolio in
Europe, Central America, southern and North Africa, the Caribbean, Australia
and the Gulf.
Anthony Barrow, one of Mears's two founding directors, says the firm has
also benefited from the new opportunities for reinsurance in eastern Europe
following the disappearance of Comecon, the former Soviet-dominated trade
grouping.
Mears had already had considerable business in former Yugoslavia, but as 95
per cent of it was in the now independent republic of Slovenia, it has not
been affected by the violence which has swept other areas of former
Yugoslavia.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENARGO, the UK marine group, said yesterday it would defy the Spanish
authorities and launch a ferry service next week between the Moroccan port
of Nador and Almeria in south-east Spain.
The decision brings to a head a dispute between Spain's merchant marine
authorities and Cenargo that tests the European Community's single market
deregulation of cabotage between Community members and third nations.
The issue has been complicated by Madrid's fears that a Nador-Almeria link
will undermine the economy of Melilla, a Spanish-controlled enclave in
Morocco close to Nador, which has so far monopolised sea communications
between Morocco's eastern Mediterranean region and mainland Spain.
The ferry service between Melilla and Spain that Madrid wants to protect is
run by Transmediterranea, a state-owned shipping line in the process of
being sold to Banco Central Hispano, BCH, one of Spain's leading banks.
Mr Michael Hendry, Cenargo's chairman, said he intended to start a regular
daily ferry service between the Moroccan and the Spanish ports on April 26
'despite the continued opposition of the Spanish authorities'. Mr Hendry
said his Pta1.5bn (Pounds 8.4m) investment had the backing of the British
government and was in accordance with the EC's Single Market directives.
A spokesman for the merchant marine secretariat in Madrid said that should
the Cenargo ferry, Scirocco, owned by the group's UK registered subsidiary
Ferrimaroc, sail to Almeria from Nador next week it would either be
prevented from entering the Spanish port or arrested on arrival.
The Madrid authorities are claiming that they have yet to amend a 1979
agreement signed with the Rabat government that shares out ferry services
between Spain and Morocco between the countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Cesare Romiti, managing director of Italy's Fiat industrial group, is
today expected to appear before Milan magistrates investigating political
corruption.
Neither the time nor the venue for the meeting have been revealed.
Investigators stress Mr Romiti himself is not under suspicion.
Mr Romiti is unlikely to provide a list of cases where Fiat and subsidiaries
have allegedly bribed politicians to win orders or participated in a more
systematic network of kickbacks. Rather, he is expected to outline the
general system of corruption.
It is not clear whether this will convince magistrates that Fiat is
co-operating. After his statement, Mr Romiti is expected to answer questions
from the judges.
The return to Italy of four senior Fiat managers 'on business' abroad and
against whom cautionary warrants have been issued will be closely linked
with the outcome of today's meeting.
Magistrates want to question two of the four, Mr Paolo Toricelli and Mr
Mauro Bertini, in connection with allegations of kickbacks on gas turbine
contracts for the Enel state electricity generating authority. Mr Toricelli
is chief executive of Fiat Avio, Fiat's turbines subsidiary, and Mr Bertini
is its marketing chief.
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and Mr Massimo Aimetti have been implicated in
allegations of kickbacks on bus contracts for the Milan municipality. Mr
Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, was formerly managing director of
its Iveco truck and bus subsidiary; Mr Aimetti is Iveco's finance director.
Speaking to industrialists last weekend, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's
chairman, admitted that Fiat had been involved in episodes of corruption.
However, he tried to distinguish between those who had paid bribes as part
of everyday business and others who had based their fortunes on political
contacts.

FT  21 APR 93 / Drug groups will work together to find Aids cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN OF the world's largest drugs companies have pledged to work together
in an effort to find a cure for Aids in an unprecedented collaboration.
The effort, which took more than a year to negotiate, involves nearly every
large pharmaceuticals company searching for a treatment against HIV, the
virus that causes Aids, in the US and Europe. The companies' annual sales
total Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn).
The group includes Wellcome, makers of AZT or Retrovir, the leading drug for
HIV-positive individuals and Aids patients. Earlier this month an important
Anglo-French study claimed that the drug failed to delay the onset of Aids
in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients.
The surprise announcement yesterday said the companies would swap
information, provide their drugs for competitors' clinical trials and
exchange development techniques in an effort to speed up the flow of drugs
to treat HIV-infection.
The groups will only swap information on drugs that are in development being
tested for safety and efficacy. Data about drugs in research, before being
tested on humans, will not be exchanged. No group has a commercial interest
in the collaboration and each group will continue its own clinical trials.
The world pharmaceuticals industry is spending about Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) a year to find a treatment for Aids.
'This is an extremely important collaboration,' said Dr Charles Leighton,
senior vice-president for administrative planning at Merck, the US group
that took a leading role in setting up the collaboration.
'The most optimistic route to an Aids therapy in the near term is through a
combination of drugs because the virus is likely to become resistant to
single agents.
'Many of the companies in this collaboration have single agents, but do not
know which combinations to use them in. The hope is that through
collaboration we will achieve more effective treatments more quickly for
this terrible disease,' he said.
He warned that failure rates for drugs in development remained high, but
argued the collaboration was a step in the right direction.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group,
said: 'I don't see any cut-throat competition in drug development in the
Aids area. No one is going to make much money from Aids but we need to show
that the pharmaceutical industry can produce the goods when it needs to.'
Dr Leighton said it would not have been appropriate to set up collaboration
before, because the drugs did not exist and it was not known how the virus
built up resistance to drugs used on their own. He stressed the initiative
had come from both US and European companies.
The US companies include Merck &amp; Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly,
Pfizer, Du Pont Merck and Syntex, as well as Miles and Burroughs Wellcome,
Bayer and Wellcome's respective US subsidiaries. European companies include
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, Roche of Switzerland, Hoechst and
Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany, Astra of Sweden and Sigma-Tau of Italy.

TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurance and financial service group, will not pay a
dividend for 1992 in spite of a substantial improvement in the group's
performance last year.
The group has given no explanation for the cancellation after paying 10 per
cent in 1991, but it is understood that it is a gesture to the group's
employees following a reduction in staff by 18 per cent last year in a
rationalisation programme.
Topdanmark, which is a participant in the European Eureko insurance
alliance, cut its loss in 1992 to DKr53m (Dollars 8.68m) from DKr273m in
1991. The group's two insurance divisions were profitable last year.

EUROCOPTER, the West's second-largest helicopter manufacturer after
Sikorsky, is to cut 1,000 jobs - about 10 per cent of its workforce - at its
plants in France and Germany.
The venture, set up last year by French Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz's
Deutsche Aerospace, blamed military cutbacks and a cautious civilian market.
It reported post-tax profits of FFr25m (Dollars 4.6m).

FT  21 APR 93 / IBM loses Dollars 285m in first quarter as sales fall:
Result gives little hope of quick recovery - Mainframes down by 'high
double-digit per cent'

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday reported a Dollars 285m
first-quarter loss, providing little hope for a short-term recovery by the
world's largest computer company. Its losses were almost Dollars 5bn last
year, its worst ever.
IBM said European sales dropped sharply in the first quarter, by almost 14
per cent, with 3 per cent declines in the US and Asia. Worldwide sales of
IBM's core mainframe computer products were down by a 'high double-digit per
cent'.
One bright spot was a 48 per cent increase in service revenues, which rose
to Dollars 1.9bn.
Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who joined from
RJR Nabisco on April 1, said the results 'reflect weak demand and continued
competitive pressures in many of our hardware product lines, particularly
mainframe computers and large disk drives'.
Overall, revenues declined to Dollars 13.1bn from Dollars 14bn while losses
per share were 50 cents, in line with Wall Street's expectations.
In the first quarter of 1992, IBM posted net earnings of Dollars 2.5bn,
including a gain of Dollars 1.9bn from the adoption of a new tax accounting
standard. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.12, or Dollars 4.45 including
the one-time gain. Gross profit margins fell to 39.5 per cent, down from
50.8 per cent in the first quarter last year.
IBM said it would continue to 'aggressively seek ways to improve the
company's profitability,' but Mr Gerstner had no comment on what form these
actions might take.
In his first public appearance since taking over at IBM, Mr Gerstner will
address the company's annual meeting in Tampa, Florida, next week.
IBM said operating expenses declined by 8.9 per cent in the first quarter to
Dollars 5.4bn, and expenses were expected to continue to decline as the
company reduced its workforce. Previously, IBM has said it would eliminate
more than 25,000 jobs this year.
The group also said its personal computer business had achieved
profitability in the first quarter, with shipments up 40 per cent over the
same period last year. Sales of computer workstations also grew strongly.
However, total hardware sales fell to Dollars 5.7bn, against Dollars 7.1bn.
Rental and financing revenues, driven by mainframe computer installations,
were down 12 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn, while maintenance services fell by 5
per cent to Dollars 1.8bn.

FT  21 APR 93 / Subscriber list ruled depreciable asset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court has ruled that a newspaper's list of subscribers may be
treated as a depreciable intangible asset, in a decision that could cost the
federal government billions of dollars in tax revenues.
In a 5:4 decision announced yesterday, the court ruled that the Newark
Morning Ledger, a New Jersey newspaper, could depreciate the Dollars 67m
attributed to subscriber lists in the Dollars 314m it paid to buy another
newspaper, and thus claim tax deductions.
The US Internal Revenue Service had argued that the subscriber lists were
part of the company's goodwill, with no easy valuation, and could not be
depreciated for tax purposes under federal law.
However, Justice Harry Blackmun, writing the Supreme Court's majority
opinion, said that the Morning Ledger had successfully argued that paid
subscribers constituted 'an intangible asset with an ascertainable value and
a limited useful life, the duration of which can be ascertained with
reasonable accuracy.'
The case has potential repercussions for other acquisitions, especially in
the financial services sector, where insurance companies and banks have
argued with the IRS over whether lists of customers were a depreciable
asset.
About Dollars 10.5bn of such assets are estimated to be in dispute at the
moment.
The Morning Ledger had won its original suit in a lower federal court, but
that ruling was overturned last year by an appeals court in Philadelphia,
which took the view that subscribers could stop buying newspapers at any
time, and so the value of the subscribers' list was uncertain.
Federal courts in other parts of the country, however, had produced
conflicting rulings, making it important for the Supreme Court to lay down a
uniform standard.

Mr Cengiz Demirtas, marketing manager at Ortas, a trading company, said:
'Its population is only 4m, but it can earn at least Dollars 5bn from
natural gas sales alone, so per capita income may jump sharply.'
Turkmenistan's deputy president Nazar Suyunov said foreign investors could
take profits freely out of the country.
The Anatolian news agency said 12 Turkish companies planned to invest
Dollars 830m in Turkmenistan, rich in natural gas, oil, cotton and

<TEXT>
GERMANY will send 1,600 troops to Somalia to provide technical and
humanitarian assistance despite continuing political disagreements over the
role of German military personnel outside Nato. The soldiers will help
rebuild roads, bridges and will secure water supplies.
The decision follows a request by UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali last week, in which he said the German soldiers would be deployed in a
'secure environment' only.
The coalition parties decided yesterday that Somalia was safe enough for
soldiers to go there. It was also decided to send a small contingent of
lightly armed infantry as protection. The decision is expected to be
formally ratified by the cabinet today.
The move has been attacked by the opposition Social Democrats who claim that
there is a thin line between safe and unsafe areas. But party leaders
indicated yesterday that they will not fight the decision in the federal
constitutional court.

FT  21 APR 93 / Russian economic reforms begin to see results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's economic reforms are beginning to bear fruit, with evidence of a
fall in inflation, a reduction of credit expansion and a stabilisation of
production, according to the Centre for Economic Performance run by the
Russian Centre for Economic Reform and Professor Richard Layard of the
London School of Economics, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The figures show a fall in the monthly inflation rate from a high of around
27 per cent in January to 21 per cent in March.
Production continues to run at levels between 10 and 15 per cent below those
of last year, but the fall has stopped and there is a very modest evidence
of a rise.
Professor Layard said that there was 'an opportunity for further
inmprovements in the economy' following an agreement between the central
bank and the government to keep the increase in credits down to 10 per cent
a month, and because of money promised by the Group of Seven.
Foreign assistance coming into Russia in the second half of the year, he
said, would amount to 20 per cent of its national income.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has overcome a major hurdle in his
bid to win a fourth term in general elections scheduled for June 6 by
constructing an apparently united front within his ruling Socialist party.
Mr Gonzalez, who is currently running neck and neck with centre right
opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar in opinion polls, has drafted his
deputy prime minister, Mr Narcis Serra, into the planning committee for the
June poll. Mr Serra is a staunch defender of monetarist policies and of a
market economy.
But Mr Gonzalez has also appointed Mr Alfonso Guerra, the former deputy
prime minister and the leader of the party's left wing, to be the campaign's
general co-ordinator and the head of the committee vetting party candidates.
The nominations, which have been unanimously endorsed by the party's
200-member federal committee, contrast with the deep divisions among the
socialists earlier this month.
Mr Gonzalez was prompted into calling a snap election last week by a
confrontation between the members of his government, including Mr Serra, and
members of the party machinery, led by Mr Guerra.

FT  21 APR 93 / Balladur downplays meeting with Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Edouard Balladur yesterday downplayed expectations of any new
monetary initiative arising out of his first meeting with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in Bonn tomorrow.
The new law to make the Bank of France independent, which will go before the
parliament next month for approval, will be 'an element of reinforced
confidence' between France and Germany because their central banks will have
the same status and 'speak the same language,' Mr Balladur told a press
conference.
'But I will not be asking the Germans' to lower their interest rates, said
Mr Balladur. It was for the Bundesbank to respond to its own domestic
pressure for cheaper money. The Bank of France this week cut its official
lending rates to their lowest level since autumn 1989, exploiting the
current strength of the franc and the recent drop in French money market
rates.
Once the Bank of France gets autonomy in monetary policy-making, the
government in Paris will have just as little influence over domestic
interest rates as the government in Bonn, Mr Balladur noted.
Mr Balladur dismissed as a 'pious wish' any idea of 'accelerating the
timetable for monetary union'. The sorry state of the public finances of
most European governments would not permit any speedier move towards
currency union, he said. His goal was for France to meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria by 1997.
Referring to his planned May 4 visit to see British Prime Minister John
Major, Mr Balladur said 'Franco-British issues were less urgent, at least on
the monetary front'. But in the context of the stalled Gatt trade talks -
where his difference of opinion with Britain is sharpest - the French
premier said he had ordered from his staff a rapid review of whether Europe
really was more protectionist than North America, the Far East and other
regions.

FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery buying sends market higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON market already gripped by 'recovery fever' galloped ahead during
late trading. It closed a whisker off the day's high as dealers picked up
the scent of an imminent and big corporate deal or takeover bid. Those hints
have fuelled much of the strong London buying in recent sessions.
The deal/bid stories grew in strength after a sudden and substantial upsurge
in the Footsie future, which finished at a healthy premium to its estimated
fair value.
Already boosted by growing optimism and further evidence about the pace of
economic recovery in the UK, plus highly encouraging news on a rapid slowing
in mortgage arrears and repossessions, the FT-SE 100 Index settled 26.1 up
at 2,856.1, having moved smoothly through the 2,850 level.
Dealers were impressed at the rise in equities after the gilts market gave
ground after a March public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 9.5bn,
well in excess of most estimates, which were around Pounds 8bn.
Equity trading got off to a brisk start, with the market driven higher
principally by strong gains in the pharmaceuticals, stores and banks
sectors. Drugs shares were helped by good first-quarter figures from Merck,
the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, announced overnight.
The impetus for the hefty gains in the banks, retailers and building-related
sectors came from the latest evidence of UK recovery detailed in the
Confederation of British Industry survey. The survey revealed that retail
sales had risen on a year-on-year basis for the third consecutive month and
were at their highest since November 1991.
The market now awaits confirmation of the upturn in retail sales when
official figures for March are released on Friday. Tomorrow brings news of
unemployment figures for March. Economists have forecast a sharp rise in
unemployment during March of around 35,000 after the surprising 22,000
decline in February.
Buying by the big institutions was said to have been consistent throughout
the session and ignoring the disappointing opening by Wall Street, which was
hit early on by news of lower than forecast housing starts and was showing a
loss of around 15 Dow points as London closed.
The late burst of bid speculation encompassed numerous sectors. TSB raced
up, with the ever present takeover stories accompanied by suggestions that
the Hill Samuel merchant banking business, acquired for Pounds 777m on the
eve of the great stock market crash in 1987, is about to be sold. In a
building sector galvanised by recent news of increased house sales and
yesterday's news from Abbey National of a sharp rise in mortgage lending and
falling repossessions, Pilkington and Tarmac moved up strongly as talk of
possible bid moves by MB-Caradon revived. Abbey shares were among the
Footsie's best performers after the encouraging agm statement.
Bank shares generally outperformed, although some industry specialists
pointed out that the sector, at a 20-year relative high, was dangerously
overbought and due a severe correction in the short term.
The 10 per cent decline in water shares over the past week triggered a
strong rally in the sector, prompted by Kleinwort Benson and Panmure Gordon.
Market turnover of 543.4m shares was described as mildly disappointing.

FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hammerson falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results as bad as feared, including a dividend cut, sent shares in
Hammerson, the UK's fifth largest property group, tumbling 19 to 301p. The
scale of the fall also represented speculators moving out of the stock as
the depth of Hammerson's problems were thought to put paid to any potential
bidder.
Analysts expressed fears over the group's disposals strategy which aims to
bring down the gearing level of 114 per cent, with some advocating a rights
issue. 'The answer is not to sell quality assets at the worst possible
time,' said Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities, adding that a cash call
would restore market faith in Hammerson's ability to turn the situation
around.
Hammerson's concerns pulled down the other leading property stocks. Land
Securities receded 5 to 530p, MEPC 7 to 381p and British Land, often tipped
as a Hammerson predator, 4 to 256p.
The publication of two sets of US stakeholdings told a seemingly incongruous
story yesterday. The US holding of British Petroleum shares officially
topped 25 per cent for the first time and BP's UK share price slipped 1 1/2
to 302p. In contrast, the holding of American Depositary Receipts in
Wellcome eased to 4.9 per cent and the UK share price jumped 32 to 734p.
Some dealers were saying that US investors who have been responsible for
driving the BP share price higher are finally beginning to be sated.
On the other hand, there was a tentative feeling that US pessimism over the
pharmaceuticals sector may have hit the bottom. A clutch of US first-quarter
results on Monday were no better than in line with forecasts and yet share
prices leaped sharply.
Wellcome had been held back by a large line of stock washing around the
market and saw a spectacular recovery. However, the other UK leaders also
gained, Glaxo rising 17 to 580p while SmithKline Beecham, helped by well
received first-quarter results, was lifted 12 to 444p.
International drinks stocks were firm, with Allied-Lyons further buoyed by
old talk that it would merge its Victoria Wine off-licence chain with
Augustus Barnet, owned by Bass. A merger would create a business with sales
of around Pounds 120m and have some commercial benefits, according to
analysts. Allied surged 19 to 569p and Bass added 2 at 563p.
Rank Organisation was the best performing leisure stock, dealers pointing
out that the stock had been left behind in the recovery euphoria. Optimism
was also being expressed that the group would be announcing a more positive
trading picture when it meets with analysts next month. The shares gained 22
at 698p.
Banks were stronger as the economic recovery story tightened its grip on the
market's imagination. Barclays rose 13 to 427p, National Westminster climbed
11 to 472p and Standard Chartered, still responding to buying by BZW in a
tight market, appreciated a further 17 to 740p.
Recovery momentum sent building and construction shares sharply forward,
making both sectors the best performers in the market.
Among building materials groups, RMC Group surged 12 to 661p and Tarmac 7 to
140p. In contractors and construction, AMEC moved up 4 to 86p, Avonside
Group 13 to 133p, Berkeley Group 6 to 402p, Bryant Group 6 to 136p and John
Laing 14 to 252p.
Stores also caught the mood, following on from the CBI distributive trades
survey. WH Smith gained 10 at 432p, Kleinwort Benson among those said to be
positive. Kingfisher rose 5 to 592p, BZW recommending the stock. Hoare
Govett was aiding Dixons' rise, arguing that US trading fears had been
overdone. The shares put on 13 at 211p.
Confident presentations as part of a US roadshow helped Lasmo improve 5 to
151p. British Gas slipped 3 1/2 to 304 1/2 as one securities house voiced
concern over the cost of the company's involvement in a Colombian project.
Clyde Petroleum recovered 1 1/2 to 46 1/2 p as the rights issue was 93 per
cent taken up.
The rise of Mirror Group Newspapers continued as SG Warburg reiterated its
strong buy recommendation, arguing that the company would be fairly valued
when the shares hit 155p. Warburg believes that earnings per share will
double to 10.9p and yet the company's prospective price/earnings ratio is at
a discount to the market. Mirror Group added a penny at 138p.
Advertising and marketing services concern WPP was firmer and heavily traded
after a presentation by the company to analysts and institutions in the US
on Monday. The shares closed 6 higher at 66p with turnover reaching 10m.
Printing group St Ives retreated 6 to 337p after announcing that it had been
held back by recession in the six months to end-January and that some of its
markets had deteriorated.
Speculation that MB-Caradon was about to hit the acquisition trail left the
shares 8 off at 297p. English China Clays cut an earlier loss to finish a
net 5 lighter at 434p, after James Capel weighed in with a profits
downgrading. The agency broker is believed to have reduced its 1993 forecast
by 11.7 per cent to Pounds 83m and the following year's figure by 8.2 per
cent to Pounds 100m.
In aerospace, SG Warburg published a cautious review on the sector in which
it suggested that aircraft delivery in the years 1994 and 1995 will be
between 10 and 15 per cent below its previous forecast. TI Group reacted to
the report by initially falling 4 to 291p, but later benefited from the
strong market trend and finished 4 ahead at 299p.
Bargain hunters helped Smiths Industries advance 4 to 330p, ahead of today's
interim figures. The shares have been one of the weak features in the
aerospace sector, having underperformed the market by 16 per cent over the
last three months. Strauss Turnbull expects profits to come in at Pounds
40m, against last year's Pounds 44m.
Fears of greater competition from US carriers hurt British Airways shares,
leaving them 2 off at 283p.

FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey up on market optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market's current thirst for good news prompted a rise in
Abbey National shares that surprised even the bank's supporters.
Analysts agreed that Abbey's annual meeting statement was a mixed bag.
Progress in the UK was encouraging, although it reflected volume growth
rather than a general upturn in the housing market. The bank also
highlighted problems with European debt, saying it would remain at least at
1992 levels. Nevertheless, the shares jumped 17 to 395p on turnover of 3.7m.
Mr John Wriglesworth at UBS said: 'Such is the desire for optimism that the
market is totally happy to ignore the bad news in the statement.' His
forecast for 1993 remains at Pounds 630m, at the low end of the range of
estimates. Also, SG Warburg, the company broker, remains a buyer, but was
nevertheless said to be slightly surprised at the level of market
enthusiasm. The house has maintained its Pounds 650m forecast.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED talk of recovery and the positive monthly CBI distributive trends
survey led to a squeeze in stock index futures, sending the June contract on
the FT-SE 100 Index sharply ahead, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract was struck at 2,844, just below the
previous night's close, and it found buyers from the outset which sent it
advancing to 2,855 by midday, ignoring the worse than expected PSBR figures.
The lunchtime period was marked by a bout of sideways trading and light
profit-taking, and the poor opening on Wall Street made no significant
impact.
A squeeze developed in the last hour of trading, pulling the underlying cash
market higher, and June finished at the day's best level of 2,873, up 28
from the prev-ious close and around 11 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 8. Volume improved to 7,172 lots.
The traded options also saw an improvement in turnover, with a total of
27,267 contracts traded. The FT-SE 100 option was particularly busy, trading
13,730 lots, and the Euro FT-SE option traded 2,714.
Among the stock options, Tesco was the most active with a total 1,136 dealt
and the August 200 calls the busiest series. It was followed by Asda at
1,006 lots and Barclays at 709. Also active were GEC and GKN.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Mixture of influences leaves
shares lower
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices fell for the second consecutive day as investors reacted to
higher bond yields, a mixed batch of corporate earnings reports, and news of
weaker housing activity, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 23.50 down at 3,443.49, some way off
its low for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.36 to 445.10 and
the Nasdaq composite 1.06 to 661.97. NYSE volume was a heavy 319m shares.
The economic news set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading. The
Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 4.6 per cent last
month, a larger than expected setback even after taking into account the
effect on house building of the severe winter storms that struck large parts
of the country in March.
Stock prices were also depressed by a rise in bond yields. Although the rise
was sparked by mostly technical factors, equity investors remain nervous
that the 1993 bond market rally, which has sustained share prices through
these early months of this year, is almost over.
A large number of corporate earnings were filed yesterday as the
first-quarter reporting season came into its stride. There was no
discernible pattern among the releases, which partly explains why the stock
markets have struggled to find a direction in recent days.
IBM shed Dollars 1 at first, but then rebounded to end Dollars 1 1/8 ahead
on balance at Dollars 50 1/2 on volume of 2.4m shares after the computer
manufacturer announced a first-quarter loss of 50 cents a share, compared
with a profit of Dollars 1.21 a share a year ago. The figures were broadly
in line with analysts' expectations.
Bank shares fell in spite of some good earnings news. The declines were
attributed to profit-taking by investors who had bought bank shares in
anticipation of better profits.
Citicorp was the second most heavily traded stock, easing Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 28 3/4 in volume of 5.9m shares after the group revealed net income
of Dollars 374m but also announced a rise in non-performing assets.
Chemical, which reported profits of Dollars 374m, up 44 per cent from a year
ago, dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 , and Wells Fargo dropped Dollars
5 1/2 to Dollars 113 7/8 following news of Dollars 1.72 a share
first-quarter net income.
Chemical Waste Management fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 after
disappointing the market with its first-quarter earnings.
On the Nasdaq market, technology issues rallied after Tuesday's plunge in
Intel shares. Intel recouped Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 101 and Seagate
Technology, aided by a ratings upgrade from Bear Stearns, firmed Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 15 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO ended on a mixed note after yet another day of extremely heavy
trading as gains in gold and forestry issues restrained the market from
shadowing losses on Wall Street. Dealers said junior diamond, oil and gas
shares continue to attract large volumes and keep overall activity busy.
. The TSE 300 index was up 0.1 at 3,663.3, with rises edging ahead of
declines by 363 to 350 after volume of 77.2m shares.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Equities underplay South African fears
 -Gold and diamonds are still the big winners in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange breathed easily yesterday for the first time
in 10 days. South African equities seem to have emerged relatively unscathed
from the political tension which has gripped the market since the Easter
assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the influential leader of the South African
Communist party.
The overall index closed yesterday at 3,576, up 18 from Monday, the day of
Mr Hani's funeral, and near to the 3,589 level where the index last traded
before Easter.
The JSE's performance underplays the widespread nervousness which has
engulfed white South Africa in recent days. The institutions which dominate
equity markets are notoriously chary sellers and this inertia has lent
support to share prices, as has the weaker financial rand (the investment
currency for foreigners, whose weakening cheapens South African shares for
overseas buyers).
The nervousness, however, was clearly evident on the exchange rate and bond
markets, with the financial rand closing on Monday at R4.96 to the dollar, a
discount of 36 per cent against the commercial rand. But yesterday it
strengthened to finish at R4.56 against the dollar, a discount of 31 per
cent to the commercial rand.
The nervousness of the past 10 days aside, the first quarter of 1993 on the
JSE was dominated by the performance of gold shares, with the All Gold index
nearly 55 per cent up from its opening 786 for this year. The index closed
yesterday at 1,248. The other star performer has been in diamonds: De Beers
is 32 per cent up this year, and 73 per cent above the low of R44.25 it hit
in the third quarter of 1992. The shares closed yesterday at R76.35.
It has been almost wholly due to the good performance of these two mining
sectors, and a 16 per cent climb by the banking index, that the overall
index has risen by nearly 10 per cent so far this year. The industrial
index, the motor behind the JSE in recent years, has not performed at all;
indeed, it is actually below the level of 4,359 at which it started the
year, ending yesterday at 4,337.
This sluggishness is understandable. The 2.6 per cent dividend yield on the
industrial index is barely above the 23-year low recorded last June. Given
that the South African economy remains resolutely in the doldrums, with
little prospect of a significant improvement in company earnings over the
next 12 to 18 months, it is difficult to justify these ratings. Industrial
shares are reflecting the dismal economic situation.
The recovery of gold shares, likewise, was to be expected, although few
would have predicted the extent of the recovery. Three factors underpin this
improved performance:
Better fundamentals in the local gold industry, especially in terms of cost
control and productivity. Mr Rob Lee, of the Board of Executors, an
institutional fund manager, notes that the industry is now producing
slightly more gold than a few years ago, with 200,000 less workers.
Secondly, better yields. When the index was at 800, it was offering a yield,
through the financial rand, of about 10 per cent to foreign investors. These
yields made South African gold shares very attractive, compared with North
America or Australia.
Finally, and flowing from this, South African golds attracted a portion of
the international investment funds going into gold shares. It was these
funds, mostly from the US, that drove up the index.
The way forward for the JSE is not clear. Although diamonds and gold have
blazed a trail for the first quarter, few are willing to predict that these
trends will continue.
As Mr Anthony Gibson, portfolio manager at institutional fund manager
Syfrets, comments: 'Now is not the time for aggression.' Most industrial
shares look overpriced, the gold bull run may be over, unless there is
sustained strength in the rand gold price, and it is perhaps still too early
to invest in cyclical commodity stocks. Mr Gibson argues that with inflation
down at under 10 per cent, the real rates of return in the money market and
medium-dated gilts make them perhaps the best place to be in the short term.
Over the next two or three years, however, he concurs with Mr Lee's view
that, whereas a substantial increase in earnings can be envisaged for some
mining companies, the same cannot easily be said for industrial shares.
'Perhaps the trend towards mining has only just begun,' comments Mr Lee.

FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.4% as yen
strengthens against dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE SELLING led by the futures market erased the session's earlier gains,
as worries about a stronger yen against the dollar pressured equity prices
below the 20,000 level, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 283.91, or 1.4 per cent, to 19,828.43 for its third
consecutive decline, after trading between an intraday low of 19,806.65 and
a high of 20,332.20. The Topix index of all first section issues dipped
10.23 to close at 1,543.34, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved
4.92 to 1,213.84.
Volume was estimated at 430m shares, compared to Monday's 361m. Declines
outscored advances by 638 to 401, with 144 issues unchanged.
The strengthening of the yen, which ended at a record high of Y110.25 to the
dollar in Tokyo, triggered selling in the final minutes of trading among
short-term investors.
Anxiety over the yen's advance is likely to keep investors on the sidelines,
traders said. Market participants had assumed that foreign exchange dealings
would stabilise at lower levels, following reports of intervention by the
Bank of Japan.
An analyst at a Japanese brokerage expected public fund managers to prevent
the Nikkei average from declining sharply below the 20,000 level.
The yen's rise hurt exporters, TDK dropping Y130 to Y3,850, Sony Y120 to
Y4,650 and Pioneer Electronic Y100 to Y2,460. High-technology issues also
lost ground: NEC settled Y12 lower at Y928, Fujitsu weakened Y19 to Y701 and
Hitachi declined Y25 to Y820.
Among vehicle manufacturers, Toyota receded Y40 to Y1,650, Honda fell Y20 to
Y1,470 and Nissan ended Y10 lower at Y775.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 53.03 to end at 21,757.04 in volume of
42.5m shares.
Roundup
THERE WERE mixed fortunes in the region yesterday.
KUALA LUMPUR was the focus of strong institutional buying of index-linked
stocks and the composite index rose 7.58 to a new closing high of 672.53.
Banking shares were in demand by foreign investors following buy
recommendations by international brokers.
AUSTRALIA concentrated on the banking sector and John Fairfax Holdings as
the All Ordinaries index moved forward 7.2 to 1,703.6. Turnover came to
ADollars 386.2m.
Westpac Banking led the actives, rising 8 cents to ADollars 3.41 with 15.7m
shares traded. Commonwealth Bank closed 13 cents firmer at a record high of
ADollars 8.55.
Fairfax was another stock to reach a record high on news that the government
would allow The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK newspaper group, to lift its
stake to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. The shares appreciated 11 cents to
ADollars 2.10.
HONG KONG closed lower for the fourth consecutive day as the cautious mood
continued ahead of tomorrow's Sino-British talks on the colony's future. The
Hang Seng index slipped 412.61 to 6,638.54.
TAIWAN retreated sharply on late selling in financial stocks as rumours
abounded that the big three provincial banks - First, Chang Hwa, and Hua Nan
 -would not pay dividends for the next fiscal year. The weighted index fell
129.05, or 2.8 per cent, to 4,448.43 in turnover of TDollars 39bn.
Chang Hwa Bank dropped TDollars 6 to TDollars 148, First Bank fell TDollars
6 to TDollars 163 and Hua Nan Bank was off TDollars 7 at TDollars 159.
MANILA lost ground for the second consecutive session as investors took
profits. The composite index declined 13.84 to 1,554.81 in turnover of
410.4m pesos.
Manila Electric slipped 7.50 pesos to 290 pesos and PLDT eased 5 pesos to
965 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND's advance continued with a rise in the NZSE-40 capital index of
8.53 to 1,597.89 in good turnover of NZDollars 53m.
Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge led the advance, helped by strong
rises in the forestry sector in the US. Carter, up 4 cents at NZDollars
3.09, reached a 4 1/2 -year high, and Fletcher Challenge put on 7 cents at
NZDollars 2.65.
BANGKOK was depressed by news that the government was to take legal action
against violators of the country's new securities law. The SET index fell
6.51 to 884.22 in turnover of Bt3.3bn. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has said that it has been investigating four cases involving
possible breaches of the securities and exchange act.
SINGAPORE eased as investors took profits after the gains seen in the
previous four sessions had left prices at record levels. The Straits Times
Industrial index ended 8.95 off at 1,763.07.
KARACHI recovered some of Monday's loss and the KSE index closed 7.59 better
at 1,076.09.
BOMBAY's fall accelerated, with a loss of 56.24 registered by the BSE index
at 2,204.91.

MONDAY'S interest rate hopes mostly ran out of steam yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS continued its retreat for the fifth trading session with a fall in the
CAC-40 index of 19.58 to 1,949.33, as investors turned away from the market
on the view that there is unlikely to be any further easing in domestic
interest rates until the Bundesbank moves. Since the year's high on March
30, the index has lost 4.2 per cent. Turnover was FFr2.8bn.
The market had largely factored in UAP's disappointing results and dividend
cut announced yesterday and the shares lost FFr10 to FFr553. Peugeot dipped
FFr14 to FFr546 ahead of tomorrow's results, while Euro Disney suffered a
6.6 per cent decline, down FFr5.40 at FFr76.40, on anticipation of poor
second quarter figures next Tuesday.
FRANKFURT saw pressure on construction stocks as Hochtief and Holzmann
announced rights issues. Turnover fell by DM1bn to DM5.1bn as the DAX index
closed 6.19 lower at 1,687.11.
Hochtief's one for five at DM800 came early in the day and pulled the whole
sector down, Hochtief leading with a DM43 drop to DM1,127, Holzmann losing
DM30 to DM1,075 and Strabag DM15 to DM640.
Holzmann, which said early in February that a rights issue was on the cards,
heralded a 2-for-15 after hours. It fell DM25 more to DM1,050 on the Ibis
market.
MILAN was in reflective mood after Monday's referendum results and some
profit-taking left the Comit index 2.66 easier at 522.72.
Political developments left the market cautious. Many investors are pinning
hopes on the possibility of Mr Giuliano Amato continuing to head an interim
government committed to pressing ahead with tough economic measures.
However, privatisation candidates turned lower on the view that Mr Amato may
not continue in office. Sme fell L103 or 1.6 per cent to L6,097.
ZURICH saw demand for financial stocks ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank
meeting and the the SMI index added 3.9 to 2,170.8.
BBC bearers held on to an early SFr80 rise to SFr4170 after news that ABB
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, aimed to eliminate
net debt through asset sales this year.
Georg Fisher bearers rose SFr40 to SFr830 and Sulzer registered shares put
on SFr21 to SFr743, ahead of today's annual news conference. The shares have
risen by 9.4 per cent and 9.7 per cent respectively over the last week on
strong local and foreign demand for some cyclical issues.
BRUSSELS saw activity in Cockerill, the steel manufacturer, which put on 4.2
per cent as investors were attracted by the group's high dividend yield. The
shares closed up BFr5 at BFr123, after touching a new intraday high of
BFr126. The Bel-20 index closed 1.33 lower at 1,251.91 in turnover of
BFr1.3bn.
Among the Scandinavian markets STOCKHOLM rose on strong gains in Astra, the
pharmaceutical concern. The Affarsvarlden General index closed up 4.70 at
1,010.50. Astra rose on strong sales in the US of its anti-ulcer agent,
while lower domestic interest rates also supported activity.
HELSINKI saw firm gains on lower interest rates, with the HEX index rising
13.6 to 1,093.0. OSLO closed mostly lower and the all-share index fell 4.39
to 446.27 in turnover of NKr491m.
ISTANBUL continued lower from the start after Monday's plunge, but prices
picked up late in the session. The market index ended 35.11 higher at
6,609.25 after a day's low of 6,079.

PRICES OF the 16 stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which trades
three times a week, rose by an average 8.1 per cent yesterday, near to the
10 per cent ceiling permitted per session as the two years' old exchange's
unprecedented rally continued, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The dramatic rise in share prices has lifted pre-Easter price/earnings
ratios by nearly a quarter, from an average 3.8 to yesterday's average 4.7,
on an exchange whose total capitalisation is 5,979.8bn zloty (Dollars 359m).
Yesterday's turnover was 48.3bn zloty.
Falling interest rates have brought stocks into favour with domestic
investors, Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the exchange chairman, noted yesterday,
adding that foreign confidence in the present government had helped to draw
in foreign investors.

FT  21 APR 93 / Money Markets: Variable rate repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS slightly duller sentiment in European futures markets yesterday
after the Bundesbank announced a variable rate repurchase agreement in its
weekly money market operations, writes James Blitz.
The lowest accepted interest rate in today's operation could be a few basis
points below last week's rate of 8.11 per cent. But some dealers had
expected the Bundesbank to bring down the cost of lending money to
commercial banks through a fixed rate repo, and there was disappointment
that this did not happen.
This now means that there is little chance of the Bundesbank lowering the
discount rate at its council meeting tomorrow, as this is so far below the
repo rate level. However, there are expect-ations of a cut in the
inter-nationally sensitive Lombard rate, currently at 9.0 per cent.
The announcement caused a slight setback in Euromark contracts. One dealer
added that there was disappointment that the figure for Germany's M3 money
supply for March had not come through. Dealers are anticipating a low figure
that will encourage the German central bank to ease policy.
Another factor that may have suppressed sentiment was the expectation that
the forthcoming inflation figures for March would show a slight rise. This
would reduce any willingness by the Bundesbank to ease policy.
The June Euromark contract declined to a close of 92.70 from a previous
finish of 92.74. There was an even heavier setback in the September
contract, which fell 8 basis points to end at 93.56.
At these levels, futures dealers are still looking for quite a lot of easing
by the Bundesbank. The contracts price 60 basis points off three-month money
by the summer and 146 basis points off the period rate by September this
year.
Sterling futures markets lost some of their early strength after the figures
for the government's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement were a good deal
worse than the market had expected. The PSBR showed borrowing of Pounds
9.5bn last month, the highest monthly requirement on record.
The June short sterling contract fell back to a close of 93.95 after earlier
peaking at 93.99. Three-month sterling cash finished unchanged at around 6
per cent.

FT  21 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Housing starts weaken dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday lost ground against the D-Mark in Europe, but bounced
back towards the close of trading after dealers failed to push the US
currency convincingly below the DM1.5860 level, writes James Blitz.
The US currency was under pressure against the D-Mark from a number of
quarters. The dollar again weakened sharply against the yen in overnight
trading in Asia, reaching a new record low. At the same time, there were
rumours that the Bank of Finland was engaged in heavy dollar sales as part
of a restructuring of its currency portfolio.
Another factor hanging over the dollar was the growing attitude that the
Bundesbank has been easing monetary policy more slowly than expected.
Yesterday, the German authorities announced a variable rate repurchase
agreement in their weekly money market operation. With call money at 8.19
per cent and the lowest accepted repo at 8.11 per cent, the chances of a
significant easing in the repo rate today looked slim.
There was cause for concern, too, about the sluggishness of the US economic
recovery, with a poorer than expected housing starts figure which fell 4.6
per cent in March. The market assumed that it was partly due to the month's
bad weather. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London,
said the data underlined that US GDP had peaked in the fourth quarter of
last year at about 4.7 per cent, and that the first quarter figure for 1993
would be about 2.5 per cent.
At lunchtime in Europe the dollar was pushed as low as DM1.5825 after
closing the previous night at DM1.5995. But in the afternoon it rebounded on
technical trading by dealers to close at DM1.6000. In New York it finished
at DM1.5968.
In Tuesday's trading in Tokyo, the dollar weakened to an historic low of
Y110.20 as the market continued to believe that there was no consensus
between the US and Japan to bring down the yen's exchange rate.
There were suggestions that the Bank of Japan had intervened to the tune of
Dollars 1bn to support the dollar. However, Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank
in London said that both the US and Japanese authorities are notoriously
poor at supporting currencies on their own. At best, the Federal Reserve was
seen checking prices. The dollar ended in London at Y110.70, from a previous
Y111.0. It eased to a Y110.50 close in New York.
The D-Mark remained mostly unchanged against European currencies. Sterling
failed to react to poorer than expected figures for UK public borrowing in
March and closed  1/2 pfennig firmer at DM2.4675.
One exception was the peseta, which weakened to a Pta72.31 per D-Mark finish
from a previous Pta72.26. The Spanish currency is now around the Pta72.32
level at which the Bank of Spain has regularly intervened in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
GOLD was fixed at a six-month high of Dollars 341.55 a troy ounce on the
London bullion market yesterday morning, but failed to hold the early gain
as waves of active selling emerged. Soon after Comex opened, a concerted
push to try and breach resistance at Dollars 342.50 emerged, but it fell
back quickly as operators turned to profit-taking. However, New York
analysts said that improved speculative demand and physical offtake was
continuing to support the market. New York raw SUGAR was ahead at midday as
general uncertainty over tightening world supplies continued to underpin
prices. The fundamentalist view of the market was not changed during the
recent volatility, said one commission house analyst, referring to the steep
sell-off after the mid-March rally to three-year highs. 'They're all still
very friendly toward it.' London COCOA closed with small losses but above
the day's lows. It was helped by a small recovery in New York after Monday's
slide. But the rally could prove shortlived as further fund liquidation is
seen emerging in the US market soon.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese selling pushes copper
to 5 1/2 -year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER PRICES plunged on the London Metal Exchange yesterday to the lowest
level for 5 1/2 years in US dollar terms as the Chinese liquidated more of
their holdings.
Copper for delivery in three months dropped to Dollars 1,830 a tonne at one
point, Dollars 76 down from Monday's close, before an afternoon rally on the
New York Commodity Exchange helped it recover to close in London at Dollars
1,870.
Traders suggested copper might fall by another Dollars 200 a tonne in the
short term. Chart-followers also said that no substantial technical support
for the price could be expected above 75 cents to 80 cents a lb, (Dollars
1,650 to Dollars 1,750 a tonne).
However, these prices were unlikely to spark serious output cuts, analysts
said, particularly as the US producers, usually the first to react to low
prices, had undertaken substantial hedging operations.
Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
pointed out that Phelps Dodge, biggest US copper producer, had 'put' options
on 475m lb - or 60 per cent of its outstanding production for this year - at
95 cents a lb; Cyprus Minerals had options on 620m lb (90 per cent of its
1993 output) at 94 cents; and Magma Copper had options on 511m lb at 95
cents - all this year's production.
Analysts pointed out that copper was much later than other metals in being
caught in the cold wind of world recession.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, points out in his latest Metals Report that,
stimulated by high prices, western world copper output reached a record
8.92m tonnes last year and 'looks set to at least match that level in 1993'.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Losses threaten ferro-silicon
operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, THE Norwegian light metals producer, warned yesterday that it might
have to wind up production of ferro-silicon unless the division halved
losses during 1993 and moved into profit in 1994. The warning was issued in
an internal group publication by Mr Arnfinn Holaas, head of the
ferro-silicon division.
'We must reduce the division's 1992 deficit by more than 50 per cent in
1993, and we must book a profit in 1994. If we can't do this, we must face
the inevitability of winding up this segment of Elkem's operations,' Mr
Holaas said.
However, an Elkem official explained yesterday that the warning was too
strong in a translation of the report from Norwegian into English. He said
that what the company meant was that it might have to phase out various
segments of the ferro-silicon division gradually unless goals were achieved
and to this end the group was diligently continuing cost-cutting and
efficiency improvement measures.
The group's annual ferro-silicon production capacity is 450,000 tonnes, but
its present output is at about 70 per cent of that rate, compared with 65
per cent in 1992. The group claims to be the western world's largest
producer of ferro-silicon, with this production comprising 19 per cent of
group sales in 1992.
Last year Elkem's ferro-alloys division, which includes the ferro-silicon
operations, reduced pre-tax losses to NKr422m (Pounds 40m) from NKr458m a
year earlier, but sales fell to NKr4.066bn from NKr4.262bn. Group net losses
rose to NKr616m in 1992 from NKr443m in 1991 while sales fell by NKr514m to
NKr7.4bn.
Elkem said along with weak ferro-silicon market prices, there was distinct
over-capacity in domestic production. The group has long been seeking
co-ordination of production with a small domestic ferro-silicon producer
which has so far refused to co-operate.
According to the Commodities Research Unit, ferro-silicon prices were 48 per
cent below their 1988 peak at the beginning of this year, despite showing a
small increase in 1992.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC expected to lift foot and
mouth ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is expected today to agree to lift the one-month ban
on imports of livestock and dairy products from Central and East Europe
imposed after the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in Italy.
The move would aim to defuse an embarrassing dispute with 18 central and
eastern European countries, some of which denounced the original trade ban
as a restoration of the Iron Curtain.
At a meeting in Strasbourg today, the European Commission is expected to
endorse a recommendation made by veterinary experts yesterday to lift the
ban, subject to stringent quality controls on meat and dairy exports to the
EC.
One option under review is to impose a two-week quarantine on livestock
entering the EC from central and eastern Europe.
The EC and Austrian ban on meat and dairy products imposed earlier this
month provoked a furious protest from central and eastern Europeans who said
there was no sign of foot-and-mouth disease in their animals. Bulgaria,
Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic imposed tit-for-tat bans, while
Slovakia barred the transit of EC livestock.
The former communist countries suggested the EC ban was an excuse to protect
its own agricultural producers and reflected the community's own niggardly
offers on market access for eastern European countries.
In response to the criticism, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said
the East's bans were politically motivated and unacceptable.
The scare began after foot-and-mouth was discovered in Italy and traced to
Croatia, a transit point for goods and produce entering the EC.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia plans to double oil
and gas production
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ECOPETROL, THE Colombian state oil company, is planning to double oil and
gas production in the next six years.
To raise money for its ambitious programme the group will make its first
ever Eurobond issue next month, according to Mr Juan Maria Rendon, company
president.
The Dollars 120m issue is the first step in a campaign to raise
international finance to increase oil production from 450,000 barrels a day
to 800,000 b/d. The group hopes to raise another Dollars 150m this year
through selling off assets such as three electricity generating plants and
its share in the gas distributing company.
Mr Rendon said 'it's a big change in strategy. Historically we have invested
only Dollars 200m pa - now we plan to be a big investor'. He said the
company had taken the decision as a result of BP's Cusiana and Cupuagua
finds, which doubled the country's reserves to 4bn barrels, and optimism
about the Piedemonte field to their north. Under Colombian law once fields
become commercial Ecopetrol has a half share in equity and development
costs.
According to Mr Rendon the costs of developing the fields to produce 400,000
b/d will reach Dollars 4bn. Ecopetrol's ability to invest has been hampered
by heavy losses last year, largely caused by the bombing of pipelines by
left wing terrorist groups, which disrupted production so severely that
exports were suspended.
Speaking of his plans to raise finance overseas, Mr Rendon said, 'we've
found the oil, we have the reserves and the production capability and
Colombia's good history of always honouring its debts. Now we must learn to
sell ourselves'.
He said the most critical issue was the construction of new pipelines. Most
of those in place at present are joint ventures between Ecopetrol and the
oil distribution companies, but according to Mr Rendon: 'Our priority is
development of the field so we may be short of funds for pipelines in which
case we will encourage the private sector to take a greater stake'.
The private sector will also be asked to participate in the construction of
several new gas pipelines to exploit reserves doubled by the new finds to
between 7,000bn and 8,000bn cubic metres.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver shortage 'will lift
prices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER DEMAND is expected to outpace supply by about 100m troy ounces this
year, according to Mr Dennis Wheeler, chairman of Coeur d'Alene Mines, a big
US silver and gold producer. He suggested that in the long term this would
push prices up from their present very depressed levels, 'possibly starting
this year, but certainly in 1994'.
Mr Wheeler said the world's primary silver producers needed a price of
Dollars 5 a troy ounce, with an expectation that it would rise to Dollars 6
or Dollars 7, to be viable. Last night silver closed in London at just over
Dollars 3.91 an ounce.
Two mines in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho in which his company
has an interest - the Coeur and the Galena silver mines - are at present
temporarily shut down and on a care and maintenance basis. Mr Wheeler said
their break-even production costs were about Dollars 4.50 an ounce but he
would not estimate what silver price would be needed to bring them back into
operation as they are leased to Asarco, another US group, which would make
that decision.
Demand for silver has outstripped supply since 1990, according to the Silver
Institute, a Washington-based producers' association of which Mr Wheeler is
president. But huge stocks of the metal held by investors continue to weigh
heavily on the price.
The institute estimated that there was a supply shortfall of 37m ounces in
1990 and one of 46.2m ounces the following year. At this time last year the
institute was looking for the 1992 supply deficit to rise to about 53m
ounces, representing a shortfall of 10.6 per cent on demand forecast to be
548.6m ounces. The organisation will be giving the results of its latest
supply-demand survey next month.
Mr Wheeler, in London yesterday during a tour to give presentations to
European investors, said that, while primary silver mines had been shutting
down, demand for the metal by big users such as the photographic industry
and jewellery producers was increasing by about 2 per cent a year.

FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fuelling Russia's drive for
reform - Andrew Gowers talks to Moscow's newly-appointed energy minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YURI Shafranik does not look like a man carrying the future prospects of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms on his shoulders. Yet
assuming that Mr Yeltsin survives this Sunday's constitutional referendum,
the job Mr Shafranik has just inherited - that of minister for fuel and
energy - will be as important as any other in the Russian government in
determining whether Russia's shattered economy stands a chance of recovery.
The new minister, appointed in January after a six-month hiatus following
the sacking of his predecessor, knows perfectly well what is at stake. In an
interview yesterday, he agreed that reform was inseparable from the task of
turning round the troubled energy sector, still Russia's most important
industry and its largest source of hard currency earnings. 'Oil', he said,
'is the guarantee of reforms and of the resurrection of Russia. The poor
situation in the industry is a big problem for reforms. Everyone understands
this, including people in the west' - possibly an oblique reference to
President Bill Clinton, who singled out energy projects for special
assistance in the aid package he presented at his Vancouver summit with Mr
Yeltsin.
To describe the industry's performance as poor is an understatement, as Mr
Shafranik also has reason to know from his previous job as governor of
Russia's main oil-producing region, Tyumen in Siberia. Although Russia
remains the world's largest oil producer, output has been falling for more
than three years; the oilfields are starved of investment and machinery;
waste and neglect are endemic.
Nor is there any prospect of a rapid improvement. The minister expects
output, which plunged by 61m tonnes in 1992, to continue falling more slowly
this year (to 350m tonnes) and next before touching bottom in 1995 - when he
warns Russia will be in danger of being unable to fulfil all its own energy
needs.
Overseeing that turnround is only one of the challenges crowding Mr
Shafranik's in-tray. Others include continuing the reorganisation of the oil
industry into large joint-stock companies in preparation for eventual
partial privatisation and addressing the chronic inefficiency of energy use,
which has risen by 38 per cent per unit of industrial production in the last
three years.
Yet another, hardly less intractable, challenge is to generate sorely needed
foreign investment in the industry - whether in rehabilitating delapidated
oilfields or exploring and exploiting new ones. Attractive as Russia ought
to be to western oil majors, they have hardly begun to invest there on the
necessary scale. One reason is the omnipresent political uncertainty. But as
important a deterrent is the punitive tax regime with which the authorities
have encumbered the industry over the past year. Energy experts in Moscow
reckon that export taxes, royalties and other assorted levies add up to a
tax take of 55 per cent on oil export revenue - before operating and
transport costs. That is enough to wipe out any prospect of a return on
investment in many cases.
The minister is refreshingly candid on the tax problem - and on his ability
to solve it at a time of severe government budget deficits and spiralling
demands for funds at national and local level. 'You have to understand we
are in a period of transition, when everything is changing,' he says.
'Certainly I am not satisfied with the tax policy we are pursuing. I try to
influence it on my level.'
Mr Shafranik says he is working on producing tax breaks for the industry and
points to a decree issued in March providing incentives for opening new oil,
coal and gas fields and repairing existing ones. More breaks should follow
for refining and machinery manufacture.
This last is a priority area, since the collapse of the Soviet Union - in
whose rulers' wisdom, 80 per cent of the country's oilfield equipment
capacity was located in the now independent republic of Azerbaijan -
deprived Russia of a vital industry. Mr Shafranik says the real need now is
for investment in local manufacturing. 'Foreign companies which want to sell
machines to us but are not keen on joint production here in Russia will
definitely lose,' he warns. 'If oil production goes down, we run short of
hard currency and will not long be able to pay for machines. So companies
which would not like to create manufacturing sites here will lose.'
If that sounds ominously dirigiste, it is out of character. The energy
minister is as ardent a marketeer as any member of Mr Yeltsin's cabinet. As
governor of Tyumen, he lobbied vigorously for a liberalisation of Russian
domestic energy prices on the argument that the region needed a fair rent
for its resources. His views have not changed, although he now adds a note
of caution. Cheap fuel, he says, is a drug, and Russia will take time to
kick the habit - just as Russia now accepts that Ukraine, with which it was
bitterly at odds over oil prices until a few weeks ago, will have to be
allowed time to adjust to the free market.
Fuel prices are probably Mr Shafranik's hottest political potato. A close
second, however, comes Russia's ailing coal mining sector, and here too he
does not duck the issues. Yesterday he repeated his blunt warning that many
mines in the Kuzbass region of Siberia, whose militant miners played a part
in the ousting of Mikhail Gorbachev and could yet cause trouble for Mr
Yelstin, were inefficient and would have to close. He coupled it, however,
with an invitation to foreign investors. 'Pits which have worked out their
resources will be closed. And we will create the conditions for foreign
investors to open new pits.'
If only it - and the rest of Russia's struggle for reform - were so simple.

FT  21 APR 93 / Jobs: The hoped-for sparklers fail to show - Advertised
demand remains on the downpath for most types of executive staff in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it comes to conjuring up mental visions of terror, the poet Samuel
Taylor Coleridge had few equals let alone betters. As an example, witness
the picture he draws, in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, of:
. . . one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having
once turned round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows, a
frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.
All of which suggests the horror Coleridge must have felt at the spectre of
his country being run by a certain set of people. Those he had in mind - and
beside whom, he said, 'the worst form of aristocracy would be a blessing' -
were 'a contemptible democratical oligarchy of glib economists'.
Fortunately, although economists have bred copiously in Britain since his
death in 1834, they haven't quite taken full control of the country yet. In
the meantime, however, Brits who believe their economy is now recovering
from recession might like to ponder the implications of a lesser spectre:
that of industry and commerce eventually being run by computing specialists
in harness with sales and marketing folk.
After all, portents of said development are to be found in the table
alongside. As on previous occasions, it gives the results over the past five
years of the MSL International consultancy's counts of jobs for managers and
higher-ranked specialists which are advertised in the United Kingdom's
weightier journals. Each post so offered is counted as just one, no matter
how many times the ad for it appears in various organs.
The upper part of the table focuses on the 12-monthly period to March 31,
showing first the number of advertised openings in eight broad categories of
executive-level work, then the total. Below that come the all-categories
tallies for each quarter of the period.
Now in all the years I have been reporting MSL's figures, I'd never been
keener to see the latest three-monthly count. The reasons were twofold, the
first dating back to six months ago.
It was then that, after what seemed like ages of unrelieved decline in every
niche of the advertised market, a bright spot suddenly appeared. Demand in
the sales and marketing category, having repeatedly plumbed ever lower
depths, rose by comparison with the 12 months before. The next tally which
came three months ago showed not only that the said rise was continuing, but
that it had been joined by an upturn in computing.
With those two improvements in the bag, my second reason for being eager to
see the latest figures lies in the seasonal pattern the counts have taken
since the consultancy began them in 1959. Almost always, January-March has
been the best quarter for demand in the calendar year. So I was expecting to
find plus-signs also sparkling beside further categories of work.
Alas, as may be seen, they have not appeared. Hence, if UK industry and
commerce are emerging from recession, they are evidently doing same without
need to advertise for increased supplies of any executives except computing,
and sales and marketing types.
That has not stopped MSL's chief executive Garry Long from greeting the
count with glad heart. Focusing on the jump between the two latest quarters,
from 2,936 posts of all types in October-December to 3,955 in January-March,
he says: 'These figures are particularly encouraging because they signal an
increase in recruitment at managerial and executive level - a sure sign of
investment for growth.'
I fear I disagree. True, the quarter-to-quarter jump is marked. At 34.7 per
cent, it compares with an average rise of 20.3 per cent between those same
two quarters over the years since 1980. But the 3,955 is still 2.5 per cent
down on the 4,058 jobs advertised in January-March a year ago, a period when
the market seems likely to have been depressed by employers' anxieties about
the forecast Labour win in the April election.
If so, then the at least short-term relief when the Conservatives prevailed
may have released pent-up demand and distorted the seasonal pattern for
1992. Accordingly, in an attempt to adjust for same, I have traced back to
1980, comparing the January-March periods with the average for all three
preceding quarters of the year before.
By that yardstick, the latest 3,955 does not represent a jump of 34.7 per
cent, or indeed one of marked degree at all. It works out at 14.8 per cent
against a 13-year average of 14.5.
Even so, while computing and the sales area may be the only beneficiaries of
an upturn in the advertised market, there may still be a rise in recruitment
of other types by different means. After all, as a result of wholesale
sackings, many able executives have signed up with agencies which keep
registers of available staff. So it may be that employers are filling their
needs from such sources rather than by advertising until the agencies'
stocks run low.

FT  21 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Short-dated UK gilts rally as Bank details
next auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED UK govern-ment bonds rallied yesterday, gaining a quarter of a
point as the Bank of England announced details of its next auction. The Bank
will offer Pounds 3bn of 7 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998 on April 28.
However, the longer end of the gilt market was slightly depressed by the
disappointing public sector borrowing requirement figure for March, which at
Pounds 9.5bn was about Pounds 1.5bn worse than expected.
The auction announcement generated some relief that the issue was no larger
than expected, and the decision to make it partly payable on April 28, with
the rest due a month later, was welcomed
The price of the 7 1/4 bond due 1998 gained about a quarter point, more than
making up the ground lost on Monday ahead of the auction announcement.
Although the PSBR figure was described as 'shocking' by some dealers -
representing an increase in government spending of about Pounds 5bn compared
with March 1992 - the damage was limited at the longer end of the gilt
market. The 8 per cent bond due 2003 and the 9 per cent due 2012 each lost
roughly  1/8 .
Dealers were reassured by the one-off aspects of some of the government
spending, as departments used up allocation at the end of the year. Some
buoyancy was also detected in income tax and VAT receipts, a trend which was
expected to continue as economic recovery took hold.
The increase in borrowing was not seen as a threat to the official forecast
of Pounds 50bn for this year's PSBR, although some economists are now
inclined to see it as a realistic - rather than a pessimistic - projection.
Once this forthcoming auction is over, the government will have raised about
a fifth of its borrowing requirement for 1993-94, said Mr Simon Briscoe,
economist at Midland Global Markets.
EUROPEAN government bond markets drifted lower in lacklustre trading as
dealers are focusing on today's Bundesbank repo and tomorrow's Bundesbank
Council meeting for signs of lower interest rates in Germany.
German government bond prices slipped back a quarter-point as new supply
helped to depress the market, dealers said. The Treuhand privatisation
agency issued DM3bn of 10-year bonds with a 6.5 per cent coupon to the bond
syndicate, and dealers expect a further DM6bn to DM7bn to be auctioned
today. 'The new bond didn't stimulate much demand for long-dated paper,'
said one dealer, who added that response to the issue was not particularly
enthusiastic.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 96.34 and edged up to a high of
96.37 before drifting down to 96.10 by late afternoon.
Dealers hope the Bundesbank will continue to allow a slight easing of
interest rates at its repo, the results of which will emerge today. At last
week's repo, the minimum rate was 8.11 per cent.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds ended lower on profit-taking.
Monday's cuts in interest rates by the Bank of France prompted a rally in
the French government bond market, but yesterday the market fell back and
the June future closed down 0.26 at 117.86.
THE combination of the yen's new high against the dollar and weakness in the
Japanese stock market helped to push up Japanese government bond prices. The
futures contract rose from 108.80 to 109.22 in Tokyo and then gained
slightly to reach 109.25 in London. In the cash market, the yield on the
benchmark No 145 bond moved from 4.25 per cent to 4.205 per cent.
Further support was lent to the bond market by bearish remarks on the
domestic economy from Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan.
As expected, the ministry of finance auctioned Y800bn of 10-year bonds with
a 4.5 per cent coupon, reopening the No 157 issue. The average price was
99.71, with a low of 99.60.
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after shorter-dated issues firmed
slightly on news of weak housing starts but longer-dated securities fell on
profit-taking by retail accounts.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at
104 3/4 , yielding 6.750 per cent. At the short end of the market, however,
the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.739 per cent.
Although the day's main economic figure - a 4.6 per cent drop in March
housing starts - was in line with expectations, it still gave a small boost
to the short end of the maturity spectrum, helping prices to hold their
ground in a weak market.
At the longer end, prices fell on retail profit-taking. Dealers remained
mostly on the sidelines, content to trade the bond with the yield at 6.75
per cent. The only other activity of note was some modest selling of the
10-year note, which was reportedly hedging related to the Dollars 1bn
Eurodollar issue by Abbey National, the UK financial services group. The
Eurodollar deal was priced off 10-year notes.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Guangdong poised for Dollars
150m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 150m floating rate note is expected to be launched tomorrow for
Guangdong International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation (Gitic), a
development arm of the government of China's fastest-growing province.
The issue, led by Union Bank of Switzerland, will have a five-year maturity
and carry a Baa1 rating from Moody's.
Mr Huang Yantian, Gitic's president, said the coupon was expected to be 55
basis points above Libor.
Gitic plans to use the money to finance projects which are already under way
in power generation and acrylic fibre production. Guangdong's economic
growth last year, at nearly 20 per cent, outstripped the 17 per cent growth
in its power generation capacity.
Foreign investment has been pouring into Guangdong, particularly from Hong
Kong and ethnic-Chinese businesses elsewhere in Asia.
However, there are concerns about the strains created by rapid growth.
Prices in Guangzhou, the province's capital, rose 17.2 per cent in the first
quarter of 1993 over the same period last year.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy moves to repay Efim
bank creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday took its biggest practical step to repaying
foreign bank creditors of the Efim state holding company, put into voluntary
liquidation last year, by authorising the treasury to raise L1,600bn through
Euromarket loans.
However, the entire Efim repayment package, which envisages issuing at least
L9,000bn in special government bonds, continues to hinge on approval from
the European Commission.
Mr Alberto Predieri, the administrator appointed to run the group after its
collapse, is due to meet Commission members in Brussels today to discuss the
government's plans.
The L1,600bn to be raised will be used to repay fully foreign bank creditors
of Efim or wholly-owned subsidiaries. The creditors will be repaid in the
currency of their original loans.
The L1,600bn represents part of the figure of L9,000bn indicated by the
government as representing Efim's exposure to the banking system.
Timing for the repayments now hinges on the Commission. Mr Predieri has said
it should decide on the legality of the government's package sometime after
today. Both the treasury and prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, have
indicated the government aims to repay foreign creditor banks by the end of
this month.
The money will be raised by a pool of Italian banks, co-ordinated by Banca
di Roma, which will then on-lend the proceeds to the treasury. No date has
been revealed for when the government will issue the special domestic bonds
through which Italian bank creditors will be repaid.
Foreign bank creditors have welcomed the government's plans.
One member of the steering committee of foreign bank creditors played down
the impact of the conflict with the Commission. 'We believe it's the usual
problem of inadequate information from Rome,' he said.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National in Dollars 1bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the UK financial services group, yesterday raised Dollars
1bn through a 10-year bond issue in one of the biggest Eurodollar issues by
a non-sovereign borrower, further extending the maturity profile of its
debt.
The deal, launched at a yield of 60 basis points over US Treasuries, met a
generally positive reception from investors, though it failed to sell as
well as Abbey's record Pounds 650m sterling issue last month, also at 10
years.
Joint lead-managers Goldman Sachs and UBS, which between them took Dollars
780m of the bonds, said late in the day that more than three-quarters of the
issue had been sold. However, other banks involved in the transaction said
they had been able to place only around two-thirds of their paper. The lead
managers held the spread at 60 basis points during the day, in the process
picking up around Dollars 100m of bonds from sellers.
The proceeds of the issue are understood to have been swapped into floating
rate sterling in a transaction handled by UBS, though Abbey refused to
confirm this. The swap is believed to have left the borrower with an all-in
cost at marginally over 25 basis points above Libor - the same after-swap
rate achieved in its 10-year sterling deal.
Abbey said the money would be used partly to refinance maturing wholesale
debt and partly to fund future lending. At the end of last year, before the
sterling issue, less than Pounds 400m of its debt had a maturity of more
than five years. Explaining the decision to move to longer-dated debt, Mr
Roger Little, director in charge of trading at Abbey National Treasury
Services, said: 'Despite the fact that (US) Treasuries have performed very
well, there is generally a view that interest rates have bottomed out.'
Abbey's sterling deal, considered generous when it was launched at a yield
spread of 50 basis points over gilts, has since tightened to around 40 basis
points. A similar tightening of the new dollar bonds was generally seen in
the market as unlikely. The same issuer's three-year dollar paper was
trading yesterday at a yield spread of over 45 basis points, suggesting
little room for tightening of the 10-year paper.
Meanwhile, the triple-A rated KfW came during the afternoon with a FFr1.5bn
deal in an attempt to pre-empt the heavy issuance of French franc bonds
expected later this week. Today, Aeroport de Paris is expected to raise
FFr1bn in the domestic French franc market, with the European Investment
Bank also turning to the domestic market for FFr2bn on Thursday. With
borrowers having held back during the election period, and with this week's
cuts in French interest rates, the pace of new issuance is expected to
remain heavy.
Three triple-A rated names turned to the Canadian dollar sector yesterday to
tap small pockets of demand from investors for four- and five-year bonds.
The four-year paper, maturing in May 1997, was officially priced over
benchmark government bonds maturing during 1996, creating attractive-looking
yield spreads. When compared with the rate for four-year bonds implied by
the shape of the yield curve, however, the spreads looked less generous, at
26 basis points for GECC and 30 basis points for Rabobank.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Investors view Vietnam as Asian
market of future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA, Hong Kong and South Korea are viewed as the most important markets in
Asia for long-term investment, according to a survey by Euromoney. Vietnam
was named as newly-emerging market with the most exciting long-term
potential.
International investors expected to raise their exposure to Asian markets
over the next two years. But some survey respondents pointed out
improvements were needed in several markets.
Respondents found levels of liquidity one of the least satisfactory aspects.
The report noted: 'In Asia, overall market capitalisation is not always
reflected on the liquidity of an exchange. In many countries, it is common
for a company's founding family or other relations to hold up to 70 per cent
of the available shares, thus limiting a security's float.'
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia were the most liquid markets in Asia,
while Indonesia, India, and the Philippines were considered least liquid.
Respondents felt improvement was also necessary in the quality of research
material, particularly on China, and information on particular companies,
their finances and creditworthiness.
The survey drew on the responses of 124 investment managers at the largest
insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds/unit trusts, investment
management companies and banks.
International investors expected to increase their exposure to Asia in the
next two years, from 15.8 per cent of total funds under management at the
end of 1992 to 18.4 per cent by the end of 1994. Asian respondents planned
to increase their exposure to the region by more than their European and US
counterparts, from 14.6 per cent to 18.9 per cent.
Within Asia, the survey revealed that investors allocated 84.5 per cent in
the developed markets - Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand  - and
15.43 per cent in emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, China, Indonesia,
Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Korea, and the Philippines. Some
0.07 per cent was placed in 'dormant or incubating' markets, which include
Brunei, Macao, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Bhutan, Laos, Cambodia and
Myanmar.
However, this asset allocation was expected to change as more emphasis was
placed on the emerging markets, rising to 22.6 per cent, while developed
markets would account for 76.3 per cent in two years.
Of the emerging stock markets, China and South Korea could expect increased
exposure by international investors over the next two years - from 15.6 per
cent to 21.6 per cent in the case of China, and from 16.9 per cent to 22 per
cent for South Korea - the report said.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Black wins approval for 25%
Fairfax stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday said it would allow The Telegraph, Mr
Conrad Black's British newspaper group, to increase its stake in the John
Fairfax media group from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.
Fairfax shares rose 10 cents to close at ADollars 2.09 on the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX) after the Labor cabinet decided to ignore criticism
from across the political spectrum of Mr Black's request.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the decision
reflected 'the valid need of foreign investors to safeguard their financial
and managerial commitment to their newspapers'.
Mr Dawkins said other foreign investors would be allowed to own a further 5
per cent of Fairfax, enabling Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank, to
retain its 5 per cent non-voting shareholding.
Mr Dan Colson, deputy chairman of The Telegraph, welcomed the decision:
'Obviously we are delighted, and we are looking forward to increasing our
involvement with this great company.'
Officials said the government hoped the decision would help to stabilise the
ownership of Fairfax, which was in receivership from 1990 to 1991 after a
bungled buy-out of family shareholders.
However, the higher ceiling on foreign ownership offers The Telegraph no
protection from Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media entrepreneur who owns
10 per cent of Fairfax and is rumoured to be considering a full bid.
Mr Packer could acquire control by buying a further 41 per cent of Fairfax,
but he would have to relinquish control of the Channel Nine television
network to comply with cross-media ownership regulations.
Trying to disarm criticism of Mr Black's involvement in Fairfax, Mr Dawkins
said there would be no further increases in the level of foreign investment
allowed in newspapers.
However, the Friends of Fairfax, an umbrella grouping of journalists and
supporters, said the decision was a 'sell-out' which would leave the bulk of
the Australian media in foreign hands.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and
the Australian Financial Review, is the main competitor to News Corporation,
the US media group, which controls 70 per cent of Australia's daily
circulation.
The decision was also criticised by Labor MPs, including Mr Barry Jones, the
party's federal president. Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader, said it
was 'quite shabby'. The populist Australian Democrats said it was 'grossly
irresponsible'.
Mr Black acquired management control of Fairfax in 1991, when the group was
bought from the receiver for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1bn) by the Tourang
consortium, consisting of The Telegraph and Hellman &amp; Friedman.
The Telegraph's shareholding was reduced to 15 per cent following a
flotation in 1992. The remaining shares are owned by a range of Australian
investors, mostly financial institutions.
Mr Dawkins said the revised limit on Fairfax shareholdings would apply to
all newspaper publishers, effectively raising the ceiling on overseas
shareholdings from 20 to 30 per cent.
The decision opens the way for Mr Tony O'Reilly's Dublin-based Independent
Newspapers (INP) to increase its 20 per cent stake in Australian Provincial
Newspapers (APN), a leading rural publisher.

GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, has increased its
shareholding in Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) to 50 per cent from 25 per cent
in a series of transactions valued at R671.2m (Dollars 210m).
Gencor bought the RBM shares from Industrial Development Corporation and its
two investment subsidiaries, Indsel and Natsel, and from Old Mutual, a life
assurance company.
The purchase will be settled through the exchange of 9.1m Engen shares and
1.55m Malbak shares, two offshoots of Gencor.
The other 50 per cent of RBM is held by the RTZ mining group.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, commented: 'An opportunity arose
whereby we could increase our investment in a major world-class mining
company with a proven competitive advantage in titanium smelting technology
and generating a substantial cash-flow.'

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Mexico proposes sweeping changes
to its markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is set to introduce legislation that will bring
regulation of its stock and capital markets into line with those of the US,
enabling Mexican brokerages and banks to compete more effectively with
foreign rivals.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, announced the planned changes at a
Mexican stock market convention yesterday. The legislation will be ready in
10 days. By promoting clear international norms, it is intended to encourage
more foreign investment in Mexican stocks in Mexico.
'We have to be competitive internationally and make sure the business in New
York comes back to Mexico,' Mr Aspe added in an interview. Most important
Mexican stocks - such as Televisa, Vitro, Telmex, ICA and Cemex - are traded
on the New York Stock Exchange or over-the-counter in the form of American
Depositary Receipts in New York.
Mr Aspe said the government would introduce new laws on insider trading and
permit only companies that have a certain proportion of their capital in
public hands to be quoted on the stock market. It would also encourage more
self-regulation in the market, enabling banks and brokerages to respond more
quickly to market demands.
There would be tighter stipulations on the information that had to be
reported, and market-makers would be introduced to improve liquidity in the
stock market.
But, said Mr Aspe, existing limitations on voting shares in some stocks open
to foreign ownership would not be changed; nor would the percentage of
non-voting ('L' or 'C') shares of the total capital be altered.

<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems, the leading computer workstation manufacturer, reported a
bigger than expected decline in third-quarter earnings, in spite of record
revenues. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 51.7m, or 47 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 61.4m, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Revenues for the
quarter were Dollars 1.1bn, up 20 per cent from Dollars 952m.
Sun attributed the decline to higher shipments of less profitable upgrade
products, including add-on memory and data storage devices. The company said
that European markets had been weak.
'Profitability was below the year-ago level due to gross margin declines
that were partially offset by tightly controlled growth in operating
expenses,' said Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer.
'Our commitment to control headcount and spending enabled us to increase
revenue per employee above Dollars 300,000 for the first time.'
For the first nine months of fiscal 1993, Sun recorded revenues of Dollars
3.1bn, up 17 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Net income for
the nine-month period was Dollars 80.6m, or 77 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 135.6m, or Dollars 1.34, last year.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: JR East files preliminary
application for Tokyo listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST JAPAN Railway, the Japanese railways group, filed a preliminary
application yesterday with the Tokyo stock exchange for a listing that will
be a test of the market's recently-regained strength.
The listing of JR East, as the company is known, will be the biggest
offering of a semi-privatised company since that of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone (NTT), whose shares fell last year to almost one-third of their
first offering price of Y1.197m (Dollars 10,783) in late 1986.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, stock exchange president, said the exchange did not want
to see a repeat of the NTT episode, which is blamed for souring the attitude
of retail investors towards the stock market.
However, NTT's price has recovered in recent weeks, lifting the market's
confidence, encouraging the government to press ahead with JR East, and
suggesting to brokers that there would be retail interest in the railway
company.
Mr Nagaoka said the timing of the listing and the price should be decided
after careful examination of the market's strength, though the listing was
likely in late October or early November. It has been reported that the
offering price will be around Y250,000.
The market expects about 2m of JR East's 4m shares held by JNR Settlement
will be offered to the public. JNR Settlement took over shares of the seven
companies created through the break-up and semi-privatisation of Japan
National Railways in 1987, and has been waiting more than three years for
stock prices to recover.
Meanwhile, the stock exchange reported a deficit of Y3.46bn for the year
ending in March, compared with Y9.13bn in the previous year.

OKI Electric, the Japanese telecommunications and data processing company,

The plants, which manufacture information and telecommunications equipment,
were being closed to adjust production levels, Oki said.
Oki said production in the first half of the current year to March 1994 was
expected to be particularly low as Japanese companies, including financial
institutions, had frozen investment plans.

<TEXT>
MARUBENI, the Japanese trading house, yesterday said it would record
extraordinary losses of Y40bn (Dollars 350.87m) for the year to the end of
March 1993 because of the restructuring of three affiliates and losses
incurred on securities investment funds.
The company said the losses would be covered by profits on the sale of fixed
assets and stocks, and would not affect its net profits for the year,
expected to be about Y12.5bn, down from Y17.4bn.
Like many other Japanese companies, Marubeni put funds into tokkin, or
specified money trusts, which were an important source of income during the
late 1980s but which have become a serious burden over the past three years.
Marubeni said the cost of restructuring its ailing textile, leasing, and
petrochemical affiliates would total Y20bn, while the tokkin losses would
also amount to Y20bn. It did not say which fixed assets will be sold to
cover the losses.

Dollars 374m
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Banking, the third-largest US commercial bank, yesterday reported a
healthy 44 per cent increase in its net profits to Dollars 374m, or Dollars
1.35 a share, for the first quarter of 1993.
The net income figure was struck after a Dollars 30m restructuring charge
related to the acquisition in February of assets from First City of Texas by
Texas Commerce Bancshares, a Chemical affiliate company.
The net profit benefited from a Dollars 35m net gain related to a change in
accounting.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman of Chemical, said the bank's performance was
helped by strong net interest revenues, record total trading revenues and
increases in several fee-based services, such as corporate finance and trust
activities.
Bad debt provisions at Chemical were Dollars 312m in the quarter, down from
Dollars 375m a year ago.
While credit costs remained at high levels, the bank's credit quality
continued to improve, according to Mr Walter Shipley, president of Chemical
Banking.
He added that non-performing assets were Dollars 5.7bn at the end of March,
down from Dollars 6.2bn at the end of the 1992 first quarter.
The bank's tier one ratio of capital to assets was 7.4 per cent at the end
of the quarter, up from 6.6 per cent a year ago.
The bank, which was formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust and Chemical, said its return on assets rose to 1.06 per cent from
0.75 per cent a year ago.
Net interest income in the quarter was Dollars 1.15bn, up slightly from
Dollars 1.12bn a year ago. Non-interest revenue for the quarter was Dollars
925m, up by 15 per cent year-on-year.
On Wall Street, Chemical's shares were Dollars  3/8 down at Dollars 40 1/4 .
Banc One, the expanding Ohio-based bank that specialises in consumer banking
business, reported a record net profit of Dollars 272m, or Dollars 1.03 per
share, for the first quarter of 1993, against Dollars 179m a year ago.
Banc One's return on assets was 1.58 per cent, one of the highest levels in
the US banking industry.
Mr John McCoy, chairman of Banc One, said continued retail loan demand
helped the net interest margin, which was 6.64 per cent in the first
quarter.
At the end of March, Banc One had total assets of Dollars 70bn and operated
60 banks with 1,277 offices in 11 states.
On Wall Street, the bank's shares were Dollars 57 1/2 , down Dollars 5/8 .
Bankers Trust, the New York bank, said first-quarter net profit jumped by 49
per cent to Dollars 230m, or Dollars 2.69 a share. After restating the
figures for accounting changes, the net income for the first quarter of 1992
was Dollars 600m and the net for the first quarter of 1993 was Dollars 155m.
Net interest revenue was 41 per cent higher at Dollars 315m. Total trading
revenue of Dollars 346m was up 60 per cent and was attributed mainly to
sharply higher revenue from several of the firm's proprietary trading
activities.
Bad debt provisions were Dollars 30m, down from Dollars 55m a year ago.
Non-performing assets declined by 7 per cent to Dollars 2.29bn.
In Pittsburgh, Mellon Bank said its first-quarter net profit was Dollars
34m, down from Dollars 86m a year ago.
In California, Wells Fargo said its net earnings in the first quarter
declined by 9 per cent to Dollars 108m. The main reason for the drop in
profits was higher expenses on the non-interest side of the bank.
Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman, said Wells was encouraged that its problem
loans declined in the quarter, but said 'we continue to be cautious given
the still fragile condition of the California economy.'
On Wall Street the Wells Fargo share price was Dollars 5 1/2 lower at
Dollars 113 7/8.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: US steel group plans expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, is to greatly expand production
capacity at a plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which has shaken up the
industry by its use of a radical, new technology.
Nucor announced yesterday that it would expand the plant's annual capacity
from 1m tons a year to 1.8m tons.
The expansion would cost less than Dollars 40m, would increase the number of
employees by only 10 per cent, and would be in operation by the second
quarter of 1994.
The company pioneered the thin-slab casting method of making sheet steel at
the Crawfordsville plant, which began operations in 1989. This makes sheet
steel much more cheaply than conventional methods, since it cuts out several
stages of the manufacturing process.
Last year Nucor opened a second thin-slab plant in Hickman, Arkansas, with
an annual capacity of over 1m tons.
Until Crawfordsville began operations, the high-value sheet market had been
one of the few sectors of the US steel market in which the country's
traditional, integrated manufacturers had been free from competition from
low-cost mini-mills.
However, its lead is now being followed by other mini-mill groups and the
integrated manufacturers themselves. Earlier this month Armco became the
first integrated company to announce plans for a flat-rolled mini-mill,
which will be located at its facility in Mansfield, Ohio.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: USAir cuts first-quarter net
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USAIR, the carrier in which British Airways invested Dollars 300m for a 19.9
per cent voting interest earlier this year, yesterday reported a Dollars 2m
operating profit for the first three months of 1993.
The airline, however, recorded a Dollars 61m loss after interest charges and
taxes.
In the same period of 1992, USAir suffered an operating loss of Dollars
48.6m and a net loss of Dollars 110.2m, ahead of charges related to
accounting rule changes.
The carrier's operating revenues in the most recent three-month period
increased from Dollars 1.65bn to Dollars 1.72bn, although it said that the
severe blizzard which hit the eastern US in March resulted in 'several
thousand' USAir and USAir Express flights being cancel-led.
Operating expenses, however, only edged up from Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars
1.71bn - helped significantly by the fall in labour costs to Dollars 648.7m
from Dollars 665.3m a year ago. Last year, the company won some significant
pay and benefit concessions from employees.
USAir said the overall load factor improved from 53.4 per cent a year ago to
55.6 per cent, while yields edged slightly higher to 18.75 cents, from 18.63
cents a year ago.
NWA, parent company of Northwest Airlines, reported a net loss of Dollars
99.2m for the first quarter, compared with a net loss of Dollars 106.9m in
the same period of last year, excluding accounting changes, writes Martin
Dickson.
However, the airline said this year's loss included a foreign exchange loss
of Dollars 31.6m, largely because of the strengthening of the yen against
the dollar, and its operating loss had been Dollars 69.8m, compared with
Dollars 120.3m a year ago. Revenues were up 1.6 per cent at Dollars 2.01bn.
Operating expenses dropped 0.9 per cent to Dollars 2.08bn.
The company said it had cut operating costs per available seat mile to 9.36
cents from 9.44 cents, while revenues per available seat mile rose to 9.09
cents from 9.04 cents.

BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental chain, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 39.2m in the first quarter of 1993, against
Dollars 25.7m in the same period of 1992.
Revenues rose to Dollars 608.7m from Dollars 446.4m a year earlier, and
earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased to 20 cents from 15
cents.
Part of the increase came from Blockbuster's aggressive expansion to build a
more broadly-based home entertainment group.

<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the fastest-growing US drugs companies, yesterday posted a 25
per cent rise in first-quarter underlying earnings from continuing
operations, writes Karen Zagor.
Net income for the 1993 first quarter was Dollars 329m, or Dollars 1.01 a
share, on sales of Dollars 1.87bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 14.8m,
or 4 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.76bn a year earlier. Accounting changes
reduced 1992 earnings by Dollars 312.6m.
Pfizer has divested and closed businesses and took restructuring charges in
both years.
Excluding unusual items, Pfizer said net income from ongoing operations was
Dollars 350.3m, or Dollars 1.07, on sales of Dollars 1.86bn in the latest
quarter against earnings of Dollars 279.8m, or 83 cents, on sales of Dollars
1.63bn a year earlier.
Mr William Steere, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Virtually all our
sales growth was from increased volume. Of our 15 per cent sales growth from
ongoing operations, 16 per cent was from volume, 2 per cent from price
increases, and the strengthening of the dollar reduced sales growth by 3 per
cent.'

GTE, the largest local US telephone company, yesterday reported a 12 per
cent rise in first-quarter earnings per share, excluding accounting changes,
thanks to higher volumes and lower costs in its telephone operations and
strong growth in its cellular telephone business.
The company reported consolidated net income of Dollars 460m, or 48 cents a
share, compared with earnings per share of 43 cents a year ago.
After adjusting the 1992 earnings for a change in accounting rules for
retirees' health benefits, the group had a net loss in the first quarter of
last year of Dollars 2.05bn, or Dollars 2.27 a share.
Sales and revenues in the latest quarter totalled Dollars 4.83bn, against
Dollars 4.82bn a year ago, while operating income was up 9 per cent at
Dollars 1.10bn.
Revenues from telephone operations rose from Dollars 3.85bn to Dollars
3.92bn and operating income was up 7 per cent at Dollars 1.04bn.
Revenues and sales from telecommunications products and services dipped 6
per cent to Dollars 911m. Operating income rose from Dollars 29m to Dollars
60m.
Sprint, the third largest US long-distance carrier, reported a net loss of
Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, compared with profits of Dollars
128m, or 38 cents, after the cost of changing its accounting methods for
retirees' health benefits, and Dollars 248m of costs associated with its
takeover of Centel, the Chigaco-based phone company.
However, the company said income from continuing operations, excluding
special charges, was Dollars 154m, or 45 cents, compared with Dollars 106m,
or 31 cents, in the first quarter of last year. Revenues rose 9 per cent to
Dollars 2.72bn.

NATIONSBANK, the south-eastern US regional banking group formed in 1991 by
the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, has unveiled a 55 per cent jump in
first-quarter 1993 net profits to Dollars 481m, or Dollars 1.89 a share.
The results were inflated by a one-time Dollars 200m benefit stemming from
accounting changes.
NationsBank, the fourth-largest US banking group, disclosed that its
non-performing assets totalled Dollars 1.92bn at the end of the first
quarter, equivalent to 2.53 per cent of total loans, leases and foreclosed
property, and about 29 per cent below the non-performing level a year ago.
Bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 1.57bn, down from Dollars 1.66bn a year
ago. Provisions taken in the quarter were Dollars 120m, less than half the
Dollars 265m taken in the first quarter of 1992.
Net interest income was Dollars 1.09bn, up from Dollars 1.01bn a year ago.
Non-interest income was Dollars 481m, against Dollars 471m.
NationsBank, which owns Panmure Gordon, the UK stockbroker, said its tier
one ratio of capital to assets was 7.61 per cent, compared with 7.17 per
cent a year ago.

ABITIBI-PRICE reined back losses in its first quarter, helped by a
strengthening newsprint market and tight cost controls.
The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 28.8m (USDollars 22.9m), or
42 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 37.9m, or 56 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales were CDollars 471m, against a restated CDollars 379m.
'Though we are not yet profitable, we have shown the first year-over-year
improvement in quarterly results of our core newsprint business since 1988,'
said Mr Ronald Oberlander, president.
Mr Oberlander told the annual meeting in Toronto he expected results 'to
pick up steam quarter by quarter in 1993'.
Rising newsprint demand was based on advertising gains in the eastern US,
and a build-up in inventories - partly due to fears of stoppages in eastern
Canada mills.
Abitibi's shipments to Europe came up against Scandinavian competition
following last year's devaluations, but Asian and Latin American markets
were firm.
The office products division posted higher sales and operating profit in the
US and Europe.

MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported reduced first-quarter
operating income and sales after weak Japanese and European economies hit
its main chemical business.
For the three months to March 31, Monsanto's operating income was Dollars
231m on sales of Dollars 1.94bn, against Dollars 259m on sales of Dollars
1.97bn last time.
Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.71 a share.
A year earlier, Monsanto suffered a net loss of Dollars 388m, or Dollars
3.16, including one-time charges of Dollars 540m for accounting changes and
other items.
It blamed recession in Europe and Japan for severely constricting demand and
pricing in its automotive-linked businesses for contributing to a drop in
operating income for its chemicals group to Dollars 50m from Dollars 79m.
Chemical sales rose to Dollars 898m from Dollars 896m.
Its NutraSweet artificial sweetener business had operating income of Dollars
34m on sales of Dollars 170m, against Dollars 37m on sales of Dollars 199m.
The business should benefit from a recent Food and Drug Administration
ruling expanding the use of NutraSweet in a wider range of drinks,
confections and baking.
The Searle pharmaceutical unit recorded an operating loss of Dollars 27m on
Dollars 361m sales. A year earlier, it had operating income of Dollars 10m
on sales of Dollars 363m.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Argentina prepares for sell-off
of stake in state oil company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S financial community was due to be briefed yesterday in Buenos
Aires on what could turn out to be be the largest international equity
offering of the year, the sale to the public of a majority stake in the
state-owned oil company YPF this summer.
The fully-integrated company, the first state oil company in Latin America,
has been drastically restructured for privatisation and is regarded by some
as the jewel in the crown of a dramatic Argentine privatisation programme.
Its 52,000 employees in August 1990 have been reduced to fewer than 12,000.
After sales of non-core assets such as its shipping fleet and of certain oil
and gas wells to dilute its monopoly power in the Argentine market, the
value of the company's assets is put in the region of Dollars 6bn to Dollars
8bn.
The government's economic team, led by Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister,
indicated earlier that a controlling stake in the company would not be sold
to a single business operator as in some earlier Argentine privatisations.
Officials also said they intended to transfer control from the government in
the first stage of the privatisation even though, after it, the government
would probably still be the largest single shareholder.
Partly for this reason, the plan is to sell more than 50 per cent of the
shares of the company in the initial offering, according to a banker close
to the transaction.
Some estimates have suggested up to Dollars 3bn could be raised in this
first stage. Some 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the company is to be reserved
for the workforce and a remaining 20 per cent is to stay with the
government. As reported, First Boston and Merrill Lynch - which had advised
YPF in its preparation for privatisation - have been appointed by the
government as global co-ordinators of the initial offering.
The offering is to be made using the US style of book building: this
establishes the demand for shares at a range of prices, and is said by its
proponents to improve chances that the shares are directed into firm hands.
This system will be used for the first time in Argentina. The government is
keen to avoid the experience of some previous auction-style privatisations
where prices fell sharply soon after the auction leaving investors, many of
which borrowed to finance share purchases, with heavy losses.
Most of the shares are expected to be directed to the US market. While the
outcome depends on the consultation now being held with underwriters and on
the book building process, bankers now guess perhaps half of the shares
offered will go to the US market, around 20 per cent to the Argentine market
and 30 per cent into the non-US international market.
With the capitalisation of the entire Argentine market now around Dollars
18bn, it would be impractical to direct the entire offering to Buenos Aires.
Nonetheless, there have been some concerns expressed about the ability of
the international market to absorb such a large amount of paper in a
relatively short time.
Filings are expected to be made with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission to permit the offering to take place in late-June or July,
earlier than the government previously publicly envisaged but one apparently
designed to avoid a clash with Congressional elections due in September.
According to officials, bankers and investors in New York are to be briefed
at the end of this week on the offering and in London early next week.
Co-managers for the offering are likely to be named by the end of the month.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Digital introduces new
workstations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment, the US minicomputer maker, aims to regain its momentum in
the Dollars 10bn computer workstation market with new products based on its
high-performance Alpha microprocessor that outpace similarly-priced
competitors' machines.
Digital has been losing ground in the workstation market for the past two
years to Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. But analysts say the new
products, which fill significant gaps in its Alpha product line launched in
November, could represent a turning point.
The group unveiled workstations in the Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000
price range as well as a higher-performance model at Dollars 70,000.
It also announced what it called 'workstation farms,' in which a series of
fast workstations are linked to work on complex supercomputing tasks.
The new products were the group's second wave of workstations based on its
64-bit Alpha microprocessor, which has established it as the front-runner in
workstation performance.
However, Digital still faces the challenge of building a base of software
applications to take full advantage of its new computer architecture.
Its first Alpha workstations were aimed primarily at software developers.
The company claims, however, there are now 'several hundred' applications
designed to run on Alpha computers.
Digital also has another advantage up its sleeve. Microsoft, the leading
computer software company, is developing a version of its soon to be
introduced 'Windows NT' software to run on Digital's Alpha workstations.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: First-term profit of Dollars 39m
at Blockbuster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental chain, yesterday reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 39.2m in the first quarter of 1993, compared
with Dollars 25.7m in the same period of 1992.
Revenues rose to Dollars 608.7m from Dollars 446.4m a year earlier, and
earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased to 20 cents from 15
cents.
Part of the increase came from Blockbuster's aggressive expansion -
including a push into music retailing, in an effort to build a more
broadly-based home entertainment group. However, same-store revenues
advanced by 6.8 per cent, and the company gained share in the home video
market.
During the quarter, Blockbuster bought an interest of about 35 per cent in
Republic Pictures, an independent producer and distributor of filmed
entertainment with a library of feature films and TV movies.
The company also recently acquired a significant interest in Spelling
Entertainment Group.
In January 1992, Blockbuster acquired the Cityvision group of the UK, which
owns the Ritz video-rental chain.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Citicorp rises sharply to
Dollars 370m in first quarter

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the biggest US commercial bank, reported first-quarter 1993
operating earnings that jumped to Dollars 370m, or 67 cents a share, from
Dollars 183m, or 37 cents, in the first quarter of last year.
The bank's net profit was inflated to Dollars 670m as a result of accounting
changes related to tax benefits.
US consumer banking business was weak, and the bank's commercial property
loan business in North America reported a net loss of Dollars 202m in the
quarter, less than half the Dollars 462m loss a year ago. But most other
divisions of the bank did well.
Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, said the results reflected a continued drop
in credit costs, as well as cost controls. He said the bank continued to
strengthen its balance sheet by building bad debt provisions and capital.
Citicorp's tier one ratio of capital to assets stood at 5.2 per cent at the
end of March, up from 4.1 per cent.
The bank's consolidated bad debt provisions in the quarter totalled Dollars
689m, down from Dollars 1.2bn a year ago. Non-performing assets amounted to
a total of Dollars 10.2bn of assets, only slightly above the Dollars 10.1bn
level of a year ago.
Net loan write-offs in the quarter were Dollars 514m, down sharply from
Dollars 997m in the first three months of 1992.
Mr Bill Rhodes, Citicorp's vice-chairman who was given responsibility for
credit control at the end of 1991, said that during the quarter the bank
sold Dollars 125m of properties, seized when loans went into default,
compared with Dollars 300m in the whole of last year. The average price
achieved for these properties was 67 per cent of the value of the loans on
them.
Earnings in the global consumer business increased by 30 per cent
year-on-year, to Dollars 320m. Revenues of Dollars 2.6bn were unchanged.
Global finance division reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 353m
compared with Dollars 193m.
The cross-border refinancing portfolio had Dollars 40m of earnings in the
quarter, down from Dollars 130m a year ago and caused by the release of
funds from bad debt provisions.
Total Citicorp revenues in the quarter were up by 5 per cent year-on-year at
Dollars 4.3bn.
On Wall Street, the shares closed Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 28 3/4.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OERLIKON-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments and engineering group, returned to
profit last year for the first time since 1985.
The group, which was put under new management in 1991, recorded a net profit
of SFr37m (Dollars 24.7m) in 1992, against a loss of SFr915m a year earlier.
Revenues were down 1.5 per cent to SFr3.57bn but group operating profit was
SFr232m, against a SFr9m loss a year earlier, due to cost-cutting.
Financial charges dropped to SFr204m from SFr249m, mainly reflecting a fall
in net debt to SFr1.44bn last year from SFr1.8bn at the end of 1991.
The directors said they intended to simplify the capital structure,
converting the SFr100 nominal bearer shares and SFr40 nominal registered
shares into a single class of SFr20 registered shares.
The directors said they expected a further increase in profits this year.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, said the
value of incoming orders dipped 3 per cent in the first quarter to Dollars
7.55bn and group revenues fell 4 per cent to Dollars 6.2bn. But the trend
was distorted by exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding these, orders were up
5 per cent and revenues up 3 per cent.
'The recessionary environment and downturn in demand continues in Europe and
the slow North American recovery has not yet positively influenced ABB's
total order intake,' Mr Percy Barnevik, president, told ABB's general
meeting in Vasteras, Sweden.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Volvo faces anger over
management style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chief, will confront more than the ire of
small shareholders over executive pay when he stands up at the company's
annual meeting in Gothenburg today. He will also face questions which go the
heart of his long stewardship of the Swedish vehicle maker.
Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association, has attracted much
attention, particularly in the local media, for its campaign to force Volvo
to disclose how much Mr Gyllenhammar receives in pay and benefits, as well
as how much he agreed to pay Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and the
size of the 'golden handshake' paid last year to Mr Christer Zetterberg, Mr
Gyll's predecessor.
However, the shareholders' association, whose 65,000 individual members held
some 10 per cent of Volvo according to a survey three years ago, is voicing
deeper concerns about the company which amount to a public questioning not
just of Mr Gyllenhammar's autocratic style of management, but of his
management strategies.
Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, managing director of Aktiespararna, says the first
two questions out of five that his association has demanded of the Volvo
board concern the future of Volvo's three-year alliance with Renault, the
state-controlled French car and truck maker, and its plans for Procordia,
the pharmaceuticals and food group in which Volvo is the largest
shareholder.
Aktiespararna supported the Renault link but says it is now unclear what the
strategy is. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault with the right to increase to
25 per cent. Renault owns about 10 per cent of the Volvo parent company, 25
per cent of Volvo cars and 45 per cent of Volvo trucks.
There are fears in Sweden that Renault might take over Volvo's loss-making
vehicle divisions.
Mr Gyllenhammar also led a bid last year to merge Volvo with Procordia but
was blocked by the Swedish government, the other main shareholder. A deal
with the state left Volvo as the largest shareholder with an option to
acquire a majority stake. But Mr Forsgardh says it is unclear what Volvo
intends next in what had appeared to be a strategic shift away from its
traditional business.
Mr Gyllenhammar is expected to try to blunt the shareholders' attack by
disclosing some details of his remuneration for the first time. Anger over
his perks - which supposedly include mansions, private jets and New York
hotel suites - has been fuelled by a background of heavy losses at Volvo
last year, and an unprecedented 50 per cent cut in the annual dividend.
No doubt there is a serious issue over the secrecy that has surrounded
executive remuneration at Volvo.
Aktiespararna is campaigning for Swedish companies to be forced to disclose
such details, along the lines now required in the UK.
'These situations would not have arisen if there had been a remuneration
committee at Volvo - or if the board had taken up the issue,' says Mr
Forsgardh. 'The real issue is who should make the decisions at Volvo.'

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: UAP chief sees sell-off despite
71% fall in profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN Peyrelevade, president of UAP, France's largest insurer, believes
the privatisation of the state-owned insurance group will go ahead this
autumn in spite of a 71 per cent fall last year to FFr1.08bn (Dollars 200m)
in profits and a cut in dividend to FFr8 a share from FFr11.
The UAP chief forecast that the Balladur government's sell-off programme
would not get under way until the autumn, by which time UAP's results for
the first of 1993 would be in.
Mr Peyrelevade said he could not foresee a repetition of 1992's 'avalanche
of catastrophes and troubles'. For UAP, these ranged from the costs of
Hurricane Andrew in the US, a sharp rise in French car thefts, to
property-related losses incurred by the Banque Worms, its French banking
subsidiary and by Danish insurers in which UAP has direct and indirect
stakes.
In spite of an earlier warning that profits would be sharply down from
1991's level of FFr3.76bn, UAP shares were briefly suspended yesterday to
allow the market to digest news of the dividend cut.
Mr Peyrelevade conceded UAP's error in getting involved in Danish insurance
at a time of instability in Scandinavian financial markets. UAP last year
suffered a FFr400m loss because of its indirect holding in Baltica.
Yesterday, UAP said it had set aside provisions to cover its FFr270m direct
stake in Hafnia, another Danish insurer.
The UAP president said it was not clear that his group would want to sell
Banque Worms, even after the banking subsidiary was restored to health. Last
year, the bank lost FFr1.64bn and UAP injected nearly FFr1.5bn of capital
into the institution.
Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was under growing pressure from banks selling life
insurance policies directly to their clients, and that it might be useful
for the insurance group to retain a banking operation.

FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: EDS signs biggest European IT
contract
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC Data Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors of the
US, has reached agreement in principle to supply information technology
services to Sweden's KF co-operative conglomerate over 10 years in what it
said would be the biggest IT services contract ever signed in Europe.
Under the deal, which both companies hope to complete by June, EDS would
take over running Apiron Information, KF Group's IT services company which
has assets of Skr240m (Dollars 32m) and annual revenues of about SKr600m.
EDS said this gave the deal a minimum value of Dollars 1bn over the 10
years.
However, both EDS and KF executives declined to detail the full finances of
the agreement, saying they had yet to be finalised.
The companies said the partnership nature of the so-called co-sourcing deal,
in which KF would retain an interest in Apiron, was unique.
Typical IT services agreements involve 'outsourcing', in which the IT
company takes over all the IT functions and assets of the client. EDS has
had such a contract with Saab of Sweden since 1991.
EDS, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, last year had total
revenues of Dollars 8.2bn, with pre-tax income of Dollars 1bn.
It has been growing fast in Europe in recent years, where its revenues last
year were Dollars 1.4bn.
As part of the KF deal, it plans to set up a European centre for servicing
the retail industry in Stockholm.
KF is the national umbrella organisation of 120 Swedish co-operatives. It is
undergoing heavy restructuring, posting a pre-tax loss in 1992 of SKr1.75bn
on sales of SKr59bn.
KF is the fifth-largest Swedish conglomerate. However, it is seeking to slim
down from a sprawling range of businesses to concentrate on the retail
sector where it is Sweden's second-largest operator, holding an 18 per cent
market share through chains such as the Konsum supermarkets and the Obs] and
B&amp;W superstores.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP Morris, which set alarm bells ringing over branded products when it
announced a sharp price cut for its flagship Marlboro cigarettes, yesterday
reported a fall in profits from its domestic tobacco division in the first
quarter of 1993.
The US tobacco, food and brewing company said the division, which
traditionally accounts for more than half of group operating profits, made
Dollars 1.016bn at the operating level, down from Dollars 1.027bn in the
same period of 1992.
Operating revenues for the division were 4.2 per cent higher at Dollars
2.54bn, but domestic cigarette shipments were down by 1.1 per cent.
Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette brand in the US and whose market
position has been threatened by the explosive growth in discount cigarettes,
saw an 8.3 per cent fall in shipments, to 22.6bn units.
The inroads being made by discount cigarettes - which Philip Morris
suggested yesterday account for 39 per cent of the US cigarette industry -
prompted the group to announce the effective price cut of about 40 cents a
packet for Marlboro.
At the time, Philip Morris warned that the move could cut operating profits
from its domestic tobacco unit by as much as 40 per cent this year.
The US tobacco division, contributed to an overall 10.8 per cent advance in
Philip Morris's first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 1.22bn, a much
slower growth rate than the company has reported in recent years. Total
revenues were up by 8.1 per cent at Dollars 15.2bn.
The international tobacco operations saw a sharp 18 per cent operating
profits rise, at Dollars 675m.
On the food side, the US businesses improved by 14.7 per cent, to Dollars
626m, while the international food division reported a 10.5 per cent gain,
at Dollars 242m.
The beer division made operating profits of Dollars 93m, up from Dollars 81m
a year ago.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Freeman shares rise on recovery to Pounds
0.87m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FREEMAN GROUP, the USM-quoted building products company, achieved a measure
of recovery in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 874,000 compared with
Pounds 342,000. The shares rose 17p to 139p.
Turnover was Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 74m, which included Pounds 18m
from discontinued activities. The contracting division was sold in February
1992.
Operating profits were Pounds 1.56m, against Pounds 966,000 after accounting
for losses of Pounds 1.12m on discontinued activities.
Overseas, where Freeman now has a total of 32 trading locations in four
European countries, France set the pace. The Spanish subsidiary, acquired in
August 1992, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 102,000 and a positive
contribution was not expected in 1993.
There was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 3.3m) after a
smaller extraordinary charge of Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 3.06m) relating to a
provision against the possible costs of liti-gation on a contract for work
for Taylor Woodrow at EuroDisney.
Earnings worked through at 7.8p, compared with losses of 0.6p. The directors
are recommending the restoration of the final dividend with 3p to make a
total of 5p (3p).

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ropner shows 27% decline to Pounds 3.82m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ropner, the Co Durham-based engineering, property and shipping group,
reported profits before tax of Pounds 3.82m for the 1992 year on turnover of
Pounds 15.5m.
The outcome, struck after exceptional profits of Pounds 422,000, represented
a 27 per cent decline on last time's profits of Pounds 5.27m after
exceptional credits of Pounds 805,000. Turnover in 1991 amounted to Pounds
14.6m.
Directors said that difficult trading conditions and the impact of recession
had shown 'little sign of abatement'.
There were, however, the 'first glimmerings' of a property revival but no
marked increase in demand for the group's engineering products.
Earnings per share emerged at 11p, down from 15.8p; the recommended final
distribution is held at 4.75p, maintaining the total for the year at 8.25p.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: British Fittings turns in reduced loss of
Pounds 1.44m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FITTINGS Group has started to emerge from the problems of 1991 when,
a week before it expected to announce pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.8m, it
uncovered a series of stock thefts and accounting errors which led instead
to heavy losses.
In the 1992 year the Birmingham-based group incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.44m, against a restated deficit of Pounds 3.57m.
'The slate is clean now,' declared Mr Cecil Buckett, brought in last May as
finance director of the pipeline equipment distribution, high pressure water
products and non-ferrous metals distribution group.
Over the past year, the group has installed new accounting systems and
reduced its operational cost base. 'This year we're in profit, we're fairly
close to budget,' said Mr Brian Stanton, chief executive. 'We're not banking
on a major upturn. We have geared the company to make a profit in the
present climate.'
Against this background, and despite losses per share of 5.41p, a final
dividend of 1p is declared, bringing the total for the year to 1.5p. Last
time, the total distribution was 5.375p after losses per share of 14.49p.
A financial restructuring, which involved a partial withdrawal from
non-ferrous metals distribution and a reduction in working capital needs as
tighter stock control was exercised, cut borrowings and reduced gearing by
the year end to 66 per cent, from 75 per cent in June 1992.
In trading conditions described by Mr Michael Borlenghi, chairman, as
'extremely difficult, particularly in the construction industry and
especially in the last quarter of the year,' turnover fell 7 per cent from
Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 77m, and operating profit from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds
1.59m.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 542,000 compared with Pounds 2.09m in 1991,
largely to pay for 150 redundancies.
Below the line, the group took extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.95m,
against Pounds 1.18m, to pay for the closure of a non-ferrous metals
business.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Shani rise 74% to Pounds
1.34m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shani Group, the ladies' and childrens' wear manufacturer, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 74 per cent at Pounds 1.34m, against Pounds 770,000, in the
six months to January 31.
The result reflected a strong performance by coat and suit manufacturing
acquisitions. There was some improvement in the core businesses despite
competitive pricing required by customers.
Turnover for this USM-quoted company more than doubled to Pounds 11.5m. The
pre-tax figure included lower interest receivable of Pounds 186,000 (Pounds
271,000).
Earnings per share came out at 6.3p (2.6p) and an increased interim dividend
of 1.8p (1.6p) is declared.
Mr Martin Hollis, chairman, said that the second half had started well and
he looked forward with confidence to a successful outcome for the year.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar plans merger of offshore
operations - Proposed reorganisation prompted by dramatic fall in North Sea
orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDPATH AND RGC, two of Britain's biggest North Sea offshore oil and gas
fabricators, are to merge as part of a reorganisation of Trafalgar House's
offshore engineering operations.
The move comes against the background of a dramatic fall in North Sea
orders.
Turnover of the seven largest North Sea fabricators of Pounds 1.5bn last
year is expected to fall to about Pounds 500m this year.
Trafalgar House Offshore, which owns both Redpath and RGC, has cut its
labour force from 7,000 to 4,000 since last summer. A further 500 to 600 job
losses, already announced, have still to take place.
The group closed its Scott Lithgow yard on the Clyde, west of Glasgow, in
February. Last year the yard employed 700.
Mr Syd Fudge, managing director of Trafalgar House Offshore, said there were
no plans to close any of its three remaining yards - one at Fyfe, in
Scotland, and two on Teesside in north-east England.
Mr Fudge said yesterday: 'We would hope that there will be no further
redundancies beyond those which have already been announced. Much will
depend upon how successful we are at tendering for what work is available.'
Trafalgar is reorganising its offshore business to take account of the fall
in orders for fabrication of large exploration and production rigs as
development of the North Sea slows.
As a result it plans to have up to half of its business generated outside
the North Sea. The company is in the final stages of negotiating with the
Vietnamese government a joint venture to provide services for the developing
Vietnamese offshore oil industry.
Trafalgar, which would own 60 per cent of the joint venture in Vung Tu on
the Mekong delta, intends to use it as a base to break into other south-east
Asian offshore markets. It would use local labour and services as much as
possible, said Mr Fudge.
The company has also been looking at opportunities to form similar joint
ventures in Azerbaijan, Russia, India and Canada.
Its reorganised business will also place greater emphasis on North Sea
repair, maintenance and improvement work.
Trafalgar said production facilities in future were likely to be much
smaller and would hook up to existing platforms.
Fabrication of large scale stand-alone platforms for the North Sea, which
last year accounted for about 80 per cent of Trafalgar's workload, is
expected to reduce to about 30 per cent during the next decade.
Turnover of about Pounds 500m last year is expected to fall to about Pounds
300m this year.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Maxwell US sales set for July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of the M&amp;O Group, which holds the US assets of Maxwell
Communication Corporation including Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide,
could be completed by July this year, the administrators said yesterday.
Initial indicative and non-binding offers for the group in whole and in
parts were received last week and were described by Mr Mark Homan, the
senior joint administrator to MCC, as 'encouraging'.
He refused to give any details of the bidders, but previous estimates of the
value of the US assets have put them in the Dollars 700m to Dollars 1.1bn
(Pounds 464m to Pounds 720m) range.
A number of bidders have been invited to conduct due diligence on the
businesses and will be expected to submit formal offers for a second round
of bidding in July. The format has yet to be determined.
Final sales may depend on anti-trust clearance if any other large publishers
make bids, but could still leave time for the payment of a dividend by the
end of November.
Mr Homan said the bids came in a 'Chinese menu approach', with some for the
whole group and others for bits of the businesses.
The move towards private sales confirms the decision hinted at earlier this
year by Price Waterhouse that it would move away from any flotation for
Macmillan.
Any pay-outs will be conditional on approval of the scheme of arrangement
for MCC by the US and UK courts. The next stage is ratification by the US
bankruptcy court in New York next Monday.
Mr Homan said realisations so far from MCC have totalled about Pounds 80m,
but much of this money is tied up in escrow or is committed to pay for past
or future costs of the administration.
Meanwhile, Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Arthur Andersen and
administrator to the private Maxwell companies, confirmed that he planned to
place about 30 businesses into company voluntary arrangements from next
month. He expected to realise dividends of 15p to 20p in the pound on the
businesses.
He said, however, that there were no immediate plans for the sale of the
companies' controlling shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers. 'We are not
actively seeking to sell,' he said. 'We have not agreed a timetable.'

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National warns of further heavy
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender, disclosed yesterday that it expected to
make further heavy provisions this year against possible bad debts on
operations in Europe after a Pounds 47m provision in France and Spain for
1992.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, told the annual meeting of the former
building society that market conditions in Europe 'continue to de-teriorate'
and it expected to make provisions 'that could be at least at last year's
level'.
He said the core rationale which had prompted it to enter business in Europe
'remains sound' although it was a long-term investment. But he said the
board continued to keep all diversifications under close review.
Abbey last year had to make capital injections of Pounds 37m in France and
Pounds 28m in Spain after suffering losses on commercial property lending.
It stopped commercial lending in France in March 1992, and has changed
management in Spain.
Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, said he expected Abbey would make
provisions of about Pounds 100m on continental lending for 1993.
Sir Christopher said Abbey's mortgage lending had 'got off to a good start
in the first quarter. Mortgage approvals were 60 per cent up on the first
quarter of 1992, following the offer of competitively-price fixed rate
mortgages.
He said loans one to two months in arrears fell from 70,000 in December to
56,500 at the end of March. The number of properties in repossession fell
from 9,300 to 9,000.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach share offer eight times
subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC share offer by Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator, was
subscribed almost eight times, with applications from 45,000 private
investors.
The company offered 11.7m shares at 112p to the public, and placed a further
21.8m with institutions. The placing and offer valued the company at Pounds
134m and raised Pounds 20.6m to fund acquisitions.
The offer was aimed at small shareholders, being advertised on the sides of
the company's buses. Some 380 directors and staff applied for and were
granted 675,500 shares. Some 86.8m shares were sought against the balance of
11m shares available. About half of the applications were for 600 shares or
fewer.
Noble Grossart announced that the allocations will be as follows -
applications for 250 shares will receive 200, between 500 and 1,000 will
receive 225, up to 1,500 will receive 240, up to 2,000 will receive 250,
between 2,500 and 10,000 will receive 10 per cent of the application. Those
who applied for more than 10,000 will receive none.
Certificates will be despatched on April 26. Dealings begin on April 27.
The DTI has cleared the acquisition by Stagecoach of the Alder Valley
business.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Boosey &amp; Hawkes scores classic win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POPULAR success of a classical symphony was cited as the most remarkable
feature of the past year by Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and
musical publisher which yesterday reported increased sales, profits and
dividend.
It said the third symphony by Gorecki, a Polish composer, which entered the
pop album charts, had now sold 250,000 copies worldwide which would
eventually earn the company Pounds 50,000 - although none of that was
included in the results to December 31.
Sales rose 10.6 per cent to Pounds 59.4m while pre-tax profits increased 5.4
per cent to Pounds 4.23m. Both the instrument and publishing divisions saw
an increase in sales, but only publishing contributed to the growth in
profits.
Mr Walter Connor, chairman, said he was pleased with the results, which were
achieved 'despite the extremely tough market conditions'.
Turnover in the instrument division increased 10.5 per cent to Pounds 47.7m,
but operating profit was 4.5 per cent lower at Pounds 2.9m. Overheads were
reduced but competitive pressures on prices cut margins.
About 35 jobs have gone from the UK factory which makes brass instruments
and flutes and 25 jobs have been moved from the Frankfurt area to eastern
Germany, where woodwind instruments can be made more economically.
The publishing division increased sales 11.2 per cent to Pounds 11.7m and
operating profit 6.7 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. In spite of worldwide
reductions in arts funding, the group said its serious music catalogue -
contemporary works and back catalogue alike - produced significant royalty
growth.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said that although confidence in the UK
was starting to recover, world market conditions continued to be tough,
especially in mainland Europe and Japan. However, he expected the group to
emerge from the recession with good long-term growth prospects.
Earnings rose 8 per cent to 67.5p. A final dividend of 16p makes a 22p (20p)
total.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: A leaner business that has more bite / A
look at Devro, the sausage skin maker which is coming to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVRO International is not a company for the squeamish. This has nothing to
do with its performance, which is very good, but rather with its main
product - for Devro is one of the world's leading makers of edible sausage
skins.
Though the company will not acknowledge it, some people find the idea of
sausage skins, or casings as the industry calls them, slightly repellent.
If such people exist in the investment community their feelings may be
tested in the next few weeks, for Devro is planning a flotation on the
London Stock Exchange and may come to the market as early as June.
Devro is a Scottish company which gained its independence in 1991 via a
Pounds 108m management buy-out from Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare
group.
With two plants in Scotland and other factories in New Jersey, US, and New
South Wales, Australia, it is headquartered in the tiny village of
Moodiesburn near Glasgow.
The flotation, which Charterhouse, Devro's merchant bankers, says carefully
will occur sometime in the coming 12 months, is likely to create a company
that 'will just creep into the bottom of the FT 350 index', suggesting a
market capitalisation of between Pounds 170m and Pounds 180m.
Yesterday Devro announced that it made an operating profit of Pounds 21.8m
in the 12 months to December 1992 on turnover of Pounds 82.7m.
That compared with an operating profit of Pounds 13.4m on sales of Pounds
53.4m for the 11 months to December 1991.
After interest payments of Pounds 9.5m last year Devro made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 12.8m against Pounds 6.3m.
The global market for edible casings for sausages and other foods is worth
about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn).
Devro claims to have 56 per cent of the market for larger casings made of
collagen, a protein found in cow hides, whose discovery by medical
researchers at Ethicon, the J&amp;J subsidiary, led to the creation of Devro in
1962.
'Devro was always a business apart within J&amp;J,' says Mr Frank De Angeli,
Devro's chief executive.
Although collagen was not a healthcare product, J&amp;J decided to launch
collagen casings on the sausage market.
The largest single share - about 30 per cent - of the world sausage casing
market is still held by sheep and hog gut, which, Mr De Angeli admits 'may
give you a better bite.' Collagen, he says, sells 'on the softness of our
bite to the consumer.'
Since the 1960s collagen casings have made big inroads into the sausage
casing market in several countries, especially the UK, where they have a 75
per cent share.
'The gut market is in a state of gentle erosion worldwide', according to Mr
De Angeli. Devro's sales volume has risen by 4 per cent a year over the past
11 years.
The advantage of collagen over gut as a sausage casing is that it is
produced in regular lengths and lends itself to being used with high speed
machin-ery.
But gut maintains a large share of the market in Germany and the US where
consumers eat a different range of sausages to those in the UK.
Devro has a very strong position in the UK sausage market, from which it
derived about half its turnover in 1991, with 94 per cent of the collagen
casings segment.
It also has 40 per cent of the US collagen market and 83 per cent of the
Australian market. It is trying to expand in France and Germany, and is
developing in Japan and Korea.
It also has only three effective competitors in collagen casings, Naturin in
Germany, Nippi in Japan and Coria in the US. None has Devro's global
marketing capabil-ity.
According to research by NatWest Securities, Devro has enough manufacturing
capacity to meet demand for the next four to five years, and more than 60
per cent of its costs are fixed, making for a very low marginal cost of
production.
Partly because Devro did not fit in with J&amp;J's other businesses several
attempts were made by its management in the 1980s to buy it out.
Eventually an MBO was achieved by Charterhouse which became the main
institutional investor.
Mr De Angeli, 67, a former main board director of J&amp;J who was not previously
involved with Devro, put in money as an institutional investor as well as
having a stake as a manager.
The other contributors to the company's Pounds 30m of institutional equity
include Baring Bros, Citicorp, Clydes dale Bank, County NatWest, Dunedin and
Standard Life.
The MBO, says Mr De Angeli who, despite his Italian name is British, has
'removed parochialism from Devro.'
Under J&amp;J the company's four plants were were run as separate units,
'loosely co-ordinated by J&amp;J' Now there are single finance, marketing and
research directors operating from Moodiesburn.
'Looking at it as one business has achieved our ambition of making it more
efficient, though there's a lot more travel involved,' says Mr De Angeli.
More than half of the company's 930 staff work at the Scottish plants at
Moodiesburn and another at Bellshill, Lanarkshire.
'An MBO makes you more lean', Mr De Angeli says.
'You're always worried about the debt (Devro still has senior debt of Pounds
61m) and the covenants you have to keep to.'
Very few people have asked me if they can hire more people. We've pulled our
horns in and changed our travel policy - I've made a few trips across the
Atlantic in economy class.'
About 40 middle to junior ranking managers were made redundant last year.
Devro engaged Charterhouse and brokers NatWest Wood Mackenzie in October to
advise it on flotation.
Mr De Angeli stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Mr Leon Allen,
formerly chairman and chief executive of Del Monte Foods International.
Mr De Angeli expects to lead the company through the flotation and says that
he will stay 'as long as the board want me.'

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo chiefs take 5% cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo executive directors will take a 5 per cent pay cut this year, the oil
exploration company said yesterday.
The announcement followed the annual report's publication showing that the
remuneration of Mr Chris Greentree, former chief executive, increase by 40
per cent last year to Pounds 480,647. The company incurred a loss of Pounds
385m and cut its dividend, but Mr Greentree received a Pounds 50,000
performance-related pay bonus.
Lasmo has also proposed issuing Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) of cumulative
preference shares in the US and up to Dollars 250m of long-term fixed rate
debt securities or Yankee bonds. The company said it would count the
perpetual preference shares as equity and expected gearing to fall by 20
percentage points to 68 per cent.
Other annual reports showed that Mr Tom Farmer, chairman of Kwik-Fit
Holdings, had his pay reduced from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 234,000 as
pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 32m to Pounds 17m.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, picked up more at Pounds
218,000 (Pounds 193,000) but Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, received less
at Pounds 352,000, including Pounds 17,000 performance-related incentive
payments, compared with Pounds 381,000. Coats Viyella pre-tax profits for
1992 were Pounds 109m, against Pounds 111m published.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sir Owen Green receives 0.37% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR has maintained its relatively austere attitude to executive remuneration
by giving Sir Owen Green, who is about to retire as chairman of the
acquisitive conglomerate, a pay rise of Pounds 804, writes Andrew Bolger.
That 0.37 per cent increase brings his salary to Pounds 217,616 for 1992, a
year in which pre-tax profits increased by 18 per cent to breach the Pounds
1bn barrier for the first time.
Mr Alan Jackson, the chief executive who successfully integrated Hawker
Siddeley, received a more substantial increase of Pounds 18,504 to Pounds
272,590, a rise of 7.2 per cent.
Sir Owen, 68, uses his last report to shareholders to get in another dig at
the Cadbury report on corporate governance, which he has dismissed as
'wishy-washy'. He has been sceptical of Cadbury's emphasis on the importance
of non-executive directors and failure to outlaw practices such as combining
the role of chairman and chief executive.
The annual report states: 'The introduction of a code bearing on this one
facet of the corporate crystal, however well-intentioned, cannot ensure
integrity or competence - the twin towers of an enduring business structure.
Caveat investor.'

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitive EIS seeks Pounds 24m to rebuild
cash balances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIS, the specialist engineering company, yesterday tapped shareholders for
Pounds 24.4m through a 1-for-5 rights issue designed to rebuild cash
balances for a fresh round of acquisitions.
The company also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.2m to
Pounds 15.1m for the 12 months to end-December on the back of a 6 per cent
rise in sales to Pounds 202m.
Earnings per share fell to 27.26p (28.24p). A final dividend of 8.775p makes
a 12p (11.7p) total.
The rights issue - underwritten by SG Warburg at 340p - comes less than two
years after EIS last went to shareholders at a price of 265p.
The company's share price closed down 25p yesterday at 388p.
Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the group found it was a distinct
advantage to negotiate with potential sellers of companies when they could
see EIS had cash with which to pay for the purchase.
COMMENT
EIS has enjoyed a reputation for conservatism and acquiring wisely. There
is, however, a limit to the amount shareholders will want to stump up
without seeing the benefit in earnings growth. Spending the proceeds of the
latest rights quickly will avoid too much dilution this year, but the group
is clearly going to need to look at bigger fish if its next acquisitions are
to justify management effort and make an imprint on profits. As most of the
recent purchases have been of small loss-making companies, EIS might
therefore be moving into riskier territory. On the other hand, the group is
now well positioned to pick up any specialist engineers that stumble as they
emerge from recession. With profits expected to rise to about Pounds 16m
this year, or 27p of earnings, the group is on a sub-market prospective
multiple of about 14  - a correct level until investors catch sight of EIS's
shopping list.

Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the group found it was a distinct
advantage to negotiate with potential sellers of companies when they could
see EIS had cash with which to pay for the purchase.
The funds would be used to take advantage of the difficulties that a number
of companies had experienced in EIS's core areas of process equipment,
aircraft and precision engineering and fluid seals and couplings.
Mr Haslehurst said the group would continue growing organically and through
the acquisition of businesses making products at the top end of the quality
spectrum.
At the end of March, its cash had fallen to Pounds 3m, down from Pounds 7m
at the end of the previous year because a number of its acquisitions during
the year had required injections of working capital.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Overseas boost for Bodycote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODYCOTE International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group,
reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits on the back of increased
overseas earnings for the year to December 31.
Profits rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 13.6m on sales of Pounds 80.3m
(Pounds 66.5m).
Mr Joe Dwek, chairman and joint managing director, said: 'Given the
difficult trading conditions in the UK the growing level of overseas profits
has been particularly valuable.'
The shares rose 20p to 584p.
Overseas profits increased more than 70 per cent to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3m)
while UK profits sliped to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.5m).
Overall operating profit rose to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.5m).
The overseas increase partly reflected last year's acquisition of Industrial
Materials Technology, which has two plants in the US, and IMT Europe, based
in Belgium, from National Forge Company of Delaware.
The metal technology division, which accounts for 65 per cent of group
profits, increased its contribution from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 9.2m. It is
expected to continue to be the main source of future growth with further
acquisitions.
Over the last five years Pounds 42m has been invested in capital equipment,
of which Pounds 9.5m was incurred last year.
Earnings rose to 31.7p (27.8p). A final dividend of 6.25p makes a 10p
(9.25p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: St Ives edges ahead to Pounds 10.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, withstood the recession by
reporting a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to
January 29.
Profits rose from Pounds 10.1m in the comparable half year to Pounds 10.5m,
on reduced sales of Pounds 108m (Pounds 109m).
Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said he was looking to make a takeover either in
the UK or on the Continent.
'Its not a high urgency and we have to be very careful since a bad
acquisition can spoil a company. But we are looking at a number of
companies.'
He expects that an upturn in his company's markets is on the way and
believes it will make 'reasonable progress' next year.
Despite the adverse effect of the translation of St Ives' US borrowings, as
the pound depreciated against the dollar, it ended the half year with a cash
balance of Pounds 13.6m.
Interest receivable increased from Pounds 973,000 to Pounds 1.4m while
interest payable fell from Pounds 810,000 to Pounds 714,000.
The US subsidiary reversed from a Pounds 278,000 first-half loss to a Pounds
304,000 profit.
The main UK division reported a fall in profit before interest, from Pounds
10m to Pounds 8.8m, while the rest of the world saw profits rise from Pounds
157,000 to Pounds 701,000.
Overall operating profit fell marginally from Pounds 9.96m to Pounds 9.86m.
The company has won the printing contract for the forthcoming sale of the UK
government's shares in BT.
As a result of the increase in the effective rate of tax, earnings per share
were slightly reduced from 7.3p to 7.2p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
COMMENT
St Ives' decision to spend Pounds 130m over the past four years on some of
the most advanced printing presses in the world looks to have been a wise
one. Its high operational gearing should allow it to benefit very quickly
from the expected upturn. The printing presses are now running at almost 80
per cent of their capacity and should shortly run at full speed if the
industry makes a complete recovery. With net cash of more than Pounds 13m
and a high rating it should be able to pull off its long-awaited
acquisition. If this is in the expected price range of Pounds 30m to Pounds
50m it will not dilute earnings. With forecast full year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 22.2m, the shares - down 6p yesterday at 337p - are on a
prospective multiple of 22. The expected recovery is well reflected in its
rating.

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Miller Group, one of the UK's biggest privately-owned
construction companies, recovered in 1992 to Pounds 3.5m after falling to
Pounds 500,000 in 1991.
Profit before exceptional items was Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 7m). The Edinburgh
based company provided Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 6.4m) to cover write-downs in the
value of property and building land.
During the year gearing was reduced from 33 per cent to just 4 per cent, and
the order book increased by 20 per cent.
In 1992 Mr James Miller, chairman, stepped down as chief executive of the
family-owned group. A new management structure was established with Mr David
Cawthra coming in as chief executive. Mr Cawthra was formerly chief
executive of Balfour Beatty.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Huntleigh doubles to Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTLEIGH Technology, the maker of pneumatic hospital mattresses that
relieve bed sores, yesterday reported a doubling of profits and an even
larger increase in earnings.
Helped by rapid growth in its new ultrasonic blood pressure gauge, pre-tax
profits advanced from Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 5.54m on sales up 35 per cent
at Pounds 28.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 17.35p to 40.12p and the recommended final
dividend is 6p, giving a total for the year of 10p (4.5p).
A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed to increase the marketability of the
shares which yesterday rose 95p to close at Pounds 10.70p, up from 413p a
year ago.
Huntleigh is today awarded the Queen's Award for technological achievement
for its Dopplex blood pressure diagnostic work.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the group had reached an agreement with
Slumberland to develop and distribute therapeutic mattresses to hospitals.
That would extend its own range of mattresses that prevent bed sores in
lower risk patients, a move which will bring the group's products to a
larger market.
Huntleigh is also entering a joint venture with one of its sub-contractors
in the US to manufacture its products. The US currently accounts for 40 per
cent of its sales. Mr Schild said some large customers, like the Veterans
Administration, had a strong preference for buying from US companies.
He added that the company would also invest some of its cash this year to
double production capacity.
Net cash at the period end amounted to some Pounds 2.3m.
During the year Huntleigh expanded the rental depots in the UK, Germany and
the US from which it distributes its own products.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: New drugs help SB rise 12% to Pounds 306m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the first quarter to March 31 ahead
by 12 per cent from Pounds 272m to Pounds 306m, on sales 26 per cent greater
at Pounds 1.52bn, compared with Pounds 1.21bn.
The results were aided by currencies. At comparable exchange rates, sales
were up 11 per cent and pre-tax profits 10 per cent. The company said
profits were less affected by currency because of hedging policy. Earnings
per share were up 14 per cent from 6.6p to 7.5p.
Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, said: 'We have had four years of substantial
growth. SB is on the right track for ongoing growth.
'Controlling healthcare costs is a priority, but government leaders should
understand that medicines, which account for less than 10 per cent of total
medical costs in most countries, dramatically lower costs by maintaining
health and limiting the need for far more expensive surgery and
hospitalisation,' he said.
In Europe, pharmaceuticals sales only grew by 3 per cent. Legislation in
Italy and Germany cut sales by 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. In
the UK and France they rose 10 per cent and 19 per cent.
The pharmaceuticals division's turnover rose 32 per cent from Pounds 674m to
Pounds 886m while trading profits increased 14 per cent from Pounds 215m to
Pounds 245m. Performance was helped by US sales up by 25 per cent.
Drugs sales were also helped by new products which had not come on stream
fully for the same period last year.
Sales of new products were Pounds 95m, compared with Pounds 212m for all of
1992. These included Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as Paxil in the US,
Relafen, an anti-arthritic, Kytril, an anti-nausea and vomiting treatment,
and Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine.
Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic increased 22 per cent to Pounds 212m,
following a weak first quarter last year.
Sales of Tagamet, an anti-ulcer compound and traditionally the company's
best-selling drug, fell 22 per cent against an unusually strong first
quarter in 1992. The medicine comes off patent next month in the US, its
largest market.
Consumer brands, which include Lucazade and Ribena, generated turnover up 10
per cent from Pounds 322m to Pounds 355m, while operating profits fell 14
per cent from Pounds 43m to Pounds 37m.
The first quarter dividend is 2.533p per share and 4.896 cents per equity
unit.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: CWS knocked by interest charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESCUE of a struggling regional co-operative and a 'tough' trading
climate pushed profits at Co-operative Wholesale Society, the UK's biggest
farmer and a significant force in retailing, down 63 per cent last year.
The CWS is the main supplier for the whole co-operative movement and is now
the largest co-operative retailer, as well as having interests in food
manufacturing and milk distribution, travel, and funeral services.
Profits after exceptional items and interest for the year to January 9 fell
from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 5m, in spite of an increase in total turnover
from Pounds 3.14bn to Pounds 3.25bn, with a rise in retail sales from Pounds
2.61bn to Pounds 2.83bn.
While trading profit rose slightly to Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 51.7m), and the
Pounds 12.7m of exceptional items - to cover continuing redundancy and
rationalisation and provisions against property development work in progress
 -were little changed from last year's Pounds 12.6m, interest charges rose
from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 34.5m.
This stemmed largely from increased borrowings after the CWS stepped in to
rescue the Greater Nottingham Society, which acquired the loss-making ELS
furniture chain, which later went into receivership.
The CWS agreed to merge with the society, and inherited debts and winding-up
costs for ELS of more than Pounds 100m.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo ex-chief's pay up 40% but directors
to take 5% cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO executive directors will take a 5 per cent pay cut this year, the oil
exploration company said yesterday.
The announcement followed the annual report's publication showing that Mr
Chris Greentree, former chief executive, saw his remuneration package
increase by 40 per cent last year to Pounds 480,647.
Lasmo is struggling under a debt burden which pushed gearing to 111 per
cent. This will drop back to 88 per cent when proceeds of a package of asset
sales are received.
Last year the company incurred a loss of Pounds 385m and cut its dividend,
but Mr Greentree received a Pounds 50,000 performance-related pay bonus.
Lasmo said yesterday that its current chief executive Mr Joe Darby, would
receive a salary of about Pounds 200,000, half that of Mr Greentree.
Mr Greentree is still negotiating his severance package.
Lasmo has also proposed issuing Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) of cumulative
preference shares in the US and up to Dollars 250m of long-term fixed rate
debt securities or Yankee bonds. The company said it would count the
perpetual preference shares as equity and expected the share sale to reduce
its gearing by 20 percentage points to 68 per cent.
Some analysts, however, do not take the preference shares as equity. The
issuing of bonds would extend the life of the company's debt as well as
giving it more exposure to US investors.
Other annual reports issued yesterday showed that Mr Tom Farmer, chairman of
Kwik-Fit Holdings, had his pay reduced from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 234,000
as pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 32m to Pounds 17m.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, picked up a little more at
Pounds 218,000 (Pounds 193,000) but Mr Neville Bain, chief executive,
received less at Pounds 352,000, including Pounds 17,000 performance-related
incentive payments, compared with Pounds 381,000. Coats Viyella pre-tax
profits for 1992 were Pounds 109m, against Pounds 111m published, and Pounds
97m restated.

FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Excalibur gets bid approach
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Excalibur, the jewellery and engineering group, has received an approach
which 'may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company'. The
group's shares have risen from a low of 8 1/2 p this year to 17 1/2 p, up 2p
yesterday. The rise prompted the announcement.
The group said it could make no further comment. The identity of the
possible bidder was not disclosed.
In January it announced an interim loss of Pounds 183,000 as its jewellery
business was hit by problems in the retail trade. It halved its interim
dividend.
A number of investors have come into the group recently. Three directors
bought 2.8m shares last September at 8p each, taking their holdings to
nearly 13 per cent. And Suter, Mr David Abell's mini-conglomerate, recently
bought a 6 per cent stake.

FT  21 APR 93 / BP sees Pounds 100m in annual profit from new Colombian
oilfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and DEBORAH HARGREAVES

<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum expects to produce 150,000 barrels of oil a day from its
important Colombian oil finds - which could add Pounds 100m a year to the
company's profits by the end of the decade.
City analysts agree with BP, however, that lack of pipeline capacity could
hinder production increases and profit potential of the 2bn barrel oilfield.
Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett, the London stockbrokers,
estimated that if production was able to reach 500,000 barrels per day, as
would be expected from an oilfield of this size, the contribution to BP's
pre-tax profits would be Dollars 525m (Pounds 348m) a year.
In the company's first detailed briefing this week on the Cusiana and
Cupiaga finds in the Andean foothills of eastern Colombia, Mr David Harding,
chief executive for Latin America, said the oilfield was 'very significant
for BP and we're optimistic'.
The size of the oilfield, which BP confirmed was at least 2bn barrels,
increases the group's worldwide oil reserves by 5 per cent.
Mr Tony Hayward, exploration manager for BP Colombia said the company was
very pleased with its appraisal of the Cusiana field although the latest
well to be drilled was dry, which showed that the field did not extend as
far south as had been hoped.
Piedemonte, a new field to the north of the two finds, is being explored in
the hope that the oil-bearing rock structure extends further.
Mr Richard Campbell, president of BP Colombia, said BP would soon agree a
development plan and financing with its partners for phase 1 of the project.
Ecopetrol, the state oil company, will take a 50 per cent share in the
discovery as part of Colombian law, leaving BP with a 19 per cent stake,
French oil group Total with 19 per cent and Triton, the US oil company, with
12 per cent.
The partners will invest Dollars 1.1bn in building a pipeline and upgrading
an existing line to transport the oil in order to reach production of
150,000 b/d by 1995. BP will pay Dollars 200m of this overall investment.
BP officials refused to put a figure on the level of production that will be
reached in phase 2 later in the decade, but pointed out that Ecopetrol has
estimated 800,000 b/d.

FT  21 APR 93 / Mutual sacrifice puts new thinking into boardrooms /
Analysis of the deal which could set a trend in the search for capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S deal between Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life
insurance company, and Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, could set a trend.
As competitive pressures in the overpopulated UK life insurance market
intensify, many more small and medium-sized mutually-owned life insurance
groups may follow in the footsteps of Scottish Equitable, sacrificing or
watering down their mutual status to attract fresh capital.
And more European companies could find a link-up with a mutual a
cost-effective route for expansion.
'For anyone who wants to get into the UK life sector it looks as though the
easiest way could be through a similar transaction,' says Mr Tim Dawson,
European insurance analyst with Lehman Brothers, the securities house.
French, Swiss, Italian and German groups all come to mind as potential
buyers, he says.
Scottish Equitable is not the only UK life insurance company short of
capital. Industry analysts expect the search for capital is likely to prompt
significant mergers and acquisitions in the next few years in an industry
which already has more competitors than demand.
Indeed, competitive pressures are partly to blame for the mutuals' capital
shortage. For marketing reasons, mutuals companies, who historically have
specialised in so-called with-profits business - in which companies 'smooth'
investment returns over a period of years - have been distributing more in
assets than they have been earning on investments, according to Mr Geoffrey
Westall, European manager at actuarial consultants Tillinghast. 'They are
eating into their free reserves,' he said.
'It is almost certainly the case that a large number of mutuals will
demutualise within a few years,' said Mr Peter Hoy, partner at accountants
Price Waterhouse, specialising in the life insurance industry. Scottish
Equitable, with nearly Pounds 6bn in assets under management, thus becomes
the largest of the British mutuals to have succumbed to a stronger partner
so far.
The irony about SE's search for capital is that it has become particularly
necessary because of the company's success in ploughing a narrow furrow in
the insurance market. The company is the fourth or fifth largest pensions
provider in the UK, and dominates pensions sold through independent
financial advisers. By concentrating on the upper end of the IFA market, SE
has played to the executive pensions and personal pensions sectors which
have proven most profitable in the industry.
In 1992, the company's new total premium income grew by 15.5 per cent to
Pounds 1.004bn, up from Pounds 869m in 1991. Total assets under management
grew to more than Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.6bn in 1991.
But success has its price and that price is capital. 'We couldn't have
continued to grow at our current rate if we didn't have additional capital,'
is the blunt explanation of Mr David Berridge, SE's group chief executive.
The company's free asset ratio - the estimate of assets over liabilities
calculated for regulatory purposes - was 10 per cent at the end of 1992,
down from 11 per cent the year before, a level considered uncomfortably
close to the minimum 4 per cent margin required by regulators.
In many ways Aegon is an ideal suitor. A creation of a merger between a
mutual, AGO, and shareholder-owned Ennia in 1983, Aegon is one of a handful
of European mutuals which have modified their own structure to attract
capital. Mapfre, the largest Spanish insurer, and Axa, the French group,
which in 1991 invested more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the US life
insurer, The Equitable, when that company demutualised in 1991, are the two
most notable examples.
More importantly Aegon has the resources available for expansion.
Under the leadership of its chairman, Mr Jaap Peters, who is retiring, the
company's decision to focus its business more heavily on less volatile and
more profitable life insurance has been highly successful. Premiums from
life insurance now account for 64 per cent of premium income, compared with
just more than 50 per cent in 1983, and generated more than three quarters
of the group's profits in 1992. Income amounted to Fl 15.3bn (Pounds 5.52bn)
in 1992, with profits - before realised gains - rising to Fl 785m.
Mr Bob Yates of brokers Fox-Pitt Kelton estimates the company has more than
Fl 2bn for expansion and says the group is constantly seeking to add to its
network of subsidiaries.
Recent acquisitions have been guided by the aim of building sizeable shares
of well-defined market segments, an approach which contrasts with the 'all
products for all customers' philosophy favoured by some of its rivals but
which fits in neatly with the thinking of Scottish Equitable.

FT  21 APR 93 / Dutch insurer invests Pounds 240m in Scottish Equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGON, the Dutch-based insurance group, has invested Pounds 240m in Scottish
Equitable Life Assurance Society in a move which will give it effective
control of the policyholder-owned company and provide it with badly-needed
capital.
Scottish Equitable is the largest company to 'demutualise' through an
acquisition. Industry analysts have predicted demutualisation will
accelerate as policyholder-owned companies seek capital for expansion.
Scottish Equitable said it sought a partner because it could not sustain
growth without more capital. As a mutual, its only capital is the reserves
of its policyholders. The transaction gives Aegon, one of Europe's largest
insurance companies, access to one of the UK's top life insurance and
pensions franchises.
'It's creeping demutualisation,' said Mr Bob Yates, analyst with
stockbrokers Fox-Pitt Kelton.
The deal involves an unusual structure which will allow Scottish Equitable
to maintain some of the characteristics of a mutual company, one of the key
stumbling blocks for other companies considering similar moves. The two
companies will set up a new company to be named Scottish Equitable Plc and
Scottish Equitable will transfer all its existing business to it.
The deal is dependent on the approval of with-profits policyholders,
insurance regulators and the UK courts.
Premium payments and investment returns of all current and future
with-profits policies will be insulated in a pool, and profits from this
pool will be owned solely by policyholders. This pool will receive Pounds
200m from Aegon and some of this will be distributed as a one-off bonus,
estimated at 40 per cent of one year's bonus payment, to policyholders.
Other unit-linked business - the fastest growing portion of Scottish
Equitable's business - will be contained in a separate pool whose profits
will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profits policyholders and 40 per cent
owned by Aegon. Aegon will inject Pounds 40m in capital to this business.
Aegon can increase its share of profits to 50.1 per cent with additional
injections of capital by 1999.
The interests of the with-profits policyholders are protected through a
voting trust which will appoint directors to the new company.

FT  21 APR 93 / Hammerson declines 44 per cent to Pounds 31.1m: Sydney Mason
to be replaced as chairman in June by Geoffrey Maitland Smith from Sears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMMERSON yesterday underlined the breadth and severity of the international
property downturn when it announced a 30 per cent decline in its net asset
value per share to Pounds 4.45 for 1992 and a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 31.1m.
The company also announced that Mr Sydney Mason, its 72-year old chairman,
would be replaced by Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, the chairman of Sears, when
he retires in June.
Mr John Parry, managing director, who is also retiring in June, will be
replaced by Mr Ronald Spinney, a former deputy chairman of Greycoat, the
developer.
The shares fell by 23p to 331p after the worse-than-expected results,
although there was some relief that the uncertainty about the group's
management succession had been resolved.
Mr Mason said that the property downturn was the most severe, lengthy and
widespread he had known. He said that continuing lack of tenant demand and
the over-supply of accommodation was compounded by the failure of several
large property companies in the UK and Canada, the group's most important
markets, which had further damaged confidence. However, there were faint
signs of an improvement, albeit modest, in some markets, he said.
Property values were worst hit in Canada and France, where they fell by 27
per cent and 22 per cent respectively. Overall, the portfolio's value fell
by 19 per cent, which contributed to a decline in shareholders' funds from
Pounds 1.06bn to Pounds 742.3m.
Gearing increased from 78 per cent to 114 per cent, while net borrowings
increased by Pounds 21m to Pounds 845m, partly as a result of the weakness
of sterling which increased the translation of foreign currency debt by over
Pounds 90m at the year end. Property disposals realised Pounds 188m.
Net rental income rose by 11 per cent from Pounds 114.2m to Pounds 126.2m.
Operating profit fell 20 per cent to Pounds 44.3m.
Hammerson said its development programme was virtually complete; its capital
commitments were just Pounds 24m at the year end.
Earnings per share fell by 51 per cent to 11p (from 22.5p). As signalled at
the interim statement in October, a final dividend of 6.5p was recommended,
compared with 17p a year ago. That made a total dividend of 10p for the
year, down from 20.5p a year earlier.

FT  21 APR 93 / IBM reports loss of Dollars 285m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday reported a Dollars 285m (Pounds
188m) first-quarter loss, providing little hope for a short-term recovery by
the world's largest computer company. Its losses were almost Dollars 5bn
last year, its worst ever.
IBM said European sales dropped sharply in the first quarter, by almost 14
per cent, with 3 per cent declines in the US and Asia. World-wide sales of
IBM's core mainframe computer products were down by a 'high double-digit per
cent'.
One bright spot was a 48 per cent increase in service revenues, which rose
to Dollars 1.9bn.
Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who joined from
RJR Nabisco on April 1, said the results 'reflect weak demand and continued
competitive pressures in many of our hardware product lines, particularly
mainframe computers and large disk drives'.
Overall, revenues declined to Dollars 13.1bn from Dollars 14bn while losses
per share were 50 cents, in line with Wall Street's expectations.
In the first quarter of 1992, IBM posted net earnings of Dollars 2.5bn,
including a gain of Dollars 1.9bn from the adoption of a new tax accounting
standard. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.12, or Dollars 4.45 including
the one-time gain. Gross profit margins fell to 39.5 per cent, down from
50.8 per cent in the first quarter last year.
IBM said it would continue to 'aggressively seek ways to improve the
company's profitability,' but Mr Gerstner had no comment on what form these
actions might take. In his first public appearance since taking over at IBM,
Mr Gerstner will address the company's annual meeting in Florida next week.
IBM said operating expenses declined by 8.9 per cent in the first quarter to
Dollars 5.4bn, and expenses were expected to continue to decline as the
company reduced its workforce. It has said it would eliminate 25,000 jobs
this year.
The group personal computers achieved profitability. Sales of computer
workstations also grew strongly. However, total hardware sales fell to
Dollars 5.7bn, against Dollars 7.1bn. Rental and financing revenues, driven
by mainframe computer installations, were down 12 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn,
while maintenance services fell by 5 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Branch Davidian cult survivors of the fire which destroyed their
compound in Waco, Texas, are led away under arrest yesterday. US president
Bill Clinton said he did not intend to ask attorney general Janet Reno to
resign over the disastrous ending to the 51-day siege. He said he accepted
full responsibility for the events which culminated in the deaths of about
80 members of the religious cult when the FBI advanced on their stronghold.

FT  21 APR 93 / Acas angry over plan to make users pay for services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACAS, the arbitration and conciliation service, yesterday accused the
government of threatening its independence by introducing new powers that
could force it to charge users.
A clause added by the government to the employment bill, which is going
through the House of Lords, means that Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment
secretary, would have reserve powers to make Acas charge for its arbitration
and conciliation between employers and employees.
The idea of charging for Acas's activities came out of a Department of
Employment review last year into how the service could save money. The
annual budget of Pounds 19m is under strain because the recession has driven
up Acas's workload.
For the second successive year, Acas handled a record number of cases last
year, with inquiries rising to almost half a million. The steepest rises
have been in sex discrimination claims which have increased nearly threefold
in two years.
Other areas of Acas's activities are also being modified by the employment
bill. The existing statutory obligation for the service to promote
collective bargaining is being scrapped and, as part of the economy drive, a
specialised work research unit is being dismantled.
In its annual report, published yesterday, Acas said Mrs Shephard's reserve
power on charging 'could well be regarded as a continuing threat to seek to
influence or govern the ways in which . . . the service exercises any, or
all, of its statutory duties'.
Acas's ruling council has written to Mrs Shephard protesting strongly about
the new powers. It said its concerns 'were not eased by being told that the
secretary of state had no current plans to exercise such a power'.
Mr John Hougham, Acas chairman and former Ford UK head of employee
relations, said there was already consideration being given to charging for
some publications and conferences.
However, he said any suggestion that arbitration or conciliation should be
charged for 'begins to get extremely close to challenging Acas's
independence and would severely affect the way in which parties coming to us
in all the areas of our work would regard the service'.
Charges would make the service less accessible to employees and, because
employers would generally end up paying any costs, the objectivity of Acas
'would be called into question'.
The Department of Employment said Mrs Shephard's proposed new powers were
'purely precautionary' and did not end Acas's independence. The new law
would also require the employment secretary to consult Acas's council before
any charges were introduced.

FT  21 APR 93 / Clashes erupt ahead of Russia's referendum: Vice-president
Rutskoi states presidential ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN ahead of Russia's referendum on Sunday grew more bitter
yesterday as the parliamentary speaker claimed President Boris Yeltsin would
win only by cheating and vice-president Alexander Rutskoi declared his
willingness to take on the presidency.
Mr Yeltsin's supporters countered that 'aggressive opposition', amounting at
times to physical intimidation, had been reported in some regions, while the
pro-Yeltsin head of the Penza region had been falsely arrested and his
family terrorised by police.
Charges and counter charges of corruption and skulduggery are flying between
the two camps.
The charge by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, that the
president would trick his way to victory was coupled with the accusation
that the president was 'under the control of criminal elements'.
However, according to the news agency Interfax, Mr Khasbulatov appeared to
concede victory to Mr Yeltsin - though it was unclear on what terms.
Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, was also cautiously
optimistic that Mr Yeltsin would win popular support for a key question of
the referendum - that of trust in himself.
However, Mr Filatov complained that 64 per cent of the local councils
involved in organising the referendum had a 'hostile position' to the
president.
Mr Filatov also noted that even if as many as 70 per cent of voters turned
out - a figure which government polls suggest might be possible  - it would
be highly unlikely that a majority of the total electorate would vote for
the president, as parliament has demanded.
The four questions on the referendum paper are:
Trust in the president.
Support for his economic and social policies.
Early elections to a restructured parliament.
Early presidential elections.
Mr Yeltsin has said he would define losing in the referendum as a No vote on
trust and on early parliamentary elections.
Meanwhile, General Rutskoi said he would put himself forward as a
presidential candidate if Mr Yeltsin was forced to resign through losing the
referendum. He said: 'I want only one thing - to stop this corrupt and
criminal chaos which is called reform.'
Avoiding direct criticism of Mr Yeltsin, he said: 'I have one complaint
about the president - he has fallen under the influence of his entourage
(which) . . . is immoral and remote from the problems of our society.'
Gen Rutskoi would automatically take over the presidency if Mr Yeltsin
resigned - as he has said he will if the referendum is not in his favour -
but this represents the first time he has stated his presidential ambitions.
Mr Yeltsin, meanwhile, vigorously defended his policy of using foreign
assistance to help economic reforms by attacking those who said he should be
ashamed to be begging.
'Those who say we have become a beggar do not know our own strength and the
power of our people. Russia is a rich society - we are really rich but in
our history we have not been able to handle our richness in a civilised
way,' he said.

FT  21 APR 93 / Electrical workers' union votes to join TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union have voted
overwhelmingly to belong to the TUC. The move comes five years after the
EETPU electricians' union, now a section of the AEEU, was expelled from the
TUC for defying its rules.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU, described the vote as 'the
biggest vote of confidence the trade union movement has ever had'.
The postal ballot was called because of the merger last May of the AEU
engineering union, which was affiliated to the TUC, and the EETPU to form
Britain's second largest union. Although the new union's engineering section
is affiliated to the TUC, the union as a whole is not.
In a postal ballot, 37 per cent of the 839,250 members voted with 283,956
(91.7 cent) approving TUC affiliation and 25,619 voting against (8.3 per
cent).
The turnout was higher than the 30 per cent or less usually achieved through
postal ballots in trade unions.
The EETPU was seen as a rightwing maverick union in constant conflict with
other unions which disliked its aggressive but successful policies that
pioneered single union agreements and no strike deals.
The AEEU is expected to join the TUC in September, but the final terms still
have to be negotiated and must be approved by three quarters of the AEEU's
executive council.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers
union, welcomed the AEEU ballot result yesterday because it would 'help to
consolidate the unity of the labour movement'.
He said he firmly believed that 'any difficulties' between the unions which
remained could 'now be sorted out within the commonly accepted structures of
the TUC'.

It would be unwise to get carried away by the apparent success of recent
flotations. The Stock Exchange's combined placings and offers for sale
system lends itself to a little hyperbole. Yesterday the announcement of
Stagecoach's flotation focused on an oversubscription of 7.9 times. Well,
not quite. It is true that the 11.05m shares on offer to the public
attracted applications for 86.8m shares - a subscription of 7.9 times or an
over-subscription of 6.9 times. But that ignores the 21.8m shares placed
with institutions and the 1.2m shares reserved for directors et al. When
they are addded back, the total offer was subscribed 2.6 times and
oversubscribed only 1.6 times.

The exploratory chat between the UK and US governments over liberalisation
of their bilateral aviation agreement produced much tough talk. But given
the industry's highly-politicised nature, consumers should not start
planning for bargain flights across the Atlantic just yet.
In framing its position, the UK government will doubtless listen carefully
to the views of British Airways. But BA faces a tricky calculation as to
whether it stands to gain more from greater access to the US market than it
would lose from higher US penetration at Heathrow. Large concessions from
the UK government may also infuriate investors. Many bought shares in BA on
the basis of its privatisation prospectus which suggested few changes to the
regulatory regime. It would be ironic indeed if BA's American shareholders,
who account for more than a quarter of the company's equity, were to sue the
UK government for giving US carriers more landing slots at Heathrow.

FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Hammerson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The brightest gloss that can be placed on Hammerson's dismal results is that
the property cycle is probably approaching its nadir. The company's net
asset value and earnings per share have now fallen below those of a decade
ago. Despite continuing weakness in international property markets, it is
hard to see Hammerson slipping much further from here.
The stock market certainly called the turn for the sector following Black
Wednesday. The question is how soon growth can be resumed. On this score,
the rise in Hammerson's gearing from 78 per cent to 114 per cent is
unnerving. The 51 per cent fall in earnings per share meant that even the
cut dividend was barely covered. Like several other property companies,
Hammerson is relying on sales of high-yielding assets to fund its pay-out.
Last year, Hammerson realised Pounds 188m from disposals; more than Pounds
100m is promised this year too. The trouble is this only worsens Hammerson's
operating cash flow, making it hard to spruce up properties and, eventually,
replace its portfolio. A rights issue is the obvious route out of the
dilemma.
While the new directors prepare their case, Hammerson will be vulnerable
should the much-rumoured bid materialise - although shareholders cannot pray
for anything approaching Rodamco's offer of almost Pounds 10 per share just
four years ago. Takeover talk, though, would help support the share price,
and it might even enable Hammerson to get the issue away at a less painful
discount.

March's record public sector borrowing - Pounds 11bn excluding privatisation
receipts - is a truly heroic effort. A decade ago, such a total for the year
as a whole would have been a disaster. Yesterday the gilt market barely
blinked. Such insouciance will only be justified if March turns out to be a
one-off. Cash limits encourage departments to spend unused cash before the
financial year-end. In 1992-93, buying from outside contractors may have
proved more cost-effective than expected, leaving more cash looking for a
home. But if so, why did the chancellor have no inkling of it when he
delivered a much lower estimate in the Budget five weeks ago?
Until now, the markets have assumed that the chancellor's prediction of a
Pounds 50bn budget deficit for 1993-94 was deliberately pessimistic. That
may prove a false expectation. The overshoot last year also means that the
Treasury has pre-funded less of this year's borrowings than first thought.
While the government will doubtless get the debt away, it cannot afford
attacks of nerves if it is to sell gilts at current yields. Its prospects
are not improved by the Bank of England opportunistically auctioning stock
at any maturity. Issues aimed at the banks, and a tough spending round, will
be more persuasive.

Aegon's Pounds 240m investment in Scottish Equitable gives it cheap access
to the UK life assurance market while neatly side-stepping the lengthy
process of demutualisation. The Scots get an overdue injection of capital
without surrendering control - or the valuable with-profits fund, which
retains its mutual status within the new company. That structure will
doubtless appeal to other cash-strapped mutual life offices. UK banks and
building societies are most likely to be copycat suitors. With conditions
tough in continental Europe, other insurers may not be feeling expansive
and, in any event, most mutuals need new channels of distribution as much as
capital, so UK-based partners are more attractive.
Whether Aegon is paying a fair price remains an open question. Since the
with-profits fund is ring-fenced, it is buying only an interest in the
unit-linked portion of the business. Yet both sides are coy about value
embedded in that fund and past profits. A similar deal between public
companies would surely demand a higher standard of disclosure. Scottish
Equitable policyholders are being asked to take a lot on trust.
Aegon shareholders might also doubt the wisdom of committing funds to UK
life assurance just as banks and building societies are moving in. That
inflow of capital must surely lead to diminishing returns. Without the
support of Aegon, Scottish Equitable would have to abandon the dizzy pace of
growth seen in recent years. Others must now find partners or face a
squeeze. The evidence suggests no shortage of backers willing to take an
optimistic view.

It's doubtful whether all members of the Society of Practitioners of

Price Waterhouse's Mark Homan, in justifying their need to prosper from
others' failures. 'We're like Blackpool landladies. We have to make our
money in the season,' he said.
But the simile should at least be preferable to Labour MP Austin Mitchell's
likening of accountants to prostitutes marketing their wares  - with one
important difference. 'If they kill you, prostitutes don't act as the

What could almost be called an official attempt to put the VAT among the
pigeons is being contested by lone Lancastrian Martin Gartside, watched by
beady eyes across the UK. Unless he wins his appeal against the tax order
Oldham's local council has slapped on his pigeon loft, his fellow fanciers
could face similar bills nationwide.
The council, for which he works when not serving as secretary of the Border
Amalgamation of Racing Pigeon Societies, claims the tax is due because the
loft is half a mile from his home.
He argues that the loft's inhabitants are properly classed as poultry, and
so exempt from the tax. If he didn't prefer to race them, he could kill them
and eat them, he says.
It remains to be seen whether he is counting his chickens before they are
hatched. Although the tribunal hearing the appeal has reached a reserved
verdict, no date has been set for the judgment to be handed down.

There are just too few babies in Japan. Seiroku Kajiyama, secretary-general
of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, says so. And furthermore that is the
prime reason for the faltering competitiveness of the country.
One of a family of 10, Kajiyama told a seminar of female LDP supporters that
large families foster a competitive spirit. 'You don't need to have as many
as 10, three to five would do,' he said, explaining that the stampede for
food at the dinner table encourages the survival instinct.
Some senior LDP officials seem to be obsessed with the fact that women are
choosing to have longer careers and fewer children, leaving Japan with a
birth rate of 9.8 per 1,000 last year, the lowest recorded. The figure
prompted Kajiyama to compare modern Japan to failed socialist societies,
which he thinks lacked the fierce entrepreneurial spirit that big families
inspire.
Kajiyama's homespun theory is a contribution to the debate over the rise of
the shinjinrui, the 'new type of people' - those who, unlike their
forebears, are willing to take holidays, swap jobs and generally enjoy
themselves. The very people, indeed, who would have the time to produce the
babies he is so keen to see.

So what did jovial Wim Duisenberg, outgoing chairman of the European central
bank governors' committee, say when asked in Basle about the likely home of
the new European Monetary Institute, due to be set up next year?
First, that he, the Dutch central bank governor, knew of a most suitable
building in Amsterdam. Second, that it 'does not contain any marble'.

When was the last time there was a really inspired choice of chairman of one
of Britain's blue chip companies?
Take yesterday's clutch of announcements. Sir Christopher Benson, the
property developer, is going to be the chairman of Sun Alliance, Geoffrey
Maitland Smith gets Hammerson Property and Thorn EMI boss Sir Colin
Southgate inherits PowerGen.
Where, however, are all the new faces? Sir Christopher is a chartered
surveyor who has spent most of his life with MEPC, which is scarcely one of
the great success stories of the property world.
Much the same applies to Sears, the retailer, where Maitland Smith has been
chairman since 1985. As for Sir Colin Southgate, now he has his seat on the
Bank of England court, he must already have a great many demands upon his
time.
At least Sir Graham Day, PowerGen's outgoing chairman was different. Bearded
and from Canada, he has a reputation for knocking heads together.
Just imagine the excitement if the chairmanship of one of Britain's
insurance companies or clearing banks was passed on to a hot-shot retailer
like Argyll's Sir Alastair Grant or a successful industrialist like BTR's
Sir Owen Green.
Instead, it often seems that - in the City at any rate - top jobs keep on
being handed out to the same type of people, who then hang on to them. The
chairman of General Accident has been a director for more than 30 years and
the chairmen of GRE, Commercial Union and Sun Alliance has each been a
director of his respective organisation for more than 20 years.
Many such organisations would surely benefit from an infusion of fresh
blood. But perhaps the really successful businessmen capable of providing it
are too busy already.

FT  21 APR 93 / Still on the path to peace: The ANC has turned South
Africa's latest crisis to its advantage in pressing for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ignore the images of mayhem and bloodshed broadcast over the past 10 days
from South Africa: the sober fact is that 35 people have died in violence
linked to the May 10 assassination of African National Congress leader Chris
Hani - a daily toll that is less than the average for the year as a whole.
The ANC has spent the past 36 hours celebrating that fact, congratulating
itself for containing what was potentially the most explosive event in South
African history. Millions engaged in protest at the death of the man now
guaranteed a place as one of the liberation struggle's greatest martyrs.
ANC marshals dealt with crowds up to 100,000 strong, and subdued them
without arms, with almost no logistical support, with the force of will and
moral persuasion. It was an impressive display of discipline and
organisation, and one which will give the ANC's future electoral opponents
ample cause for concern.
But if the ANC has crossed one hurdle without stumbling, others remain. Its
leaders originally set out merely to manage the crisis caused by Mr Hani's
murder. But now they have turned it to advantage, and have begun to exploit
public anger to achieve broader political goals.
As publicly stated, those goals are: agreement by the end of May on a date
for the first multi-racial elections; installation by the same date of the
first phase of interim government, a multi-party Transitional Executive
Council to rule with the incumbent National party; and joint control of the
security forces, blamed by the ANC for Mr Hani's murder (though there is no
evidence they were involved).
To support these demands, the ANC has announced a six-week programme of mass
action - marches, strikes, and boycotts. Inevitably, public outrage over Mr
Hani's death will dissipate over that period. But before it does, party
leaders hope to be able to produce what has eluded them so far - concrete
results from the negotiating table.
Superficially, producing those results appears simple. For both the ANC and
the government - the two main parties to multilateral constitutional talks -
agree that elections should be held as soon as possible. The government
wants elections by April 1994 and the ANC largely agrees, though it would
accelerate the timetable by a few months. Likewise, the government and the
ANC want to see a Transitional Executive Council - a multi-party body
charged with 'levelling the playing field' ahead of elections - in place by
June. That body, and its several sub-councils, would supervise any
government action which has an impact on the political arena, but would not
constitute true joint government.
So the ANC could push the government, obviously shaken by the massive
protests and fearing greater instability, to set an election date with
despatch. But elections to what body, and under what constitution? Elections
cannot be held until the multi-party forum decides how regions are to be
represented in the new South Africa, whether there will be a unicameral or
bicameral legislature, whether an executive president or prime minister,
whether South Africa is to be a unitary or a federal state; they cannot be
held under the current constitution, which bars blacks from voting.
Yet agreement on a new, interim constitution appears to be months away. So
the negotiators are left with an unenviable choice: risk public wrath by
refusing to set an election date, or set a date without constitutional
agreement. Once that is done, parties would be forced to agree a
constitution in short order, or court national disaster by postponing the
poll; a constitutional accord could only be achieved by forcing out of the
negotiating forum any party which impedes progress towards early agreement.
And such an exclusion could mean that potentially large sections of the
population would not view the constitution as legitimate, jeopardising
democracy in South Africa.
The test comes when the 26 parties involved in the negotiating process
return to the table. Apart from the government and the ANC, the third
crucial participant is the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. The others can
be steam-rollered without affecting the legitimacy of the constitution.
But to force the departure of Inkatha - which opinion polls show might
command 10 per cent of the national vote, and substantially more in the
violent Natal province - would be a serious blow. Inkatha has already said
an election date cannot be agreed until the fundamental question of the form
of the future South African state, unitary or federal, has been decided.
Inkatha opposes not just the setting of an election date, but also the
installation of the Transitional Executive Council. For the party rejects
any form of interim government, and wants the unelected multi-party
negotiating forum to agree a final constitution (opponents of Inkatha's
leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, say he wants a constitution written now
because his influence would be diluted by popular elections he could not
win). The ANC and others want a two-phase interim government, with the
council to be followed by a power-sharing interim government, plus an
elected body to draw up a new constitution.
So the ANC will have to assess carefully the impact of its 'mass action'
campaign. Its declared purpose is to put pressure on the government, but the
most serious effect could be on Inkatha, forcing Chief Buthelezi to decide
whether to continue in a process he opposes or to go it alone. He has
already called the ANC's campaign 'ridiculous', and said it represents a
'setback for negotiations'.
After months of patiently trying to draw Inkatha constructively into the
negotiating process, the risk is that the two black parties will be on a
confrontational path again.
The ANC and the government could probably agree between them on an election
date, a Transitional Executive Council, even on an interim constitution. The
government recognises the power demonstrated by the ANC on the streets, and
is clearly willing to be flexible.
In any case, the gap between them is not huge. Earlier this year, they
agreed on multi-racial power sharing through the end of the century, and
though disputes remain over how decisions will be taken in the multi-party
cabinet, they can be resolved. The two sides have also agreed on a
substantial devolution of power to regional governments, and though details
are still under debate, agreement in principle is a significant
breakthrough.
The main dispute between the government and the ANC is not constitutional,
but practical: how to ensure that the security forces do not continue to
destabilise the transition to democracy. For while there is no evidence of
security force involvement in the Hani assassination - two right-wing whites
are in custody for the murder, but they have no recent security force links
 -the perception in the townships is that Mr Hani was killed by the
government. And many of the killings which followed his murder were either
carried out by police (12) or in the case of the 19 people killed on the eve
of the funeral, with suspected 'third force' involvement.
The vexed issue of how to defuse the security force threat, under
negotiation for three years already, is again coming to the fore. The
government insists that political control of the security forces must remain
with it; the ANC wants full joint control of the forces. Somehow, this issue
must be resolved before any constitutional progress can be made.
But even if it is resolved, the ANC's two other demands - for an election
date and a Transitional Executive Council - must also be met. The government
may try to deflect the public outcry by meeting the second demand while
referring the first to an independent electoral commission, which would
decide when South Africa was 'ready' for elections. This seems unlikely to
succeed.
Whatever happens, the ANC may yet regret focusing so much attention on the
constitutional talks. They are tortuous and slow, and can produce only
compromises, not outright victories for the ANC. The movement's leaders may
yet find that it is they - not the government - in the hot seat, having left
their constituents expecting something they cannot quickly deliver.

FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Herculean task for Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIANS HAVE voted by a larger-than-expected margin to reshape the
political system under which their country has been run since the second
world war. The referendums on Sunday and Monday confirmed the momentum
behind reform, above all the drive to redraw the electoral laws that have
produced five decades of weak coalitions. The Herculean task is to translate
this wish for change into new policies and structures capable of making
Italy a better governed country, able to hold its own in the mainstream of
Europe
The difficulties of the transformation bear some resemblance to those that
have confronted countries in eastern and central Europe. The struggle has
been made more complex by the challenge of steering Italy through its most
severe recession for 20 years, while limiting the country's chronic budget
deficit. But after the damage wrought by revelations of corruption and
misdoing, the country's political establishment has now no choice but to
proceed with renewal with utmost speed.
The direction of the desired transition is now evident. The Italian
parliament must quickly transcribe the voters' wish for an end - or at least
a substantial modification - of proportional representation into legislation
ensuring a new basis for elections, perhaps as early as the autumn.
Full-scale rewriting of Italy's 1946 constitution is a task which should
await the next parliament. But the process of constitutional reform is not
merely at the top of the agenda; it is now under way.
The nature of the politicians and the parties who will carry out the
electorate's mandate for change is far less clear. Mr Giuliano Amato, the
current prime minister, could stay on at the helm of a new interim
government specifically charged with organising a transition culminating in
its own extinction. In view of the urgency of its tasks, not least in the
budgetary field, such an interim administration should draw support from as
broad a coalition as possible. This could include not only the Radicals, but
also the Lombard League, whose rise in northern Italy has dramatically
reflected the yearning for a break with the past.
Neither Mr Amato nor any other established party figure would seem suitable
to guide Italy beyond the next elections. New figures will be needed. For
all his success in the referendums, Mr Mario Segni, the former Christian
Democrat who headed the reform movement, may not fit the bill.
In Italy's shifting political landscape, the referendum results guarantee
neither a passport to better political management, nor an automatic demise
of the old nomenklatura. It is unlikely, for instance, that scrapping state
funding of political parties will, by itself, make them less prey to
nefarious influences.
Furthermore, a first-past-the-post voting system, which increases the
likelihood of large majorities by dominant regional parties, may raise
rather than diminish the risk of political fragmentation. The Christian
Democrats, previously the main party of government, have been badly hit by
allegations that Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister, has for
years been consorting with the Mafia. But if voters - particularly in the
south - start to realise that the ending of the old order brings real
sacrifices, the party's fortunes could again start to rise.
Italy's natural dynamism needs a political system which will be more open,
just and efficient than the one which - precisely because of the
possibilities for abuse of power and patronage - has hitherto proved so
entrenched. Italy's voters have chosen a high-risk course, but it is the
only one available. The transition will bring discomfort. The greater the
Italians' recognition that it is worth bearing, the higher will be the
chance of success.

FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Jubilee Line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS now more than a year since work was due to start on the Pounds 1.8bn
extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands. The delay has been
caused by the government's insistence that the developers of Canary Wharf
should contribute Pounds 100m towards the project before work begins. Ever
since the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the company that built Canary Wharf,
the wrangling has continued over who should pick up the bill.
Suddenly, however, the skies appear to have cleared. The Luxembourg-based
European Investment Bank has announced that it is prepared to put up Pounds
98m towards the line's construction costs under its remit to stimulate
economic growth in the European Community. A 15-year loan will be provided
to whichever private sector body takes over Canary Wharf from the
administrators. That body will hand over the money to the government, and
then attempt to service its debt to the EIB out of profits from Canary
Wharf.
The structure of the deal suits the government since it will enable
ministers to claim that the private sector will still be responsible for the
required contribution. But the claim will ring hollow: the EIB, after all,
is a non-profit making public sector institution wholly owned by EC member
states.
Implicit in the triple A borrowing status that the EIB enjoys when borrowing
on the international capital markets is that it customarily lends to public
sector projects underwritten by governments. While none of the parties will
divulge who is guaranteeing the loan for the Jubilee Line, it is highly
improbable that the EIB would have lent to a project as risky as Canary
Wharf without the comfort of a government guarantee. The question then is
why the government did not save everyone a lot of bother and a year's delay
by putting up the money in the first place.

FT  21 APR 93 / Personal View: Clinton joins the interventionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American reactions to the industrial challenge from Japan in the 1990s
resemble those of Europeans to the challenge from the US in the 1960s - as
Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton's US secretary for labour, has stated.
It is not surprising therefore that the US administration should emulate
Europe in its industrial policies.
Mr Clinton is proposing that more federal funds should be available to
finance the development of industrial technology, with the emphasis on areas
where industry is supposed to be threatened by foreign competition - such as
aircraft motors and supercomputers - or where developments are expected to
generate wider benefits, such as a national high-speed computer network and
technologies to reduce environmental damage.
These policies are not entirely novel for the US; both Republican and
Democratic administrations have financed large and expensive development
projects - such as satellites, rockets, supersonic airliners and synthetic
fuel plants - nearly all of which have been failures, as a recent study by
the Brookings Institution emphasised*. The tax credit for industrial
research and development expenditure, the most expensive part of President
Clinton's new package, dates back to 1981.
But the scope of the 'technology support programme' is greater than anything
seen previously and, although it is relatively modest at some Dollars 3.4bn
a year, the presidential rhetoric that has accompanied it suggests that
there may be more to come. The policies therefore seem to represent a break
with those of Republican presidents, and to augur competition with Europe
and Japan on subsidies. In all three regions there are now governments which
believe they ought to do something to improve industrial performance.
Experience in the US as well as Europe suggests that the effects of the new
programme are likely to be trivial; and the most beneficial are likely to be
the cheapest, such as improving advice on technology available to small
companies. The expensive tax credit for industrial research and development
is unlikely to have much effect on industrial performance, although it will
have an effect on the amount of expenditure described as R&amp;D in companies'
tax returns. In any case, increasing industrial expenditure on R&amp;D does not
in itself improve performance; R&amp;D is an input, not an output.
This programme is backed by many academic studies, some of whose authors,
such as Robert Reich, Laura Tyson, and Lawrence Summers, are now members of
the administration. But the arguments they use to justify subsides are not
convincing. Summers, under-secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury, has argued that the high wages in capital - and R&amp;D - intensive
industries represent 'excess rents', because these earnings cannot be
explained by the available information. Foreign subsidies, such as those to
Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, are then said to transfer rents,
and so economic welfare, from the US to the subsidising countries. But
unexplained differences in pay may reflect unobserved differences in
quality, so the rents could be imaginary. Summers' arguments do not show
that subsidies would improve economic welfare; but they would transfer money
from taxpayers to employees of subsidised companies.
This group of academics also alternates between confidence that its results
are relevant to policy, and recognition of the difficulties of implementing
an industrial policy successfully. The recognition by Tyson, the chief White
House economist, of these difficulties led her to recommend that support
should be limited to generic research.
Governments cannot easily intervene to improve industrial performance. It
may seem that some wonderful new technology is failing to be exploited; but
there is usually a good reason for this. And if a government offers grants
to industry, it will soon learn that the cheapest finance is the preferred
source. The government will then find that its funds are often replacing
private funds, and the true effect of its largesse is difficult to
establish.
To a European observer, it is strange that the US government should think
industrial innovation needs more government help. American industrial
weaknesses seem more related to the number of large and arthritic companies
than to lack of innovation; and increased government intervention could
weaken the entrepreneurial spirit that has made the US the world leader in
new industries such as microprocessors, personal computers and
biotechnology. Mr Clinton may be tackling the wrong problem.
