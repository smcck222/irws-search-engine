FT  06 APR 93 / People: Loudon broadens M&amp;G's board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Loudon, the former chief executive of Midland Montagu, has been
appointed a non-executive director of M&amp;G Group, one of Britain's biggest
fund managers.
Loudon, 50, comes from a well known Dutch family which has produced the
chairman of Royal Dutch Shell and Akzo as well as several bankers. In spite
of his Dutch name, Oxford-educated Loudon has an English wife and feels more
at home on the international business circuit than most of his peers.
He has worked with Lazards Freres in Paris, the Ford Foundation in New York
and Jakarta, McKinsey &amp; Co and Amro in Amsterdam, before being headhunted as
part of Midland Bank's new management team. He has contacts which should
come in handy for a firm of fund managers with international ambitions.
Loudon, who lost his job as an executive director of Midland Bank following
its takeover by HSBC Holdings last year, was appointed a non-executive
director of Arjo Wiggins Appleton in January.
It is just over a year since M&amp;G appointed Hugh Collum, SmithKline Beecham's
finance director, as a non-executive director and Paddy Linaker, M&amp;G's chief
executive, says that Loudon's appointment is part of an effort to broaden
the board membership. Traditionally, M&amp;G has drawn most of its non-executive
directors from a relatively small circle. Before Loudon's appointment three
out of M&amp;G's seven non-execs were connected with the Esmee Fairbairn
Charitable Trust, which owns a third of the company, and Bobbie Brooks is a
director of Kleinwort Benson, which used to own a 37 per cent stake.
Meanwhile, Michael McLintock, who has recently joined M&amp;G from Barings'
corporate finance department, has been appointed a director of M&amp;G
Investment Management. McLintock, whose father Alan has been a non-executive
director of M&amp;G since 1982, will be promoting the firm's investment skills
for managing segregated pension funds.

FT  06 APR 93 / People: Brown treks back to United Inds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Loss-making United Industries has hired Tom Brown, previously group managing
director of the much larger, Hull-based, engineering group Fenner, who
thinks he has spotted the ideal time in the economic cycle to 'be involved
in something entrepreneurial'.
Brown's predecessor at the company, which makes precision springs for
aerospace, automotive, electrical and engineering applications, was
53-year-old David Simpkin, who has taken early retirement after a heart
attack. A chartered accountant, he had been with parts of the group for 27
years and group managing director since 1989.
'In any case, we needed a different kind of manager to lead us out of the
recession, one who was more product-oriented,' says chairman Ken Coates.
'Brown is a trained professional manager with an MBA (from IMEDE in
Lausanne) and he is a qualified engineer.'
Brown, who has been trekking in Morocco since resigning two months ago,
likens Fenner to an oil tanker. 'I have been keen to be master of my
destiny,' he says. Peter Barker, executive chairman, has been there
'approaching 40 years. It is very much his personal fiefdom'.
At United by contrast he has a non-executive chairman who promises to 'offer
guidance and counsel but not to get in the way', as Coates himself puts it.
His last entrepreneurial sortie, Brown now thinks, was just at the wrong
stage of the economic cycle. At the end of the 1980s his search, in
association with Schroder Ventures, for a management buy-in opportunity
which he would run and Schroders would finance, proved fruitless.

FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: The City takes stock / A look at the benefits of
electronic trade confirmation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's planned paperless
settlement system, has forced UK financial institutions to think again about
the future of their operations for the confirmation and settlement of
securities trading.
One likely recipient of the resources freed by Taurus's demise is electronic
trade confirmation (ETC), an automated screen-based process designed to
shorten the time taken to confirm equity or fixed-income trades between
brokers and institutions.
The main advantage offered by ETC to the user is the reduction in the number
of failed trades which can often turn into expensive errors for the parties
involved. Furthermore, ETC eliminates the need for confirmation faxes or
telexes, which in turn should lead to a streamlining in back office staff.
The introduction of ETC into the UK came about following an industry user
group (IUG) initiative in December 1991, led by Fidelity, the Boston-based
fund management group. But although many institutions were quick to
acknowledge the advantages of the system, only a few have decided to install
one of the three ETC systems which are now running.
The main reason offered by institutions for not giving ETC a higher priority
was that many of them had already invested a considerable amount of money
adapting their back office technology to the eventual start-up of Taurus.
These institutions have been forced to return to the drawing board. One of
them is the Prudential, the UK's leading life insurance and financial
services company and a big investor in financial markets in the UK and
abroad.
'Taurus was our number one priority for 1993 but we are now re-evaluating
our priorities. ETC is on this list,' says David Hanson, the administration
director of Prudential Portfolio Managers.
The wider use of ETC is also the main objective of the IUG's new chairman,
John Lambert, director of operations at Schroders Investment Management. 'We
have got to push much wider geographically - outside the UK - as well as go
deeper within the UK,' he says.
He adds that the prospect of a three-day rolling share settlement in the UK,
as opposed to the current 14-day account system, means that ETC should also
be considered by smaller financial institutions. Some of them still rely on
brokers sending them contract notes in the post. 'Speed will be of the
essence when rolling settlement is introduced,' says Lambert.
The collapse of Taurus has, if anything, brought rolling settlement much
closer: it is being accorded a higher priority than before, with many in the
City urging its introduction this year.
Meanwhile, the three vendors selected by the IUG to build and sell ETC
systems have all gone live. Institutions can choose from Trax, sold by the
International Securities Market Association, the Stock Exchange's Sequal
system, or Thomson Financial Services' Oasys Global system.
These systems allow users to confirm trades within the UK and across
continental Europe. Oasys also provides ETC with Mexico and plans to have a
base in Sydney in the third quarter to provide ETC in the Asia Pacific
region.
So far, the response from users has been positive. John Bevan, transaction
support supervisor at Fidelity, says that since January, when Fidelity
started putting details of trades through Oasys, the main advantage has been
the reduced risk of failed trades. 'It has made life easier but the main
benefit will come when more people are involved,' says Bevan.
At present, the three ETC systems operate independently, but there is an
agreement in principle between the vendors to set up interfaces so that
users do not have to subscribe to all three systems in order to confirm
trades with each other.
However, progress on the links has been hampered by discussions about who
will bear the cost of the development of the links and how the charges for
using the links will be allocated among the vendors. The links are not
expected to be in operation before the end of this year.
Lambert is keen to press ahead with the links which he believes are
necessary for the success of ETC. For example, the existence of links would
benefit brokers in particular since they have had to install several systems
in order to communicate with different clients.
For now, the use of ETC is mainly between brokers or brokers and
institutions but it would appear logical that the same trade details already
stored in an ETC system could then be sent on by the institution to its
custodian bank with payment and delivery instructions.
There has been an initiative to introduce such a system in Europe, known as
ISITC, since the end of last year. A similar system is already in use
between institutions and custodians in the US.
However, this stage of automation may take time before it is widely
accepted, mainly because UK institutions may be reluctant to surrender their
long-standing links with their custodian banks.

FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: Matsushita and Sony join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company, is launching a
high-definition laser disc player which it is procuring from rival Sony in
its first Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreement.
The deal, in which Sony will supply Matsushita with a high-definition laser
disc player, will be the first time Matsushita has marketed a product
purchased in its entirety from Sony. Under an OEM agreement a manufacturer
buys a product from another manufacturer and markets that product under its
own brand name.
It represents a significant shift in the strategy of Matsushita, which has
competed fiercely with Sony.
The deal also highlights the growing trend among consumer electronics
companies to procure products through OEM deals, so that they can focus
their energies on areas where they have an edge over other manufacturers or
which are more profitable. 'Given (our) limited resources, we decided it was
better to buy this product from Sony,' Matsushita said.
Electronics companies must invest in R&amp;D in a wide range of areas, the
company explained. In order to bring products to the market swiftly,
Matsushita concluded it would be better to co-operate with other
manufacturers, rather than doing everything on its own.
Supplying products to the market through OEM agreements enables
manufacturers to continue supplying consumers with a wide product range
without having to manufacture everything themselves, which can be a costly
and unprofitable.
Hitachi has also been considering buying low-cost PCs on an OEM basis with
IBM.
The high price of developing new technologies has brought more consumer
electronics companies together in an attempt to avoid another costly
standards war.
The new laser disc player to be launched by Matsushita, for example, is
based on a standard agreed by five of Japan's leading consumer electronics
manufacturers - Matsushita, Pioneer, Sanyo, Sony and Toshiba. In addition to
the high-definition laser disc player, Matsushita also announced the launch
of a high-definition televison priced at Y980,000 (Pounds 5,700), one of the
lowest in the market.
However, the company acknowledges that it faces a dilemma. In order for the
market to grow prices must fall significantly. But it would rather not see
prices fall rapidly, as prices of consumer electronics products have tended
to in the industry's recent history, as this would prevent it from being
able to recoup investment costs in HDTV over 20 years.

FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: Sowing the seeds of productivity - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biotechnology has been greeted in developing countries with as much
apprehension as enthusiasm. Pessimists argue that the concentration of
biotechnology research and development within commercial companies in rich
countries means, at best, that the needs of the poor will be by-passed.
Profit-seeking firms will inevitably concentrate on products of most
interest to affluent farmers - on new wheat strains or leaner beef, rather
than improved millet or cassava, food staples for many rural Africans.
Worse, there are fears that biotechnology could make the poor poorer.
Research on genetically engineered substitutes for vanilla, coconut oil,
cocoa and even coffee could destroy the livelihoods of millions of farmers
in the third world, repeating on a far bigger scale the predations of
enzyme-produced sweeteners on the world sugar market.
Increased production due to higher yields from disease and drought-resistant
crops could glut world markets and push down prices - bearable for farmers
who can afford to buy the expensive new seeds (and gene-related herbicides)
that cut their growing costs, but potentially devastating for those who
cannot.
Finally, the reduced need for labour to fertilise, weed and spray the fields
planted with these new wonder crops could cut rural jobs and incomes,
intensifying poverty and accelerating the drift to the overcrowded cities.
Weeding especially is a task done mainly by very poor women.
However, a review of existing applications of biotechnology in developing
countries by the International Labour Organisation* suggests these fears are
misplaced. Even today, biotechnology is not exclusively a preserve of the
wealthy nations.
Many developing countries - from Mexico to Malawi - already have the skills
and resources to exploit 'second-generation' techniques based on
micro-propagation, which involves producing plantlets from isolated plant
cells to yield identical crops. A micro-propagation laboratory to produce
cloned plantlets costs perhaps Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 176,000), small beer
compared with the millions spent annually by third-world nations on imported
chemical fertilisers.
Micro-propagation of potatoes in Kenya has doubled land productivity and
profitability. China has gone further, developing resistant strains of rice
and wheat with remarkable results.
In addition, micro-propagation for citrus growing in Mexico and tea planting
in Malawi and Kenya actually boosted employment, as more hands were needed
for planting, pruning and harvesting the extra crops. Jobs were also created
in associated industries - the laboratories producing the plantlets and the
factories processing the harvested crops.
Biologically-crafted crop strains also have big potential advantages for
small, poor farmers, the ILO argues. Unlike their conventionally-bred Green
Revolution counterparts, these strains do not require extra inputs such as
water and fertiliser to realise better yields. On the contrary, they cut
costs, save on resources, reduce the risk of crop loss and failure and, by
improving storage qualities, may help small farmers bring their produce to
market. In theory, the benefits of biotechnology should thus be shared more
equitably.
To make sure that they are, countries need to adopt policies that encourage
wide and speedy diffusion of biotechnology while limiting its adverse
effects. The ILO argues that fair patent rules and greater competition
between suppliers would help keep prices down and broaden access.
It also urges rich countries to scrap trade barriers to commodity imports
that artificially stimulate work on substitutes and discourage research on
new end-uses. Poor countries, it says, should do more to reduce rural
inequalities and to promote adjustment to the new technology, which holds
out the prospect of a more productive, efficient and greener farm sector.

FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A slowly tightening noose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JACK Maddox set up a pension scheme for himself and for the co-founder of
his Liverpool-based advertising and marketing agency 14 years ago, but now
wonders if this was sensible.
Maddox says his two-person pension scheme, now extended to cover four
directors, is faced with a growing weight of regulation - with the
possibility of more to come in the wake of the Maxwell scandal.
When Maddox established what is known as a small self-administered pension
scheme in 1979 the setting up and monitoring costs were modest. An actuary's
report on the progress of the scheme was required only once every three
years.
A tightening of the rules has since led to a requirement that accounts must
now be filed each year, requiring the use of a registered auditor and the
scheme's actuary. The growing burden of legislation on the professions has
meant that auditors and actuaries are becoming more painstaking in their
approach and their costs have risen sharply.
'What used to be a small, easily administered fund has become a federal
case,' says Maddox, chief executive of Michael Bungey DFS, which has 12
full-time employees.
He calculates that allowing for inflation, the Pounds 1,000 minimum annual
professional fee he is now charged would amount to Pounds 70,000 (Pounds
80,000 if start-up costs were included) over the life of a 30-year scheme.
'That amount would buy a lot of pension but the fund members will see none
of it,' he says.
Small, self-administered pension schemes, sometimes referred to as
directors' plans, serve a double purpose. They allow participants to provide
for their pensions and, since funds in the scheme can, within certain
limits, be invested back into the business, represent a valuable additional
source of finance for small firms.
In a broader economic context, these schemes recycle funds generated by
small firms back into the sector, compared with the payment of insurance
premiums which are usually invested in large companies or in government
securities. They also avoid the payment of substantial management charges to
insurance companies.
The tightening regulatory noose has meant that businesses such as Michael
Bungey now face extra costs. 'Today, in the same position, we would avoid a
self-administered scheme because a number of better and more lucrative
alternatives exist,' says Maddox.
'What seems to be forgotten is that the scheme is the managers' own fund.
They have no interest in robbing themselves, so why are the controls
excessive?' Maddox has registered his concerns with the Pension Law Review
Committee, set up in the wake of Robert Maxwell's death and the discovery of
a large shortfall in the Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund. This
committee, which is due to report by September, is carrying out a
wide-ranging review of occupational pension schemes, including the issue of
the appropriate degree of regulation.
In principle, the small self-administered pension schemes are designed so
that small companies can operate them relatively easily, compared with the
rules for the larger occupational schemes.
As well as the possibility of further legislation resulting from the pension
law review, the European Commission is considering imposing tighter limits
on the amounts which the schemes can invest back in the business. The
managers of small, self-administered schemes are limited to 'self-investing'
25 per cent of the assets during the first two years and 50 per cent
thereafter. But Brussels has suggested an overall limit of 10 per cent on
self-investment, despite the fact that no other EC country operates this
type of small company scheme, says Dryden Gilling-Smith, managing director
of Employee Benefit Services, a consultancy.
Maddox contrasts the tightening of reporting rules for small company schemes
with the relaxation of filing requirements at Companies House. 'There is no
trading data now, only balance sheet information,' he says 'That makes fraud
much easier. But nobody who has his own pension scheme is going to rip
himself off.'
The Department of Social Security says the government has to strike a
balance between encouraging employers to set up pension schemes and
safeguarding the rights of pensioners. It queries whether an annual audit is
particularly onerous.
The government's campaign to reduce red tape has made further progress with
the appointment last month of the chairmen of the seven deregulation
taskforces. But as the company featured here illustrates, conflicting
demands for consumer protection will make for difficult choices.
The Growing Business Page is running a series highlighting businesses
entrapped by red tape.
It will award a bottle of Laurent-Perrier pink champagne to each one
featured.
The owner managers of independent businesses are invited to describe their
experiences - on no more than two sides of A4 please. Letters should be

Some small businesses are worried that government attempts to collect child
maintenance payments from parents' pay packets will add to the workload on
employers and damage employee relations.
The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 58,000 members, has criticised
plans by the Child Support Agency to issue deduction from earnings orders if
other methods of obtaining payment fail.
This latest burden comes on top of attachment of earnings orders which can
be used to collect council tax payments and is at variance with the
government's commitment to cut red tape, the federation said.

projects for the past seven years. This year it will give UK companies the
choice of a French student for the first time.
In a pilot project confined in its first year to London, undergraduates from
French universities will take part. Companies keen to expand their
activities in France or elsewhere in the single market would be particularly
suitable, Step said.
A total of 1,000 students from UK universities are expected to take part in

Many small firms pay between 5 and 10 per cent above base rate for overdraft
finance, according to a survey of Northern Ireland businesses.
Thirty per cent of firms with overdrafts paid interest at 5 per cent above
base or higher. Some companies in the services sector paid 10 per cent above
base - a total of 16 per cent - while manufacturing companies paid up to 9
per cent above base.
These were not isolated cases and possibly reflected a failure to appreciate
that rates were negotiable, the authors noted. One in six service businesses
and one in 10 manufacturers were unaware of the rates they were being
charged. The survey covered 1,000 firms employing fewer than 100 people
each.

FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Single market update
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How are you coping with the European single market?
You can improve your hand by reference to a clutch of new books which
provide help and guidance on dealing with the new Europe.
The Handbook of European Business Contacts 1993-94 (Colt Books, 226 pages,
Pounds 24.50) by Gerard Dawson and the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce provides useful lists of hundreds of business support
organisations, trade associations and government offices throughout Europe.
It gives a brief economic profile of the 12 EC member countries including
comprehensive lists of local chambers of commerce - important because of
their statutory role in most EC countries where they are the main
repositories of business information.
One important source of cross-border business is the government contracts
which have been opened up by EC public procurement policies. The problem for
the smaller business, in particular, is knowing where to go for information.
Eurobudget '93 (Fourth Edition. London Chamber of Commerce, 224 pages,
Pounds 95) by Michael O'Hagan and others, provides brief explanations of the
EC budget process followed by details of all the budget lines open to
outside bidders and the officials responsible.
This is a handy short-cut to information otherwise only available from a
time-consuming study of EC budget documents but would benefit from a less
terse introduction.
If your business dealings in Europe involve negotiations with a French
business, Negotiate in French and English by Pamela Sheppard and Benedicte
Lapeyre (Nicholas Brealey, 138 pages, Pounds 9.99) provides a bilingual
guide. It explains the French approach to negotiations and the terminology
they use in situations ranging from establishing goodwill, through doubts
and deadlock to compromise and agreement.
Intended for the businessman or woman with a good basic grounding in French,
this fascinating book provides, in context, the phrases which cannot be
found in general or business dictionaries.
For the businessman who wants to start from scratch The Economist Guide to
the European Community (Revised edition. Century Business, 262 pages, Pounds
14.99) by Dick Leonard provides an informative overview of the EC's history,
role and institutions.
This guide covers a lot of ground but retains a lively style.

FT  06 APR 93 / Joblessness forecast to peak soon at 3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT WILL continue to rise for only a few more months, peaking at
3.1m, but will still be about 2.5m by the end of the century, according to
the annual review of the economy and employment by the Institute for
Employment Research.
The institute expects a net 500,000 additional jobs by 2000, most of which
will be part-time jobs taken by women in the service sector. The female
labour force is expected to grow by 500,000 over the next decade.
The movement away from primary and manufacturing industries to the service
sector will continue, with manufacturing expected to lose another 600,000
jobs in the next decade.
The growth in clerical and secretarial work, which now accounts for just
over 4m jobs, will stop as a result of new technology, the institute says.
It expects an increase of about 150,000 clerical and secretarial jobs by the
end of the decade.
Skilled manual jobs will decrease by about 500,000 by the end of the decade.
An increase of 750,000 posts is projected for managers and administrators
with a further 800,000 new jobs in professional and associate professional
and technical occupations such as laboratory assistants.
Part-time jobs accounted for the whole of the 1.2m increase in employment
between 1980 and 1990, and an extra 750,000 part-time posts are expected
before 2000.
The growth in self-employment is likely to increase again following the
decline in 1991 and last year. About 200,000 additional self-employed jobs
are expected before the end of the decade.

FT  06 APR 93 / Decline in building industry eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of decline in the construction industry has slowed in the past
three months and there has been a modest improvement in inquiries from
potential customers, the industry said yesterday.
But construction companies still expect output to decline by a further 2 per
cent this year, following a 5.5 per cent fall last year.
The Building Employers Confederation said that its latest workload survey of
more than 600 companies showed a slight improvement in the proportion of
companies reporting an increase in inquiries from potential customers.
The decline in production in the past quarter was less steep than in the
previous three months. Companies expected to shed fewer jobs as the year
progressed.
In spite of this the confederation still expected 50,000 construction jobs
to be lost this year, taking the number of jobs axed since summer 1989 to
more than 500,000.
A fifth of companies continued to work at less than half capacity even
though there had been a rise in inquiries.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said:
'The fact that inquiries for new work are stabilising and that firms are
being increasingly successful in tendering and negotiating for new work is
welcome news for the industry.
'But there remains a worrying lack of confidence among manufacturers, which
are continuing to fail to invest in new buildings.
'There also appears to be a disappointing lack of repair and maintenance
work being done - and for small firms, employing less than 25 people, there
are few signs of encouragement in this survey.'
Some small companies have only enough work to last them another three
months. Medium-sized companies say they have work for up to nine months,
while the main contractors have a large enough workload to last 12 to 18
months.
Sir Brian said the industry needed further interest rate cuts.

FT  06 APR 93 / Biggest fall in living costs for over 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVING COSTS have fallen more in the past 12 months than ion any year for
more than two decades, a study published today indicates.
The Reward Group, a consultancy specialising in pay and consumer studies,
calculates that in February a family with average needs in terms of housing
and consumer purchases required an income 5.1 per cent less than a year
previously to maintain its standard of living.
The year-on-year fall in living costs is the biggest since Reward started
its twice-yearly studies in 1972. There was a year-on-year decline of 0.7
per cent last August.
The findings support other indications of low inflationary conditions as a
result of the recession. While the muted level of price rises for many
consumer goods played a part in the overall fall in living costs, the
biggest factor was that housing costs for home owners fell by 19.7 per cent
in the year to February, mainly due to lower interest rates.
For the relatively small number of people who rent their homes from local
authorities housing costs rose 12.1 per cent because of higher rents.
Reward bases its results on a survey of average costs for a group of eight
hypothetical four-person families with different spending habits.
The annual income needed to support the families - each including one adult
in employment, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged eight - works out at between
Pounds 11,728 and Pounds 71,215, depending on lifestyles.
In terms of the incomes needed, Greater London, Woking and Welwyn Garden
City are the dearest places in Britain while Northern Ireland, Peterhead,
Thurso and Doncaster are the cheapest.

FT  06 APR 93 / Venture capital boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK venture capital industry bounced back last year, increasing
investments by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn as venture capitalists took
advantage of cheaper investment opportunities created by the reces-sion.
The annual report of the British Venture Capital Association, published
today, says the rise in 1992 compares with a 17 per cent investment fall in
1991.
There were no signs of a shift away from the less risky, later-stage
investments which accounted for 57 per cent of deals by number and 29 per
cent by value.
Management buy-outs and buy-ins accounted for 26 per cent of deals by number
and 64 per cent by value. Early-stage investments accounted for 17 per cent
of deals and just 7 per cent of sums invested.
British venture capitalists invested in a total of 1,297 companies around
the world last year, with 88 per cent or Pounds 1.2bn of investments in
1,147 companies in the UK.
Consumer-related businesses continued to dominate investments by sector,
attracting 32 per cent of the amounts invested.
The south-east accounted for the largest number of investments by region,
attracting Pounds 550m of funds, or 44 per cent of the total, but this was
directly proportionate the the region's share of business activity. Across
the rest of the UK investment was spread fairly evenly by region.
The association said the 1992 figures included for the first time loans
directly linked to equity investments by the same venture capital group, so
they were not directly comparable with previous years.

FT  06 APR 93 / Mesnage appears in Guernsey court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Mesnage, a French trawler skipper, appeared in a Guernsey court
yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes. He was charged with fishing illegally in
British territorial waters off the island and with failing to comply with an
order from a fisheries protection officer.
Mr Mesnage faces a maximum Pounds 50,000 fine for the first offence and a
maximum Pounds 1,000 for the second. The charges relate to alleged incidents
10 days ago involving French fishing vessels and the Royal Navy. The case
was further adjourned until today.
Earlier yesterday more than a dozen British fishing vessels landed their
catches at the French port of Cherbourg without the feared protest action by
French fishermen. Last Friday French fishermen warned their British
counterparts not to go to French ports because of tensions over disputed
fishing rights and the arrest of Mr Mesnage.

FT  06 APR 93 / Tax set to rise, highest for four years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXATION as a proportion of national income is set to rise this year to the
highest level for four years, the free-market Adam Smith Institute says.
The proportion will rise this year to 41.68 per cent from 39.43 per cent
last year and 42.18 per cent in 1989 - itself the highest since 1985 when it
was 42.35 per cent.
It says the change is 'deeply disturbing' - after the early 1980s, when tax
as a proportion of national income fell, Britain 'is once more becoming a
high tax economy'.

found no evidence that time pressures reduced the quality of the audit, and
senior managers and partners said enough time was given to audits.

FT  06 APR 93 / High Court calls eating-up time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTAURANTS ARE entitled to give customers 'eating-up time' in the same way
that public houses can give drinking-up time, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
Southampton magistrates found Mr Anwar Amin guilty of contravening a
condition of his restaurant licence which prevented him from 'keeping open'
between 3am and 5am. Mr Amin admitted that some customers were still eating
at 3.45am when police officers visited the restaurant. But no customers were
admitted after 3am, and diners were finishing their meals, he argued.
Allowing an appeal, Mr Justice Rougier, sitting with Lord Justice Watkins,
said customers in the restaurant at 3am were entitled to finish their meals.

FT  06 APR 93 / Patten vows to improve skills base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTRODUCTION of vocational education for 16-to-19-year-olds in full-time
education is to be speeded up in the drive to improve the country's skill
base, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Patten, who has given a much higher public profile to vocational
qualifications in recent weeks, told the Institute of Directors he would
like to see vocational qualifications developing into mainstream
qualifications, catering for up to half the age group.
Ambitious goals were essential if the UK was to meet the national targets
for achievement of vocational and educational qualifications set by the
Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Patten said that a number of alternative qualification routes were needed
in order to meet the national targets.
He stressed his commitment to retaining 'all that was best in the A-level
system' but said a central objective was to provide people with an
attractive vocational alternative. The new National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs) and General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs)
for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were designed to do this.
The first GNVQs - in art and design, business, health and social care,
leisure and tourism and manufacturing - are being piloted in about 100
colleges and schools.
Mr Patten said he wanted GNVQs in at least two subjects to be available in
at least 1,500 schools and colleges by 1996. Pupils could take GNVQs
alongside GCSEs and A-levels.
'Vocational education has in the past been held in low esteem,' said Mr
Patten. 'We need to attack ingrained cultural attitudes that regard
practical and applied studies as inferior to theoretical A-level courses. We
need to promote parity of esteem between vocational and academic
qualifications.'
Mr Patten said employers had an important part to play and he hoped they
would all ensure that recruitment decisions and advertising material gave
due credit to GNVQ achievement.
Young people, he said, were sophisticated and could read signals from the
employment market. 'If they think that employers value higher levels of
education and skills, and are prepared to reward them, they will aim for
those higher levels. If they think that employers value the vocational
routes they will follow these routes.'
The Institute of Personnel Management has questioned whether numerical
targets for education and vocational qualifications will be adequate to
generate the skills needed to sustain the UK as an economic force in the
21st century.
Mr David Wright, vice-president of the institute, which has welcomed the
targets in principle, said in Personnel Management, the monthly magazine,
that there needed to be a more strategic approach to the types of skills
required.
He said: 'Relying on local labour market intelligence to match immediate
local demand for and supply of skills is fine, but there needs to be a more
strategic national and long-term focus.' It was to be regretted that such a
role was outside the remit of the new employer-led advisory body on the
targets.
A central role of the new body, the National Advisory Council for Education
and Training Targets, is to persuade employers in England and Wales to take
up national vocational qualifications.
Mr Wright said NVQs would not be welcomed by employers if they were
perceived to increase the price of training over and above present
expenditure and if they added to bureaucracy.

FT  06 APR 93 / Consumer credit demand slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR credit by consumers slackened in February, but remained above the
depressed levels of last year, government figures released yesterday show.
New borrowing through finance houses, building societies and certain bank
credit cards rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 49m in February, after a
Pounds 151m rise in January.
Extra borrowings - taking into account repayments and excluding mortgages
and bank overdrafts - in the three months to the end of February totalled
Pounds 305m, well above the Pounds 64m in the previous three months.
The Central Statistical Office data reinforce recent indications of a muted
recovery. This interpretation was supported by Bank of England figures on
the M0 narrow measure of money supply and by the CSO's latest set of
cyclical economic indicators.
M0, which is mainly notes and coins in circulation, rose by a strong 4.9 per
cent in the year to March, compared with a 4.5 per cent year-on-year rise in
February.
The longer-leading index compiled by the CSO, which is supposed to give
advance warning of economic growth, registered 109.6 in February, after
108.9 in January.
In February consumers showed less willingness to use bank credit cards to
increase borrowings. They repaid a net Pounds 8m on cards which are part of
the Visa or Mastercard systems, after borrowing Pounds 40m on these cards in
January. In the three months to the end of February net repayments on cards
came to Pounds 11m, after repayments of Pounds 63m in the previous three
months.
Total new consumer credit in February taken through cards, building
societies and finance houses was Pounds 4.39bn, after Pounds 3.93bn in
January. Between December and February new credit came to Pounds 12.95bn, up
from Pounds 12.27bn in the previous three months.
The CSO published revised estimates of the amount of credit borrowed in the
last six months of last year that indicate demand for lending in the final
quarter was higher than previously thought.
Consumer loans through retailers, building societies, all types of credit
cards and other credit agencies rose by Pounds 291m in the final quarter
rather than the Pounds 153m initially estimated. The corresponding figure
for the third quarter was Pounds 203m, after a Pounds 392m first estimate.
Overseas institutions bought Pounds 1.031bn worth of gilts in February, the
biggest monthly figure since June 1991, figures from the Bank of England
show. Total gilt sales came to about Pounds 3.2bn in February.

FT  06 APR 93 / Leyland Daf receivers to appeal over parts ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of truck and van maker Leyland Daf will urge the
Court of Appeal this morning to avert a crisis for management buy-out
attempts.
If the receivers lose, management buy-out initiatives at the Leyland and
Birmingham plants would be in difficulty because of a lack of parts.
The court will hear an appeal by Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the
joint administrative receivers for Leyland Daf, against a High Court
decision in London last week not to compel Automotive Products, a subsidiary
of the BBA engineering group, to continue supplying components.
The components, chiefly brake assemblies and some clutches, are used at both
the truck assembly plant at Leyland in Lancashire and the van plant in
Birmingham.
Automotive Products is refusing to deliver brake and clutch components until
it is paid more than Pounds 758,000. It says it is owed this for parts
supplied before Leyland Daf went into receivership in February.
At the time of the hearing, the receivers warned that production could be
halted at the van plant as early as yesterday and that truck assembly could
end later this week.
However, the receivers said yesterday that a rescheduling of production
operations around the Easter holiday meant that the plants were unlikely to
be halted before the middle of next week. It is understood that about 15
companies are refusing to supply Leyland Daf, although the Automotive
Products case is the most critical.
Leamington Spa-based Automotive Products makes components specifically for
Leyland Daf vehicles, and both the Leyland and Birmingham plants acknowledge
that it would take months to establish an alternative supplier. Managers at
the van plant, in particular, had hoped to conclude a buy-out as early as
next week.
Counsel for the receivers argued unsuccessfully in the chancery division of
the High Court that Automotive Products was in breach of European Community
trading law by abusing its dominant position as a supplier and holding the
company to ransom.

FT  06 APR 93 / Executive pay growth slows further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES' pay rises slowed further over the 12 months to April 1,
according to the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and
actuaries. But although employers are applying the brake, they are not
pushing it as hard as they were six months ago.
The group's index shows that the average pay for all ranks of executives
increased by 5.7 per cent in the 12 months ended last Thursday, compared
with 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to April 1 last year.
Of the latest 5.7-point gain, however, more than half has come in the six
months since September.
The index - which also includes the value of benefits such as cars and
pensions as well as salaries and bonuses - is based on a survey of 5,362
managers in 422 companies in the UK.
Noble Lowndes says that the proportion of managers whose pay is completely
frozen is now 6.3 per cent, compared with 7.1 per cent a year ago. The great
majority of the remainder have had rises of at least twice the government's
1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector increases.
Among the managers, chief executives and directors of big companies with
sales turnovers of more than Pounds 600m have continued to improve their
differential over other groups.

FT  06 APR 93 / Annual-hours contracts spread rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE OF contracts fixing the number of hours worked each year rather than
each week is increasing rapidly, particularly in the service sector, a
survey by the Institute of Personnel Management shows.
'Annualised hours' contracts allow companies to cope with varying demand and
cut overtime costs.
The survey, due to be published in full next month, found that of more than
80 organisations operating annualised hours schemes, 60 per cent had
introduced them since 1989. In the service sector, more than 65 per cent of
the companies surveyed had brought them in since 1991.
Nearly all the organisations using annualised hours were extremely
satisfied, the IPM said.
The majority also considered that employees liked it, although some workers
complained about 'reserve hours' in some schemes, which meant that they
could be called in to work at very short notice to cover absence or
unexpected demand.
Cardiff-based Matsushita Electric, making televisions and microwave ovens,
reported in the survey that it had saved about Pounds 3m since introducing
annualised hours for about 1,500 production workers in January last year.
The company has been able to organise working hours around seasonal
variations in demand - 60 per cent to 65 per cent of demand for its products
comes between September and December.
Some companies, however, including Bristol and West Building Society and
ITN, reported that the recession was making it difficult to decide on the
right number of hours one year ahead.
The institute reported that there was increasing evidence of annualised
hours contracts being introduced to retain valued staff, as well as for the
more traditional reasons of meeting demand and cutting overtime payments.
Some women returning to work after having children asked for annualised
hours so they could work more flexibly, it said.

FT  06 APR 93 / Judges call eating-up time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTAURANTS ARE entitled to give customers 'eating-up time' in the same way
that public houses can give drinking-up time, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
In a decision that could have wide implications for the restaurant trade,
the judges ruled that magistrates erred in law in convicting Mr Anwar Amin,
joint holder of a licence for the Dhaka tandoori restaurant in Southampton,
of staying open too late.
The city's magistrates fined Mr Amin Pounds 100 in June 1991 when they found
him guilty of contravening a condition of his late-night refreshment house
licence which prevented him from 'keeping open' between 3am and 5am.
Mr Amin admitted that about 30 people were still eating at 3.45am on a
Sunday in November 1990, when two women police officers visited his Onslow
Road restaurant.
But he argued that the mere fact that the officers could get in through an
unlocked door did not necessarily mean the restaurant was being kept open
within the meaning of the Late Night Refreshment Houses Act 1969.
The act regulates places kept open between 10pm and 5am for 'public
refreshment, resort and entertainment'.
No customers were admitted after 3am, and diners were in various stages of
finishing their meals, Mr Amin argued.
Southampton magistrates decided he was guilty of an offence because the
officers could get into the restaurant without hindrance.
Allowing an appeal against the conviction, Mr Justice Rougier, sitting with
Lord Justice Watkins, said that if the magistrates' interpretation of the
law was correct it would place restaurant owners in 'an impossible
situation' and mean that customers had to be out by closing time. Those in
the restaurant at 3am were entitled to finish their meals, he said.

FT  06 APR 93 / Joblessness 'will peak at 3.1m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT WILL continue to rise for only a few more months, peaking at
3.1m, but will still be about 2.5m by the end of the century, according to
the annual review of the economy and employment by the Institute for
Employment Research.
The institute at Warwick University expects a net 500,000 additional jobs by
2000, most of which will be part-time jobs taken by women in the service
sector. The female labour force is expected to grow by 500,000 over the next
decade.
The movement away from primary and manufacturing industries to the service
sector will continue, with manufacturing expected to lose another 600,000
jobs in the next decade. The new jobs will also continue the trend towards a
more divided labour market with many being low-pay/low-status jobs and
others being relatively high-pay/high-status.
The growth in clerical and secretarial work, which now accounts for just
over 4m jobs, will stop as a result of new technology, the institute says.
It expects an increase of about 150,000 clerical and secretarial jobs by the
end of the decade.
Skilled manual occupations will decrease by about 500,000 and plant and
machine operatives by about 400,000 by the end of the decade. The utilities
will lose an estimated 80,000 jobs by 2000, the report says, with the
biggest decrease in the electricity industry.
An increase of 750,000 posts is projected for managers and administrators
with a further 800,000 new jobs in professional and associate professional
and technical occupations such as laboratory assistants.
Part-time jobs accounted for the whole of the 1.2m increase in employment
between 1980 and 1990 and an extra 750,000 part-time posts are expected
before 2000.
The growth in self-employment, which in the 1980s was concentrated in
construction and certain parts of the service sector, is likely to increase
again following the decline in 1991 and last year. About 200,000 additional
self-employed jobs are expected before the end of the decade.

FT  06 APR 93 / Living costs show biggest fall for over 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVING COSTS have fallen more in the past year than at any time for more
than two decades, a study published today indicates.
The Reward Group, a consultancy specialising in pay and consumer studies,
calculates that in February a family with average needs in terms of housing
and consumer purchases required an income 5.1 per cent less than a year
previously to maintain its standard of living.
The year-on-year fall in living costs is the biggest since Reward started
its twice-yearly studies in 1972. This contrasts with the comparable
year-on-year decline of 0.7 per cent last August.
The findings support other indications of low inflationary conditions as a
result of the recession. While the muted level of price rises for many
consumer goods played a part in the overall fall in living costs, the
biggest factor was that housing costs for home owners fell by 19.7 per cent
in the year to February, mainly due to lower interest rates.
For the relatively small number of people who rent their homes from local
authorities housing costs rose 12.1 per cent because of higher rents.
Reward bases its results on a survey of average costs for a group of eight
hypothetical four-person families with different spending habits.
The annual income needed to support the families - which in each case
includes one adult in employment, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged eight -
works out at between Pounds 11,728 and Pounds 71,215, depending on
lifestyles.
In terms of the incomes needed for a set standard of living, Greater London,
Woking, Welwyn Garden City, Berkhamsted and Slough are the dearest places in
Britain while Northern Ireland, Peterhead, Thurso, Doncaster and Barnsley
are the cheapest.
The current downward pressures on the cost of living are, however, greatest
in Greater London, and lowest in Northern Ireland.
The report says that in the past 12 months food prices have not risen at all
while fuel costs have fallen by 0.5 per cent and transport costs have risen
by 3.5 per cent.

CONFIDENCE about order prospects among UK exporters has fallen in the past
three months, a survey by DHL, the international distribution company,
shows.
Its export confidence index, based on replies to its survey, stood at 51 in
the first quarter after 56 in the fourth quarter of last year and 33 in the
third quarter.
The survey underlines how the weak state of many foreign industrial
economies may hold back growth in the UK.

FT  06 APR 93 / Tax burden 'set to hit four-year high'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXATION as a proportion of national income is set to rise this year to the
highest level for four years, according to the Adam Smith Institute, the
free market think tank.
It says the proportion will rise this year to 41.68 per cent from 39.43 per
cent last year and 42.18 per cent in 1989.
The institute says the change is 'deeply disturbing', adding that after the
early 1980s, when taxation as a proportion of national income fell back,
Britain 'is once more becoming a high tax economy, less attractive for
foreign investors and less friendly to home grown entrepreneurs'.
Some of the increase is due to the recession which has pushed up social
security spending while income has fallen, the institute says.

FT  06 APR 93 / Abbey puts home cover cost up 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the country's second-largest mortgage lender, announced
yesterday that it is to increase premiums on home contents insurance
policies by an average of 26 per cent, underlining the recent upward trend
in premium rates.
The rise follows increases elsewhere in the insurance market and comes after
a steep increase in theft costs. Last week the Association of British
Insurers announced that the the cost of theft claims in 1992 had risen 27
per cent on the previous year to Pounds 749m.
Although the increase appears to be slightly ahead of the trend of rises
elsewhere in the insurance market, the premiums charged until now by Abbey
are understood to be cheaper than its main rivals.
Abbey sells home structure and contents policies on behalf of a a 'panel' of
three insurers: Commercial Union, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General.
Earlier this year all three announced that they had increased premium rates
in most classes of insurance following heavy underwriting losses over the
past three years. The rises will take effect from the date that policies are
renewed.
However, customers renewing their policies between May and the end of the
year will also pay an average rise of 10 per cent announced in December last
year, taking their total increase to 37 per cent.
Mr Ambrose McGinn, head of product marketing at Abbey, said the increase was
'regrettable'.

FT  06 APR 93 / Japanese steer around Maastricht storms:  The tortuous
progress of the Maastricht treaty in Britain is portrayed by the government
and its supporters as damaging to the national interest. Delays or
non-ratification, they say, threaten inward investment by presenting Britain
as 'half in and half out of Europe'.  But what do the inward investors
think?

<TEXT>
ASK leading Japanese manufacturers if they are discouraged by the debate
over Maastricht from locating in Britain and some will betray annoyance at
the mere suggestion. Most will point to large strategic investments, already
made, to which they pledge commitment.
Toyota Motor in Tokyo is a good example. 'Considering the time, energy, and
money put into organising suppliers, distribution networks and shipping
ports, withdrawing from the UK is absolutely out of the question,' it said.
The company has invested more than Pounds 500m in a car plant in Derbyshire
and an engine plant in Wales.
Sony, the consumer electronics company, said there would be no change in
investment policies even if debates over Maastricht and the UK's return to
the European exchange rate mechanism continued. The company exports
televisions to continental Europe from its plant in Wales.
Sony said: 'It's probably unavoidable that every country has their
differences over further unification, but we're willing to wait three, five
or even 10 years.'
Toray, which manufactures synthetic fibres, has just completed its third
polyester plant in Nottingham. The company supplies Marks and Spencer, and
ships half of its products manufactured in the UK to continental Europe.
The company is philosophical: 'We don't think most of us will live to see
complete unification in Europe,' adding that many Japanese companies had set
up plants and distribution networks in the UK ahead of 1993. 'What happens
after that won't have much economic impact (on the company).'
Ricoh, the office machinery maker which manufactures copier machines and
parts in the UK, said: 'Politics and currencies are a cultural matter for
the countries involved,' stressing that the most important factor for
further investment was the economy and market demand.
For smaller Japanese companies yet to move into Europe, ratification of
Maastricht may not have as much weight as some Europhiles stress. A
researcher at Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), an affiliate of the
ministry of industry and trade, said the main criteria for choosing an area
for investment were market size and labour costs.
'This worry over Maastricht and Japanese companies is overdone. People see
great importance in the single market, where goods and services flow freely,
but prospects of what lies beyond that is not a major concern,' he added.
A Jetro survey of 433 Japanese companies with manufacturing or research and
development bases in Europe indicated that immediate reaction to the single
European market was muted, and that companies were still trying to assess
the effects.
Only 31.1 per cent said integration was having a positive effect on their
business, while 65.6 per cent indicated the effects were neither clearly
positive or negative.
On economic and currency unification, 72.5 per cent expect the process to be
delayed, while 21 per cent thought that not all EC members would
participate.
The survey also indicated that the UK remains the most favoured EC country -
27.7 per cent of 713 companies had chosen to locate manufacturing centres in
the UK.
The availability of English-speaking workers, distribution systems and
infrastructure are some of the reasons for the UK's popularity.
It is also worth noting that most investment decisions were made in the
1980s, when the UK's attitude towards Europe was unclear.
According to the Jetro report, the main reason for Japanese companies
cutting back on investments, or even pulling out of Europe, was the flagging
European economy. This suggests that Mr John Major, the prime minister, may
be successful in wooing more Japanese investment if the UK economy, and the
European market, pulls clear of recession.

FT  06 APR 93 / Concerted action urged on exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Needham, a trade and industry minister, moved yesterday to
encourage exporters to work more closely together in bidding for large
projects in foreign markets.
The government will aim to pinpoint 'national champions' to take the lead in
particular export sectors - including power, water, airports, transport and
oil and gas.
The action forms part of a wide-ranging effort to boost UK exports and
hinges on concern that contracts have been lost because UK companies have
been fighting against each other rather than against foreign competitors in
their efforts to win a contract.
Earlier this year North West Water and Thames Water lost a contract in
Buenos Aires to Generale des Eaux of France after competition between them
led to neither arranging export finance in time.
Mr Needham said he was 'determined to help create a unified British approach
to the challenge which the main project markets present. Companies need to
work together more effectively.' France and Japan in particular are seen as
having been effective in co-ordinating the efforts of local companies to win
large international contracts.
The change would 'provide focus and strategy and administrative structure to
back winners, and stop us murdering each other to the delight of our
competitors,' Mr Needham added.
The aim was to reorganise the Overseas Projects Board at the DTI, the job of
which is to ensure close links between the government and industry in bids
for big export projects.
New sector groups headed by businesspeople rather than government officials
would pinpoint UK export strengths in the sectors concerned, identify
priority export markets, seek joint ventures in infrastructure projects, and
look for opportunities for collaboration in developing countries in
particular as they privatised sectors of their economies.
The groups would identify circumstances where 'a single bid will improve the
UK's chances of securing major business (and will advise) on the selection
of one company or one group of companies to put forward the most effective
national bid when several UK companies are competing for a particular
project'.
Mr Needham said the reorganisation 'signals an important change of focus'.
It formed part of a wider aim to boost earnings from large contract exports
from an expected Pounds 10bn this year to Pounds 20bn by 2000.
Recently the government has taken steps to work with industry to aid
exporters. Additional export credit cover has been made available in
'concentrated markets' where UK exporters have been particularly successful
 -such as Indonesia, India, Malaysia, China and Hong Kong.
A campaign to boost exports to the US, launched a month ago, harnesses
proposals culled from industry (such as targeting 20 US sectors in which UK
exporters have strength) an education programme for exporters and 'strategic
alliances' introducing exporters to prospective US partners.

FT  06 APR 93 / NUT calls on Patten to halt compulsory tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE largest teachers' union yesterday called on Mr John Patten, education
secretary, to call a temporary halt to all compulsory testing in English and
Welsh schools.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
speaking as teachers' unions prepare for their annual conferences, said it
would be unfair to proceed with the tests if the government was planning a
review of the national curriculum and its testing arrangements.
This year's tests are already being boycotted by the NASUWT, the
second-largest teaching union after an overwhelming vote in favour.
The NUT will ballot its members next month on a boycott of the new English
tests for 14-year-olds. However, Mr McAvoy predicted that the union's annual
conference, which opens in Brighton on Saturday, will support a call to
widen the boycott.
Last night a Tory MP joined the criticism of Mr Patten. Mr Hugh Dykes, Tory
MP for Harrow East, said: 'I hope Mr Patten will see the logic of suspending
the 14-year-old test and looking at some of the similar problems elsewhere.'
The moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers, in conference at Cardiff
this week, looks likely to join the boycott of the tests.
Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, has warned Mr Patten that mounting
pressure on his union's members to boycott the tests will be difficult, if
not impossible, to withstand.
Both head teachers' unions have warned ministers that they cannot guarantee
that the tests will continue if boycotts spread. This would threaten the
collection of data for schools' performance league tables.
A newly formed group of head teachers, the National Co-ordinating Committee
on Learning and Assessment, is also threatening to support the boycott of
all national tests and to set alternative exams.
Mr Patten will address the ATL conference on Wednesday, and is expected to
resist calls for a halt to the tests.
However, he is likely to stress that the national curriculum and tests -
criticised as overloaded, over-elaborate and too time-consuming - will be
reviewed to make them more manageable for teachers, yet challenging and
rewarding for pupils.
Mr Patten is relying on heads and school governors to see that the
government tests go ahead as planned.
Mr David Pascall, the departing chairman of the National Curriculum Council,
last week urged the government to review the tests and slim down the
national curriculum.

FT  06 APR 93 / Unions poised for more rail action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE disruption on the railways can be expected next week. The executive of
the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union meets today to decide on its next
move following last Friday's 24-hour stoppage on the railway network.
Unless British Rail guarantees no future compulsory redundancies, RMT looks
set to call another one-day strike, perhaps in mid-week. Tomorrow, the train
drivers' union Aslef will announce the result of a strike ballot. Its
leaders are confident of backing for a 24-hour stoppage.
RMT members at Sealink Stena ferries are also expected to join strike action
at ports while workers in the railway workshops are likely to join in the
next 24-hour stoppage.
The National Union of Mineworkers and London bus workers could also be
involved in further stoppages.
None of the unions can hold 24-hour stoppages indefinitely. By law they have
to hold further strike ballots within 28 days of their last ballots.

FT  06 APR 93 / Sport of kings run on a shoestring: The Grand National
fiasco comes at a lean time for horseracing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW did it happen? How did a sport like horseracing, which generates
billions in betting turnover, manage to fall so painfully on its face? How
did the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree racecourse in Liverpool end
in fiasco on Saturday?
After weeks, or even months, of infighting and buck-passing the finger of
blame will be pointed at two groups: the Jockey Club, which runs British
racing, and the management of Aintree racecourse.
In spite of the billions bet on horseracing, it remains an amateurish sport
at many levels - including that of the racecourses, many of which are owned
by small companies run by people with inadequate training, aptitude or
skills. Some racecourses - such as Ascot, owned by the Queen - are nests of
snobbery.
Racecourses and the sport in general are suffering from the recession. The
59 British racecourses saw estimated revenues of Pounds 64m in 1991, while
their costs were about Pounds 77m. However, they received Pounds 7.1m in
1991 from the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which levies bookmakers'
turnover and allocates funds for the benefit of racing. This reduced their
overall deficit that year to an estimated Pounds 6.8m, against Pounds 5.3m
the previous year.
Many courses are run on a shoestring and their facilties are often poor,
relying on the services of low-paid helpers and officials.
Although recent tax improvements, including VAT changes in the last Budget,
will eventually help the sport, its fortunes have suffered in recent years
as owners have sold out or reduced their involvements because of rising
costs and lower prize money.
Britain's 9,000 racehorse owners shouldered a total deficit in 1990
estimated by the sport at Pounds 152m. By now it may be greater. Between
1985 and 1992 the number of racehorse trainers fell from 1,018 to around
860, leading to more than 1,000 job losses in the racing world. And the
total number of horses in training - both flat and National Hunt - fell from
14,000 to 11,500.
Meanwhile, the stewards of the Jockey Club met at their London headquarters
yesterday to discuss how to minimise the damage done by the race being
declared void. A full inquiry has now been ordered.
The race was declared void after officials failed to halt a majority of the
horses and their jockeys following the second of two false starts. An
estimated Pounds 60m in UK betting turnover now has to be refunded to
punters, while the government lost tax revenues and bookmakers lost hundreds
of thousands of pounds in marketing expenses.
However, William Hill, the bookmaker, has decided not to pursue its loss
through legal action. It had been considering a claim for negligence against
the Jockey Club and Aintree racecourse. The chain said: 'If we pressed a
case against Aintree, as we would have to, it could bankrupt the course.'
William Hill has 1,800 betting shops and took about Pounds 15m in Grand
National bets. The company said it had spent about Pounds 200,000 on
pre-race marketing and administration.
The biggest bookmaker, Ladbroke, with about 2,000 shops, said it handled
about 25 per cent of the amount bet on the race.
Meanwhile, Mr John Major dismissed the idea that the fiasco has affected
Manchester's chances of hosting the 2000 Olympic Games.
After a visit to the Swiss headquarters of the international Olympic
Committee as part of his effort to boost Manchester's bid, the prime
minister said: 'Someone made a mistake. It went wrong. That has to be set
against a British sporting reputation built up over generations.'

FT  06 APR 93 / Lib Dems 'living in sin with Labour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday opened a second front in their campaign for next
month's county council elections in England and Wales by publishing their
own survey of party alliances in local government which denounces the
Liberal Democrats as 'Labour's stooges'.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, described Liberal Democrat
councillors as 'living in sin with Labour up and down the land'.
There were, he said, no pacts between Liberal Democrats and Tories on county
councils. Tory central office admitted, however, that there was a formal
pact between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Wolverhampton borough
council, and that there might be one or two informal arrangements in other
non-county councils.
Reflecting the emphasis on the cost of local government, which is already
dominating the campaign, the Tory survey lists examples of Liberal
Democrats' support for Labour budgets in Avon, Bedfordshire, Cheshire and
Cumbria; and Liberal Democrats joining with Labour in Oxfordshire to defeat
Tory budget plans.
The Tories are also highlighting arrangements between the other parties
occurred where Conservatives are the largest single party.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, accused the Liberal Democrats
of striking 'cosy deals with Labour regardless of the clear wishes of the
local electorate'.
With one eye on the Liberal Democrat challenge to the Tories in the Newbury
parliamentary by-election - expected to coincide with the local elections -
Mr Howard cited the position on Berkshire county council, where the Liberal
Democrats had put Labour into power even though the Tories were by far the
largest party.
The Liberal Democrats are a focus of attack in these elections because they
are bound to perform better than when the 3,500 county council seats were
last contested. The 1989 local elections took place as the alliance between
the Liberals and the Social Democrats was falling apart.

FT  06 APR 93 / Time for audits 'not long enough'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUNIOR STAFF in accountancy firms believe that the time allowed for their
work for audit clients is not sufficient, the British Accounting Association
annual conference was told yesterday.
The findings, based on an initial analysis of 36 accountants at all levels
of seniority in response to a fictitious auditing case study, are contained
in a study by Mr John Dunn and Ms Anne Fergusson of the University of
Strathclyde.
Mr Dunn suggested that this might show the perceived level of low tendering
by accountants did not lead to short cuts in auditing but to greater
pressure on staff to maintain standards. But more senior managers and
partners believe that the time allocated through budgets was sufficient.
Mr Dunn stressed that he had found no evidence that time pressures on staff
reduced the quality of the audit. None of the respondents spent more than 8
hours a week on a client beyond the amount of time allocated. Most coped
with the extra workload by coming in early or working through their lunch
hour.
Partners in Irish accountancy firms back efforts to limit the threat of
litigation against them, the conference heard yesterday.
A survey by Mr Peter Green and Ms Jacqueline Granleese of the University of
Ulster found that accountants also recognised that any attempt to limit
their exposure would be seen as not providing the best protection for
investors using audited accounts.

FT  06 APR 93 / Pakistan seeks to allay US fears over terrorist links
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NISAR ALI KHAN, cabinet member and chief political adviser to Pakistan's
prime minster, is due to arrive in Washington today for discussions with US
officials over recent allegations that Pakistan was supporting terrorism in
Indian-controlled Kashmir.
Senior Pakistani officials and politicians fear Washington might put
Pakistan on a list of terrorist states alongside countries such as Libya and
Iran, but western diplomats in Islamabad discount the possibility.
'They (Americans) are not likely to label Pakistan as a terrorist state . .
. because it has not been involved in the same sort of anti-western
campaigns as Iran or Libya,' a western diplomat said.
The Bush administration considered terrorist allegations against Pakistan
last December, but decided not to press the case. Now the Clinton
administration is reviewing the allegations.
The Pakistani visit is part of a recent effort by Islamabad to convince the
outside world that the allegations are part of an Indian-backed campaign to
discredit Pakistan.
Pakistan has also come under pressure from Egypt over allegations that Arab
terrorists carrying out attacks in northern Africa are being trained in
Pakistan.
Last week, Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister gave assurances to the Egyptian
president, Mr Hosni Mubarak that Islamabad would clamp down on Arab suspects
allegedly being trained by Islamic activists in Pakistan.
While it appears unlikely Pakistan will be listed as a terrorist country by
the US, Pakistan is taking the issue seriously, in part because 'it only
adds to previous strains over the nuclear issue', according to one official.
Washington suspended military and economic aid to Pakistan in October 1990
after allegations that Islamabad was developing nuclear weapons.
Pakistani paramilitary forces arrested the leader of a march on the
Indian-defended ceasefire line dividing Kashmir yesterday, Reuter reports
from Seri, Pakistan.
Officials ordered the arrest of the leader, Mr Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, and
102 followers after they threatened to storm a police barricade.
About 2,000 marchers in Seri, a small town 23km from the line of control,
had staged a sit-in on the second day of the march, saying they would break
through police barriers unless Pakistan opened routes into the disputed
region.
The march was organised to show support for a three-year separatist
rebellion in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
Mr Rathore, leader of the Kashmir branch of opposition leader Benazir
Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, was arrested after army officers failed to
persuade him to call off the march.
Earlier, he had appealed to the crowd to disperse.

FT  06 APR 93 / HK services follow industry's path to mainland: High
inflation fuels migration in search of lower land and labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1980s Hong Kong's manufacturing base moved wholesale to southern
China in pursuit of cheap labour and land. Now its service industries are
trying to do the same thing.
The colony's manufacturers moved back to the mainland in the mid-1980s after
Deng Xiaoping's move to open the Chinese economy to market forces and
foreign investment. They now employ about 3m in southern China, mostly in
neighbouring Guangdong, and as a result Hong Kong's entrepreneurs control
twice the industry they did before the move back.
Like their colleagues in manufacturing, the chiefs of the colony's service
industries are seeking to take advantage of lower costs across the border.
But the motivation is different; it has more to do with escaping Hong Kong's
persistently high inflation than with vague feelings of nationalism or the
sense of 'going home'.
Prices in Hong Kong rose at an annual rate of 8.7 per cent in February, but
underlying inflation - which excludes energy and food prices - is at an
annual rate of about 11 per cent.
According to Mr Keith Ferguson, regional economist at W I Carr, the
stockbrokers, Hong Kong suffers from structural inflation.
'The two key constraints are land and labour and that shows up in two
sub-indices of the consumer price index, services and housing, which have
been growing at annual rates of 13 per cent and 15 per cent respectively,'
he says.
These constraints are compounded by the Hong Kong dollar's link to the
dollar. For the past 10 years it has been fixed at a rate of HKDollars 7.8.
This means that Hong Kong is unable to run a monetary policy independent of
the US.
Interest rates track US rates, which have been designed to stimulate growth
in a mature economy. In high-growth Hong Kong, low interest rates have
fuelled stock and property market speculation, promoting asset price
inflation.
An expansionary budget, introduced by Hong Kong's governor Mr Chris Pattern
in February, is also seen as promoting inflation. The Hong Kong government's
fiscal balance moved from a surplus of more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds
1.8bn) last year to a forecast deficit of HKDollars 3.5bn in 1993-94 - a
change equivalent to nearly 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
It is unlikely that banking, aviation and telecommunications will be able to
relocate their operations with as much ease as manufacturers found. One
estimate, by Hang Seng Bank, puts the potential relocation at less than 10
per cent of the services work force in Hong Kong, or about 120,000 jobs.
But, as Mr Rod Edd-ington, managing director of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's
international airline, says: 'Inflation is forcing Hong Kong business to
rethink the way they do things. Either capital moves to labour or labour
moves to capital.'
For Cathay, and its related companies, this had meant a bit of both. Cathay
has relocated 200 'back office' accounts jobs to Guangzhou (Canton) for a
salaries bill 25 per cent of what it was paying in Hong Kong.
It has also established a back-up computer centre in Sydney; and it is
encouraging its pilots to opt for 'home basing', that is, for Australian,
Canadian and European pilots, to live in their home country rather than Hong
Kong.
'Cathay has much of its cost base in Hong Kong,' says Mr Eddington.
'Inflation has had a significant negative effect on our business. Our
product is sold in an international market place where competitive pressures
are truly international.'
In a related development, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, Haeco,
recently signed a joint venture agreement with the Xiamen special economic
zone in Fujian province to build a USDollars 63m (Pounds 44m) aircraft
maintenance facility in the zone. The facility - which is expected to be
operational in 1996 - will consist of a hangar capable of accommodating two
Boeing 747s, together with supporting workshops.
Again high costs of both labour and land is the motive for moving out of
Hong Kong. Haeco has been employing and training mainland workers who will
staff the Xiamen facility when it is completed.
The Hong Kong government recently gave Hongkong Bank approval to recruit up
to 350 workers from southern China to help it overcome branch network staff
shortages.
Says Mr Paul Selway-Swift, head of the bank in Hong Kong: 'I can not recruit
enough tellers. I think there has got to be a move to try to take advantage
of the pool of labour that exists across the border.'
The importation of labour will not produce cost savings per se - the bank
will house the people it recruits and that, together with salary, will equal
the cost of a local hire - but it may help relieve the labour shortage.
'What has happened in the last few years is the growth in demand for service
sector employees, especially in hotels and department stores. The new
entrants have to pay more than us and when we raise pay so do they. Once we
have trained someone it does not take much more training for them to adapt
to another job.'
There is an added benefit for Hongkong Bank - similar to that for Haeco -
from the importation of labour. It has ambitions to conduct full service
banking in China, and a trained-in-Hong-Kong mainland staff would be a
useful resource to staff such an operation.
'In the back of our mind we are aware that they could be useful to us in
China, but that is not the reason we are doing it,' says Mr Selway-Swift.

FOREIGN MINISTERS of Gulf Arab states started a second day of talks in Saudi
Arabia yesterday to find ways of countering energy taxes proposed by the US
and Europe, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The two-day meeting in Riyadh is the last in a series of talks by Gulf
Co-operation Council (GCC) states, which control over half the world's
proven oil reserves, to co-ordinate a unified position before talks with the
European Community next month.
Mr Mohammad Sahlawi, spokesman for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, was reported in the Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh as saying that Opec
would continue to try to explain its opposition to the tax.
The foreign ministers were also discussing the stalled Middle East peace
process, the United Arab Emirates' dispute with Iran over three strategic
Gulf islands, and Iraq's compliance with Gulf War-related UN resolutions.
The GCC groups Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)
heavyweights Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar with
small independent producers Oman and Bahrain.
The six states fear the tax would reverse a projected rise in oil demand and
hit earnings. The proposed US tax would levy around Dollars 3.50 on each
barrel of imported oil.
Gulf exporters are worried it will spur the EC to go ahead with plans for a
similar tax, which could add Dollars 10 over 10 years to the cost of a
barrel of imported oil. Gulf oil ministers will take the proposals to a
meeting in Oman in mid-April between Opec and other producers to map out a
strategy to counter the tax.

FT  06 APR 93 / Ramos takes emergency powers to cope with crippling power
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos of the Philippines yesterday signed a bill giving him
emergency powers to deal with electric power shortages that have disrupted
the economy.
Daily power cuts, lasting six to eight hours, have occurred since the year
began, sometimes in peak hours, disrupting industry and households.
The new law allows Mr Ramos to negotiate contracts for building new power
plants, instead of having to go through the legal bidding process. This is
expected to spur a 1,600 megawatt expansion of the Luzon grid, which
services Manila and nearby industrial centres.
This would cover a shortfall in capacity and provide a reserve allowing
refurbishment of existing plants.
The president said the law 'gives me the requisite mandate to more
effectively address the problem,' which is hampering his administration's
efforts to pull the economy out of recession and catch up with more
prosperous neighbours.
The government is targeting growth in gross national product of 3.5 to 4.5
per cent this year, after a stagnant performance in the past two years.
Manila businesses have been forced by the power cuts to lay off some 71,000
workers, according to Ms Nieves Confesor, labour secretary.
Incomes of more than 2m time-rated workers have been halved because of
reduced working hours, she said.
The law authorises the government to raise the charges of the National Power
Corporation, the state-owned electricity company, enabling it to meet loan
covenants with foreign creditors, particularly the World Bank. A rate
increase was approved last December but opponents secured a restraining
order in the supreme court. The law circumvents the court embargo to satisfy
conditions of creditors. About Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) of new financing
for new power projects can now be expected from creditors. It also allows Mr
Ramos to reorganise the power company and possibly break it up into smaller
units which could be sold to private investors.
Another provision of the law channels part of earnings from state-run
gambling casinos into power projects.
The state national electrification administration yesterday secured
financing for acquisition of 104 mini-hydro power generators, with a
combined capacity of 51 megawatts, to be installed in the provinces.
The generators, financed with aid from Britain, China, France, Norway and
Australia, will be used to light homes and power irrigation pumps and rice
mills in rural areas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy is unlikely to recover until late this year, Mr Yasushi
Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, told regional branch managers
gathered yesterday to discuss a recent strengthening of some economic
indicators and the unexpected surge in stock prices.
Mr Mieno's comments came as the bank intervened in the Tokyo foreign
exchange market to halt the yen's sudden rise, which business groups have
warned may threaten economic recovery by putting extra pressure on
vulnerable export industries such as the electronics and car sectors.
A continuing weakness in capital spending in manufacturing industry was
reflected in a 26.2 per cent fall in orders of machine tools during
February, including a 36.2 per cent year-on-year plunge in orders from car
makers. The Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association said exports for the
month were down 5.7 per cent.
Japanese companies are being forced to reduce capital spending as many
industries are still attempting to trim excess production capacity. Pointing
to this trend and to weak consumer demand, Mr Mieno said final demand is
unlikely to recover until the second half of the fiscal year which began
this month.
He suggested that recent optimistic reports by private sector economists are
premature, as there is no certainty that a small increase in domestic car
sales and industrial production will be sustainable in coming months.
The regional branch managers have apparently brought generally gloomy
economic news with them to Tokyo, as private construction orders have fallen
sharply, putting added importance on a government economic package to be
finalised this month.
Concerned by fluctuations in the yen, the Bank of Japan intervened when the
Japanese currency hit a high of Y113.30 to the dollar during trading in
Tokyo yesterday - it closed at Y113.83. The bank was repeating its attempt
of Friday to blunt the rapid rise in the yen over the past two weeks.
Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have suggested that finance
ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will discuss the
currency markets at a meeting in Tokyo on April 14.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TOURISM in Kenya dropped sharply last year, reducing hard currency revenues
from the industry to Dollars 295m from Dollars 400m (Pounds 195m from Pounds
266m) in 1991, a government official said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Nairobi.
Mr Philemon Mwaisaka, permanent secretary at the ministry of tourism, blamed
the sharp downturn in visits to safari parks or Indian Ocean beaches on
reports in western countries, where most visitors come from, about attacks
on tourists, tribal violence and political unrest.
'Imagined insecurity in Kenya had convinced European-based tourists that the
country was not safe,' he said.
The run-up to December's first multi-party polls in 26 years was marred by
tribal violence.
This, coupled with bandit attacks on tourists, led to a fall in hotel
bookings of up to 60,000 bed-nights in the last five months of 1992, tourism
officials say.
Last year, some 700,000 tourists visited Kenya after a record 814,000 in
1991. But many, enticed by cheap bucket-shop deals, kept their wallets
closed while in the country.
Mr Mwaisaka said the government was fighting back with a vigorous campaign
to revitalise the industry and woo visitors.
He said security in national parks would be stepped up, more roads would be
built and accommodation would be improved.
'Protection of endangered species like elephants and rhinos has received
priority,' he added.
'Poaching has been reduced to almost zero and an elaborate security network
put in place to ensure tourists' safety and increased comfort,' he added.
The government has also begun aerial surveillance of game parks and issued
advice about which areas of Nairobi are considered dangerous. Fears for the
safety of tourists have been fuelled by attacks in game parks, particularly
the Masai Mara reserve.
Germany and the US have warned their nationals not to go to parks while
Britain and Australia have cautioned against travel in parks when
unaccompanied by rangers.
Kenya, which rejected International Monetary Fund and World Bank-backed
reforms last month, badly needs tourists to help purchase essential imports
and service a Dollars 7.1bn foreign debt.
President Daniel arap Moi, angered over an IMF refusal to reinstate critical
balance of payments support of around Dollars 40m a month, two weeks ago
called a halt to liberalisation policies and said Kenya would go its own
way.

FT  06 APR 93 / Fear of redundancy haunts company loyalists
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE executive returned to Toyko from business in the US recently to
find that his job had gone. He is still on the pay roll but now he gives
lectures on sexual harassment to colleagues being posted abroad.
He is one of a rising number of employees at Japanese companies whose roles
are redundant but who are still on the payroll because of the Japanese
corporate aversion to compulsory redundancy.
Kigyo-nai shitsugyo, or unemployment within companies, has become a growing
concern as companies struggle to cut costs in the face of a persistent
economic downturn.
Research institutes warn that unemployment, officially only 2.3 per cent at
1.57m, will rise sharply if economic activity fails to revive and companies
start to shed already 'redundant' staff.
Nissei Research Centre estimates that more than 600,000 paid workers were
redundant in all industries, excluding construction, in the fourth quarter
last year, the highest level of internal unemployment since the previous
peak after the first oil shock in the 1970s.
Nikko Research Centre believes the number is even higher. It estimates that
in manufacturing alone kigyo-nai shitsugyo in the fourth quarter of last
year was 1.15m.
The Bank of Japan, in its latest quarterly business survey, says the
proportion of manufacturers believing they have excess labour rose to 19 per
cent from 13 per cent in the previous survey.
Company after company has announced plans to cut recruitment next year, and
several, including NTT, the telecommunications group, and Japan Air Lines,
have announced plans to reduce significantly the number of employees on
their payrolls over a number of years. But there is concern that corporate
Japan is doing too little to deal with the burden of excess labour.
Faced with recession and dwindling profits, large Japanese companies have
generally cut staff costs by reducing overtime and bonuses, hiring fewer
contract employees and cutting the number of recruits.
Some are moving workers into areas where demand is stronger and seconding
some to subsidiaries; some are even asking staff to stay at home.
Voluntary early retirement is a last resort, while compulsory redundancies
are still unheard of among virtually all large corporations. Pioneer, which
makes compact disc players and video equipment, caused an uproar earlier
this year by forcing 35 of its senior directors into early retirement.
'People are not things,' says Mr Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, senior vice president
of Toshiba. 'We must find a way to employ our staff.'
Many of the Japanese corporations curtailing employment are having to pay
for the high number of recruits they took on in the boom years of the late
1980s. Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer company which is cutting
recruitment to 300 next year, took on nearly 4,000 in 1989.
Nikko Research warns there is a limit to the amount companies can achieve
with cost-cutting measures short of redundancy.
Mr Yasuo Kuwashima, chief economist at the Federation of Labour Unions'
Research Centre, believes it is difficult to quantify how many are
internally unemployed, but he is concerned that unemployment could rise in
coming months.
If job cuts start to feed through now, it is likely unemployment will drift
up until the end of the year, assuming the first quarter was the bottom of
the economic cycle (unemployment normally lags recovery by three quarters).
'But then again we don't yet know if the first quarter was the bottom,' says
Mr Kuwashima.

it had created a giant monopoly when the government wanted to reduce

FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Growth in air traffic slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Air Transport Association reported a 'disturbing' slowdown
in passenger traffic growth in February among its 213 member airlines as
businesses continued to cut air travel to reduce costs.
The report undermines hopes of an end to three years of economic woes which
have cost the airline industry collectively Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn).
The 800 business travellers surveyed by Iata said a cut in the number of
trips made was the main method of cost control. Second came the hunt for
cheap deals, third sending fewer people on trips and fourth a downgrade of
the class of travel.
More than a quarter of companies had cut their travel budgets in the past
six months, against 10 per cent which said the budget had risen. Around half
the companies thought developments in telecommunications could eventually
replace part of their travel.
The survey results come on the heels of a business class air fares war in
Europe. It intensified yesterday when British Airways cut fares until the
end of June by as much as a quarter from the UK to Paris, Amsterdam and
Helsinki.
The moves followed similar cuts in recent weeks by British Midland, Air
France, Finnair, the Dutch carrier KLM, and Aer Lingus, the Irish airline.
The reductions apply only on routes from London and leave a business class
return trip to Paris costing Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318
previously.
'We are trying to persuade people to trade up into business class,' said BA
yesterday.

MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday signed a Pounds
65m concessional loan to Indonesia to fund a 65MW power station to be built
by a UK company in Samarinda, East Kalimantan.
The contract for the project has not been awarded but, under the terms of
the loan, it must go to a British company. Mr Hurd rebutted suggestions
that, by tying the aid, the UK government was undermining the principle of
free trade.
British exports to Indonesia grew 58 per cent to Pounds 312m last year,
while Indonesian exports to the UK rose 29 per cent to Pounds 536m.
Officials say the loan is a belated effort to promote UK companies in an
Indonesian sector in which Dollars 30bn of investment is planned in the
1990s.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from France's new centre-right government pledged yesterday to
continue the previous administration's efforts to re-open last year's EC-US
farm trade agreement, a keystone of the Uruguay Round world trade talks.
Mr Alain Juppe, France's new foreign minister, told his EC colleagues that
the new administration still had to be convinced about the compatibility of
the November deal with the reform of EC common agricultural policy agreed
last May.
'This is of capital importance for us,' he told fellow ministers in
Luxembourg. 'It's of economic, political and social importance and I would
even say it's important for reasons of culture and civilisation.'
He also stressed that the government would continue its predecessor's
opposition to the EC-US deal on oilseeds, which is separate from the Uruguay
Round.
But Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British foreign office minister, warned Mr
Juppe the French would 'certainly not get anything better than the November
deal'.
The new government's chances of re-opening the agreement are slim. Senior
agriculture officials from the 12 EC members have already concluded that
Community undertakings within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) are compatible with the CAP reforms.
But Mr Juppe said after yesterday's meeting that there was still work to be
done: 'We have had a partial debate on certain consequences (of the EC-US
deal) but we think we haven't obtained a response to the overall question
(of compatibility)'.
Foreign ministers, who were discussing whether to endorse the Washington
deal, agreed to give the new French administration more time to form a view
on the package. The Socialist government, heavily defeated in last week's
elections, refused to sanction the EC-US agreement, principally on the
grounds that it would jeopardise France's lucrative cereals trade.
Although Mr Juppe said the new government would maintain the firm line of
the outgoing socialists, other ministers and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade
commissioner, welcomed the moderate tone in which the French views were
expressed - a far cry from some of the more strident pronouncements by
centre-right candidates on the hustings.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the new French trade minister, said the Commission should
be doing more to open a Gatt panel on US sanctions against EC steel exports.
He was pleased with the tough line being taken by Sir Leon in the dispute
over public procurement.

SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took its first steps towards developing a national
cellular telephone network when the government invited applications for the
two licences it plans to award.
The government sees cellular telephones as a means of introducing
competition into the telecommunications field - dominated by the parastatal
Telkom - and as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South
Africans access to a telephone.
Some fear the government may have set licence fees at a punitively high
level. Operators will have to pay an initial R100m (Pounds 21.8m) and 5 per
cent of net revenue in annual licence fees. Radio fees of R5m a year and
R20,000 a year for each 200kHz channel granted will also have to be paid.
Licences will be granted for 15 years. The two systems will probably cost
R3-400m each and have up to 400,000 subscribers jointly.
Licence applications have to be in by mid-June with the government hoping to
an announce its decision by June 30. Telkom has already been granted 50 per
cent of one licence. The UK company Cable &amp; Wireless is expected to tender
in partnership with M-Net, the locally based pay television station.
Selection criteria include such factors as the quality, reliability and
affordability of the service; technology transfer; local added value; job
creation; competition and consumer benefits and the financial soundness of
the applicant.
The government says a criterion which will 'weigh heavily' is how far the
applicant is prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped
part of the community where services are expected to be uneconomic.
A recent study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand - based on 1989 data - found that only
2.4 per cent of South Africa's black population had phones - more than three
times the average for Africa, excluding South Africa, but only a tenth of
the penetration in South Africa's white community.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Ports in the Channel tunnel storm - The
Humberside and Rotterdam alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTS of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the Humber in northern England
are to consider a series of joint promotions to cities, industry and
commerce north of London and on the EC mainland.
Each promotes separately at present, stressing the variety of their North
Sea links. The aim of joint marketing would be to boost traffic and trade
between them - in particular unitised freight (mainly containers) carried on
truck or trailer.
The advent of the Channel tunnel seems to have concentrated minds. Both
Rotterdam and Humberside authorities claim the tunnel, which is due to start
operating within 12 months, will have little impact on their operations. But
since it is making shippers think afresh on North Sea trade, this is
prompting the ports to promote themselves.
Rotterdam's Port Promotions Council, which sent more than 30 shippers and
business leaders to Hull for talks last month, is stressing its 'gateway'
role, offering immediate access to Europe's road, rail and inland waterway
network. Rotterdam handles an annual 290m tonnes of cargo, mainly bulk
chemicals or foodstuffs, but up to a fifth is in unitised form.
The Humberside Partnership - a British equivalent joint venture of public
and private sectors - is emphasising Britain's London transportation
bottleneck and the tunnel's comparatively tiny freight capacity of only 8m
tonnes a year at first.
Members of the partnership believe market forces and Britain's motorway
network already point to the Humber as the most natural route to and from
Europe for Scotland, northern England, the Midlands and Ireland. More than
60m tonnes of cargo a year are passing through - up to a quarter of it
unitised - and volumes have grown steadily, despite recession.
Associated British Ports, which owns the main ports of Hull, Immingham,
Grimsby and Goole last month reported its Humber traffic up 4 per cent in
1992 at nearly 50m tonnes.
Mr Stuart Bradley, ABP's chief executive, says the Humber is Britain's
busiest and fastest-growing waterway. The port of Hull in particular has
blossomed since the abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989,
which removed restrictive practices from stevedoring.
Hull has been able to increase container operations and re-open Alexandra
Dock, closed in 1982 because of overmanning and inefficiency. In November,
the port will have a new floating stage in the Humber so ships can avoid
locking into docks, thus cutting journey times.
North Sea Ferries, which already runs overnight passenger and freight
services between Hull and Rotterdam, is building two large, advanced
roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) cargo ships to operate from the new stage on the
250-mile Rotterdam route.
These will sail in each direction at 10pm and arrive at 8am the next day,
enabling a full day's truck driving on each side - enough to service large
cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, or Glasgow in
the UK or well into Germany from the Rotterdam side.
Mr Karel de Zeeuw, project manager of Rotterdam Port Promotion Council, says
container, palletised and ro-ro flows between Rotterdam and the UK are
principally to North Sea ports on the east coast of England.
Unless it becomes cheaper or quicker to get to and through the tunnel in
England, he says traffic flows north of London will be unaffected, so
existing shipping routes will not suffer.
The tunnel is expected to affect cargo flows between the UK, France, Italy
and Spain, but Rotterdam sees little of these anyway. Meanwhile, Mr de Zeeuw
intends to promote Rotterdam's direct link into the Rhine-Main-Danube canal
system to counter any effect the tunnel may have on cargo flows to southern
Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of the Hull-based Northern Foods, thinks the
tunnel's main attraction will be to the food industry. He would like to use
it to more than double the market for Northern Foods' Sheffield factory -
which makes a range of products for the UK retailer Marks and Spencer - to
110m people if the problem of the London bottleneck can be overcome.
Otherwise, he fears competitors in northern France may use the tunnel to
attack Northern Foods' markets in southern England, forcing him to consider
setting up in France.
Mr Henry Johnson, of AS Haulage of Hull, is chairman of the Humberside
branch of the Road Hauliers' Association. 'If we get an order to shift
something today from northern England and get it to Germany tomorrow, we can
ship it from the Humber and have it in Rotterdam in the morning. It is then
just four hours to the Ruhr.
'It is going to be very difficult to beat this sort of short-notice
flexibility using the tunnel,' he says.
The Humberside Partnership, formed two years ago, already has a series of
presentations planned for much of Britain north of London to spread the
message.

FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: BA cuts business fares in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business class price war between European airlines' fares intensified
yesterday when British Airways cut fares by as much as a quarter from the UK
to Paris, Amsterdam and Helsinki.
The moves follows similar cuts in recent weeks by British Midland, Air
France, Finnair, the Dutch carrier KLM, and Aer Lingus, the Irish airline.
The reductions apply only on routes from London and leave a business class
return trip to Paris costing Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318
previously.
'We are trying to persuade people to trade up into business class,' said BA.
'Many companies specify that business travel be in economy.'
The fares war is limited to highly competitive routes. A business class
return fare on London-Frankfurt, for example, which is only flown by British
Airways and Lufthansa fly, remains at more than Pounds 350.
Some of the tickets carry restrictions, usually specifying that the return
trip must be made within three days of departure. BA's fares do not, but are
only available until the end of June.
Such cuts in short-haul and in business class are unusual. Airlines are
struggling to attract corporate clients which have stayed away as the
recession in Europe has deepened. Companies have cut back on travel
spending, either by sending staff economy class or switching to
telecommunications for business meetings.
Economy fares cuts are common on busy long-haul routes. But the fight for
the cash-conscious business passenger began in earnest this winter.

FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Business to benefit in cold war clear-out
 -Hopes raised by Clinton pledge to review old Communist era restrictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN and American business could have much to gain from the long overdue
review promised by President Bill Clinton into the cold war legal relics
which contradict US policy supporting the democratisation of the former
Soviet states.
Mr Clinton promised in Vancouver on Sunday to review all such outstanding
regulations that Russia felt was hindering its economic development.
Technology related restrictions - on imports as well as exports - comprise
the 'most onerous' existing problem for US-Russian commerce, Mr Richard
Jacobs, president of Newstar, a Washington and Moscow-based merchant banking
and investment advisory firm, said yesterday.
One plan to bring a Russian model nuclear space reactor to be exhibited in
the US ran into all kinds of red tape, he said. Once permission was
received, the Russians found they could not re-export it.
'The US government also requires that American companies have permission to
receive technical data from Russian companies.' he said. 'They have to have
an export licence to return the same data.'
Mr RK 'Judge' Morris, an official with the National Manufacturers'
Association, said US companies were discouraged from investing and entering
joint ventures with Russia by the presence of the old Jackson-Vanik
amendment, which links trade benefits and credits with emigration
restrictions. As long as the law remains on the books, and the president
must issue an annual waiver - as he does with China - then business will be
discouraged from making long-term investments, he said.
The association is also asking the administration to streamline export
controls 'so they don't provided a competitive disincentive' in Russia, and
to raise commercial aid.
The administration must also sort out a policy dilemma regarding US credits.
Is the prime purpose of the US Export-Import Bank, which provides export
financing, trade or aid? If it is trade, how much risk can it be allowed to
take on without a congressional approval? The same is true with the
Commodity Credit Corporation which supplies funding for farm credits.
The Clinton aid package for Russia includes, for example, an Dollars 82m
loan to finance the sale of Caterpillar pipeline construction machinery.
Eximbank, although still without a chairman and vice-chairman, went ahead
and approved the loan in February. Bank officials then had to endure
criticism from Congress for having made loans to a country that was not
'credit-worthy'.

FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Thumbs down from grain traders in US
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GRAIN traders yesterday expressed disappointment about President Bill
Clinton's Russian aid programme, even though nearly half the Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1.05bn) package is earmarked for concessionary grain sales. They
said it had not normalised the lucrative grain trade with Moscow, which
stalled in November due to Russian arrears.
Traders voted with their wallets yesterday morning, pushing futures prices
for wheat, corn and soyabeans lower at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Mr Clinton has offered Dollars 700m for grain sales to Russia under the food
for progress aid programme. However, exporters say only about Dollars 500m
will be available for grain purchases, and the balance will have to be used
to pay for shipping it.
US food aid programmes are subject to cargo preference provisions, a
concession made long ago to US longshoremen's unions.
The provisions require food aid to be transported on US-flagged vessels,
which can be as much as Dollars 50 per tonne more expensive than other
ships. There had been some hope Russian food aid would be exempted from the
law.
'Clinton has clearly lost the battle with the unions' on the cargo
preference issue, said Mr Richard Feltes, senior grain analyst with Refco,
the Chicago-based trading firm.
The summit package will provide for about Dollars 70m per month in bulk
grain shipments to Russia over the next seven months, well below the Dollars
200m to Dollars 250m per month exported to the country before its debt
problems stalled sales under US-guaranteed commercial loans, Mr Feltes said.
About 40 per cent of grain exported under the aid package will be wheat,
with the balance corn and soyabeans. Another Dollars 194m has been
designated for sales of value-added products. Exporters said much of that
will be vegetable oil, which is in short supply in Russia.

FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: EC ready for talks on lower trade barriers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY foreign ministers yesterday gave the Commission power to
negotiate an eventual free trade zone with Russia. The decision is viewed by
member states as a vital signal to bolster President Boris Yeltsin's
struggle for economic and political reform.
'Partnership' negotiations already started between the EC and Russia will
now be widened - at Moscow's request - to aim at reducing the barriers to
exchanges of goods, services and investment over the course of the coming
decade. The aim is to finalise the EC-Russia accord by the Copenhagen summit
on June 21-22.
The new, so-called evolutionary clause on free trade, according to
Commission officials, should quickly eliminate tariffs on most Russian
industrial goods coming into the EC, and retain very few tariffs on farm
produce. Any attempt to move forward to a full-fledged free trade zone would
not start, however, until Russia joins the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Despite misgivings among some member states, Commission recommendations for
a generous 'safeguard' clause against surges of competitive Russian goods
coming into the EC were accepted. Barriers would only be re-erected in the
event of 'serious injury' to EC producers of similar goods, or the threat of
it. The Commission also had written into the minutes of yesterday's
agreement that the clause would only be invoked after thorough investigation
to prove that the threat was real.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said the agreement was 'a
recognition of the need for the Community to do what it can to assist the
process of reform and democracy in Russia headed by Mr Yeltsin'.
The ministers overrode Commission objections and laid out tougher human
rights standards as a precondition for the free trade project. A majority of
member states argued that it would strengthen the hand of reformers in
Moscow.
The only mildly discordant notes yesterday came from Belgium, which noted
that it would be a long time before Russia was ready for free trade with the
Community, and that the Twelve would have another opportunity to decide when
that time came. This appeared to cut across the 'evolutionary' intention of
the accord now being sought.
France's new centre-right government, something of an unknown quantity on
its Euro-debut, was in favour of reaching free trade by stages.
Ministers also agreed in principle yesterday to expand the EC's technical
assistance programme to the former Soviet republics, to include so-called
'triangular operations'. This means using EC aid to help re-establish
trading links between east and central Europe and the ex-Soviet republics.
In spite of Greek reservations, Turkey could be involved because of its
growing influence in the Central Asian republics.
The Commission was also defeated on its proposal to extend full employment
and social security rights, throughout the EC, to dependents of Russians
legally established in any given member state. The EC's own growing jobless
totals ruled out such ideas, officials said. 'The whole point is to create
worthwhile jobs for Russians in Russia, not in Aberystwyth,' said one UK
official.

RUSSIA, emboldened by the Vancouver summit, yesterday issued a barrage of
attacks on Ukrainian prevarications on giving up control of nuclear weapons
stationed on its territory.
'Ukrainian representatives openly state the weapons are the property of the
Ukraine. This can only be viewed as Ukraine's claim to own nuclear weapons,'
the Russian government said.
Mr Grigory Berdennikov, deputy foreign minister, said the US and Russia had
provided such exhaustive security guarantees for giving up the weapons that
'we can't even comprehend what other guarantees could be provided'.
General Boris Gromov, deputy defence minister, said Russia was put in an
impossible situation where it was not supposed to own the weapons but
guarantee they were secure. 'Nuclear weapons cannot have two masters,' he
said.
In reaction to renewed American and Russian pressure, Ukrainian leaders
yesterday reiterated their commitment to becoming non-nuclear.
'I am convinced that Ukraine will give up its nuclear weapons,' said Mr
Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian prime minister, after a meeting between top
Ukrainian cabinet ministers and a US congressional delegation.
However, Ukrainian officials did not specify when and insisted the final
decision was a grave step which it could not take lightly.
'At stake is the future of the Ukrainian state and its people,' said Mr
Borys Tarasiuk, deputy foreign minister and top arms negotiator.
House majority leader Mr Richard Gephardt said he had received assurances
Ukraine would eventually give up its nuclear weapons.

ECUADOR HAS been hit by one of the worst natural disasters in its history,
leaving thousands homeless and an unknown number killed, writes Raymond
Colitt in Quito.
A landslide last week in the southern province of Azuay has created a dam in
the river Paute, causing the backwater to flood surrounding areas.
Dozens of dwellings have been flooded and the rising water level is
threatening to engulf several more communities.
President Sixto Duran Ballen has declared a state of emergency and relief
efforts are now concentrating on providing shelter for homeless, as well as
evacuating those still threatened by the rising water level.
So far the death toll has been placed at 32 but it is not known how many
more are buried beneath debris.

in pipeline
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE official aid announced at the Vancouver summit for Russia's energy
sector is an attempt to speed up assistance promised but slowed down by
political and economic obstacles.
Western oil companies have been frustrated by constantly changing and
increasing taxation, the lack of a clear decision-making process and
political instability.
Reformers in the Russian government are trying to improve matters. This
involves trying to centralise exports to reduce theft and to create the
right incentives for domestic companies and a suitable environment for
foreign investors.
In the meantime, multilateral organisations and export credit agencies have
had problems finalising arrangements which are meant to encourage private
companies until the investment environment becomes more attractive.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister responsible for finance and
economics, has asked for and received a list of suggestions from western oil
companies on building a suitable tax and legal regime. The companies are for
the first time acting together on this front through a Petroleum Advisory
Forum (PAF), which includes 20 integrated oil companies and 23 service
companies.
But there is also considerable resistance from parts of the bureaucracy to
giving foreigners a free hand to strike deals with Russian companies.
'The central government does not yet understand that their only role in the
industry should be to regulate and take tax revenues from it,' said one
western banker. He also pointed to deep-rooted psychological barriers
prevalent among some bureaucrats in the fuel and energy ministry and the
finance ministry.
'What it boils down to is that Russians can't understand why foreigners
should make a profit from taking Russian minerals out of the ground.'
With western banks reluctant to put more money into Russia when they are
having to reschedule old debts, multilateral organisations see themselves as
vital catalysts for encouraging private capital.
This is not to say that western companies are not rushing to explore those
opportunities already on offer, the biggest being a tender to exploit some
of the gas reserves off Sakhalin Island.
'Sakhalin is a bellwether for the industry,' says Mr Don Schaefer, the PAF
chairman, who is also commonwealth area manager for Shell, one of the five
companies included in a consortium bidding for the project.
The consortium, which at first grouped just US companies McDermott and
Marathon, plus Japan's Mitsui, went through much torment to be awarded just
the feasibility study last year. Part of the problem was the conflict
between the federal and local authorities on which rival group of companies
should get the contract. Another was demands by local authorities that
western companies should finance new infrastructure not required by the
project.
Now the companies are hoping for a Russian decision this month or next on
whether they will get the contract to develop the reserves.
Mr Schaefer suggests that the contract which is finally awarded should be
scrutinised by the industry at large, putting pressure on the Russian
authorities to come up with terms that will make this Dollars 10bn (Pounds
7bn) project an encouraging example.
One smaller project which will be watched and perhaps even speeded up as a
result of the summit is the Chernogorskoye joint venture, between
Chernogorneft, a Russian oil enterprise, and independent US oil company
Anderman Smith.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has already committed
Dollars 33m to the project and a Dollars 40m loan from Morgan Grenfell, the
British merchant bank, is to be guaranteed by the US Eximbank. But the
latter's own slowness in processing the project, attributed in part to its
small travel budget, is one example of a western bottleneck that may be
cleared by President Bill Clinton's promise to accelerate support already
promised.

FT  06 APR 93 / Republican unity holds up Clinton stimulus bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC presidents usually have to worry about their own party's
disunity, but for the time being, Republican unity is proving quite enough
to block President Bill Clinton in Congress.
Yesterday the Senate's Democratic leadership failed for the third time to
break a Republican stranglehold over the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending bill
which forms a centrepiece of the president's short-term economic plan.
The White House, which has tried to push through its economic package with
as few amendments as possible, has now been forced into negotiations with
the Republicans, but it is unclear whether the two sides can agree on a
compromise.
While the Democrats hold a notional 57-43 majority, the Senate's sometimes
eccentric rules of procedure allow the minority to prevent a vote from
taking place unless the majority musters 60 senators to bring debate to an
end.
The two sides are at odds over the stimulus bill's importance. Republican
Senator Phil Gramm calls it 'one last big spending spree' before the
administration embarks on the task of reducing the deficit.
But Mr Robert Reich, the Labour Secretary, yesterday defended the bill as
'the only way to get jobs back,' and said this position was bolstered by the
'stubbornly high' March unemployment rate of 7.0 per cent announced last
week.
Whether or not the stimulus bill is necessary, the Senate deadlock is
holding up another measure that is critical: a bill to increase the limit on
federal debt to Dollars 4,370bn. The Treasury yesterday had to postpone a
Dollars 22.4bn auction of Treasury bills, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury
secretary, estimates the ceiling will be breached tomorrow.
For most senators, however, the argument is more a matter of political
arm-wrestling - a trial of strength and endurance. For the Republicans, not
just the stimulus bill but their influence on all future legislation may be
at stake.
On the administration's side is the irritation of many House members that
the Senate is stopping them from going home for the scheduled
Easter/Passover recess, and the opportunity to label the Republicans as
champions of gridlock.
Although gridlock was unpopular with voters in the last election, so was
wasteful government spending, and it appears that the Republicans are
winning this particular labelling battle.

FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Cri de coeur from Kohl on burden-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's reiteration yesterday of the scale of German aid
already promised to Russia was 'in some ways a cry for help,' a foreign
ministry official said. 'He wants greater burden- sharing.'
In a statement aimed at the US administration, and the European Community,
Mr Kohl said Germany had provided more than half of all western aid to
Russia. Germany was already saddled with financing the economic rebuilding
of eastern Germany.
The stakes for Germany are high. If the reforms carried out by Russian
President Boris Yelstin failed, and the country slid into anarchy, then
Germany would be faced with a massive refugee influx, officials warned
yesterday.
Mr Kohl promised no fresh money, but said Germany would 'continue to help
within the bounds of its possibilities'. Support for reform was 'an
investment in a peaceful future. . . a slide back into a confrontation would
put burdens on all of us which would be far greater than the aid that is now
necessary.'
Mr Kohl said the debt rescheduling granted to Russia by the Paris Club of
creditors last Friday would cost Germany DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn). This was in
addition to substantial amounts of aid already committed by Germany to
Russia for this year and 1994. These include:
DM80bn credit facilities to the former Soviet Union, most of which has been
earmarked for Russia since 1989.
Export credit guarantees totalling DM5bn since 1992. The guarantees are
targeted at restructuring and modernising the Russian economy.
DM8.4bn in 1993 and 1994 towards cleaning up after the occupation of Soviet
troops on eastern German territory on top of DM17bn already spent in the
five new eastern German Lander.
The remaining 220,000 troops from the former Soviet Red Army will leave
Germany by August 31 1994. In addition, Bonn is financing a DM550m programme
to build 36,000 houses for soldiers returning to the former Soviet Union.
DM510m this year for creating democratic and market economy structures. This
includes education and retraining programmes, as well as creating a legal
environment for setting up small and medium sized private enterprises.
DM100m for improving the security of nuclear power stations in 1993. A
further DM32m has been committed for 1994.

FT  06 APR 93 / Gonzalez wants a head to roll - or he'll go: PM threatens to
quit as Socialist party leader over a scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOSE LUIS Corcuera is, to put it mildly, a persuasive man. A former Basque
steelworker he is big, strong and not very subtle. He is also Spain's
minister of the interior and has just been given a remarkable job by Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
By the end of the week, Mr Corcuera has to persuade the administrators of
Spain's ruling Socialist party that unless one or more of them resigns, then
Mr Gonzalez will go as party leader. He will quite needlessly add that if Mr
Gonzalez resigns the Socialists will certainly lose the election later this
year so it had better not be him that does so.
Mr Corcuera is perfect for the job because he comfortably straddles the two
worlds Mr Gonzalez has to live in - as prime minister and leader of a
conservative government, and as secretary general and leader of a more
left-wing Socialist party.
For more than three years he, along with most of the country, have watched
the prime minister and his fellow party leaders arrive at this week's
stand-off. For a long time after being first elected in 1982 Mr Gonzalez was
able to inhabit his two worlds. But as Spain's economic boom faded,
government opted for financial prudence while the party resisted subsidy
cuts, privatisations and looser labour laws.
Mr Gonzalez found himself siding with his conservative cabinet colleagues,
in particular his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, but party lobbying
against fiscal responsibility has invariably won the day. Now Spain is in
recession and Mr Gonzalez, facing election, seethes over opportunities lost.
This alone would not have been enough to bring tension between party and
government to a head. The vital element has been corruption charges  -
illicit party financing and influence peddling - that have been levelled
against the party (in fact against almost all Spanish parties) and which it
has reacted to by burying its head in the sand.
It started in 1990 with the revelation that the brother of the then deputy
prime minister and deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra, had enjoyed the
use of a government office in Seville - from which he worked as an 'adviser'
to his brother - to conduct lucrative business affairs. Incredibly, Mr
Guerra took more than a year to resign as deputy PM.
He remains deputy party leader to Mr Gonzalez. Their relationship, rooted in
the years of exile during the Franco dictatorship, has become slowly more
poisonous. Mr Guerra, though, has helped return three Socialist majorities
since 1982 and is popular in the poor south.
Then in 1991 Spanish newspapers discovered that senior party officials had
taken control of a fake consulting company, Filesa, in Barcelona. They had
then 'sold' industrial research worth about Dollars 10m to big financial and
corporate clients. The money was used to finance Socialist election
campaigns in the late 1980s.
The newspaper reports were brilliantly documented but the Socialists
attacked them as opposition campaigns. In the past year a lone judge has
taken on the party and searched its headquarters to loud complaints of
victimisation. Late last month, though, three treasury inspectors seconded
to the judge confirmed the reports.
Public opinion - with an eye on the corruption arrests in Italy and the
Socialist collapse in France last month - is demanding that heads roll. If
nothing is done, the conservative opposition, level with the Socialists in
the polls for the first time in a decade, will surely make new gains.
Mr Gonzalez has made a simple choice. He was persuaded against his better
judgment to stand for a fourth term as prime ministerial candidate for the
party and he has now decided to withdraw - by resigning as party leader - if
someone who knew about the financing scam does not own up to it and go.
He himself was probably not aware of the scam - he pays little attention to
party details. The public gaze, however, does fall on two men whose arms Mr
Corcuera will be twisting until the party executive meets on Saturday - Mr
Guerra and the party number three, Mr Jose Maria Benegas.
More than any other leaders, Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas have taught the party
to denigrate every attempt to make it accountable to the public in cases of
suspected corruption. The resignation of either man would be a sensation and
might restore some public confidence in the party.
Mr Gonzalez's tactics are not new. He resigned briefly as party leader in
the 70s over an ideological disagreement with the left. In the 1986 Nato
referendum he made it clear he would resign if the country voted against
continued membership.
This will be nastier. The party leadership has been together for 20 years
and the infighting will be personal. But Mr Gonzalez is likely to stand his
ground. His resignation as party leader would mean he would see out this
term as prime minister and retire. As he faces down old friends in the party
his impatience to go and the Corcuera bludgeon are his best weapons.

FT  06 APR 93 / French adviser seeks big cut in immigrant intake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE should cut its annual intake of around 150,000 immigrants by about
two-thirds, according to a controversial newly-appointed adviser to Mr
Charles Pasqua, France's new interior minister.
In an interview published yesterday by Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Jean-Claude
Barreau, a former priest turned immigration specialist, said that in the
present economic climate, 'the right floor to aim at would be in the
neighbourhood of 60,000 a year'.
A tighter control of immigration, both legal and clandestine, is a priority
of France's new conservative government. But Mr Barreau said he did not
condone any forced repatriation, such as that of a group of Africans who
were dispatched back to Mali last year after camping for many months on the
outskirts of Paris.
The new government, he said, should rather implement more fully decisions
taken by its own tribunals. Every year these tribunals ordered about 25,000
people to be deported, but less than 10,000 actually ended up leaving the
country. He also noted that quicker asylum decisions by the government had
recently had a deterrent effect, halving the number of requests for
political asylum from 60,000 in 1991 to 30,000 last year.
Mr Barreau has often stirred controversy in a chequered career which started
with 11 years as a priest before he married and turned successively author,
diplomat in Algeria, and immigration specialist.
Two years ago he was sacked as head of the Office of International
Migrations by the Socialist government after he wrote a book on Islam. In
yesterday's interview he said that Islam, the main religion of French
immigrants, mainly from the Maghreb, posed 'a specific problem because it
has never existed among a diaspora living in predominantly non-Moslem
societies'.
He contended that the main problem for immigrant communities in France was
'poverty and unemployment'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN leaders are putting together a package of 'radical measures' in an
effort to resuscitate economic reform in the aftermath of a huge expansion
of credits last week which pushed the Ukrainian currency to new lows against
the dollar.
Mr Leonid Kuchma, the reformist prime minister, over the weekend met
President Leonid Kravchuk and the chairman of parliament to forge a
coalition to back the reforms. Government officials said Mr Kuchma had
secured a promise from the National Bank chairman that in future new credits
would only be released with the government's consent.
The latest credit emission, which was authorised by the parliament, wiped
out the existing debts of all Ukrainian enterprises, making it impossible to
weed out the weak factories from the strong ones.
'We have taken action to undo the situation which developed last week,' said
Mr Vasyl Evtukhov, acting first deputy prime minister. 'We will force the
enterprises to behave, we will force some of them into bankruptcy.'
The tough talk was a reaction to the National Bank's release of 1.23
trillion coupons of fresh credits at low interest rates to industry and
agriculture last week. Ukraine's fledgling currency market reacted
immediately as banks cut the value of the Ukrainian currency by 50 per cent
in one day to a low of 3,000 coupons to the dollar.
'This single step wiped out almost all of the progress we had made in the
previous three months,' said Mr Mykola Syvulsky, deputy minister of finance.
Before last week's credit expansion, the Ukrainian currency appeared to be
stabilising against the dollar and inflation had slowed to 20 per cent a
month.
'This emission means that on paper we have no loss-making enterprises,' he
said. 'But the cost of this policy is a degradation of the national currency
and a continual lowering of the standard of living of the Ukrainian people.'
The collapse of the currency and the prospect of a new round of inflation
had exhausted the government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POSSIBLE breakthrough aimed at averting all-out strikes in eastern
Germany's metal and electrical sectors was yesterday thrown into confusion
after disagreement between regional and national employers' associations.
The plan was drawn up at the weekend between Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime
minister of Saxony, Mr Hasso Duvel, regional head of IG Metall, Germany's
powerful engineering union, and Mr Erwin Hein, president of the Saxony
regional employers' association.
It proposed that workers in the state's metal and electrical industry
receive a 26 per cent pay increase this year, compared with the 9 per cent
first offered by the employers. A 26 per cent rise would bring their incomes
up to 82 per cent of western German levels, as called for in a contract
signed in March 1991 between the unions, the employers, and the managers of
eastern German enterprises. Next April, metal and electrical workers would
have had their incomes increased to 91 per cent of west German levels.
The 1991 agreement envisaged income parity by April 1994. Wages in eastern
Germany are currently between 65 and 70 per cent of western German levels.
Under the Saxony proposal IG Metall would have postponed the timetable
towards equalising eastern and western wages by nine months to January 1995,
and called off warning strikes which began last week.
IG Metall officials yesterday said the agreement, mediated by Mr Biedenkopf,
a leading member of the Christian Democratic Union, and once tipped as a
possible successor to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, could 'serve as a model for
the rest of eastern German states'. Over half of IG Metall's 300,000 members
are based in Saxony.
Saxony's metal and electrical employers will today meet to decide whether to
accept the plan. But the proposal, clearly favouring IG Metall, must also be
approved by Gesamtmetall, the federal metal and electrical employers'
association, which yesterday rejected the deal outright.
A spokesman said the association 'would not accept the compromise. We are
sticking to 9 per cent. And that is that. We will not go back to the
original timetable towards income parity (between eastern and western German
wages),' he said.
Last month Gesamtmetall, followed last week by Arbeitgeberverband, the steel
employers' association, broke the 1991 contract. They said they could not
afford the wage increases because of the recession in western Germany, the
deteriorating economic circumstances in the five new eastern German states,
and persistent low productivity levels which are 70 per cent below western
Germany.
IG Metall, anxious to boost its support in eastern Germany, started
organising warning strikes throughout the region last week to put pressure
on the employers. Until yesterday, it still intended to hold a ballot among
its east German members for indefinite strikes in the region, and protests
in the rest of Germany from April 24.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers have started preparing moves towards
the total international isolation of Serbia, as a means of forcing Bosnian
Serbs to agree the peace plan proposed by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance.
This followed a call yesterday by Lord Owen, the Community's peace
negotiator on Bosnia, for 'relentless pressure' to make Bosnia's Serbs
accept the plan.
'Everybody believes that this is a time now to put relentless pressure on
the Bosnian Serbs and on the governments of Serbia and Montenegro to come
and accept the plan. . . .' Lord Owen said after briefing ministers in
Luxembourg.
The EC said later it had 'elaborated a package of possible measures' -
understood to include the closing of Serbian diplomatic missions, freezing
Serbia's foreign assets, attempts to block transit trade from states
bordering Serbia, and a ban on telecommunications traffic.
The Community made clear it was awaiting the outcome of UN Security Council
negotiations on tightening sanctions, but Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish
foreign minister and president of the council of ministers, said the EC did
not exclude acting unilaterally.
In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the
Bosnian Serbs that if they did not agree soon to the peace plan, the US
would consult with its allies on the possibility of lifting the Yugoslav
arms embargo.
Lord Owen said suggestions the embargo on Bosnia be lifted selectively to
help the Moslem population defend itself were a 'counsel of despair'. This
would introduce more modern weaponry into the conflict for all sides, he
said.
Earlier, foreign and defence ministers of the Western European Union decided
to tighten the blockade on Serbia's river Danube supply routes, by sending
eight to ten patrol boats to reinforce sanctions.

FT  06 APR 93 / Community agrees copyright rules on crossborder TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMON EC rules on copyright for television programmes transmitted across
borders via satellite and cable received broad approval from European
Community ministers yesterday.
The measure is aimed at filling a gap in the 1989 directive liberalising
crossborder broadcasts within the EC - the so-called 'television without
frontiers' directive, which came into force in October 1991 and contained no
reference to copyright protection.
Ministers responsible for the internal market agreed that the satellite and
cable companies responsible for transmitting the programmes would handle the
payment of royalties for cross-frontier broadcasts. The legal void has led
to confusion about who is responsible for paying copyright fees due on
satellite or cable broadcasts, with right-holders trying to collect
royalties from different companies in the member states where programmes are
received.
The directive will come into force on January 1, 1995, assuming it gets the
final legislative go-ahead from ministers and the European Parliament.
Separate draft legislation aims to harmonise differing national rules on the
duration of copyright protection.
Ministers postponed until June a decision on controversial measures aimed at
outlawing the sale of high-power motorcycles in the EC.
Motorcyclists demonstrated against the measure nearby, as ministers
discussed whether to limit the total power of the machines to 100 bhp.
The measure is part of a series of measures harmonising technical standards
for motorbikes. Advocates believe it will help improve road safety, but
Portugal, supported by the UK, yesterday proposed a five-year delay to allow
safety studies.

the task from Mr Karl Holoubek, the board member who to date has handled it
on his own, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The move follows a string of accidents at the chemical group. This led to
the call by Mr Joshka Fischer, environment minister in the state of Hesse,
for Mr Holoubek to step aside until a thorough investigation of safety
systems could prove that a recent series of accidents at company facilities
were not caused by mismanagement.

FT  06 APR 93 / Norway opts to play for high stakes in EC talks

FORMAL negotiations on Norway's fourth attempt to join the European
Community opened in Luxembourg yesterday, with the Norwegian government
outlining tough opening positions on energy, agriculture and fisheries,
regional policy, and how quickly it should become a net contributor to the
EC budget.
Norway is expected to catch up with the EC accession negotiations begun in
February with Austria, Sweden and Finland by the end of the month. The aim
is to conclude the four processes in parallel in time for referendums in
each country next year, and entry in 1995.
But senior Norwegian and EC officials believe Oslo's application could be
the most politically complex to accommodate. After twice having applications
rebuffed in 1961 and 1967, Norwegian voters rejected entry in 1972, just
before the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the EC. At yesterday's televised
opening of the talks, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark,
which currently chairs the EC, stressed that Norway would have to accept not
only all existing EC laws and regulations, but the Maastricht treaty too.
Denmark, along with the UK, has still to ratify Maastricht, and both
countries have secured opt-outs from its provisions being denied the new
applicants.
Norway, which unlike its neutral fellow applicants is a Nato member,
yesterday accepted the Maastricht goals of a common EC foreign and security
policy with a pronounced Atlanticist accent, and - unlike Denmark and the UK
 -put itself on the list for economic and monetary union.
But as Europe's largest net oil and gas exporter, Norway yesterday expressed
its opposition to EC plans to legislate against countries reserving
significant proportions of exploration licences for their own companies.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has around half of licences
reserved to it. 'We are confident that our EC partners will understand how
some proposals, particularly the draft hydrocarbon licensing directive - for
which we see no need - give rise to serious concern,' Mr Bjorn Tore Godal,
Norway's trade minister, said.
He stressed that Norway would require particular understanding to preserve
its Arctic farmers, its fisheries, and to underwrite its regional policies,
all aimed at preserving the existing pattern of settlement of its sparse
population. Sweden and Finland have brought similar problems to the
negotiating table; the three countries together would increase the EC land
mass by 50 per cent, but its population by only 5 per cent.
But EC negotiators fear that Norway may be raising expectations the
Community will not be able to meet in full. 'There's a danger they'll place
the bar too high, because nobody will lift a finger to help them,' one
senior Commission official said.

FT  06 APR 93 / Nine states stress aim to remove passport checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS from nine EC member states yesterday underlined their commitment
to lifting passport checks on travellers within the European Community.
Ministers from the nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone stressed
that free movement of citizens was vital to the success of the single
European market, during the opening televised debate of yesterday's meeting
of internal market ministers in Luxembourg.
Only ministers from the three EC countries which are not members of the
Schengen agreement - Britain, Ireland and Denmark - omitted to mention the
outstanding problems over free movement of people in their opening speeches.
Internal border controls on people were supposed to disappear on January 1,
but technical and political problems have prevented even the Schengen nine
from meeting their commitment to the single market.
They have now promised to lift all outstanding controls at land and sea
borders by July and controls at airports by the end of December.
The remaining trio, led by Britain, are likely to retain controls beyond the
end of the year.
This is despite veiled threats from the Commission of legal or legislative
action against intransigent member states.
However, even Schengen countries have political problems with the abolition
of controls, and the free-travel agreement has not yet been ratified in all
the member states.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's new minister for European affairs, said
external borders would have to be strengthened and national rules on drugs
harmonised before internal checks could be abolished.
Mr Lamassoure also complained that currency instability had undermined the
single market.
He said last year's devaluations in the Community had cost France's overall
balance of payments about FFr1bn (Pounds 120m).
Internal market ministers again failed to reach agreement on a voluntary
Community-wide company statute for multinationals, after Britain blocked the
measure. The British government believes the measure is not necessary.
The UK dislikes provisions which would oblige companies to consult workers
on important strategic decisions.

Sabena, the Belgian airline, confirmed a cabin crew strike had delayed a

on its flights, Reuter reports from Brussels.
A union official earlier said Sabena was allowing a maximum of 100
passengers on every flight for safety reasons.
He said several flights were delayed by more than half an hour and one
intercontinental flight was held up for almost two hours. Sabena confirmed
that nine out of 113 had been delayed yesterday.
The unions are protesting mainly against a cut in compensation days for
intercontinental flights and fewer crew for shorter flights.

Poland's government won a clear majority in parliament at the weekend on a
first reading for its modified mass privatisation proposals involving the
transfer of 600 state sector enterprises into privately owned, foreign
managed National Investment Funds, Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw
The draft legislation now goes forward to committee stage where former
communist SLD deputies, who voted for a first reading after gaining
concessions from the government, are to resume pressure for further
amendments to the plan.
These focus on giving the enterprises selected for the scheme by the
government the right to opt out. The weekend vote puts the government's
privatisation strategy back on track for the moment, giving Mr Janusz
Lewandowski, the privatisation minister who last Friday survived a vote of
no confidence, a breathing space.

FT  06 APR 93 / Owen urges pressure on Bosnia Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Owen, the European Community's peace negotiator for Bosnia, yesterday
called for 'relentless pressure' to make Bosnia's Serbs accept the
Owen/Vance peace plan.
'Everybody believes that this is a time now to put relentless pressure on
the Bosnian Serbs and on the governments of Serbia and Montenegro to come
and accept the plan which has been placed before them,' Lord Owen said after
briefing European Community foreign ministers.
Earlier, foreign and defence ministers of the Western European Union (WEU)
decided to tighten the blockade on Serbia's river Danube supply routes, by
sending from eight to 10 patrol boats to reinforce sanctions. The WEU, the
EC's embryonic defence co-operation arm, intends to help the three Danube
states of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania bottle up arms and oil still
reaching Serbia in defiance of UN sanctions.
Germany will be sending at least four of the patrol vessels and 50 of the
250-300 personnel expected to man the blockade force. The other WEU and EC
members contributing are France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
The WEU move came as EC foreign ministers discussed how to tighten pressure
on Serbia, as a means of forcing Bosnian Serbs to agree the peace plan
proposed by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance.
In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the
Bosnian Serbs that if they did not agree soon to the Vance/Owen peace plan,
the US would start to consult with its allies on the possibility of lifting
the arms embargo that now applies to all parties in the former Yugoslavia.
However Lord Owen said suggestions that the embargo on Bosnia be lifted
selectively to help the Moslem population defend itself were a 'counsel of
despair'. He pointed out that this would introduce more modern weaponry into
the conflict for all sides.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations plans to ignore the objections of local Moslem military
leaders by attempting to evacuate another 15,000 refugees from the besieged
eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said yesterday that the situation in Srebrenica had turned
into a test case for the UN that would indicate whether its priority was to
save lives.
Local Moslem leaders on Sunday prevented a UNHCR convoy, which had brought
in relief supplies to Srebrenica from allowing refugees to board trucks to
take them to the relative safety of Tuzla.
However, Mr Mendiluce said the situation in Srebrenica, which is in range of
Serb artillery, was desperate. The ceasefire had been broken in many areas
yesterday and the Moslem front lines were being slowly but surely squeezed
by the Serb forces.
Mr Mendiluce said there were a total of 60,000 people in the Srebrenica
region, of which 25,000 to 30,000 were in or near the town, besieged by the
Serbs for the past year. The present population could not be settled in
Srebrenica in any case, and the UNHCR's objective was to evacuate a further
10,000 to 15,000 people, to add to the 5,000 it had taken out last month.
UN officials denied, however, that by evacuating more people from
Srebrenica, they were in effect contributing to the Serb policy of so-called
'ethnic cleansing', the expulsion of Moslems from towns and enclaves which
the Serbs claim as part of their own territory. A UNHCR spokesman said the
UN was not evacuating residents of Srebrenica, a town whose population has
been inflated by the influx of tens of thousands of refugees, but only those
who had fled there after other Moslem areas had been captured by the Serb
militia.
Though the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, said on Sunday that he
would allow the evacuation and order local Bosnian army commanders to let
the returning relief convoys load up with refugees, the UNHCR said yesterday
it was not sending in a convoy before it was clear that the president's
orders would be carried out. Meanwhile, the military commanders of the
Moslem, Serb and Croat warring parties in Bosnia, are due to meet under UN
auspices in Sarajevo today, to try to consolidate a fragile eight-day
ceasefire in the conflict.
An estimated 150,000 Bosnians have been killed or have been reported
missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been driven out of their
homes and taken refuge in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or abroad,
since the civil war started one year ago today.
General Philippe Morillon, the UN commander in Bosnia, said yesterday the
Bosnian Moslems had only agreed to attend if the Serbs halted their attacks
on Srebrenica.
Months of preparation have gone into the agenda of the military commanders'
meeting, which includes discussions on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo and
protected corridors for the free movement of civilians.
A mixed military working group of staff officers from the rival factions has
reached agreement in principle on many essential points in a series of
meetings since last November. Implementation of these agreements could be
the first step towards the realisation of the peace plan drawn up by the
international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.

FT  06 APR 93 / Small retailers face higher card charges from Barclays bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS has told about 40,000 small retailers that the amount they are
charged for each credit card purchase is to rise by 8 per cent from this
month unless they pay Pounds 35 a month to rent electronic card checking
machines from the bank.
The increase is part of an effort by high street banks to raise charges to
retailers for card transactions because their card-handling subsidiaries -
known as merchant acquirers - have been making only small profits, or
losses.
National Westminster said it had not raised charges, but the bank is
expected to re-examine them next month. Lloyds said it was raising credit
card transaction charges by an average of 0.2 percentage points of purchase
values.
The rises were disclosed as Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, called on
banks to freeze fees and charges for the rest of the year.
Although the transaction charges do not apply to consumers they could be
passed on in higher prices.
Mr Brown is also planning to lead an attempt by Labour MPs to ensure that
consumers are better informed about the borrowing charges on credit cards by
inserting provisions in the Finance Bill implementing the March Budget.
Barclays has told half of the 80,000 small customers of its merchant
acquirer that credit card transaction charges - which are between 1.2 and
4.5 per cent of purchase value - will rise 8 per cent unless they switch to
electronic checking.
It has also raised its charges by 1.4p per debit card transaction. It says
this equals an average rise of 4 per cent for smaller retailers, who were
paying between 20p and 60p per transaction before the rise in charges last
week.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays' central retail services
division, said the bank was trying to give small retailers an incentive to
take on electronic checking systems that would reduce fraud.
Mr Reay-Smith said debit cards remained 'fundamentally under-priced' because
fraud losses matched the amount gained on charges. Barclays' fraud losses on
debit cards for the first six months of last year were Pounds 10.8m.
Barclays said retailers might save money by hiring the electronic checking
machines.

FT  06 APR 93 / Kohl urges more aid for Russia: G7 finance ministers meet
next week to discuss support package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY will today call on its industrialised partners to underpin Russia's
reforms with more debt rescheduling and a co-ordinated aid package.
The call follows the weekend's decision by US President Bill Clinton to
provide Moscow with Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) in aid and a new warning
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that, without help, Russia's reform programme
would fail.
Today's meeting of special advisers to the Group of Seven finance ministers
in Washington is expected to finalise a package of financial and economic
assistance to Russia. This will be presented to a G7 meeting of finance and
foreign ministers in Tokyo next week.
Mr Kohl warned yesterday that if western governments did not co-ordinate a
programme - assisted by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community
 -Russian reforms would fail.
'Support for the reforms is an investment in a peaceful future. A slide back
into confrontation would put burdens on all of us which would be far greater
than the aid that is now necessary,' Mr Kohl said in a four-page statement.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said he welcomed 'the American
president's determination to support as a partner the politicians who want
to press ahead with reform in the Russian federation'.
But Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said President
Clinton's pledge of Dollars 1.6bn of credit and aid facilities to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin following last weekend's summit meeting was 'a good
start, but far from adequate'.
'Compared with what we Germans are giving and will still have to give
Russia, it is a relatively small amount. But I am pleased that the Americans
have jumped the hurdle and made a start,' he said in a radio interview.
The west sees its aid as crucial in shoring up support for Mr Yeltsin within
Russia, where economic adjustments following the collapse of communism have
severely eroded living standards. Mr Yeltsin faces a key test in an April 25
referendum, on his presidency and the policies of his government, which is
being conducted by the conservative-dominated Russian parliament.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, cautioned yesterday that Western
countries should make aid to Russia conditional on its control of money
supply and inflation, 'policies which do not exist at the moment'.
Mr Hurd, speaking on a visit to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, said he
supported the US government's announcement at the weekend US-Russia summit
between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin of Dollars 1.6bn package
of aid with its emphasis on the micro-economic measures.
Macro-economic assistance channeled directly through the Russian government,
should be conditional on the implementation of new economic policies, said
Mr Hurd.
He said reformers within Mr Yeltsin's administration wished western aid 'to
be conditioned, because only if it is conditional is there an increasing
incentive, support, for reform in Russia'.
The coming weeks would see a dialogue among G-7 industrialised nations, and
in the EC, as to levels and conditions of further help to Moscow, Mr Hurd
said.
In Tokyo, Mr Yohei Kono, chief spokesman for the Japanese government, said
Japan was preparing further aid measures of its own, which it intended to
have ready for the G7 Tokyo meeting. A Japanese foreign ministry official
told AP-Dow Jones that the size of the package would be comparable to that
of the US.
For his part, Mr Kohl said 'anchoring democracy, the rule of law and the
market economy in Russia, and the other reform states, is a unique chance
and challenge which demands the full commitment of the entire West'. He said
that Germany, which would not be providing fresh money, had already
'provided more than half of western aid'.
Foreign ministry officials in Bonn are increasingly confident the Clinton
administration is more committed to supporting Russia's reforms than the
Bush administration.

FT  06 APR 93 / Two former Italian PMs investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER Italian prime ministers, Mr Giulio Andreotti and Mr Arnaldo
Forlani, were served notice yesterday that they were under investigation for
alleged illicit financing of their Christian Democrat party.
The moves amount to a further widening of Italy's political corruption
scandal, which has led to the resignation of five ministers and
investigations into a large number of businessmen and politicians, including
former Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi.
Mr Andreotti, who was advised by Palermo magistrates a week ago that he was
under investigation for alleged collusion with the Mafia, was warned of a
new inquiry into party funding by Milan magistrates.
Mr Forlani's inquiry is being carried out by Rome magistrates investigating
the awarding of contracts for road building by the state group Anas.
Until recently, Mr Forlani was secretary of the Christian Democrat party.
Last night Mr Andreotti told the Financial Times he could not recall the
transaction to which his inquiry relates, dating from the campaign for the
general election in April last year.
'I don't remember. . . But this was election time and you have to make a lot
of telephone calls,' he said. He was also dismissive of the moves to
incriminate him.
Parliament could meet today to consider whether to waive immunity on Mr
Andreotti, a life senator. Mr Andreotti's lawyers said yesterday: 'We are
completely and unconditionally at the disposition of the Milan magistrates
in whom we have absolute faith.'
This declaration contrasted with the vigorous reaction by Mr Andreotti and
the Christian Democrat party after Palermo magistrates sent a 256-page
dossier on the former premier to parliament last week.
Milan magistrates are understood to want to question Mr Andreotti about
payment of L250m (Pounds 114,000) allegedly arranged by him via his friend
Mr Giuseppe Ciarapico, owner of Roma football team and a prominent
financier, who was arrested on charges of fraud relating to a subsidiary of
state holding company Efim, now in liquidation.
The payment was allegedly made to help the Social Democrat party, one of the
Christian Democrats' coalition partners, in the 1992 elections. Mr Andreotti
is alleged to have orchestrated it.

FT  06 APR 93 / Treasury economic model may be run by US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A KEY element of preparing the UK government's much-criticised economic
forecasts could be contracted out to a US company und-er proposals put to
the Treasury.
Massachusetts-based DRI is the world's biggest economic consultancy and its
clients include General Motors, IBM, Exxon and British Petroleum. It says
running the Treasury's computerised model of the UK economy is 'not
impossible' and would add to its prestige.
If DRI and the Treasury agree a deal, the secretive process would receive
the biggest shake-up since economic forecasts started in the 1940s.
DRI, owned by the McGraw-Hill media and financial services company and with
annual worldwide revenues of about Dollars 60m (Pounds 42m), would scrap the
Treasury's existing model, run by an in-house team of about 30 economists.
DRI would replace it with one maintained by its own economists and software
experts.
The Treasury model is a computer containing more than 100 mathematical
equations. It links factors such as unemployment and taxation and is used to
forecast likely output growth and inflation.
The Treasury would neither confirm nor deny whether talks with DRI are
taking place, on the grounds that it did not want to influence any possible
negotiations with other companies.
It is examining the possible contracting-out of its computerised model as
part of a Whitehall-wide scheme to encourage more private-sector involvement
in government activities. The cost of Treasury forecasts is an estimated
Pounds 750,000 a year. Two are published each year, while more are worked on
internally.
DRI, with 450 staff - 80 per cent of them in the US - would base any work
for the Treasury partly on its expertise in modelling parts of the North
American economy on behalf of about 30 US states, including New York and
California. Under DRI's plans, Treasury ministers and officials would
continue to be responsible for published UK forecasts. The basis for how
these are worked out would be left to a non-government agency, one step
removed from political constraints.
In recent years, Treasury forecasts have been criticised for
under-estimating both the extent of the late 1980s boom and the recession.
Even though these shortcomings have been shared by many private-sector
forecasters, some politicians and industrialists believe the Treasury
projections have been 'massaged' to provide a favourable view of economic
conditions.
Mr Jean-Michel Six, the DRI executive in charge of operations in Europe and
Asia, said talks were at an early stage and still had to cover such areas as
fees and how new ideas DRI might like to introduce would fit in with
Treasury requirements.

FT  06 APR 93 / Europe and US look to the benefits of freer trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY foreign ministers yesterday gave the European Commission
power to negotiate an eventual free trade zone with Russia. The decision is
viewed by member states as a vital signal to bolster President Boris
Yeltsin's struggle for economic and political reform.
'Partnership' negotiations already started between the EC and Russia will
now be widened to aim at reducing the barriers to exchanges of goods,
services and investment over the course of the coming decade.
Russian and American business could also gain from the review promised by
President Bill Clinton into the cold war legal relics which restrict the
export of technological products to the former Soviet states.

RESULTS DUE
TESCO, the UK's second-largest grocery retailer, will be hoping to reassure
the City with a healthy rise in full-year profits tomorrow. Its shares have
been under pressure amid fears that its sales growth is lagging behind that
of rivals J Sainsbury and Argyll, owners of Safeway. Most forecasts are
clustered around Pounds 580m, compared with Pounds 545m last year, although
some go up to Pounds 585m.
Full year figures today for 1992 from MB-Caradon, the building products and
security printing group, are expected to be in the region of Pounds 120m to
Pounds 125m, against Pounds 106.4m in 1991. Lower interest charges, and a
solid performance from the managed businesses are behind the expected rise.
Interest will focus on how the group will reinvest the Pounds 473m proceeds
of the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, announced last
Friday.
TIP Europe, the trailer rental company, is expected to announce
disappointing interim results tomorrow. The company's Mobiel subsidiary,
which supplies temporary buildings in continental Europe, is understood to
have run into bad management and planning problems.
Analysts have downgraded forecast full year forecasts from Pounds 8.8m to
Pounds 6m, while interim profits are likely to be about Pounds 2.4m from
Pounds 3m last time. The dividend is also in danger of being cut again.
Sun Alliance Group, the composite insurer, is expected on Thursday to report
a loss for 1992 of around Pounds 150m, a recovery from a loss of Pounds 466m
a year-earlier. It is likely to maintain the dividend, though.
Mirror Group Newspapers, buffeted by board room upheavals including the
recent departure of Lord Hollick, is forecast to produce today pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 27m and Pounds 33m (Pounds 47.3m) for 1992.
First-half pre-tax profits today from Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous
Grouse, will be boosted by the company's decision to equity account its 35.4
per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky blender. Analysts expect
the underlying pre-tax figure, however, to reflect pressures on volume sales
and prices of new and mature whisky. Forecasts suggest the outcome will be
between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 14m, 5 to 8 per cent below last year's
Pounds 14.7m.

approved

<TEXT>
ITALY'S complex state-controlled telecommunications sector is set for
unprecedented change after cabinet committee approval of a long-awaited
restructuring.
The move opens the way to creating a single company to run Italy's
telecommunications services, where seven different state-controlled groups
now operate.
The cabinet committee, which called on the IRI state holding company to
present rationalisation plans by June 30, also accepted that the
government's stake in the future single telecoms group could fall below 51
per cent.
Italy's telecoms sector comprises a patchwork of companies, all
state-controlled, which are often in conflict with one another, and
sometimes deeply divided internally.
The sector is co-ordinated by Stet, the IRI-controlled listed holding
company. Stet in turn controls Sip, the main telephone utility, which is
also listed, as well as Italcable (international communications) and
Telespazio (satellite links).
Two other companies, Sirti (network engineering) and Italtel (equipment
manufacturing), supply the group, while a third, Iritel, was formed last
year after the long-awaited transfer of ASST from the post office to IRI.
ASST provides domestic trunk connections and some shorter international
links. The new Telecom Italia would probably include all the companies,
except Italtel and Sirti.
Although rationalisation plans have been aired for years, they have been
postponed by political difficulties or squabbling among the companies.
Managements have become increasingly politicised, with some companies having
a carefully-balanced team of chairman, deputy and up to two managing
directors appointed on the basis of party affil-iations.
False starts have led to analysts' scepticism that rationalisation will now
take place in earnest.
However, the timetable envisages the creation of Telecom Italia by the end
of 1995 at the latest.
Rationalisation was 'an indispensable step', said the committee, which
warned that the state would retain a 'significant' minority stake.
Tariffs would be determined by a 'price cap', linking charges to
productivity and quality.
Although the destiny of Iritel, which is widely expected to be merged with
Sip, remains unclear, the committee called for the integration process to be
accelerated.

SNECMA, France's state-controlled aero-engine maker, saw its consolidated
loss deepen last year to FFr794m (Dollars 146m) from FFr68m in 1991, writes
David Buchan in Paris.
The company said the figures reflected 'the global crisis in the aviation
market, and include provisions for restructuring the workforce and
depreciation of shares in certain subsidiaries'.
The group announced last month that turnover in 1992 fell to FFr23bn,
against FFr 23.9bn the previous year. The value of its order book dropped by
FFr 3bn by the end of last year, from FFr 7.3bn a year earlier.

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines Inter-national's survival plan, including a CDollars 246m
(USDollars 195m) equity infusion from American Airlines, has hit a new
obstacle. An Ontario court dismissed an application by PWA, Canadian's
parent company, to have the Gemini Group computer reservations company
declared insolvent.
This would have allowed PWA to leave Gemini for American's Sabre system  - a
condition of the equity infusion.
Gemini is jointly-owned by PWA and rival Air Canada and several smaller
airlines. Air Canada is fighting the Canadian-American deal and maintains
PWA's withdrawal from Gemini would bankrupt the group.
In Calgary, Canadian said its lawyers would decide later this week whether
to appeal the Ontario court decision.

OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, is selling OM Group, its US
speciality chemicals subsidiary, through an initial public offering in the
US.
Net proceeds are estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 170m, while
OM Group will raise Dollars 20m through a simultaneous treasury issue.
The offering will be underwritten by Lehman Brothers, Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp and Goldman Sachs, and comprise US and
international tranches.
Mr Markku Toivanen, president of Outokumpu Metals &amp; Resources, said: 'This
business is not a core one. We are not comfortable in marketing speciality
products as we are more a commodities business.' He said an IPO, rather than
a trade sale, would help with future fund-raising.
OM Group, based in Cleveland, is one of the world's leading producers of
metal-based speciality chemicals and has manufacturing facilities in the US,
Finland and France.

BHF-BANK, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, rounded off the reporting
season for Germany's larger banks by announcing 1992 group operating profits
up by 6.9 per cent to DM366m (Dollars 228m).
The increase is more modest than at Germany's bigger banks, most of which
have increased operating profits by more than 10 per cent. But at the
partial operating profits level, which excludes the contribution from
own-account trading, BHF's 1992 profits rose by 15.3 per cent to DM327m.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, said that provisions for bad and
doubtful debts had been increased significantly for 1992, mainly for
corporate loans.
The incidence of bad debts rose from 0.09 per cent of the total loan
portfolio in 1991 to 0.17 per cent last year, just above the 0.15 per cent
average of the last five years.
Total business volume rose 11.5 per cent last year to DM54bn, while the
surplus on interest income climbed 10.8 per cent to DM569m. Fee income
increased 13.3 per cent to DM301m while administrative expenses rose 9.6 per
cent to DM544m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOLSET Engineering, the Huddersfield-based producer of turbochargers and
other diesel engine parts owned by Cummins Engine of the US, has bought
Dresden-based Kompressorenbau Bannewitz (KBB) from the Treuhand agency in
eastern Germany.
Mr Alec Wallace, director and general manager for Holset turbochargers, said
the deal filled 'a huge hole' for the company, which had been looking for a
manufacturing presence in Germany to add to its European facilities in the
UK, France and Spain.
Holset has agreed to maintain the workforce at the current level of 165 for
five years, and also to invest a total of DM3.5m.
KBB is currently making a loss, but Mr Wallace said it should be breaking
even by the end of the year. 'Its product range is pretty good, quality
standards are acceptable, but it has very little marketing skill.' One of
the attractions for Holset was its complementary technology.
Holset, which has 2,000 employees worldwide, is not disclosing the price it
paid for KBB. But usually such purchases from the Treuhand are for nominal
amounts.

FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Funds for business support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Baroness DENTON OF WAKEFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Brown warns of cut in spending on unemployed' (March 16)
suggested that government funding for business support services, including
those that will be delivered through the pilot One Stop Shop business
centres, will be reduced by 14 per cent for the coming year.
This is not the case and is based on a misunderstanding of the basis for the
supply estimates figures which, because of the transfer of small firms
responsibilities between departments after the election, do not necessarily
compare like with like across the 1992-93 and 1993-94 financial years. The
position is that the 1992-93 budget for local business support in England
was Pounds 154m in 1993-94 and in 1993-94 will be Pounds 169m, an increase
of Pounds 15m.

FT  05 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: World Trade Centre hotel in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO SITRA, the Mexican company jointly owned by Trafalgar House
Construction and Grupo Sidek, has been awarded a Pounds 7m contract to build
the first stage of the new World Trade Centre Hotel in Guadalajara. This
brings the total amount of work won by the company since its formation last
year to Pounds 41m.
The 19-storey, 480 bedroom hotel is being constructed for Servicios e
Immuebles Turisticos and will be located next to the Guadalajara Expocenter.
Grupo Sitra is responsible for erecting the entire steel structure, which
includes three basement levels, along with the foundations, retaining walls
and permanent shuttering. Piling work is currently commencing on the site
and the first stage is scheduled for completion at the end of this year.
Other hotel work currently under way includes the design and construction of
the Pounds 20m Hotel Continental Plaza and Centro Commercial in Veracruz,
Mexico's largest port. The complex will consist of an eight-storey hotel
containing 240 bedrooms and a seven-storey office and banking block, and a
single-storey restaurant and discotheque above a semi-basement car park.
On the country's western seaboard, Grupo Sitra has two design and construct
contracts worth Pounds 7m for residential and tourist developments. At
Guaymas, work on the Condominios Plaza Las Glorias involves building 44
apartments in several six-storey blocks, while further down the coast a
group of villas are being built as part of a marina complex at Puerto
Vallarta.
In the north east, near the United States' border, the company has a Pounds
7m contract at Mexicali for the civil engineering works connected with a new
water treatment plant and steel rolling mill.

FT  05 APR 93 / Bookmakers angry at National fiasco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKMAKERS are preparing for a rush of punters today to reclaim about Pounds
75m staked on the 1993 Martell Grand National horse race, which was declared
void on Saturday and will not be re-run this year.
Senior executives of William Hill are to meet today to decide whether to sue
the racecourse for the Pounds 2m profit the company says it lost.
Ladbroke said: 'The damage done to the public image of racing is
immeasurable both in Britain and throughout the world. This is the biggest
sporting event for Britain, let alone racing, and we owe it to the British
public to put it back, the sooner the bet-ter.'
The company said it would have to bear about Pounds 100,000 in extra
advertising and staff costs. 'But it would have cost us a great deal more if
the race had been run and the favourite had won.'
Minutes after the race was ruled void, amid scenes of chaos watched by an
estimated worldwide television audience of 300m, bookmakers announced that
all stake monies would be returned, and appealed for calm when the betting
shops re-open this morning.
The biggest loser will be the Treasury, which would have taken an estimated
Pounds 6m in betting tax on the race.
Martell, the sponsor, which had brought about 550 guests to the course, some
from as far afield as Malaysia and Singapore, registered disappointment at
the outcome but showed no inclination to withdraw its support for the race.
Mr Peter Greenall, chairman of Aintree racecourse, yesterday said that after
consultations with leading trainers it had been decided that it would not be
practical for the world's most famous steeplechase to be re-run later this
year.
Mr Greenall said that Aintree's overriding consideration was the long-term
image of the race. 'I am not as sceptical as many that the Grand National
has been so dented,' he said. 'The race has been run for 150 years and is a
special part of our heritage.'
The racecourse is holding its own inquiry on how animal rights protestors
managed to get through a security cordon and onto the course, where they may
have caused the first false start.
Aintree would refund entry fees and travelling expenses to owners and
trainers of the 40 intended runners and reimburse jockeys' riding fees.
Stewards of the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, are expected to start an
inquiry today into the chaos which followed two false starts to the race.
Their investigation could lead to changes in the system used to recall
runners after a false start.
After the first on Saturday, Mr Keith Brown, the official starter, signalled
with a red flag to stop the race.
After the second false start Mr Brown's warning flag failed to unfurl.
About 30 jockeys, who said they saw no flag, continued to race. Some
finished the 4 1/2 -mile course in spite of further attempts to stop them
after the first circuit.

FT  05 APR 93 / Polluted land review to focus on liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY developers and bankers are to be invited to take part next month in
the government's review of the problems of land pollution and the use of
contaminated land.
The inter-departmental review is expected to last three to four months, so
that any changes in the law that it recommends could be included in the
'green' bill expected in the autumn.
This is the the third review of policy in this sector. It was announced last
month when Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, confirmed that the
government would not be going ahead with plans for a register of
contaminated land. But there are signs that the review will concentrate more
on easing the development of contaminated land than some environmental
campaigners will welcome.
In particular, ministers are concerned that the liability for the costs
relating to land that may become polluted may act as a deterrent to banks
lending money for its development.
Ministers are also considering offering guidance on the different standards
of clean-up required for contaminated land, depending on its future use.
Land that is going to be buried under concrete for a car park, for example,
might not need to be cleaned to as high a standard as if it were going to be
used for housing.
Ministers' focus on the question of costs liability reflects a report
published earlier this year by a working group of the government's advisory
committee on business and the environment. It concluded that flows of
capital to industry could be 'seriously impeded' because bankers and
insurers were afraid of future environmental costs.
The property industry would welcome unequivocal guidance on the standards of
clean-up expected in different circumstances.
But property owners are resigned to more stringent environment standards,
not least because of increasingly exacting standards of lending
institutions. 'Everyone accepts it is important. There is no way of escape
from it,' said Mr Michael Chambers of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
A green paper issued by the European Commission a few weeks ago sought to
establish an enforceable code of civil liability for environmental damage.
EC officials, like the UK property industry, are anxious to avoid the
problems the US experienced with its 'Superfund' legislation. This has
imposed huge costs on industry and generated huge fees for the legal
profession.
Blue Circle Cement is moving 150 employees from its headquarters adjoining
the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire, because of
contamination of the site.
The company said yesterday the establishment had assured it that there was
only 'low-level' contamination of the site by traces of plutonium and
uranium, but directors had decided employees should be relocated as a safety
precaution.

FT  05 APR 93 / Market for recovery awaits its starting orders: FT writers
asks a range of businesses whether they believe a recovery may have begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of a modest revival in consumer demand have begun to raise hopes of
recovery. The outlook for unemployment and new credit business remains bleak
but the governor of the Bank of England thinks that 'in all probability' the
recession is over. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist of Nomura Research
Institute in London, says there are 'enough green shoots to make a salad'
but the downturn in Germany and other Continental markets bodes ill for
exports, and consumer confidence at home remains fragile.
ON AN overcast mid-week afternoon, Binns department store in Middlesbrough
is remarkably busy. Steady streams of customers compare flowery duvet covers
and study the fine china.
Mr Graham Bishop, the manager, is not surprised at the bustle. Since the New
Year he has seen an upturn, confirming his store's place in the top-10
sales-growth table of the House of Fraser group.
His ledgers chart the store's sales performance in the first three months of
the year. Compared with early last year, overall turnover is up 6 per cent.
Menswear, furniture and furnishings are up 9 per cent and electrical
appliances up 14 per cent. Children's wear is up 16 per cent, cosmetics 22
per cent and white goods a thumping 36 per cent.
Mr Bishop should be a happy man, but there is a snag. He is delivering the
orders, but can British industry deliver the goods - and on time?
'We're finding industry in this country generally unable to react to
positive signs,' he says. 'It's totally frustrating.'
Mr Bishop quotes examples: the towel company that wanted up to five weeks to
supply a standard line, and the linen producer which, having joined House of
Fraser in a joint promotion, had no stock in hand when orders flowed in.
Then there was the company whose top-of-the-range hi-fi was temporarily
dropped because of delays in supply.
Binns, Middlesbrough's biggest department store, turns over more than Pounds
10m a year and employs 192 full-timers and part-timers. That will rise
beyond 200 this year, mainly because of a move to more part-time working to
maximise the efficient use of staff.
Mr Bishop believes the upturn has started. 'We've been through the worst
fear of redundancy. People are now starting to settle down.' But he worries
that British suppliers may lose out to overseas competitors unless industry
starts re-employing and investing to boost output.
'People are going to pull their orders. There's a limit to how long people
will wait. My message is: wake up industry, there's a market out there.'
New markets have proved a fertile ground for Tenhill Computer Systems, the
West Yorkshire-based software company.
Mr David Haycox, founder, chairman and managing director, believes such
companies will not grow fat on the signs of recovery in Britain. He is
convinced that growth for his company - which produces software for the
leasing and credit industries - lies overseas. 'The market isn't big enough
to keep Tenhill growing in the UK.'
Last year about 15 per cent of Tenhill's sales were exports but this should
rise sharply in coming years. After two years cultivating the German market
 -mostly using British staff seconded to Germany - Tenhill has appointed a
German managing director for its Frankfurt office. It will be recruiting
this year, mainly Germans, in Germany. Mr Haycox plans a move into Spain
this year.
It is not that the UK is showing no signs of interest, but orders tend to be
prospective. He says: 'We're certainly getting more prospective business in
our books than we've had for two years.' Prospective new UK orders exceed
Pounds 2m.
Most new inquiries have come from the vehicle leasing sector, which is
enjoying improved business because customers unsure of a recovery prefer to
lease vehicles rather than buy them.
In the last three months the company has sold three systems worth more than
Pounds 200,000 each, compared with three in all of last year.
Further firm orders will be needed, however, if the company is to maintain
staff numbers as people return from a period working in Germany. Even then,
future recruitment is likely to be limited.
Mr Haycox says the UK's leasing market, his main customer, is way ahead of
the rest of Europe - perhaps excepting France - in its range of financial
tools. But, to his frustration, hardly any of his customers are growing by
selling their expertise abroad.
'What is happening is the UK finance market is being swallowed up by
overseas players. I've said to my customers they are foolish in not looking
outside the UK market.'
Exquisitely tended landscaped grounds surround Tenhill Computer Systems'
Georgian mansion near Leeds. Inside, visitors step into an entrance hall
dominated by chandeliers, gilt plasterwork and Corinthian columns.
For a company founded in a Leeds back-bedroom 15 years ago, turnover of
Pounds 4.5m in 1992 and a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
392,000 suggests some immunity from the recession for the 100-strong
workforce.
Mr Haycox says: 'I have it in mind to lengthen our order backlog. That
creates a bit more stability for us.' He insists responsiveness will remain
'excellent', but is averse to running with excess staff capacity.
Overseas sales hold no fears for one of Britain's more traditional
manufacturers. Mitchell Shackleton, the Greater Manchester-based crankshaft
maker, exports more than 60 per cent of its output to Europe, Scandinavia
and North America.
For six years in the late 1980s the company, a subsidiary of US-based
National Forge, made serious losses, peaking at Pounds 600,000 on a Pounds
3m turnover. But after a management restructuring in mid 1990 it is back in
profit on turnover of about Pounds 4m and fighting its corner in a fiercely
competitive world market. At the large end of its product range it is the
UK's sole representative.
Mr Brian McGuinness, the managing director, is confident: 'Our order book
value today is infinitely better than it was 12 months ago.'
But he rejects any suggestion this indicates 'green shoots' in the wider
economy. 'In that context I don't sense things are on the up at all. If we
had to rely on the UK market we wouldn't survive. I honestly believe it's
due to getting off our backsides.'
Warning that recovery in this sector is some way off, Mr McGuinness cites
crankshaft regrinding, in which 90 per cent of the company's business is
UK-based. Demand remains slow. Intensive marketing of the regrinding service
is serving more to retain demand at current levels than to increase it.
The 91 employees of the 105-year-old heavy engineering company produce huge
crankshafts for the diesel engine, pump and reciprocating gas compressor
industries worldwide.
The company's traditional methods of making crankshafts do not, Mr
McGuinness says, permit the orders growth vital to its future. 'No business
can stand still. You either go up or down. We've got to grow.'
To that end, the company has lined up new supply sources of forgings which
will enable it to get into new crankshaft markets and reduce the costs of
some end products.
With the more buoyant mood there has been capital investment of Pounds
400,000 last year and about the same is planned for this year.
But the cost of survival has been high. The workforce has fallen from 300 in
the mid 1970s, although jobs have been created since the late 1980s, when
only 75 were in work.
Mr Alan Brown, the works convener, puts the company's continued success down
to management initiative rather than emergent green shoots. 'I don't think
anybody can be 100 per cent confident,' he says.
'Since Brian took over this place two years ago it's turned around. I don't
think anybody outside has done anything to improve it for us.'

FT  05 APR 93 / No re-run planned after Grand National shambles
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1993 Grand National, one of the world's most famous sporting events,
will not be re-run after being declared void on Saturday amid scenes of
chaos.
A global television audience of 300m and a racecourse crowd of 60,000, who
paid seat prices ranging between Pounds 29 and Pounds 55 (Dollars 40-Dollars
78), were witness to one of the great shambles in British sporting history.
After the first start, Mr Keith Brown, the official starter, signalled with
a red flag to stop the race.
After the second false start, in which some horses and jockeys again became
entangled in the tape, Mr Brown's warning flag failed to unfurl.
About 30 of the 39 jockeys taking part continued to race. Some finished the
4 1/2 -mile course despite attempts to stop them.
One of the course commentators announced: 'The race that is happening is not
happening,' to raucous laughter from thousands of spectators.
The starter was later booed from the course as spectators queued in heavy
rain to get their money back from bookmakers.
Mr Peter Greenall, chairman of Aintree racecourse near Liverpool, said
yesterday that after consultations with leading trainers, it had been
decided that it would not be practical to restage the world's most famous
steeplechase at the next meeting in November.
Bookmakers, preparing today for a rush of punters reclaiming about Pounds
75m staked on the race at betting shops throughout the country, said they
would continue to press for a re-run.
Senior executives of bookmaker William Hill are also to meet today to decide
whether to sue the racecourse for the Pounds 2m the company claims it lost.
Ladbroke said: 'The damage done to the public image of racing is
immeasurable both in Britain and throughout the world. This is the biggest
sporting event for Britain, let alone racing, and we owe it to the British
public to put it back, the sooner, the better.'
Seagram, the Canadian drinks group which sponsors the race through its
Martell label, registered disappointment at the outcome but showed no
inclination to withdraw support for the race.
Mr Greenall said Aintree's overriding consideration was the long-term image
of the race. 'I am not as sceptical as many that the Grand National has been
so dented,' he said. 'The race has been run for 150 years and is a special
part of our heritage.'
Stewards of the Jockey Club, racing's ruling body, are expected to begin an
inquiry today. Their investigation could lead to changes in the system used
to recall runners after a false start.

<TEXT>
EGYPT'S President Hosni Mubarak is seeking a summit with Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the Israeli prime minister, after his discussions on reviving the Middle
East peace process in Washington, Israeli officials said yesterday.
Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had
requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates
and in terms of location, nothing is set.' Mr Mubarak, who has emerged as
the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace talks, meets
President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he would report
the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return to Cairo.
The Egyptian leader has recently met President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and
Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman.
The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to
resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in
December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks.
The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next
round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from
Washington.
Mr Mubarak would particularly welcome a successful mediation effort at a
time when his government is under strong pressure from Islamic
fundamentalists at home. It would also underline Egypt's strategic value to
Washington while the country is seeking a renewed US commitment to the
Dollars 2.1bn it receives in annual civil and military aid.
An Israeli-Egyptian summit would be unlikely without a solution being found
to the peace talks impasse. In the event of a deal, Mr Mubarak could seek to
extract the maximum symbolic publicity from his role by meeting Mr Rabin in
Jerusalem. This would mark the first visit to Israel by President Mubarak
since he took power more than a decade ago, and the first by any Egyptian
leader since the historic trip of President Anwar Sadat in November 1977.
A senior Egyptian foreign ministry official said Mr Mubarak had decided in
principle to make such a visit, saying 'it is not a question of whether, but
of when'. The official said Mr Mubarak would not have countenanced such a
trip while Mr Yitzak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, was in power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan cabinet approved at the weekend a Dollars 1.7bn heavy oil
project to be carried out by Conoco, a subsidiary of EI du Pont, and
Venezuela's national oil company, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
The project calls for producing and upgrading very heavy crude oil from
Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt, the world's largest known accumulation of
heavy oil and bitumen.
This is the first time a foreign company will be allowed to participate as a
direct investor in Venezuela's oil production sector since the republic
nationalised its petroleum industry in 1976. It is also the first step
towards opening up large-scale production in the belt.
Conoco and Maraven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA,
will be equal partners in the project, according to Mr Frank Alcock, PDVSA
vice-president.
The plan, which must be approved by the Venezuelan congress, involves
producing 120,000 barrels a day of extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco
belt and converting it into 102,000 barrels a day of lighter gravity oil,
plus 3,000 tonnes of petroleum coke.
The belt, north of the Orinoco river, contains an estimated 1,200bn barrels
of extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen.

FT  05 APR 93 / Bonn plans toxic waste retrieval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal environment minister, arrived in
Bucharest yesterday to assess ways to clean up 400 tonnes of toxic waste
illegally exported by Germany to Romania in recent years.
The waste, exported by both east and west German companies, has been stored
in and around the Transylvanian town of Sibiu in corroding containers,
according to the environmental group Green-peace.
Plans were made to take the toxic waste back to Germany in early March. But
disputes between the German states over where the waste should go and who
should pay for its transportation have delayed the move. The total cost of
re-importing the waste is estimated at DM3.3m (Dollars 1.98m).
The plans followed a campaign by Greenpeace which has recently reported a
string of illegal dumping sites used by German companies abroad.
At the weekend, officials from the Environment Ministry in the state of
Lower Saxony ordered back some 3,000 tonnes of metal waste due to be
exported to Russia by a west German enterprise and labelled as industrial
goods, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
The government will probe Hoechst, Germany's largest chemical group, to see
if poor organisation was to blame for a string of accidents at its plants,
officials said at the weekend, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Topfer said he and local officials had agreed on the investigation, to be
carried out by his ministry.

FT  05 APR 93 / Monday Interview: Presenting a bright new image - Joao de
Deus Pinheiro, EC commissioner for internal political relations, talks to
David Gardner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joao de Deus Pinheiro is fortunate to have an engineering background since
he has taken on a job he is having almost to invent. Despite his formal
title as EC commissioner for internal political relations, his real job is
commissioner for 'openness'.
His task is to clean up the image of the Community - and particularly of the
European Commission in Brussels - at probably the nadir of 'Europe's'
popularity with its citizens.
His approach is simple. 'We will tell the truth,' he says reiteratively. 'We
want the citizens to know exactly what is going on,' he insists, adding EC
'information should show things as they are, not as we would wish they
should be.'
This approach could hardly be in starker contrast to the independent report
on EC information policy, presented last Wednesday to universal derision.
That report was ordered by the Commission in November from a committee of
'outside experts', dominated by figures from public relations and
advertising, and headed by Mr Willy de Clercq, former Belgian minister,
ex-commissioner, and now Euro-MP.
Its sub-Orwellian strategy to make Europeans like the political and monetary
union forseen by the Maastricht treaty prescribed, inter alia:
A Euro-office of communications centralised on the Commission, which would
secure 'binding agreements' after every significant EC decision about 'the
message to communicate and the means for its communication.'
'Positioning' the EC as 'a branded product', with its own symbols ranging
from a Euro-birth certificate to a European Order of Merit. The 'targetting'
of journalists and editors (also known as 'transmitters' and 'relevant
multipliers'), 'so that they subsequently become enthusiastic supporters of
the cause'. The 'review' of school text-books, 'not in order to rewrite
history, but to ensure that a European dimension is given to our past.'
Slogans to replace the 'far too technical' EC treaties with the theme of
'togetherness' (for example: TOGETHER TO PROMOTE, PROGRESS &amp; PROSPERITY,
PROTECTION AND PEACE, TOGETHER FOR EUROPE TO THE BENEFIT OF US ALL]). The EC
must be brought 'closer to the people', the de Clercq report says,
'implicitly evoking the maternal, nurturing care of 'Europa' for all her
children.'
Mr Pinheiro says 'we were absolutely taken aback' by this politically
tin-eared ad-man's fantasy when the Commission got it a week ago. Another
top Commission official was less restrained. 'This crap,' he fumed, 'is just
what we need to lose the Danish referendum' on Maastricht - due on May 18,
and still as touch and go as the British government's struggle to get the
treaty through parliament. The instinct of some senior officials was to
suppress an obviously damaging recipe for a public relations fiasco.
Mr Pinheiro's credibility, as the man in charge of restoring the
Commission's credibility, risked going up in flames. 'What are we going to
do?' he says the commissioners asked themselves. 'Should we refuse to go to
the press conference?'
He insisted de Clercq be told he would not get their support, then went with
him to face the press. Amid the tumult of scorn and laughter from the
aggrieved 'transmitters', he firmly but politely took his distance.
'The diagnosis is good, but the therapy is not acceptable. . . at least to
me,' he said. The Commission would be bringing forward its own proposals in
the last week of April. His record as chairman of the Council of Ministers
of the 12 during Portugal's presidency in the first half of last year showed
that 'there was no manipulation'.
'We're not going to go for propaganda,' he pledged, 'the main task is to
tell the truth.' Now he has to prove that this was a first act of openness,
announcing a new dispensation in EC information policy.
Deus Pinheiro, as he is known in his native Portugal, could well be the sort
of man who fits the current mood across Europe. This has as one of its
distinguishing features a revulsion against politics as now practised at
national or Community level.
As Portuguese foreign minister, he was a well-regarded and thoughtful
president of the EC council. By 10.30 on the morning after Danish voters
sparked off the EC's crisis of confidence, rejecting Maastricht last June 2,
he had secured the unanimous support of the 12 to press on with ratifying
the treaty.
Yet a month later, he decided to leave politics. 'I didn't want to be a
professional politician any more. People are tired of the faces they see and
tired of the old politics. They want something more responsive to civil
society, something which uses the strength of society.' Something, he offers
tentatively, 'a bit more like Clinton.'
Nor, initially, did he want to accept his government's nomination as
commissioner; he preferred going back to his tenured professorship of
engineering and to seats on three corporate boards. But when Commission
president Mr Jacques Delors suggested he take on the job of opening up
Brussels policy-making to greater public scrutiny, 'it was such a challenge
I felt bound to accept.'
'A certain humility is called for' within the Commission, he says, in order
to 'stop being secretive, admit our mistakes' and be open about internal
debate. Currently, one of the main functions of the Commission spokesman's
service is to deodorise any whiff of internal controversy, jealously guarded
as cuisine interne.
'If we decide on a certain line, we should stick to it, but that is
different,' Mr Pinheiro argues.
As talks start this week on how to make the EC single market work, Mr
Pinheiro says the project is already partly discredited 'because the
negative sides of it were suppressed. It was always presented in golden
form,' he remonstrates, 'there was no attempt to find a balance.'
'What people want to know is more important than what we want to give them,'
and the reforms he intends to put to his colleagues in a few weeks time will
try 'to make reality available' in a 'demand-oriented, natural way.' If he
gets his way, they will:
Overhaul and slim down the ineffectual information directorate general
(DG10). Staff will be appointed to gather and provide 'information,
background, context and precedent' on demand. 'The structure of DG10 will be
such that everyone will know exactly who is responsible for what,' promises
the commissioner for openness. Have DG10 monitored forensically by a group
of five experts independent of other Brussels departments, and overseen by a
regularly rotated consultative council of users, 'to make sure its working
as a service,' he says.
Make Commission delegations in member states 'of better quality', sifting
differing national concerns and feeding back 'sensitivities, moods and
demands'.
One thing he would like the 12 to do is to allow television cameras into the
Council of Ministers '100 per cent' - except for 'delicate matters
concerning third countries. . .which are usually done over lunch anyway.'
Three Council debates will be televised today and tomorrow, after the
current Danish presidency's temporary victory in arguing down vetoes from
Belgium, Luxembourg and, as it happens, Portugal.
Mr Pinheiro sees changes in the secretive, decision-making habits of some
member states coming slowly. But he is determined that 'the Commission will
have to change overnight.' Not all his colleagues favour transparency, he
acknowledges, forseeing 'a big fight ahead in the Commission.' But he is
utterly confident he has Mr Delors' support to effect 'a huge change in
attitude, from top to bottom.'
'Vanguards are over, people want leadership, yes, but not vanguards, that's
over.'

FT  05 APR 93 / A mini-scare on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Was robust US economic growth at the end of last year a statistical illusion
 -the temporary fruits of increasingly desperate attempts by the Bush
administration to secure a convincing recovery ahead of last November's
election? A school of bearish economists has always harboured doubts. Mr Jay
Levy, senior pessimist at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, claims that
last year's upturn was largely induced by a relaxation of fiscal policy,
following the cut in tax withholding rates last spring and efforts to
accelerate federal spending. Between July and early September, the Federal
Reserve did its bit by cutting the already low federal funds rate by three
quarters of a point.
Sceptics are having a field day. On Tuesday the Conference Board announced
gloomy figures suggesting that most of the post-election surge in consumer
confidence had evaporated by March, when its index fell to the miserably low
level of 62.6, far below normal recovery levels. On Thursday, the Purchasing
Managers' Index - a reliable barometer of conditions in manufacturing - was
reported well down for the second month running. On Friday, markets were
zapped by official figures showing a fall in payroll employment of 22,000
last month, against projections of an increase of 100,000-150,000. Rattled
by the prospect of a price war in the tobacco industry, shares went into a
tailspin, pulling the Dow Jones index down nearly 70 points by the end of
trading.
Cabinet officials jumped on the figures. 'We're sure not coming out of this
recession,' said treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is annoyed that
Senate republicans are still blocking the administration's Dollars 16bn
fiscal stimulus package. Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary (who would
spend much of the cash on a summer jobs programme), gloomily reiterated
earlier warnings that the economy was still too weak to generate 'full-time
permanent jobs'.
Nobody doubts that the economy has slowed from the unsustainable 4.7 per
cent annual rate of growth registered in the fourth quarter. At issue is the
precise rate of growth at which it is now settling. If it were to prove less
than 3 per cent, unemployment might not fall below the current level of 7
per cent, which would cause consternation at both ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue. Pressure for a more expansionary fiscal and monetary policy could
build up rapidly, casting doubt on medium-term efforts to reduce the budget
deficit, which are anyway far less ambitious than most pundits realise.
Fortunately, growth appears more robust than the chronically volatile
monthly figures might suggest. The drop in employment last month was partly
a reflection of severe winter storms and partly a correction following the
outsized 367,000 leap in payrolls in February. Taking the first quarter as a
whole, employment grew at an average monthly rate of 125,000, against 85,000
in the fourth quarter of last year and 38,000 in the preceding three
quarters. This is respectable given slower growth of the labour force than
in previous recoveries.
The Conference Board probably overstated the fall in consumer confidence:
the rival University of Michigan index points to an improvement in consumer
sentiment at the end of last month. Actual spending, meanwhile, has held up
quite well: data for January and February point to real growth of consumer
spending at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter. Factory
orders are running nearly 11 per cent higher than this time last year;
industrial production, while losing a little momentum, is still up more than
4 per cent on an annual comparison.
Fears that the recovery is fading are hard to square with tentative signs of
rising inflationary pressures, which have squelched the bond market's
impressive rally (long yields have edged back above 7 per cent). For bond
traders the most unnerving aspect of Friday's jobs report was the 0.5 per
cent rise in average hourly earnings last month.
This follows a pick up in both consumer and wholesale price inflation since
the start of the year: excluding food and energy (which tend to be volatile)
consumer and producer prices are growing at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent
and 3.4 per cent, compared with 3.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively
in the second half of last year. Some, but not all, commodity price indices
have also risen sharply since Christmas.
The price figures are causing much head-scratching, not least at the Fed,
which in February was predicting further falls in consumer price inflation,
to perhaps 2.5 per cent against 3.0 per cent last year. Unless the wave of
restructuring in US industry has caused a mismatch between worker skills and
employment opportunities, thus raising the 'natural' rate of unemployment
(the rate consistent with stable inflation), it is hard to see why
inflationary pressures should be emerging this soon; yet the range of
indicators pointing to a stirring of inflation seems too broad to be readily
dismissed as a fluke.
The pessimists are wrong to fear a sudden collapse in growth. The more
insidious danger is that the Fed, eager to remain friends with the White
House, will delay tightening monetary policy for too long, in the process
squandering its opportunity to lock in very low inflation.

FT  05 APR 93 / The peacekeeping trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the end of the Cold War, the United Nations seemed at last able to live
up to its charter mandate as the foundation of a better world order. And
since the Gulf crisis of 1990-91, it has gained credibility as the
legitimate enforcer of the international rule of law, with a rapid expansion
of peacekeeping operations in crisis areas across the world.
The war in Bosnia is about to test these expectations in the fire of
reality. And the chances are that the United Nations, and the leading
members of the Security Council, will come out of it badly burned.
Ever since this savage war began, the outside world has feared to get
involved, and has strained to keep it at arm's length. But television has
made indifference impossible; progressively the international community is
being dragged from humanitarian aid to political commitment, and now it is
reaching the bar of desperate military decisions.
With the no-flight ban, the United Nations Security Council last week took a
significant and possibly fateful step down a road which could lead to direct
military involvement in Bosnia. Nato member states made preparations to
provide the combat aircraft to put the ban into action. And if this fails to
bring the Serbs to an accommodation under the Vance-Owen peace plan, the
Security Council will debate tougher sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Certainly, bringing peace to Bosnia seems a logical extension of the UN's
expanded peacekeeping role. Two years ago, the organisation had 15,000
peacekeepers around the world; today it has nearly 55,000 deployed in 14
different operations, from Cambodia to Somalia. Two years ago, in the
two-year budget period 1990-91, the cost of UN peacekeeping operations was
Dollars 819m; last year the cost of peacekeeping rose to Dollars 1.5bn.
This year's peacekeeping budget is Dollars 2.5bn; but expanding activity
means the final figure could work out at anything between Dollars 4.5bn and
Dollars 7.5bn. Peacekeeping is now by far the organisation's single biggest
activity, costing 50 per cent more than the UN's non-peacekeeping budget.
The central problem in the peacekeeping equation concerns the use of force.
If the blue helmets are only there to monitor a ceasefire that is already in
place, the operation may be simple, cheap and uncontroversial. In Somalia,
substantial force was required to guarantee humanitarian aid; but
intimidation of the war-lords was not too difficult, and the UN may now be
able to help restore the state.
With the war in Bosnia, however, the UN is in territory which is not just
uncharted but dangerous. The dilemma is that the international community is
progressively getting hooked on a commitment to make peace in Bosnia before
there is any reliable prospect of a peace agreement. If the warring parties
sign an agreement, on the basis of the Vance-Owen peace negotiations, the UN
will be bound to send troops to enforce it. Given what we know of Serbian
war-aims, it seems likely that even an 'agreed' peace would have to be
imposed by force. In short, the UN could find itself dragged progressively
from peacekeeping into peacemaking, from the monitoring of peace to the
making of war.
Western governments can see the dangers all too clearly; and their generals
have no desire to get into a no-win situation, which could lead to a
military disaster, but which cannot provide a military solution to a
political problem. On the other hand, the UN Security Council is now getting
so deeply committed to the search for a solution, that it cannot easily
declare the problem insoluble and simply walk away.
The UN suspended its rescue convoys from Srebrenica after seven women and
children died in the crush; but world opinion will inevitably demand that
the rescues resume, because the need is so great. So the rescues will have
to take place on a bigger scale.
The hard lesson we may have to learn from the war in Bosnia, is that when
peacekeeping is most desperately needed, it is likely to demand more than
the international community is ready to give. This is not mainly a matter of
money: last year's UN peacekeeping operations cost less than the New York
City Police Department, and was a tiny fraction of one per cent of what the
world spends on defence.
No, the real trouble with this kind of peacekeeping is that it will quickly
come up against three harsh limitations: military resources, the political
will of national governments, and international consent.
If the UN wants serious military capability it can get it only from three
countries and one organisation: the US, France and Britain, and the Nato
integrated command. But the UK is already alarmed at the strain on its
military resources, even by its present rather modest commitment to Bosnia;
it is demanding in advance a commitment to rotation by other countries. The
Germans cannot go, and the Russians will inevitably collaborate with the
Serbs. So where will the UN find other military forces that are both
professional and politically disciplined, for an operation that is bound to
last for years and years?
But even if these three countries were able and willing to take on the
burden, it would look terribly like a neo-imperialistic intervention,
despite the blue UN helmets. That is surely not the kind of peacekeeping the
rest of the world would want to endorse. In short, our vastly expanded
expectations of the UN's peacekeeping role may already have out-run what is
possible. Indeed, they may even have out-run what is desirable.

FT  05 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES will be on the US dollar this week, after Friday's non-farm payroll
figure for March was worse than dealers had expected, writes James Blitz.
The payroll figure is the most important indicator affecting the dollar in
the money markets, and tends to cast its shadow over dealing for some days
afterwards.
Many dealers had been expecting a monthly rise in the payroll of only 80,000
by last Friday morning.
But, far from rising, the number of people in work actually contracted on
the month by 22,000, taking the dollar as low as DM1.5870 on Friday
afternoon.
The later rebounded above DM1.60 in the European afternoon, but dealers
hoping that the dollar will stay above that level have little to hope for
from this week's US indicators.
The consumer prices figure for March, which is due on Good Friday, may
indicate whether there is an upturn in inflation inside the US economy.
Increased US inflation would raise expectations that the Federal Reserve
might raise its official short term interest rates, a move that would be
positive for the dollar.
However, Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London,
believes that last week's US indicators suggest that any rise in inflation
will be on the modest side.
There are expectations, however, that the Bundesbank will shave the rate at
which it offers wholesale funds to commercial banks in its weekly operation
on Wednesday.
There was disappointment that the Bundesbank did not ease official rates
last week. However, the discount rate is now some 67 basis points below the
Bundesbank's repo rate, leaving scope for money market rate cuts.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Deals signal lower lending
margins in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS that lending margins are falling again for UK companies that are
regarded as strong credits were confirmed on Friday with the launch of a
Pounds 125m syndicated loan for Northern Foods.
The five-year loan, arranged by NM Rothschild and Midland Bank, will pay a
margin of 37.5 basis points over Libor - comfortably below the level of
around 45 basis points established by several deals for UK companies last
year.
The terms on the Northern Foods syndicated loan are identical to those on a
recent five-year, Pounds 100m deal for Reuters, led by Warburg.
Bankers said Northern Foods, though well regarded, was not thought as strong
a credit as Reuters. However, Rothschild reported good initial interest from
Northern Foods' relationship banks, at whom the loan is targeted. 'These two
deals have established a new corporate benchmark in the UK corporate loan
market, at least for good credits,' one banker said.
The lower lending margins on the two deals were attributed to the shortage
of high-quality corporate borrowers in the syndicated loans market.

FT  05 APR 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago attempts to put a price on
pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE small and misunderstood sale of pollution rights by the US Environmental
Protection Agency and the Chicago Board of Trade last week was the latest
step in the evolution of a market. Pricing pollution is no different from
pricing bonds, according to Nobel laureate Professor Ronald Coase of the
University of Chicago. His work on determining economic costs of social
problems forms the basis of the EPA's market-based pollution reduction
programme.
'People basically think they need something physical to trade. The point is
you never, ever trade in physicals. You always only trade the rights to
something. Once that's understood, it becomes much easier to see trading in
intangibles,' Prof Coase says.
He says the great advantage of a market-based system for allocating
pollution is that it achieves a set level of pollution reduction at the
lowest possible cost. Eventually, information from that market can become a
valuable public-policy tool. 'Over the long run, it allows us to determine
what the costs of pollution are, and will allow the EPA to balance better
the costs and benefits of pollution control.'
For industry, a secondary market for pollution permits would communicate the
real costs of emissions, forcing producers to factor those costs into the
price of their goods. Even environmentalists like the concept. They can use
their dollars to buy pollution rights and retire them.
The pollution permits scheme will falter, however, if a liquid secondary
market does not develop soon. Only a handful of the permits have traded
privately, and last week's auction also failed as a secondary market. All
the permits sold had been donated by the EPA, not contributed by utility
owners.
The EPA is late in launching its on-line system for clearing secondary
trades, forcing counterparties to construct expensive contracts. Regulatory
and tax uncertainties also stifle the market.
Some investment bankers say the needs of electric utilities are so diverse,
that custom-tailored transactions are likely to win out over mass-market
trading systems.
This view conflicts with that of Mr Richard Sandor, a principal inventor of
financial derivatives and now an advocate for a CBOT futures market in air
pollution permits. He expects the pollution-rights market to mimic the
architecture of the credit markets: screen and telephone-based cash trading;
dynamic, customised off-exchange derivative trading, and an on-exchange
futures market as the ultimate public pricing and risk-management vehicle.
Mr Sandor is willing to be patient - like the bond markets, he expects
pollution market synergies to take two decades to achieve. It may take
longer.
Nevertheless, Chicago's deep-pocketed trader-entrepreneurs have historically
been willing to back applications of the latest pricing theories.
The CBOT is starting a low-cost electronic bulletin board to highlight
allowance bids and offers, and will hold periodic auctions to provide
necessary spot market infrastructure.
The CBOT has competition in this area, because other exchanges - floor and
screen-based - also view pollution rights as a potentially lucrative new
venture.
Even if trading fails to blossom, the existence of the permits has provided
an economic alternative to more expensive pollution abatement techniques.
They have intrinsically brought down costs of environmental compliance.
Regulators are already working to adapt the concept to other forms of
pollution - including nitrogen oxide, a chemical precursor to the noxious
air pollutant, ozone, and to some water pollutants. Prof Coase would like to
see his ideas applied to broadcasting, where he advocates market-based
allocation of radio frequencies and other common carriers. Prof Coase's
theories are becoming increasingly popular, perhaps because of the growing
realisation that the most plentiful of resources  - even air and water - are
finite and thus have a determinable and defendable value.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreign borrowers turn to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surge in issuance in the US corporate bond market, where underwriting
volume reached a record level of more than Dollars 122bn in the first
quarter, has been accompanied by a spate of financings by foreign borrowers
in the US market.
The so-called 'Yankee' bond market - the US market for foreign borrowers -
reached record volume of nearly Dollars 7bn in the first quarter, according
to IFR Securities Data.
Although the market is still dwarfed by issuance in the dollar sector of the
Eurobond market - close to Dollars 40bn in the first quarter, including
global offerings - as well as the US corporate bond market, the Yankee bond
market has proved a vital source of funding.
For leading borrowers, there is little difference between financing costs in
the US and the Eurobond markets. Frequently, the best way for them to
minimise costs is to structure deals as global offerings, with placement in
both the US and Europe, so that paper will flow towards the strongest bid.
Consequently, borrowers such as Finland and Sweden, which might have
considered tapping the Yankee market to meet heavy funding needs, launched
global bonds instead.
What the US market does offer, however, is a home for weaker credits which
are not readily accepted in the Eurobond market. While Eurobond investors
tend to demand exorbitant spreads for borrowers with credit ratings below
the single-A band, US investors have considerable appetite for lower-rated
debt. 'There is an ability to evaluate credit in the US market which is more
advanced than in the Euromarket,' said Mr Charlie Berman, a director of
Salomon Brothers in London.
The appetite of US investors for lower-rated - and consequently higher
yielding - bonds has been fuelled by the sharp decline in US interest rates.
The prolonged rally in the Treasury market has pushed yields down to
historic lows. Even now prices are off their highs, there is still demand
for bonds, simply because investors do not want to leave funds on deposit or
in the money markets because of the negligible returns on offer.
The main beneficiaries outside the US of this appetite for yield fall into
three main categories.
First, some lower-rated companies have been able to fund themselves more
cheaply than in their domestic markets. UK companies have been keen to
access the market, often funding US subsidiaries in this way. In some cases,
they have made use of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144A,
which allows borrowers to issue tradeable securities in the private
placement market without registering with the SEC. Bass and Hanson both
raised large sums in the US market in the first quarter.
Second, the market has attracted emerging countries such as Turkey and
Korea, which are planning to return to the market shortly.
Third, the market has proved a fruitful source of subordinated debt for
banks, which need to shore up their capital to meet new international rules.
Last week, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank successfully placed a Dollars 300m
10-year issue, via J. P. Morgan, priced to yield 140 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury. But much of the surge of issuance in the first
quarter was created by Canadian provinces, which are trying to diversify
their funding to meet heavy borrowing schedules.
In spite of the growth of the Yankee bond market, the amount of paper issued
in the private placement market under rule 144A is still below the
expectations of three years ago, when the market was opened. Most investors
still prefer SEC-registered paper, while insurance companies, which were
always active in the private placement market, remain the mainstay of the
144A market. However, dealers have tried to improve liquidity in the sector
by making markets in the paper, and there have been signs of a broadening of
the investor base.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo reforms feed through to
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first in a series of reforms designed to dismantle the barriers between
Japanese banks and securities houses on April 1 fed through to the Eurobond
market on Friday, when the London-based securities arms of five Japanese
banks launched a spate of deals for Japanese companies.
Previously, the banks had not been allowed to lead-manage Japanese corporate
or bank issues, except for their parent bank.
Among deals totalling Y70bn on Friday, the largest offering was a Y30bn
five-year issue for Mitsui &amp; Co, arranged by Sakura Finance International,
the London arm of Sakura Bank. Sakura has several corporate deals on the
cards for next week.
Typically, most Japanese corporate paper in the Euroyen market is, in fact,
placed in Japan, and is not actively traded. Japanese companies often prefer
to tap the Eurobond market because of the lower fees charged, but the market
has nevertheless proved lucrative for underwriters.
The move is expected to increase the level of competition in the Euroyen
market.

FT  05 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Investor enthusiasm helps prolong rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt rally continued as the market absorbed nearly Pounds 4bn of bonds
but still ended slightly higher on the week.
Investors responded enthusiastically to the Bank of England's biggest gilt
auction, in which Pounds 3bn of 20-year bonds were sold, and also snapped up
Pounds 600m of 10-year stock. A further Pounds 650m tranche of gilts is
going on sale from today.
The market took heart from the lack of evidence that inflationary pressures
were increasing. That fits in with the generally bullish environment for
government bonds in many other important markets.
Another positive indicator was signs of a faint recovery in the UK economy,
which may reduce the pressures on the public sector borrowing requirement,
widely reckoned to reach Pounds 50bn in the 1993-94 financial year.
On the week, gilts at around 20-year maturities gained about half a point
for a yield decrease of 10 basis points to about 8.2 per cent. Yields at the
10-year mark barely changed on the week, and were quoted on Friday night at
7.7 per cent.
The reason for keen interest in gilts - demand for stock at the auction was
roughly twice the amount on offer - is not difficult to explain.
Inflationary expectations in the UK, as measured by the yields on
index-linked gilts, are that over the next few years inflation will be kept
down to relatively low figures of around 4 per cent.
With 10-year gilt yields at their current level, the real yield on offer to
investors is a reasonably healthy 3 per cent to 4 per cent.
The inflation arithmetic appears to be tempting many overseas investors into
the gilt market on the grounds that the yields on offer for UK bonds are
starting to look enticing compared with those on rival types of government
securities.
In Germany, for instance, 10-year government bonds currently offer yields of
around 6.7 per cent. But with inflation appearing to many observers likely
to stay at around 3 to 4 per cent for some time, the anticipated real yield
on these bonds does not look particularly attractive.
Mr Stephen Lewis, of the London Bond Broking Company, believes that the UK's
large current account deficit will be crucial in ensuring that UK
inflationary pressures stay muted for the foreseeable future.
According to Mr Lewis, any effort by the government to expand the economy -
perhaps if it becomes especially worried by further rises in unemployment -
would push the deficit still higher than the Pounds 17.5bn expected by the
Treasury this year. The difficulties of financing this deficit would cause a
run on sterling, which in turn would force the Treasury to tighten interest
rates.
Over the next few months, however, fragile signs of recovery may become
deeper rooted. Anecdotal evidence from various industries increasingly
suggests that demand is picking up.
A new indication may come today with the expected news that growth in M0,
the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and
coins in circulation, was around 5 per cent in the year to last month, well
above the top level of the Treasury's 'monitoring range' of between zero and
4 per cent.
Further signs that increased spending by consumers may also come with
today's figures on the amount of new consumer business in February. This is
expected to show a slight Pounds 100m increase. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, told a House of Commons select committee of
MPs last week that he thought the recession was probably over - a
development that many in the gilt market would welcome, on the grounds that
the gap between state spending and revenues could be expected to start
falling from 1994-95 onwards.

FT  05 APR 93 / US Money and Credit: Gains are consolidated on back of
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY analysts have been waiting for the US bond market to consolidate recent
gains. Last week, their expectations were fulfilled.
The release of the March unemployment figures on Friday caused the benchmark
30-year long bond to lose more than a point, and the yield on the issue to
rise back above the 7 per cent mark. At 7.05 per cent, that was the highest
closing yield since mid-February.
In truth, the bond markets had been edging towards this denouement for most
of the week. Bond prices rose on Monday, but this was largely in reaction to
the previous Friday's sell-off, and thereafter the bond market paid little
attention to a raft of economic data which might have been expected to send
yields lower.
For example, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index fell to
53.4 in March, from 55.8 in February - an indication that manufacturing
activity, although still growing, is doing so at slower rates.
Consumer-confidence data was also weak.
Undeterred, and with all eyes fixed on the March employment numbers, the
long bond yield inched up steadily, from 6.89 per cent on Monday evening to
6.96 per cent by the end of trading on Thursday.
At first sight, Friday's jobs figures appeared to give grounds for
encouragement. While the unemployment rate remained steady at 7 per cent,
the number of payroll jobs actually declined in March. This seemed to
indicate a weakening in the economy, and mitigate against the inflation
threat which had worried the bond market recently.
But analysts pointed out that last month saw exceptionally bad weather -
causing a shortening of the working week and some job losses. It was
notable, for example, that construction employment fell by 59,000 workers in
March.
Moreover, buried amid the data, was 5 per cent rise in average hourly
earnings - evidence that inflationary pressures may be creeping back.
Finally, there were upward revisions to the already-substantial payroll
gains seen in the previous two months.
The bond market read the worst into the figures. The 30-year Treasury yield
head back across the 7 per cent mark, and the yield curve steepened
perceptibly with the yields spread between 10 and two-year issues widening
some 10 basis points, to 218 basis points - a sure sign that the market
scents an inflationary threat.
Whether it is right to be worried may become clearer this week. The key
numbers to watch for will be the producer price index figures on Thursday
and the consumer price index data on Friday.
Analysts are divided over the extent to which these will allay the market's
fears. Salomon Brothers, for example, is forecasting that the PPI will show
a 0.6 per cent advance in March, the largest monthly jump since October
1990. It suggests the increase will be 'broad-based', taking in food
products, petrol and home heating oil, and some big tickets items, like
motor vehicles.
This, in turn, could translate into a 0.4 per cent rise in the 'core' PPI
figure (excluding food and energy). The 'core' CPI figure, meanwhile, is
forecast to have risen by a similar amount. 'If our predictions are correct,
the headline wholesale and retail inflation measures posted their largest
quarterly increases since the leap recorded in the wake of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait,' says one analyst.
But not everyone is so gloomy. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example,
expects the data to 'slow the recent inflation scare'. Here, analysts are
predicting that the PPI and CPI figures will show a rise of 0.3 per cent,
inclusive and exclusive of the food and energy items.
Who is right remains to be seen. But it is safe to assume that the bond
market will remain edgy until the answer is known.

FT  05 APR 93 / Italian Government Bonds: Political crisis continues to
cloud outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past week, old-fashioned sets of scales have been spotted among the
electronic gadgets on Italian bond dealers' desks. So close has the
correlation between the lira/D-Mark exchange rate and the current prices of
Italian bonds and futures become that some say it is now possible to compute
the latter based simply on the former.
Seldom has the link between the foreign exchange and bond markets been so
close. But last week, bond and derivate prices plunged in inverse proportion
to the rising strength of the D-Mark against the lira as Italy's political
crisis grew more acute.
Friday marked a nadir. Prices on the Milan futures market for 10-year bonds
plummeted as prospects of finding a convincing replacement for the
government of prime minister Guiliano Amato grew fainter. Simultaneously,
the lira crossed the psychological L1,000 threshold against the D-Mark for
the better part of the day before being quoted just a sliver stronger at
L999.62, according to the Bank of Italy's indicative rates.
Futures prices in Milan dropped to within sight of 92.50 - the latest
technical floor - as trading reflected the lack of confidence in the
immediate political outlook. Prices for futures had slipped steadily all
week. But the sharpest declines came on Friday, when they fell by about
L1.10 compared with Thursday's close.
Analysts are wondering how much further they will drop. 'We think 91.50 is
the next floor on a technical basis,' says one bond specialist at
Euromobiliare, the Milan-based merchant bank. 'But until we can start
talking again about a coherent economic policy in Italy, it's hard to be
certain where the next floor is.'
Prices are still well above the lows recorded during last September's
currency turmoil, when futures on 10-year government bonds sank to 85.10.
But the two periods are hardly comparable, given the general upturn in
European bond prices that has taken place in the meantime.
A price of 92.50 for the future implies a corresponding gross yield of 13.60
on the latest 10-year bonds. The risk premium on Italian paper is already
'absolutely comparable with that of last autumn,' says Euromobiliare's
analyst.
With political events dictating sentiment, no one expects an upturn at least
until after the referendum on electoral reform on April 18. With last week's
political consultations instigated by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro having
failed to bring about a more broadly-based government, it is up to Mr Amato
to soldier on at least until the referendum.
'Only then will the real process for creating a more representative
government really start,' says a bond specialist at Banco Lariano. In spite
of the achievements of the Amato administration, he thinks only a
broader-based coalition will be able to take the unpopular, but essential
economic, measures required to bring the budget deficit under control.
A period of prolonged political uncertainty bodes ill for both the lira and
bonds. 'We can't expect anything positive in the immediate future,' says the
Banco Lariano analyst. Noting that recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of
Italy have been closely linked to firm action on the economy and curbing the
deficit, 'there's no chance interest rates will go down for the time being,'
he adds.
With widespread gloom about the political outlook for the fortnight ahead,
dealers are looking to the post-referendum period for a possible upturn.
Even then, prospects are uncertain at best. If a new government, including
some of the present opposition parties, can be formed quickly, then the lira
and government bonds should pick up.
But the likelihood of agonising political horse-trading in Rome is just as
strong. In that event, dealers may again have to bring out their sets of
scales to see how much further bond prices could drop.

claims

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT, the hotels and management services group, has rejected demands
made by representatives of a group of preferred shareholders who have said
they intend to bring a lawsuit against the company, AP-DJ reports.
The group includes UBS Securities, an affiliate of Union Bank of
Switzerland, which holds the largest number of preferred shares in the
group.
It maintains that Marriott's split of the company, with one segment
receiving most of the debt and the other most of Marriott's equity, is
'unlawfully coercive of, and detrimental to, holders of preferred stock.'
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group
wants Marriott to change its reorganisation plan, and said it would seek
compensation if the plan goes through.

(Dollars 680m) from BFr22.3bn, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The group, Belgium's largest company by market capitalisation, lived up to
its reputation as a generous payer of dividends by proposing a net dividend
of BFr302 per share, up 4 per cent on last year's BFr290.
The group invested some BFr29.7bn in 1992, against BFr26.2bn the previous

<TEXT>
HERMES, the French luxury goods group, has released details of plans to go
public in June by joining the second market in Paris, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
Hermes, still controlled by the Hermes family, intends to increase its share
capital by 4 per cent, by issuing 467,410 new shares. The price has not yet
been revealed.
The company will also allow three banks - Banque Nationale de Paris, the
BFCE group and Banque Hottinguer - to place a 10 per cent stake among
institutional investors.
The institutions will then be able to sell their shares on the open market.
Mr Dumas said that after the issue the founding family would still own 81.4
per cent of the equity.
Hermes has seen sales growth slow in the past three years since its peak in
1989. However, Hermes, which has 242 sales outlets worldwide, saw sales rise
by 2.5 per cent to FFr2.46bn (Dollars 451m) in 1992 while net profits rose
by 46 per cent to FFr176.2m.

PROMODES, the French retailing group, plans to raise up to FFr2bn (Dollars
367m) from a convertible bond issue to reduce debt and prepare for
acquisitions.
Mr Jacques Beauchet, finance director, said the issue would be worth between
FFr1bn and FFr2bn, 'but closer to FFr2bn'.
He said Promodes was finalising plans and expected to launch the issue
within the next three months.
The issue may involve Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, two of France's
largest banks, taking stakes in Promodes, with BBV, the Spanish bank which
is a shareholder, increasing its present 4.1 per cent holding.
Both Carrefour and Casino, the chief competitors of Promodes in the
hypermarket sector, have recently made major acquisitions.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Czech government seeks new
partner for truck venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CZECH government plans to look for another foreign partner for the Avia
truck company following last week's decision by Mercedes-Benz to abandon its
planned Dollars 250m joint venture with the Prague-based small truckmaker.
Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, said he wanted to
resume negotiations with other potential partners, including Renault
Vehicules Industriels, whose bid was rejected in favour of Mercedes 16
months ago.
Under the agreement with Mercedes, the German motor company was to have
taken an initial 31 per cent stake in the venture with Avia-Praha, and Liaz,
a maker of heavy trucks based in Jablonec nad Nisou, in northern Bohemia.
Avia was to hold an initial 49 per cent and Liaz 20 per cent in the venture.
Mercedes planned to raise its stake later and to invest DM350m (Dollars
218m) over three years to develop and modernise production at the two
plants. Avia's production of small trucks under contract from Renault was to
be replaced by new models.
The aim of the venture was to build up sales in eastern Europe, but the
collapse of markets in the region had made the move less attractive,
Mercedes said. Access to eastern Europe had also become more difficult
because of the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia on January 1 this year.
Mr Jaromir Jiricny, Liaz general director, said he was not surprised by
Mercedes' decision and added that Liaz would continue to produce its own
trucks.
Managers at Avia said they would try to buy a majority share in the company,
though the government's preferred option is to find a foreign partner.
In 1991, Avia made a profit of Kcs25m (Dollars 860,000) on sales of
Kcs2.5bn, while Liaz made Kcs128m profit on sales worth Kcs 3.9bn. Avia then
employed 4,000 and Liaz 6,650 workers.
Both companies need fresh capital and new technology to modernise old
production lines and models.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Tony Brook leads SelecTV changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BROOK, the former managing director of TVS Entertainment, yesterday
became deputy chairman of SelecTV, the independent television production
company rocked by allegations of irregularities and riven by internal
disputes.
Mr Brook, an executive with long experience in ITV, will succeed Mr Peter
Laister as chairman of the company, which makes Birds Of A Feather and
Lovejoy, on May 1.
A report into SelecTV's problems by its solicitors, Richards Butler, is
believed to be heavily critical of the standards of corporate governance.
The company has expanded from a turnover of Pounds 95,000 to Pounds 22m in
less than four years.
Apart from a number of hit shows, its greatest asset is the 15% stake in
Meridian, the ITV company for the south of England, which won its franchise
from TVS.
Following the investigation which was prompted by the issuing of a writ
against Mr Allan McKeown, the managing director, by Mr Michael Buckley (the
former chairman) with the knowledge of Mr Laister, then an independent
director, a number of changes are expected.
They will include SelecTV, expected to make a pre-tax profit of around
Pounds 600,000 for 1992, appointing its own separate finance director and
company secretary for the first time. The Richards Butler report is
understood to clear Mr McKeown, who is married to the actress Tracey Ullman,
of any wrong doing.
However, it is believed that a number of transactions agreed either verbally
with various directors or through memos were not formally minuted by the
board, as they should have been under company legislation.
Further legal action could flow from the Richards Butler report. Apart from
the alleged irregularities mentioned in the writ, which was never served,
the solicitors also looked into how SelecTV came to own 12m shares in a
company called Wilton - the corporate vehicle of Mr Buckley, who was ousted
as chairman of SelecTV last week.
The shares cost SelecTV Pounds 250,000, which has been written off.
The board will take legal advice this week on whether further action is
needed as a result of the Richards Butler inquiry into the share deal.
SelecTV is expected to issue a statement to the Stock Exchange this morning.
Mr Buckley is calling for an independent legal investigation and is
appealing to institutional shareholders of SelecTV to call an extraordinary
general meeting to look at the all the issues involved.

BRITISH AEROSPACE paid its chairmen 48 per cent more in 1992 in spite
plunging to a Pounds 1.2bn loss, the biggest in UK corporate history.
At the same time, the new finance director, Mr Richard Lapthorne received
Pounds 406,191 for six months' service. The figure, revealed in the annual
report and accounts, includes an unpublished amount to compensate him for
the loss of his pension rights at his previous job. This means that Mr
Lapthorne earned more than BAe's chief executive, Mr Dick Evans.
The last two years have seen three BAe chairmen. Mr John Cahill took over
from Sir Graham Day last May and earned more than 80 per cent of the year's
Pounds 439,318 payout; Sir Roland Smith and Sir Graham shared Pounds 297,703
in 1991.
Four directors left the company last year as the losses mounted. Two of
them, unnamed, shared Pounds 552,643 as part of their leaving packages.
The four who left were: Mr Dudley Eustace (finance), Mr Brian Cookson
(legal), Mr Frank Saundry (personnel) and Mr Raymond Mould, chairman of the
troubled property arm Arlington Securities.
The payments are unlikely to win new admirers for the company. BAe is still
struggling to recover from the losses and the European Commission's order
last month that it should repay Pounds 44.4m received in 1988 from the
government to 'sweeten' its purchase of Rover.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: SmithKline chief gets 20% rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive of drug company SmithKline Beecham, received
a 20 per cent pay increase last year to take his annual salary past the
Pounds 1.5m mark.
Mr Bauman, who has seen his high remuneration questioned by some
shareholders in the past, received Pounds 1.02m of salary and benefits and a
Pounds 571,000 bonus last year.
During the period, SmithKline's pre-tax profits increased 11.3 per cent.
Mr Henry Wendt, chairman, saw his pay fall from Pounds 978,000 to Pounds
541,000. This follows his December 1991 decision to spend only about half
his time working for SmithKline.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Kitty Little makes Pounds
150,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In view of the profit made in 1992 and the current trend, Kitty Little Group
is returning to dividends with a payment of 1p. The last distribution was
the final for 1990.
In what was a difficult year for the retail sector, with exports
'surprisingly difficult', the USM-quoted group held its turnover at Pounds
4.74m (Pounds 4.23m) and produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 150,000,
compared with the loss of Pounds 306,000. There were no exceptional charges
this time, against Pounds 218,000.
For the current year results in the first quarter were encouraging. 'I
expect every segment of the business to perform satisfactorily,' said Mr
Graham Webster, the chairman.
The group distributes four main product ranges - fragrances, reading
glasses, sunglasses and luxury toilet bags. It had seen a fundamental change
of profile from the original fragrance business heavily orientated towards
Christmas, but that division still represented about 50 per cent of overall
business.
Earnings per share were 1.05p (losses 1.96p). Cost of the dividend was
Pounds 21,000 after waivers by the directors.

FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Offering packaging for many new
owners - The forthcoming Pounds 70m flotation of RPC Containers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING four owners in six years might be enough for any company. But RPC
Containers, which has enjoyed that distinction, is looking to bring in yet
more new owners with a flotation, likely to value the rigid plastics
packaging group at around Pounds 70m.
Its current owner is a venture capital backed management buy-out arranged
only two years ago. The float is expected in the early summer, beating
internal expectations of the earliest date for flotation.
The business was originally put together by Reed International in the days
when it was in paper and packaging as well as in publishing. Reed bought two
businesses, in 1983 and 1986, and built two factories, giving a total of
five plants.
But in 1988 Reed decided to focus on publishing and a buy-out of the
European paper and packaging side, under the name Reedpack, was arranged.
Reedpack succumbed to a take over by Svenska Cellulosa of Sweden in 1990.
SCA decided to concentrate on paper and paper-based packaging so once again
RPC was up for sale. The mbo beat trade buyers with a bid of Pounds 33.4m.
SCA agreed to defer 40 per cent of the purchase price for three years,
taking Pounds 13.5m of dividend free preference shares.
The float ought to raise more than enough to redeem Pounds 21.5m of
preference shares, including SCA's. Some of the existing shareholders may
use the chance to top-slice their investments.
Despite the regular ownership changes, the operating management of the
company has seen surprising continuity with many directors dating back to
Reed days.
RPC, which cannot use the Reed name, has flourished in the last two years.
Despite a sluggish market for packaging, says Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive,
its volumes have risen by 28 per cent over the period.
Products range from packaging for motor oil to orange juice, paint to pills,
and tomato ketchup to baby wipes. It is aiming to expand in higher margin
areas such as packaging for health and beauty products.
RPC is especially proud of a stone-look plastic cider flagon. Working with
customers on designing new packaging - often part of their marketing
strategy for a product - can be the key to winning business, and improving
margins.
Operating profits have risen from Pounds 2.8m in the year to end March 1991
to Pounds 5m in 1991-92 and are likely to show another significant rise in
the year just ended.
Cash generation has been impressive too. The buy-out started life with
Pounds 12m of debt but when the latest accounts are published that should
have reduced that to only Pounds 1m or so. The five-year loan set up at the
time of the buy-out was paid off before the end of the 1991-92 financial
year.
Significantly, it was repaid from trading not from asset sales. Furthermore,
RPC has been able to finance capital spending and make three acquisitions
totalling between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m.
One drawback might be the heavy reliance on the UK. But Mr Marsh has plans
to expand in Europe. Exports are modest, he says, but growing fast. But what
RPC really needs is a manufacturing base there, and that will have to be
acquired.
Polymer prices could be another worry, as they represent about 30 per cent
of turnover. These have been weak over the last two years and may now be set
to rise again. Increasingly RPC has contracts with customers linking selling
prices to raw material costs, automatically passing on increases.
There are no directly comparable companies on the stock market, so RPC's
arrival is likely to generate interest.

FT  05 APR 93 / Marlboro cowboy wants more territory / Analysis of the
latest effects of a price war and other changes in the US cigarette market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Jim Johnston, head of RJR Nabisco's huge US tobacco operations, knew he
had a problem during the group's annual shareholder meeting Friday morning,
his phlegmatic demeanour gave nothing away.
Only when the meeting finished, did the RJR Nabisco executive concede that
he had a big price war on his hands.
'We will take appropriate steps to maintain our competitive positions in
every segment of the market,' said Johnston, tersely.
The price war comes courtesy of Philip Morris, the leading tobacco
manufacturer in the US. While RJR shareholders were gathering in Delaware,
Morris was telling analysts in New York that it planned to slash the price
of its top-selling Marlboro brand 'to a level which has proven . . . to be
effective in encouraging consumers to make brand selections based on brand
preferences rather than price'.
This is widely interpreted as a price cut of about 40 cents a packet. That
would reduce the retail cost of 20 Marlboro cigarettes from Dollars
2.10-Dollars 2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80 (Pounds 1.26).
Morris will make these savings available by a mix of promotional schemes,
including discount coupons and mail-shot offers, thus formally maintaining
current wholesale prices. It will also extend promotional activity on its
other full-priced brands, such as Benson &amp; Hedges. Finally, the company has
set no time limit on the trade-war: 'We expect to forego any further price
increases on premium brands for the foreseeable future,' said Morris.
For the Dollars 46bn (Pounds 32.3bn) US cigarette market, Philip Morris'
decision to defend market share rather than to chase short-term profits is
momentous. Together, Morris and RJR account for about 70 per cent of all
cigarettes smoked in the US. Marlboro takes almost one-quarter the market -
meaning that it sells about 6bn packs a year. With some justification,
Morris calls its leading brand 'the world's most valuable trademark'.
But, formidable though Marlboro's position has been in the past, the brand
has been badly threatened of late. Last year, for example, Marlboro
shipments fell by 5.6 per cent. Market share, according to John Maxwell,
analyst at Wheat, First Butcher, has been slipping since 1989.
There are two principal reasons for this. First, the entire tobacco industry
is under assault from the health and anti-smoking lobbyists, and from the
nation's tax-gatherers. While such pressures are not new - they largely
explain why cigarette consumption has been declining by about 2.5 per cent a
year in the US - they are particularly acute at present.
On the one hand, a recent Environmental Protection Agency report, claiming
that 'passive smoking' causes 3,000 cancer deaths a year, has almost
certainly accelerated the move towards smoke-free restaurants and
workplaces. On the other, the new 'non-smoking' White House is widely
expected to increase excise taxes on cigarettes to help fund changes in the
nation's healthcare system. Many state governments are also contemplating a
heavier fiscal burden on the industry.
Secondly, there has been the phenomenal growth of 'discount' and 'generic'
cigarettes. These labels were virtually non-existent 10 years ago, and even
as recently as 1990, accounted for less than one-fifth of all cigarette
sales. Today, on Philip Morris' reckoning, they account for about 36 per
cent.
These cheaper cigarettes retail for half the price of the traditional
'full-priced' brands, such as Marlboro or RJR's Winston and Salem.
Ironically, they are made by the same companies which produce the full price
brands.
Philip Morris started manufacturing and promoting its own discount labels in
earnest a couple of years ago, when it realised the inroads cheaper
cigarettes were making into the US tobacco market could not be ignored. RJR,
having concentrated heavily on bolstering its full-price brands in the early
1990s, also redirected its attention to its discount brands in 1992.
But both companies know well that the profits made from these cheaper
cigarettes are a fraction of the very juicy returns which the likes of
Marlboro and Winston generate. It has been estimated that the profit per
pack of Marlboro is about 10 times that made on a pack of the cheapest
'discount' smokes.
So, given this background, analysts had little difficulty in interpreting
the rationale behind Philip Morris's announcement on Friday. 'This is not a
new price war,' said Roy Burry at Kidder Peabody. 'It's the latest blast in
a price war which has already been going on. Philip Morris has come down
with both feet on the market, and it's going to destroy the discount
brands.'
The logic is simple: it will be impossible for the discount cigarettes to
come down in price by a similar amount, so the price differential between
full-priced and cheaper smokes will narrow. If Philip Morris is right, this
smaller differential will mean that smokers' purchasing is governed by brand
preference, not price. So Marlboro, with a classier image and a distinctive
taste, should regain market share. The losers, meanwhile, would be the likes
of Brown &amp; Williamson, part of BAT Industries of the UK, and American
Brands, which are heavily dependent on the lower-priced brands.
Will it work? Competitors, and some analysts, pointed out one obvious danger
 -namely, that Marlboro loses its carefully-cultivated premium image. 'We
view this as a defensive move, cheapening the Marlboro brand,' said B&amp;W. A
second problem could also arise if consumers become resilient to future
price increases, and Marlboro becomes mired.
Philip Morris' strategy will not come cheap. The company said that it
expects operating profits from its US tobacco business to be down 'by as
much as 40 per cent' in 1993 as a result of this strategy. That goes to the
heart of the Morris money-machine: in 1992, domestic tobacco produced an
operating profit of Dollars 5.18bn, almost half the group total of Dollars
10.96bn. Analysts, who had been predicting earnings per share of
approximately Dollars 6.45 for the group in 1993, quickly redid their sums.
New estimates ranged between Dollars 4.75 and Dollars 5.15.
The situation at RJR Nabisco is every bit as gloomy - particularly given the
company's heavy debt load, and current plans to divide its stock into two
share classes, pegged to food and tobacco respectively. Analysts assume that
RJR will have to follow Morris' pricing lead on its full-priced brands, with
the result that domestic tobacco profits - which accounted for 58.8 per cent
of group operating income last year  - will also be savaged.
'It looks as if everyone will have to deal with lower profits for a while',
says Barry Ziegler, at AG Edwards.

FT  05 APR 93 / Standard Chartered to restructure management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is to reshape
its management following the recruitment of Mr Peter Wood, finance director
of Barclays, and the planned retirement of two of the bank's long-standing
senior directors.
The changes, which may result in Mr Wood being given wider responsibilities
than just being Standard's finance director, are likely to include a
reallocation of responsibilities for the bank's treasury and merchant
banking functions.
The bank last month announced a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 202m for
1992 after incurring a Pounds 305m loss in India as a result of the Bombay
securities trading scandal.
It has been trying to strengthen its controls to prevent a repetition.
Mr Wood is taking over as finance director from Mr Richard Stein, but the
bank is also looking outside for a replacement for Mr Alan Orsich, the
deputy managing director in charge of global businesses, who is due to
retire in November. Mr Malcolm Williamson has taken over as chief executive
from Mr Rodney Galpin.
Mr Galpin is due to hand over the chairmanship of the bank to Mr Patrick
Gillam, chairman of Asda, at the bank's annual general meeting in May.
The bank is likely to announce an interim change in its management structure
within a month, and will then consider further how to allocate
responsibilities under Mr Williamson after it recruits a replacement for Mr
Orsich.
One possibility would be the appointment of a deputy chief executive under
Mr Williamson.
Mr Wood, who was excluded from being considered as Barclays' chief executive
by the decision to look outside the bank, would be a prime candidate. But
the bank may not replace Mr Orsich's role as deputy managing director in
this way.
One reason for giving Mr Orsich this responsibility was that he was
along-standing senior director of the bank when Mr Williamson was appointed.
The interim changes have been approved by the bank's board, and are being
explained to the bank's management in regions such as Africa and the Asia
Pacific. They are aimed at strengthening Standard's functional reporting
lines.
The bank is thought to have examined ways of integrating its treasury
function - which has come under Mr Orsich's global businesses division  -
with parts of its financial services division, including merchant banking.
The bank said yesterday that it could not comment on any management changes,
but expected to make an announcement shortly. It said that any changes it
would announce were unrelated to the Bombay securities trading losses.
Fifteen managers - including three in London - have already left the bank as
a result of the Bombay incident. A further six have been reprimanded.

FT  05 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: UK industrial policy set to enter a new
era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that the UK government has extricated itself from the coal debacle, we
can expect the Department of Trade and Industry to start playing a more
prominent part in the economic life of the country.
In the weeks ahead, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
is likely to disclose more of his ideas for increasing industry's
competitiveness in line with the government's new-found commitment to
support manu- facturing.
The DTI is maintaining a resolute silence about Mr Heseltine's plans. But
those who fear that his pledge at last year's Conservative party conference
to intervene to help British companies 'before breakfast, before lunch,
before tea and before dinner' means the UK is returning to discredited
industrial policies of the 1970s may be in for a surprise.
Let there be no mistake. Mr Heseltine is an interventionist by the standards
of the 1980s. He is busy establishing a new dialogue with industry that will
lead to relatively frequent round-table discussions with top UK businessmen
over industry's strategic goals. He prevailed on the Treasury in last year's
Autumn Statement and last month's Budget to provide more support for
exporters.
But this need not mean that the government is about to re-enter the business
of trying to pick winners or support ailing industries or companies. It can
be argued that his solution to the coal crisis was the minimum consistent
with the will of Parliament. Mr Heseltine's refusal to mount a rescue for
the UK operations of the Leyland-Daf commercial vehicle group suggests that
he has no ambitions to revive the DTI as a rescuer of lame ducks.
Indeed, Mr Walter Eltis, who became Mr Heseltine's chief economic adviser
last year, recently provided a timely reminder that a well-run
macro-economic policy can be far more important for the future welfare of
industry than any amount of specific support organised by the DTI.
Delivering the Esmee Fairbairn Lecture at Lancaster University, Mr Eltis
explained how three main handicaps had caused British manufacturing industry
to fall behind that of Germany and Japan. In his view, UK industry:
has been inadequately profitable to cover interest costs;
has had to live with 'extraordinary volatility' of government policy, and;
has allowed trade unions to influence the way companies are run to too great
an extent.
In his lecture (which was given last November but published only last
month), Mr Eltis identified the relative lack of profitability as the
achilles heel of UK industry.
Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
Paris show that despite some recovery, the UK business sector's net
operating surplus (the surplus of net company income over wages and
bought-in inputs) as a percentage of net capital stock consistently lagged
that of the UK's leading industrial trading partners in the 1980s.
The upshot has been an industrial sector that has less financial margin for
error, that lives in fear of its financiers and which is less able than
foreign rivals to develop and market world-beating products. That the UK's
company bosses have been obliged to spend their time on finance, avoiding
bankruptcy, negotiating with trade unions and government and dealing with
take-overs and mergers also explains the dominance of accountants among
their ranks.
Mr Eltis says government has a vital role to play in resolving this state of
affairs. But the role he prescribes might surprise those who see the DTI as
a potential hot-bed of intervention in company affairs.
He argues that the predictability and stability of the macro-economic
environment can swing the balance between success and failure for companies.
In addition, the structure of taxation and public expenditure can have 'a
vital impact on industrial relations and the freedom with which managements
can achieve and finance higher productivity and faster economic growth'.
These appear to be big claims for a policy that seems reminiscent of the
'hands-off' approach to industry pursued in the Thatcher years.
But Mr Eltis provides some persuasive arguments to support his case. It is
precisely because average profitability is low in British industry that the
predictability and stability of the cash flow to be expected from
investments are especially important.
Government must therefore achieve low inflation and control its borrowing.
Financial markets punish failures with higher interest rates and currency
movements that can wipe out profits on longer term contracts. Mr Eltis cites
research from the mid-1980s by Mr Sushil Wadhwani, now an economist with
Goldman Sachs in London, to the effect that each 1 per cent addition to the
inflation rate adds almost 6 per cent to the number of company insolvencies
in the UK.
The importance of controlling government expenditure and limiting the impact
of taxation on individuals and companies can be seen in the UK's greatly
improved industrial relations, last Friday's transport strikes
notwithstanding.
Real wages and profits grew strongly in UK industry in the 1980s, creating
an environment where employees and manufacturers could gain from
co-operation. Such a scenario would have been less likely if the state had
channelled most of the increase in national income into the public sector.
The government's industrial policy, when finally disclosed, will contain all
manner of specific measures that will be battened on to its increasingly
pro-business macro-economic stance. Some, such as the abolition of the car
tax, were introduced in the Autumn Statement. Others, such as the real
freeze on business rates, came in the Budget. There is still much to do by
way of cutting red tape and enabling small companies to grow.
In his lecture, Mr Eltis was not speaking for his boss. But it would be
unusual if Mr Heseltine were to turn against a philosophy in which
government facilitates the growth and recovery of manufacturing rather than
force-feeding it.
Industrial policy in the 1990s may therefore see the Treasury and DTI in
harmony rather than at loggerheads.

<TEXT>
FOR the first time since Deutsche Bank bought Morgan Grenfell just over
three years ago, a senior executive of the parent bank will take a direct
role in the management of the UK merchant bank's German operations.
Mr Jurgen Bilstein, 45, named last week as head of corporate finance at
Deutsche Bank, has become one of four managing directors of Morgan
Grenfell's German subsidiary.
This will give Deutsche its first direct influence over the day-to-day
management of Morgan Grenfell in Germany, which with 30 professional staff
is Germany's largest mergers and acquisitions operation.
'The changes have been implemented at my initiative,' said Mr John Craven,
chairman of Morgan Grenfell and board director of Deutsche Bank.
'Although Morgan Grenfell is head and shoulders above any other M&amp;A house in
Germany we felt we would be able to do a more effective job for our
customers in Germany if we co-operated more closely with the parent bank.'
Mr Bilstein will be reporting indirectly to Mr Craven on M&amp;A issues, but as
head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank he will report to Mr Ronaldo
Schmitz, the Deutsche board member responsible for corporate finance. Under
the Deutsche Bank definition this does not include M&amp;A.
On occasions German clients have asked Deutsche to advise on M&amp;A
transactions to the exclusion of Morgan Grenfell.

FT  05 APR 93 / Rocard takes control of Socialists: Aspiring French
presidential candidate ousts Fabius as leader of party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S Socialist party, shattered by losing more than 200 seats in last
month's general election, has been further shaken by a weekend political
coup in which Mr Michel Rocard has toppled Mr Laurent Fabius as party
leader.
The speed and manner with which Mr Fabius was ousted by Mr Rocard, who still
claims to be the party's presidential candidate in 1995 despite losing his
parliamentary seat, has led to bitter recriminations. A number of younger
Socialists are now looking to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president who is a French Socialist, to salvage their party.
After a long debate within the party's executive board on Saturday, Mr
Rocard was voted the head of a provisional committee to steer the party
until it holds its congress in July, effectively dissolving the post of
first secretary which Mr Fabius has held for 18 months.
As so often in French socialism, personality rather than policy was the
determining factor. Mr Fabius has long been President Francois Mitterrand's
proxy in trying to block the rise of Mr Rocard, a relative late-comer to the
Socialist party whom the president considers a dangerous opportunist.
The upshot of Saturday's battle is to leave Mr Mitterrand more politically
isolated than ever as he faces the new conservative government of prime
minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Fabius managed to keep his own
parliamentary seat, and the new leader of the much-diminished parliamentary
Socialist party is a Fabius supporter. But the party leadership, at least
until July, has passed into hands hostile to Mr Mitterrand.
Mr Rocard said yesterday he would give 'priority to the reconstruction of
the left' rather than to 'personal adventures'. But the 62-year-old former
prime minister evidently calculated he could not afford to delay preparation
of his presidential bid by letting Mr Fabius continue in his post even for
four more months.
Few of Mr Rocard's declared supporters kept their seats last month. But he
capitalised on Mr Fabius's nominal responsibility as party leader for the
election debacle, and won backing from supporters of Mr Lionel Jospin, a
departing party heavyweight.
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a left-wing former defence minister, resigned
from the party yesterday, condemning what he called 'a petty palace revolt.'
A group of younger Socialists, known as the quadras (for quadragenarians)
because they are all in their forties, has become increasingly fed up with
the Rocard-Fabius-Mitterrand internecine warfare in the party.
The quadras' leader, Mr Francois Hollande, who also runs Mr Delors's
official political fan club in France, yesterday said Mr Rocard had behaved
like a machine politician 'of the worst kind', and called on him to resign
from his new post.
Mr Delors should intervene, Mr Hollande said, to 'insist that everyone rally
round the party, and that all those involved in such operations (as
Saturday's manoeuvring) should step down for a time'.

FT  05 APR 93 / All is ship-shape again at the Baltic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROTECTIVE sheeting is renewed over the south dome of the London
headquarters of the Baltic Exchange, the world's largest shipping market, in
preparation for today's reopening less than a year after it was wrecked by
an IRA bomb, writes Charles Batchelor.
Rebuilding the exchange's 1903 neo-classical trading floor will, however,
take another two or three years. Traders, who have been working at the
Lloyd's of London offices nearby, will return to the Baltic's St Mary's Axe
headquarters, but they will work in the Queen's Room, an austere underground
banqueting hall built in the 1950s.
Unlike other 'open outcry' markets which have closed trading floors in the
move to electronic dealing systems, the Baltic Exchange has kept its clubby
atmosphere. Today's move comes as the exchange reappraises its future - the
number of traders attending the daily market sessions has been falling, and
most tanker contracts are now negotiated on screen. But the exchange still
accounts for more than half the world's bulk cargo chartering business -
buying and selling space in oil tankers and in 'dry cargo' vessels carrying
commodities - and an even larger share of ship sale and purchase contracts.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Property owners must have hoped that news of the proposed law reform
concerning privity of contract in commercial leases was an April Fool's
joke. Sadly for them, the government seems deadly serious, although the
timing of the legislation is unclear. The government did not go as far as
many tenants wanted and refrained from changing leases retrospectively.
Nevertheless, the reform will marginally lessen the security of income for
property investors. It also represents a further shift in the balance of
power from landlord to tenant, although bleating about it savaging property
values can safely be dismissed. More worrying for the long term was the
environment secretary's announcement that he will review upwards-only rent
reviews, confidentiality clauses and procedures for resolving disputes. Any
such changes to commercial leases would have far-reaching implications for
property owners.
The uncertainty may deter those contemplating a return to direct investment.
Overseas investors have found the security of UK property leases attractive
with German funds buying about Pounds 600m of UK property last year. There
are also signs that domestic funds are again looking to buy after budget
changes which marginally increased property's relative appeal to gross
funds. It would be unsettling if the government prevaricates. But the
precedent on privity of contract is not good. The lord chancellor has
already taken five years to act on the Law Commission's main
recommendations.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The raft of companies floating on the market seem to be enticing Sid into
making a comeback. With returns on cash being whittled away by falling
interest rates and the stock market buoyed by hopes of recovery, private
investors seem prepared to take a punt on new issues once again. Last
month's offering by David Lloyd Leisure was almost seven times
oversubscribed. Westminster Health Care, a nursing homes company, which is
raising Pounds 63m this week, has had requests for prospectuses from 45,000
potential investors.
Institutional investors, too, appear receptive to issues from smaller
companies with a big exposure to the UK economy. Although the FT-SE 100 has
performed somewhat laggardly this year, smaller capitalisation stocks have
risen by almost 15 per cent. This may encourage more flotations. The timing
would certainly seem to be ideal for management buy-out companies
contemplating a return to the market. MBOs which have struggled through the
recession appear in need of funds to finance expansion. But the window of
opportunity may not last.
Secondary issues from quoted companies will continue to take money from
shareholders' pockets. So far this year, almost Pounds 3bn has been raised
in rights issues. Big equity issues from ICI and British Telecommunications
will follow this summer while the government's gilts programme will drain
further funds.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the timetable for demerger set, haggling over the valuation of Zeneca,
the bio-science side of ICI, can begin in earnest. Whatever the outcome, the
Pounds 1.3bn rights issue planned for June will be priced below the level
envisaged by management when the plot was hatched. The healthcare sector has
underperformed the market by 40 per cent since the start of 1992. Hence
Zeneca may emphasise its recovery promise in speciality chemicals and
agrochemicals, which together account for 60 per cent of sales.
Stripping out costs attributable to ICI, specialities made perhaps Pounds
45m profit last year on sales approaching Pounds 1bn. Assuming trading
margins of 10 per cent - after restructuring and a favourable exchange rate
 -operating profits of Pounds 100m should be achieved in a good year. The
outlook in agrochemicals is clouded by the reform of the CAP and pressure on
prices. Any big advance on last year's Pounds 85m trading profit may require
weather conditions that give pests a field day.
Pharmaceuticals may thus still have to provide the engine for growth. Zeneca
has survived the kind of patent expiry now confronting others. If that makes
it less risky, the yield should reflect as much. Since the 1993 dividend has
been set at 27.5p, a share price of 700p - and a rights issue price some way
below - would give a yield roughly in line with Glaxo. Zeneca would
doubtless argue that a multiple of around 14 times this year's forecast
earnings is a miserly assessment of its drugs pipeline. With the market so
suspicious of pharmaceuticals, though, it will do well to get away with any
more.

The conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie for insider dealing has reopened
anxieties about legislation in this area, due back in parliament after
Easter. The Mackie case appears to confirm the view that insider laws trap
those undeserving of punishment while the real miscreants walk away scot
free. Mr Mackie was not acting for personal gain. But on his advice, clients
of Bell Laurie White were saved losses in Shanks &amp; McEwan. Is that just a
good analyst doing his job? Those who were not privy to the same information
might reasonably think otherwise.
The case shows how easily the cosy relationships between companies, brokers'
analysts and large investors can fall foul of the existing law. It could be
a lot worse under the new legislation which so broadens definitions that
even apparently innocuous information may be deemed illicit. Still,
analysts' worst fears look unfounded. They are unlikely, for example, to be
prosecuted for circulating market-moving forecasts to their clients. Were
that the spirit of the age, there would be more prosecutions under existing
legislation.
The real danger is that some companies will use the new legislation as an
excuse to clam up, except on set-piece occasions such as annual results.
That would be a pity. The more information in the public domain, the less
insider dealing is a problem. Truly skilful analysts can then work out what
it all means, just as they must now interpret more detailed financial
information under the new accounting standards. Mr Mackie may have thought
he was doing his job. But there would have been no confusion over
confidentiality - and no need to prosecute - if Shanks &amp; McEwan had issued a
profits warning the moment it realised earnings fell short of expectations.

FT  05 APR 93 / Spanish PM threatens to quit over party corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FELIPE Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, and his ruling Socialist
party are heading for a clash this week over a corruption scandal that is
seriously damaging Socialist chances of being re-elected later this year.
In a pointed interview at the weekend, Mr Gonzalez hinted that he might
resign as party leader if the Socialist party machine did not take political
responsibility for the scandal.
At issue is the so-called Filesa affair - named after a bogus consulting
company, run by senior party officials, which took money from big business
in return for industrial research which was never done. The money was used
to pay Socialist election expenses in the late 1980s.
The affair has hurt the party in polls ahead of elections which must be held
before the end of the year. It has also sharpened old tensions between Mr
Gonzalez's conservatively minded government and the more radical party,
which has vigorously denied it had anything to do with Filesa.
Mr Gonzalez had not wanted to stand for a fourth term as prime minister, but
was persuaded to do so by the party, which sees that its only chance of
winning over the electorate is with him as leader.
However, he has begun to realise that public opinion is heavily against
waiting for a court ruling on Filesa and in favour of a show of political
responsibility - one or more senior resignations - by the party or
government.
In his interview on Spanish radio, he said he was not pressing anyone to
resign but hinted that he was not prepared to go to the electorate with the
scandal hanging over him.
If Mr Gonzalez were to withdraw, there seems little doubt that the
Socialists would suffer severe reverses.
A party executive meeting scheduled for today has been delayed until
Saturday as party infighting intensifies.
The most likely candidate for sacrifice would be the No 3 man in the party,
Mr Jose Maria Benegas who has, it is reported, already offered to resign.
A Basque, Mr Benegas is an old Socialist warrior who has courageously stood
up to intimidation from Basque separatist terrorists in the past. But under
his direction the party has failed to satisfy public unease about the
financing scandals.

FT  05 APR 93 / Leading Article: Drugs on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Concorde team of medical researchers should be congratulated for
carrying their trial of the leading Aids drug AZT through to its unexpected
conclusion, announced on Friday. They had courageously resisted strong
pressure to abandon the study from colleagues, particularly in the US, who
thought wrongly that they already knew that AZT would benefit people
infected with HIV.
As it turned out, the modest benefits found after a year's AZT treatment -
the point at which three smaller US trials were stopped - had disappeared by
the end of the three-year Concorde study. The drug failed to delay the onset
of Aids symptoms.
This is desperately sad for many thousands of HIV-positive people who had
hoped AZT would hold the disease at bay. But it is a powerful vindication of
the patient European approach to clinical trials, as opposed to the American
tendency to rush to premature conclusions on inadequate evidence. In the
long run this study will help people with HIV, by exposing the inadequacies
of AZT and therefore making it easier for researchers to test other drugs.
This is not the first time a large European clinical trial has justified
itself, after initial disapproval from American specialists who thought they
knew the answer.
In the late 1980s US cardiologists attacked Isis-3, an Oxford University
study of 46,000 heart attack victims who received either an expensive new
'clot-buster' drug or a 30-year-old treatment to dissolve blood clots. A
leading US newspaper even ran an editorial entitled 'Human Sacrifice' which
suggested that it would be unethical for doctors to take part in a trial
comparing TPA, a glamorous biotechnology product, with the evidently
inferior old streptokinase. However, the report of the Isis-3 study,
published a year ago, showed that streptokinase saved as many lives as TPA
and caused fewer strokes as a side-effect. This enabled hospitals to cut
drug bills and reduce the number of strokes.
Large-scale clinical trials, in which groups of patients are given different
treatments, can be highly effective in answering the big questions in
medicine. One such question is whether drugs that reduce high levels of
cholesterol in the blood save lives. Since excessive cholesterol is known to
be an important cause of heart attacks, the answer might seem to be yes. But
the existing clinical evidence is ambiguous and Oxford researchers are
planning a Pounds 10m trial, in which 10,000 people take a
cholesterol-lowering drug and 10,000 take placebo (dummy) tablets for five
years. This should either prove that the treatment works or, if not, save
hundreds of millions of pounds a year in unnecessary drug bills.
In the field of Aids research, the understandable impatience of HIV
activists has made it hard for drug companies or government agencies to
organise large enough clinical trials to give worthwhile results. The
Concorde study shows why these attitudes must change.

FT  05 APR 93 / Leading Article: Latin risks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a decade in which it was relentlessly snubbed, Latin America is once
again in the enthusiastic embrace of the world's financiers. The last time
this happened, the relationship ended in tears. Will the renewed affair
enjoy a happier conclusion? There are many reasons why it should.
Most Latin governments, with the exception of Brazil, are managing their
economies more effectively than in the early 1970s: budget deficits are down
and countries such as Mexico are in surplus. Governments have cut tariffs
and ended import quotas; they have privatised state industry and held to
tight monetary and fiscal policies. These have been important steps to
improving economic efficiency and have resulted in renewed capital flows
which have been encouraged by low returns in more established markets.
In most countries, these inflows are smaller in comparison with the size of
the economies than they were in the 1970s. They are also more varied than
the predominantly bank-financed foreign currency flows of the 1970s. A
significant component is invested in equity and an important part of that is
direct investment, yielding results in technology transfer and enhancing
labour skills. Yet while growth has picked up, only in one country, Chile,
has there been a true breakthrough. Its economy expanded 10.4 per cent last
year while inflation fell to 12 per cent. For years the country in Latin
America with the lowest savings, it now boasts a domestic savings rate of
over 20 per cent of GDP.
This is in large part thanks to ambitious pension fund reform, now being
copied elsewhere in the region. Chile is otherwise well positioned for
future strong and stable growth yet this has required a decade or more of
economic reforms. Most Latin American countries have been reforming for a
shorter period. In Mexico, where economic reform is otherwise furthest
advanced, growth is still sluggish as old industrial capacity closes down in
the face of tough foreign competition. A big current account deficit is
being financed in part by large inflows of short-term capital, a significant
reversal of which could have severe long-term consequences. Argentina has
cured hyperinflation but at the cost of an exchange rate which is torturing
domestic industry. In Venezuela, economic reform meets social protest; in
Brazil, it has hardly been tried.
Where reform is advancing, a new order of economic legislation is being
embarked upon. Governments will also have to focus on longer term issues
such as education, health care, poverty and taxation. Renewed optimism about
the region must therefore be mixed with caution.

FT  05 APR 93 / Leading Article: Living with US trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON'S self-righteous indignation over the sins, actual and alleged,
of its trading partners is both irritating and depressing. But it is not a
justification for despair. Much of the posturing is for domestic effect and
also reflects the early days of an inexperienced administration with a
predominantly domestic focus. Many in the administration, not least the
president, understand the US interest in multilateral trade. It is up to
others, above all the European Community, to help them focus on the wider
picture.
It will not be that easy, given the unwillingness of the administration to
think trade policy out from first principles. Mr Mickey Kantor, President
Clinton's feisty trade representative, argues that policy will be
'pragmatic', 'realistic' and 'results-oriented'. Not for him, he insists,
are debates over the 'theology' of free trade versus protectionism. Yet only
last week Mr Kantor said that 'we see a trade policy emerging that is more
active, anticipatory, inclusive and flexible.' This may not be theology, but
it is obscure. And what of the insistence on 'fairness'? Can anything be
more theological than a notion that can be neither defined with precision,
nor measured with accuracy. And, if 'fairness' means anything, what can be
'fair' about reliance on clout available only to a superpower?
The starting point has to be an understanding of what trade is for? Trade's
aim is to import things more cheaply than when made at home. In short, 'it's
the imports, stupid.' The problem with much trade policy is that it is not
based on this truth. This is true of 'fair trade' law, whose aim is to make
imports more expensive than they need be. The policy is 'pragmatic', but
largely in the sense that it buys more political support than it loses.
Current US priorities are likely to fail the test of 'pragmatism' in far
more than merely this fundamental sense. The North American Free Trade
Agreement is economically important, but it cannot offer as much to the US
as the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Similarly, what has
made more than 60 countries liberalise unilaterally since the start of the
Uruguay Round in 1986 is recognition that such liberalism was in their own
interest. But the more they are told that they owe liberalism to the US, the
less politically acceptable such liberalism is likely to be.
The end of the cold war has provided what may turn out to be a unique
opportunity for establishing a liberal trading system with a truly global
coverage. For the new administration this opportunity still has a relatively
low priority. But this is no more than a period of transition. What could
turn it into something more prolonged than that would be a decision by the
EC, encouraged by the new French government, to take the US gauntlet up
prematurely.
Mr Clinton is still likely to obtain from Congress a relatively unencumbered
renewal of the 'fast track' authority needed to complete NAFTA and the
Uruguay Round. The US could then be once more the source of both the ideas
and the energy to move global trade policy forward. In the meantime, it is
up to the EC above all to stop the global trade show from running off the
road.

When it comes to new ideas on performance-related pay, it's hard to beat the
Americans.
Take yesterday's Sunday Mirror exclusive about a Californian high school
football team which suddenly started to fire on all cylinders after the
coach introduced a new bonus scheme.
Although details of the bonus scheme have still to come out in court, it is
alleged that the coach's wife gave the team an incentive by rewarding them
on a sliding scale. A good pass deserved a kiss and a cuddle, tackling the
opposition quarterback got heavy petting, and so on. The team's assistant
coach says the team got carried away because of his boss's obsession with
victory.
By contrast, GKN executive chairman Sir David Lees' bonus scheme, revealed
in the latest accounts, seems rather tame. Sir David has waived his
performance related bonus of Pounds 42,750 and agreed that it will only
become payable when GKN's earnings exceed the Pounds 100m mark - provided
this occurs prior to 1997.
Given that GKN earned Pounds 48.4m last year, it sounds a rather demanding
target, until its remembered that GKN earned Pounds 120m in 1989.

Only a dash of colour (red, perhaps) can save the politically correct 'Mao
jacket', if China's fashion designers are to be believed.
The cheerless blue or grey high-collared jackets that were the stern
revolutionary uniforms of Mao Zedong's day are selling so poorly in China
these days that even a 60 per cent discount cannot shift them from the
warehouses, according to yesterday's China Daily newspaper.
Beijing's Meidu Garment Factory - chosen by the Ministry of Light Industry
as a leader in quality Mao jackets - has ceased production and shops are
clearing them from their shelves to make way for more stylish and pricey,
western brand names.
'The first thing to do to restore the Mao jacket's popularity is to brighten
up the colour,' one garment designer said.

Britain's high streets have been overwhelmed by a tidal wave of building

shops, they asked, the friendly old-fashioned shops - cobblers,
greengrocers, fishmongers?
Now the recession is starting to deprive them of this subject of
conversation. Does Highgate high street in north London represent the thin
end of the wedge?
Two of the big building societies have already closed down expensively
purchased estate agency branches there. And now a shop that used to
specialise in elaborate antique mirrors has been replaced with an
old-fashioned greengrocer.
Whatever next: a traditional ironmonger selling mops, brushes and galvanised
iron pails?

A sure sign that all is not well with a country's paper is when there are
too many zeros to fit on the currency traders' computer screens. Both Italy
and Brazil have been sufferring such embarrassment of late.
The problem has been most acute in Brazil where the ever weakening cruzeiro
now sells at 40,000 to the pound and rising daily. President Itamar Franco
refuses to make traders' life easier by lopping off three zeros and
introducing a new currency, because this would be a blow to his country's
national pride.
Having publicly rebuked his last finance minister for suggesting such a
move, Franco has not been convinced by the planning minister's idea to
rename his currency the 'strong cruzeiro'.
In the meantime the more enterprising Brazilian businessmen are starting to
take matters into their own hands by creating their own currency units.
Lorenzetti bathroom fitters, for example, is now quoting prices in URLs, the
Lorenzetti Referential Unit each of which is currently worth 22,983.63
cruzeiros. Prices will remain fixed in URLs. But the URL will, of course,
accompany the roughly one per cent a day inflation.
The problem of too many noughts is proving infectious. Italy has also been
afflicted following the lira's fall through the L1000 mark against the
D-Mark on Friday. Reuters, which provides a large share of the dealing
equipment used in the currency markets, was one of the first to smell
trouble when its machines started to go on the blink.
The company's terminals are set up to take only three figures before the
decimal point on the lira/D-Mark cross rate. So, when the lira crossed from
L999 to L1000 for the first time, the computer system started rejecting the
quotes. For a brief period, London dealers reported DM1 as being worth
L000.00.
'Not in our lifetime,' was the comment of one 23-year-old dealer.

FT  05 APR 93 / Fitness plan for body and soul: Michael Prowse considers the
options facing the Clinton administration as it wrestles with reform of US
healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton sends healthcare reform plans to Congress next
month, he will be proposing social and economic change of a scale and
complexity seen only twice before in US history - during Lyndon Johnson's
'Great Society' of the 1960s and Franklin Roosevelt's 'New Deal' of the
1930s.
Healthcare accounts for about one seventh of US gross domestic product,
making it the nation's largest business and a sector that, economically, is
more significant than all US export industries combined. Its political clout
is more than commensurate with its economic muscle: when Mr Clinton's task
force held a public hearing in Washington last week, representatives of 160
special interest groups - from the American Medical Association to the
National Farmers Union - turned up to give evidence.
Needless to say, they opposed many of the changes the White House is
expected to propose, and could not agree on the principles that should guide
reform.
Mr Clinton's fundamental goals are easily understood and hard to quarrel
with. He wants to bring the US into line with other industrial countries by:
Giving all citizens a legally enforceable right to a standard package of
health benefits. At present some 35m people (15 per cent of the population)
have no insurance cover, and 100,000 people a month are estimated to be
losing coverage as a result of corporate cuts, unemployment or sickness -
which makes them 'bad risks'.
Reducing the uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs through a reform of
the healthcare industry involving 'managed competition' between providers of
healthcare and the imposition of 'global budgets' or ceilings on total
spending. In the past three decades healthcare spending has grown twice as
fast as the rest of the economy.
Achieving these goals, however, raises a seemingly endless series of complex
questions that are likely to be resolved only after protracted debate in
Congress and intense lobbying by interest groups.
The first thorny question is what to include in the basic package of
guaranteed benefits. Oregon state has generated enormous controversy by
openly drawing up a set of healthcare priorities for its public programme
and declining to fund treatments that are either unlikely to succeed or too
expensive or both.
The standard benefits package would have to include most doctors' services
and routine hospital acute care. But what about organ transplants and
experimental drugs for treating cancer? What about the cost of prescription
drugs, which are not covered by Medicare, the federal scheme for the
elderly? What about abortion, which Congress has never previously agreed to
finance with taxpayer dollars? What about mental health care and long-term
nursing home care, which are heavily restricted even in generous private
insurance schemes, yet which Mr Clinton has indicated he wants to make more
available?
If many of these items were included, the expenditure on healthcare could
balloon: the federal government, at a minimum, would have to upgrade the
benefits provided for the elderly under Medicare, at a cost of perhaps
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn) a year.
A further unresolved question is who should decide what benefits to include
in the standard package and when it should be improved to reflect
technological change. The task force is considering setting up a National
Health Board, loosely modelled on the Federal Reserve Board. Yet in a nation
unaccustomed to any form of deliberate restraint in healthcare, such
decisions would be far more contentious than those on interest rates.
Ultimately Congress and the White House would have to decide.
But deciding what everybody has a right to is only the first tricky issue.
Mr Clinton then has to ensure that everybody is covered and find an
acceptable means of controlling costs in the longer term. He also has to
decide how much freedom to give individual states, whose existing healthcare
systems vary tremendously, partly as a result of differences in wealth and
population density.
The fundamental framework for reform envisaged by the task force is an
uneasy amalgamation of ideas put forward by analysts with very different
philosophical beliefs about the role of government. Mr Clinton is impressed
by aspects of the 'managed competition' schemes that Mr Alain Enthoven, a
business professor at Stanford University, has been refining for years with
the help of a group of experts who meet regularly at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
But he wants to supplement them with budget controls long favoured by
left-wing Democrats. (In the late 1980s, Mr Enthoven influenced healthcare
reform in Britain by advocating an 'internal market' - a form of managed
competition - within the UK National Health Service.)
Like most analysts, Mr Enthoven concedes that unsupervised competition in US
healthcare has led to runaway cost inflation and worrying gaps in insurance
coverage, especially in the small business sector. The central innovation of
managed competition is to require individuals and small companies to
purchase care collectively through intermediaries or sponsors that would
negotiate terms with competing health plans offered by networks of insurers,
hospitals and doctors in the private sector.
The sponsors, now generally known as a 'health insurance purchasing
co-operatives' (HIPCs, pronounced 'hippicks') would act as conduits for
large pools of citizens and thus have the market clout to force doctors and
hospitals to provide high-quality care at lower prices, for example by
replacing traditional fee-for-service medicine with more economical
alternatives, such as the pre-paid plans offered by Health Maintenance
Organisations. They would also regulate local health markets, ensuring that
all certified health plans offered at least the minimum guaranteed package
of benefits on the same terms to all applicants, regardless of age, sex or
health status.
In most variants of managed competition, the current practice of
unrestricted tax relief for corporate health schemes would be ended; tax
deductibility would be limited to the cost of the cheapest plan in any area
offering the standard benefits package. The theory is that the combination
of competition and fiscal incentives would control health costs without the
need for bureaucratic controls on the private sector.
Managed competition has never been tested. But there are some indications
that shifting more people into HMOs and other forms of managed care would
reduce costs. Mr James Robinson of the University of California at Berkely
recently analysed health plans used by Bank of America employees in
California. In 1989 the average expenditure per employee enrolled in an HMO
was Dollars 1,853; average spending on employees who opted for traditional
fee-for-service medicine was Dollars 2,968. Only about 10 per cent of this
cost difference reflected the fact that enrollees in the HMO tended to be
healthier than those who opted for an unrestricted choice of physicians and
hospitals.
The problem with many managed competition schemes is that employers and
individuals are not obliged to purchase insurance, although subsidies might
be provided for small companies, low income workers and the unemployed.
Universal health cover is thus not guaranteed. And since premiums are freely
negotiated between the HIPCs and networks of providers, there is no
certainty that costs would be controlled.
Mr Clinton is thus expected to supplement managed competition in two ways,
both foreshadowed in the innovative healthcare reform plan proposed last
year by Mr John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner for California. The
Clinton plan is expected to:
Achieve universal access by requiring all employers to insure workers, but
ease the burden by subsidising the cost of premiums for employees of small
companies (80 per cent of the currently uninsured population are members of
families whose heads are employed). Task force working papers suggest the
share of costs employers would have to meet might range from 50 per cent for
the smallest companies to 80 per cent for the largest. Making employees
responsible for the remainder would encourage people to choose the cheapest
plan certified by the local HIPC as providing the federally approved
standard package of benefits.
The administration may phase out the Medicaid programme that currently
provides insurance for about half of people living below the official
poverty line. Public subsidies for the unemployed and poor might instead be
paid directly to local HIPCs which would enroll them in the cheapest health
plan offering the standard benefits package. Care of the poor and middle
income groups would thus be integrated.
Control costs by imposing some form of a 'global budget' on the healthcare
sector. Mr Paul Starr, a health analyst at Princeton University and senior
adviser to the Clinton team, has proposed what he calls 'benchmark
budgeting'. In effect the federal government would stipulate a maximum
allowable rate of increase in the premium charged for the standard benefits
package. In addition, a more flexible target would be set for discretionary
spending by individuals and companies who wanted to purchase more generous
health plans. The cap and target, argues Mr Starr, could be set by the
president and Congress on advice from his economic advisers and the National
Health Board.
The advantage of a cap on premium growth is that it avoids the bureaucracy
of direct controls on the price and volume of medical services (an option
which many prominent Democrats including Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New
York state, are still urging). At the same time, however, the networks of
competing doctors and hospitals would find themselves subject to an overall
spending limit. Like the medical profession in all other developed
countries, they would have to ration the supply of expensive new forms of
treatment, but the trade-offs would be determined locally rather than in
Washington.
The Clinton plan is theoretically attractive. But turning abstract ideas
into practical proposals will be an immense task. Perhaps the biggest
challenge lies in creating new institutions. How quickly, for example, could
a national network of HIPCs be established? And what exactly would be the
status and powers of these bodies? Should they be public corporations or
non-profit private sector bodies subject to political oversight?
Then there is knotty issue of paying for the reforms. Bringing healthcare
coverage to the uninsured, providing subsidies for small business and
improving the package of benefits offered could cost an extra Dollars 90bn a
year (1.5 per cent of national output), perhaps more. The reforms will only
gradually reduce the rate of growth of spending.
Mr Clinton is expected to raise 'sin' taxes on tobacco, alcohol and guns but
this would cover only a portion of the required revenue. He may also propose
new taxes on hospitals and doctors. The big question, however, is whether he
has the courage sharply to restrict the tax-deductibility of employer-paid
healthcare, a middle-class perk which costs the Treasury about Dollars 90bn
a year. Tough restrictions would increase the relative attractions of
economical health plans, such as HMOs, which are disliked by many Americans
because they impose restrictions on choice of physicians.
The transition to a new system also threatens severely to disrupt one of the
few sectors that has steadily created jobs in recent years. Mr Uwe
Reinhardt, a health care analyst at Princeton University, reckons that
managed competition could throw many specialists out of work (on average
HMOs require only 125 physicians per 100,000 enrollees, less than half the
number in traditional fee for service medicine.) The restructuring is also
likely to provoke a wave of mergers and job cuts in the health insurance
industry, sparking comparisons with the 'downsizing of defence'.
Healthcare reform makes Mr Clinton's budget-cutting economic plan look like
a gentle warm-up exercise. It will affect the future of every family and
business in the nation. Yet in spite of the formidable problems, there is a
good chance that Mr Clinton will succeed.
The contradictions and inefficiencies of the present system are widely
regarded as intolerable: a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that
three quarters of voters believe a 'complete overhaul' of the system is
needed. Mr Clinton has the intellect and communication skills to convince
the nation that change is now less threatening than the status quo.

FT  05 APR 93 / Next stage for the franc fort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc has been granted a stay of execution by the currency
markets following the formation of a pro-EC government after the
parliamentary elections. But it will only receive a full reprieve when it
becomes clear that a politically acceptable method has been found of
maintaining the franc fort into the future. Essentially this means that
German interest rates must continue to fall, not too slowly, and with them
the risk premium attaching to French rates.
The new prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur has lost no time in underpinning
the policy and the relationship with Germany on which it rests. He has
arranged the earliest practical meeting with the German chancellor Mr Helmut
Kohl and he may depart from protocol to meet the Bundesbank president Mr
Helmut Schlesinger.
Some insight into the portfolio of ideas available to him can be obtained
from a report, A French Perspective on Emu, published by the Commissariat
General du Plan, just published in English. Since the demise of old-style
French planning the Commissariat has continued as a semi-official
think-tank, licensed to go beyond the government line of the day.
Last autumn's crisis, says the report, 'demonstrated the volume and
irresistible weight of capital movements that an expected currency
depreciation could generate'. These events risked making monetary union, the
arrival of which had been previously taken for granted, 'seem a very remote
and not very credible goal'. With that prop taken away, it becomes
questionable, say the authors, how far the strategy of maintaining the
exchange rate mechanism for four to six years before the full transition to
European Monetary Union can be maintained.
The authors therefore fly the kite of a 'monetary Schengen' - named after a
group of hard-core EC countries which agreed to dismantle their frontier
formalities before other members were ready. The authors are careful to say
that this would not affect the formal undertakings of the Maastricht treaty.
Four concrete steps are proposed for the countries on the fast track:
Formal commitment to ERM central rates and a possible reduction of
fluctuation margins from 2 1/4 to 1 per cent;
All central banks to hold reserves denominated in the currencies of partner
countries;
Strengthening of mutual support mechanisms for intramarginal intervention;
Central bank independence.
Mr Balladur has made a good start by announcing in his first week his
intention to make the Banque de France independent by the summer. This is a
move which the Bundesbank can only applaud. The suggestion about reserves is
mainly cosmetic and should not be allowed to become a focus of controversy.
The Bundesbank cannot be expected to cheer from the rooftops the idea of
more extensive intervention to support partner currencies. But the
Commissariat legitimately points out that the Bundesbank has given just such
support to the franc in the crises of the past few months, even when it did
not suit immediate German interests. Indeed there could be a time when the
D-Mark will require support itself.
The biggest Bundesbank opposition will be to any early narrowing of margins.
It is possible to sympathise both with the Bundesbank's secret preference
for wider margins and the French preference for narrower ones. For the
present margins are too narrow for a managed exchange rate system and too
wide to inspire confidence in permanently fixed rates.
The heart of the matter, however, is the Commissariat's suggestion that
Germany should 'agree to internationalise the formulation of its monetary
policy' in advance of 1997. This is not outrageous so long as it does not
conflict with price stability. Central bank independence implies freedom to
implement monetary policy, not to chose the geographical area over which
that policy applies.
The practical weight of Bundesbank objections will be much less once it is
clear that further big reductions of German short-term interest rates will
not stoke up inflation in Germany itself. The underlying rate of monetary
expansion is believed to be within the 4 1/2 per cent to 6 1/2 per cent
target corridor, but nearer the upper end. This, in practice, leaves a good
deal of discretion about how far and how fast to reduce interest rates.
Facts such as the unexpectedly severe recession, modest pay settlements and
the belated but welcome resistance of some German employers to unrealistic
wage parity commitments in the east, are all signs that the battle against
inflation is being won and that no loss of credibility need be involved if
German monetary policy were to take a slightly more international and
long-term approach.

FT  05 APR 93 / Worse off at the end of the day / A look at the effect on
companies and shareholders of Budget changes to ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might imagine that a Budget which reduced the tax burden on UK companies
would be good news for shareholders. However, the largest blocks of shares
are owned by tax-exempt pension funds which have suffered a significant blow
from the changes in advance corporation tax.
In time, this will adversely affect those companies which have set up
pension funds for their employees; for these companies usually promise to
make up any shortfall between contributions and the cost of providing
pensions promised by the scheme. The extra pensions burden will offset the
corporate gain from the easing of the costs imposed by ACT.
ACT is a percentage of a company's dividends which is levied as a
down-payment on its ultimate 'mainstream' corporation tax. Tax-exempt
shareholders, along with pension funds, can reclaim the ACT the company has
paid on their dividends.
The Budget reduced the rate of ACT from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and
trimmed the amount tax-exempt shareholders can reclaim by the same amount.
The effect is to cut the value of the total payments received by 6 1/4 per
cent. Although there are offsetting benefits for companies, the government's
tax take from companies and their shareholders will rise by Pounds 1bn a
year.
How will these forces affect pension funds? Much depends on exactly how UK
companies react to the ACT changes. In the past, companies have raised
dividends, to protect shareholders from the impact of the tax changes.
Between 1986 and 1988, ACT was reduced to 25 per cent from 30 per cent in
line with a general reduction in tax rates.
But that reduction, says Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting
actuaries R Watson and Co, was phased in gradually, falling to 29 per cent
in 1986, 27 per cent in 1987 and 25 per cent in 1988. More important, UK
companies were doing so well that they could afford double-digit increases
in their rate of dividend rises.
This time, although at least two companies - Rentokil and Unilever - have
increased dividends with the specific aim of compensating investors for the
tax changes, others are unlikely to follow suit.
They cannot afford it. Dividend cover - the ratio of current earnings to
dividend expense - is now low by historical standards. Companies usually
feel they need earnings of at least two and a half times dividend expense to
be able to increase payouts. On average, earnings cover on the FT-Actuaries
All-Share Index is only 1.7 times dividend expense.
Far from rising, payouts are under pressure. Dividends of the 800 or so
companies making up the All-Share shrank  1/2 per cent in 1992 and have
shrunk a further 1 percentage point in the first two months of this year. Mr
Wilson estimates that it will take companies two years to make up the income
lost to pension schemes.
The drop in dividend income is of crucial importance to pension schemes,
which rely on these earnings to pay contributions. Mr Wilson estimates that
a 6 1/4 per cent reduction in pension funds' UK dividend income will reduce
it by about Pounds 500m per year. And because actuaries value assets based
on dividend stream rather than cash flow, the change will cut some Pounds
10bn to Pounds 12bn off the value of UK pension funds.
'Companies will have to put in higher contributions or cut benefits,' says
Mr Wilson.
The first employers required to dig into their pockets will be those in
declining industries with 'mature' schemes - those with many pensioners and
few contributors. Mr Roger Urwin, partner at R Watson, estimates that more
than half of all UK pension funds are in the 'mature' category.
For more fortunate companies, there will still be an impact in time. Many
companies are not currently contributing to their pension funds: the funds
are valuable enough not to need topping up. According to the National
Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, 38 per cent of
all British employers made no contribution to their pension scheme last
year.
The ACT change 'will hasten the day when companies have to begin making
contributions again,' Mr Wilson says.
'The big manufacturing companies, the big engineering firms are likely to be
hard hit,' said Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and
Woodrow. Mr Pomery cites the case of a client with a small scheme surplus
whose trustees had planned to distribute that surplus as an enhancement to
members' benefits. As a result of the tax change, the surplus is gone, Mr
Pomery said.
Mr Duncan Roberts, pension finance manager at T&amp;N, the engineering company,
said the ACT change is likely to knock Pounds 20m off the company's pension
scheme surplus when the next actuarial valuation begins this month. The
company has made no contributions to the scheme for several years and is
unlikely to do so for the moment, but the reduction in surplus will bring
forward the time when they must resume.
Some pension bosses believe they can cope without too much trouble. Mr Paul
Whitney, chief investment officer of CIN Management, the in-house manager of
British Coal's pension scheme, says the tax change will cost his scheme
Pounds 15m to Pounds 18m of income a year on its Pounds 7bn portfolio of UK
shares. While the loss is substantial 'it is not the end of the world', and
investment strategies can be shuffled to help make up the income, he said.
For example, a fund could make up the lost income by switching into
higher-yielding stocks - low-priced stocks with relatively high dividends.
However, T&amp;N's Mr Roberts believes such a strategy would expose a scheme to
increased risks and reduce its scope to benefit from increases in share
prices.
Even if pension funds can cope with the immediate loss of income, they fear
that the new rules signal an increasingly hostile government attitude to the
privileged tax status they have enjoyed.
'I think this is quite a clever move to reduce the tax breaks on pension
schemes,' said Mr Trevor Crowter, partner at KPMG Actuarial Services.
There are three other indications that the Treasury may have had this in
mind.
First, Mr Lamont's Budget also included a freeze at Pounds 75,000 on the
earnings cap, the maximum salary upon which pensions contributions can be
based and still attract tax relief. At the present, this cap affects only
high earners and only those who have changed jobs since June 1989. Over
time, however, rising wages will push an increasingly high proportion of
workers into this category, automatically reducing the tax benefits accorded
to pensions.
Second, the government is reviewing the entire regulatory regime for pension
schemes, through the Goode Committee. It is understood to be examining some
aspects of tax policy.
And third, some government ministers have started to hint that laws for
pension funds have allowed employers to benefit too fully from the tax
treatment they are accorded; and that the long-term savings industry would
benefit if the same rules applied to all methods of pension provision.
So, while the latest changes to pension fund taxation seem modest, the
industry is waiting anxiously to discover whether they are the beginning of
more radical reforms.

<TEXT>
Sir, Having returned from many years overseas, I have been particularly
impressed by the high standard and efficiency of the Royal Mail and
therefore am baffled that privatisation of this service is being considered.
To have guaranteed delivery of first class mail the next day, Saturday
deliveries, two deliveries per day prior to Christmas and to contribute
substantial profits to the Treasury is an achievement of which the employees
and management of the Post Office can be proud. I am convinced that citizens
of other countries would be prepared to pay far more in postal charges for
the privilege of this quality of service.
Those of us who have endured sporadic and indifferent postal services can
only shake our heads in bewilderment that such a heedless course of action
is being contemplated. The old aphorism must ring true in this case: 'If it
isn't broken, don't fix it.'

FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Crediting Pinochet for free market in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN DAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If Observer does not know what General Pinochet has done to deserve a
Latin American Award ('Obverse side', March 8), he obviously has not asked
the right Latin Americans, and certainly not the majority of Chileans.
General Pinochet prevented that beautiful Latin American country from
becoming a Soviet satellite. He is also responsible for introducing the free
market concepts into Chile and, by example, into the rest of Latin America.
Therefore, ironically, more than any other single man, Pinochet is
responsible for the transition of Latin America from the old-style military
coup and counter-coup of the 1960s and 1970s to the open, free market,
democratic continent that it is today.
It is worth pointing out that Pinochet is the only dictator, to my
knowledge, ever voluntarily to step down from office. This was after a
referendum he himself called, in which he received a higher percentage of
the total vote than did John Major's conservatives at the last election (or
Bill Clinton in the last American election]). I do not think that either of
those two would put themselves to an up-down referendum at this point.
Pinochet, with his military trappings, is perhaps easy to ridicule; but
Latin America has much to thank him for.

FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Best for France and Europe if franc floats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr S J POPHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from L van den Muyzenberg (March 30) contains a very large
level of misinformation. Since it is also typical of comments that one hears
from French politicians, I feel it cannot go unanswered.
No serious commentator that I've read suggests that the franc would fall by
20 per cent if free floated; indeed, most say that the likely behaviour
would be a small fall followed by a gradual rise back up to previous levels
as German short term interest rates come down. How is this remotely
inflationary?
The point of John Plender's article, 'Le doomsday machine' (March 26), was
not to argue that the French banks ought to be bailed out of their bad
lending decisions but to illustrate the sort of deflationary forces that
were gathering over the French economy and the problems this would put in
the way of economic recovery, when the present draconian and wholly
inappropriate monetary squeeze is finally relaxed.
France already has low inflation and how maintaining very high levels of
real interest rates leads to investment is beyond me. Many people have said
that long term rates are more important in France than, say, in Britain. But
I would be willing to bet with anyone that long rates would also fall were
the franc to float free.
To link one's currency to that of a sound money economy that normally moves
in sync with one's own economy seems a very sensible idea. Unfortunately,
that description of the German economy, in the wake of German reunification,
is somewhat doubtful at the moment.
European exchange rate co-operation seems a very sensible long-term policy
(some of the arguments for which he eloquently advances in his final
paragraph). However, he must surely have noticed that the ERM has not
recently been providing the sort of stable environment for doing business in
Europe, after which he hankers. It is a pity that this sensible policy is
being put at risk (and brought into disrepute) because the rules of the ERM
are unable to cope satisfactorily with the present situation. Would it not
be better for the franc to float free until economic conditions in Germany
become more normal; better for the French economy, better for the longer
term future of ERM, and better for the European economy.

FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: No wrong doing by Agusta on helicopter contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AMADEO CAPORALETTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by David Gardner and Andrew Hill, 'EC fears link to Italian
scandal' (April 1), spoke of a possible involvement of Agusta in the payment
of kickbacks for the acquisition of a contract for the procurement of
helicopters for the Belgian Ministry of Defence. Agusta declares itself to
be completely unconnected with any financial dealings directly or indirectly
aimed at illegal purposes.
The contract for the procurement of 46 A109CM helicopters for the Belgian
army was awarded to Agusta in December 1988 by the Belgian government after
preliminary assessments and positive evaluation by the appointed
parliamentary commission, and following an international competition held
with the participation of the major helicopter manufacturers. The total
value of the contract amounts to BFr6.6bn (1988 economic conditions).
Assembly and delivery of the helicopters is carried out by SABCA in Belgium
according to the contractual commitments set out in the industrial
compensation agreement which was the major factor in deciding the selection
of the Agusta helicopters by the Belgian government.
As of today, 18 helicopters have been delivered with the remainder to be
supplied by the end of 1993.

FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Acts of derring-do - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN TWEEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sponsors are often either ignored by the media or criticised for playing
safe and supporting only the classical repertoire and old masters. It is
therefore quite novel for them to come under attack from journalists for
being too daring.
Several sponsors have drawn flak from their critics in the last few weeks by
supporting the contemporary arts in all disciplines. But it is in the area
of the visual arts that a battle has really been engaged.
The Turner Prize was attacked on Channel 4 with sweeping accusations of a
'modern arts mafia'; and Damien Hirst's decaying carcasses provided a
frisson of controversy at the elegant black-tie dinner to celebrate the
prize at The Tate Gallery.
Journalists queued up on either side to defend or attack the winners of the
Barclays' Young Artist award. The Wilson Twins' photographs of battered
rooms where a murder may have taken place lent a different angle on
corporate hospitality suites.
BP's sponsorship of the third re-hang of The Tate was attacked by Brian
Sewell, a critic not known to pull his punches; he urged BP to suspend its
support of the Tate, presumably to teach Nicholas Serota, the director, a
lesson for daring to wake people up.
So, as sponsors line up with contemporary artists at their most demanding
and the battle rages with the critics, here comes the next brave sponsor -
NatWest.
The NatWest 90s Prize for Art is a deliberate attempt to strike a balance
between the warring factions.
Only those entrants who have mastered basic artistic skills will win.
However, at the official announcement at The Royal Society of Arts on April
29, the next chapter in this exciting drama will be on display. The NatWest
prize and its judges - Anthony Mould (chairman), Chantal Joffe (last year's
winner), Craigie Aitchison and Diana Rigg - are going to show that there is
life beyond the narrow band of London arts schools that scooped many of the
other prizes. Who said sponsors were afraid of controversy?
One part of the media that cannot be accused of attacking sponsors, because
it has a deliberate policy to ignore them, is the BBC.
The charter renewal of the BBC in 1996 has pushed the corporation into
debating its future with its consumers. At a recent seminar on the future of
the BBC as a cultural patron, the most lively debate concerned the failure
of the BBC to credit sponsors adequately. Though the delegates were told by
the corporation that things had improved, no one believed it.
The BBC's case was not helped when everyone realised that the BBC is about
to publish updated guidelines on sponsorship without bothering to discuss
them with the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts - or, for
that matter, with anyone else in the arts or sports field. The guidelines,
which were written five years ago and are happily ignored by everyone in the
sports field but ruthlessly adhered to by the arts programmers, could be
replaced by even more draconian rules.
The BBC has yet to make up its mind whether it wants sponsorship for
programmes. Nobody is pushing them. But surely it could get its act together
in giving the arts a fair deal when it comes to the coverage of sponsored
arts events being broadcast? Watch this sound bite.
The new award for great patrons of the arts from Montblanc, the pen maker,
is welcome news. Not that Montblanc is giving prizes to sponsors  - that is
ABSA's job, through its award schemes throughout the country.
Montblanc's prizes were awarded at a grand ceremony at the Opera-Comique in
Paris last Wednesday to the great and the good of the cultural world.
One of the four categories, the 'private vision award', went to Simon
Rattle, music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; he
shared the award with Lincoln Kirstein, one of the founders of the New York
City Ballet. Each winner received Dollars 25,000 for the arts organisation
of his choice; and a Montblanc 'Octavian' pen.
Simon Rattle announced that his cheque would go to save an educational
project with his orchestra that would have otherwise been lost due to cuts
in public funds. Richard Eyre, the National Theatre's director, represented
the UK on the judging panel and called on private sponsors to shame
governments by their generosity - an interesting angle that the BBC might
like to ponder.
Classic FM has confounded its critics by revealing that it has around 4.3m
listeners. It is no surprise then to find it attracting business
sponsorship. The latest to sign up is British Gas, which is to sponsor a new
programme Classical Gas for 26 weeks in a package worth approximately Pounds
200,000.
British Telecom tops the chart of British sponsors and is therefore a most
appropriate backer for ABSA's national conference at the Barbican this June,
as well as other parts of the ABSA operation.
Evaluation will be the key topic of the conference, which will bring
together ABSA's business members and the members of its development forum
for arts managers. The debate should be lively as sponsors need more than
ever to measure the benefits they are looking for if they are to justify
their corporate budgets.

FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the English National Opera on Saturday, Chaikovsky's Pushkin opera was
revived by their departing director of productions, David Pountney, in his
own decade-old staging, and conducted by their soon-to-be music director,
Sian Edwards. Overall it was deadly: stiff, unmoving, interminable. A lot of
prommers must be ENO regulars too; on the strength of the marvellous Queen
of Spades prom from Glyndebourne last summer, many of them may have booked
to see it fully staged at the Coliseum - and some of them were probably
among the many customers who left without apologies after Act 2.
The performances cannot but improve as the run continues. Some of the
components are excellent, though on this first night they added up to
nothing much. Miss Edwards drew strong, cultivated Chaikovsky playing from
the band. It struck me for the first time that the funereal interlude in Act
3 must stem from the third-act entr'acte of Parsifal, which Chaikovsky knew
but professed to despise.
In principle, for the obsessional anti-hero of Pushkin's novella the
high-strung brightness of Graeme Matheson-Bruce's tenor was entirely apt.
Peter Sidom, as the urbane Tomsky, was a model of clarity and
man-of-the-world slyness; Anthony Michaels-Moore rose splendidly and with
sonorous dignity to the central aria of Prince Yeletsky. Unfortunately
Matheson-Bruce often sang slightly, distressingly flat, and his supposed
inamorata Lisa (Janice Cairns, unbecomingly costumed) was both harsh and
flat. As the old countess, Patricia Payne was very nearly a pantomime dame:
not her fault.
Nearly everybody's words were laudably clear, which let us hear all too well
just how leaden and banal the English translation is. In an opera so full of
arias in slowish, gently confessional mode, a stilted text makes a heavy
burden. In any case, extracting plausible dramatic performances from the
principals seems to have had low priority in this production.
It is one of Pountney's 'white dreams', swathed in as much gauze as his
later, far stronger production of Janacek's Osud. It has its visual moments,
largely in the style of Romantic ballet - some supernumerary dancing witches
suggest childhood memories of a Robert Helpmann show - but the stage forces
are deployed so coldly and formally that only potently affecting lead
singers might break through the ice. Lacking those, the evening remains
grimly frigid.

FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Abbey keeps the world at bay - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1950 the Ordnance Survey published a map of monastic Britain which gave
the names and locations of the 900 monasteries and nunneries of the
pre-Reformation country. It is hard for us to imagine the holocaust of
destruction that followed King Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries
and today it is difficult to conceive of a Britain that in some ways must
have been like Tibet - a land full of monks and nuns, even in its remotest
corners.
It was, I think, Sacheverell Sitwell who said that the great monastic ruins
of England were the equivalent of Cambodia's Angkor Wat or Egypt's Abu
Simbel. They seem as dead and defunct as those places because the ruins are
not even corpses but skeletons, with no traces left of the souls and minds
that once inhabited them. Even the most remarkable of all the monastic
remains in England, Fountains Abbey, demands a feat of imagination to evoke
the nature of the monastic lives that were followed there.
The problem, even in as remote and beautiful a place as Fountains Abbey by
the River Skell in Yorkshire, is that the remains of England's abbeys have
been secularised at least once in their long lives. Fountains' first
secularisation came at the dissolution; its second in the 18th century when
John Aislabie and his son laid turf in the fields around the abbey and
incorporated the ruin as a picturesque fragment in their new landscape
gardens. In this century, the remote and silent abbey ruins and the adjacent
landscape park of Studley Royal have been drawn closer still to the secular
world by waves of visitors and their cars.
In 1983 the National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal
estate, acquiring not just the 18th-century landscaped water gardens, but
also the most complete Cistercian abbey in Europe. The Trust also acquired a
problem of the most sensitive kind. It was not just a matter of how to
restore and care for the estate, it was also a matter of preserving the
extraordinary atmosphere while coping with more than 300,000 annual
visitors.
It is the combination of landscape and architecture that makes Fountains
Abbey special. There are two aspects to this. When the monks of St Mary's
Abbey in York begged their superiors to remove them from the laxity of town
life in 1132, their archbishop selected Skelldale because it was 'a place
remote from all the world, uninhabited, set with thorns . . . fit more for
the dens of wild beasts than the uses of mankind'. To this aspect of
remoteness must be added the approach of the 18th-century landscapists, who
reduced the abbey ruins to picturesque features while elevating the entire
estate into a vision of the sublime imagination.
The National Trust has continued the development of the estate by planning
for the reception of visitors in ways that remove the worst aspects of the
visibility of car parking and allow more rewarding circular walking routes.
But the most important element is the new visitors' centre that has now been
opened after years of delicate treading of the planning tightrope. The saga
is in many ways a story of our times. The amount of local, regional and
national negotiation needed to build a centre that is, itself, dedicated to
the enhancement of the whole estate in retrospect seems almost unbelievable.
But the concerns were the correct ones; many people felt that the greatest
Cistercian abbey in Europe, in its wild valley, should be sacrosanct.
The selection of the architect was a vital part of the process and the
Trust's choice of Edward Cullinan and Partners was brave and inspired. The
choice of site to allow the invisibility of the centre from the abbey was
also important, but this did not mean that the centre should be designed as
a shy and retiring creature lurking secretly in a remote meadow. The
National Trust has taken the appointment of architects very seriously and at
Fountains Abbey the opportunity to add something of quality from the late
20th century was rightly considered to be important.
The result of this act of patronage is a remarkable new building located as
an incident in the entire landscape plan of the estate. The visitor
approaching from the new road now sees new axial views of the pinnacled
spire of William Burgess's High Victorian St. Mary's Church (built by the
pious Marchioness of Ripon in the 1870s). Aislabie's grand avenue, focused
on the distant view of Ripon cathedral, is another new, fine view. After a
sharp turn away from the obelisk of 1815 the road brings the visitor to the
new centre.
The initial view of the centre, which will be very different when the new
trees have grown, is something of a surprise. Cullinan's design is both
vernacular and flamboyant. Dry stone walls root the building to its site,
steeply pitched sandstone roofs and dramatically curved flying, lead roofs
seem to want to carry it to heaven. The architectural language is original,
owing more perhaps to Tolkien than to ecclesiastical towers. As the centre
is built around a courtyard, which opens at an angle on to a dramatically
foreshortened view of the top of the great abbey tower, the echoes of the
cloister are present without being over emphasised.
Inside the centre Cullinan displays his conviction that structure and the
construction process should be expressed. The steel frame can be seen
beneath the timber roofing joists, bolts and dowels are also visible
throughout. The sense of an architect playing with a parts kit is emphasised
by the architect's decision to utilise a colourful, even childlike palette
on elements of the timber ceiling (in the restaurant, the sensation of being
in the hall of a rather progressive new primary school is only just
avoided). But the architectural jollity is refreshing and the centre should
indeed have a sense of both pleasure and education.
I enjoyed the frisson of an architectural experiment, admired the marriage
of materials, and appreciated the air of anticipation provided by the siting
and landscaping of the centre. I know from the time I have spent on the
National Trust's architectural panel how hard it is to achieve the balance
between the undisturbed silence of historic places and the need to provide
for large numbers of visitors. Honeypots mean bees. At Fountains Abbey the
new hive is a highly skilled creation.

FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Bashmet - a great violist / Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over any few years, there is scarcely ever more than one viola player who
can fill international concert halls. These days he is Yuri Bashmet, who
(all but) filled the Barbican Hall on Thursday - and with a programme of
stern sobriety. That was a feat. In fact Schubert's 'Arpeggione' Sonata,
with which he began, is not normally expected to be so sober; but Bashmet
expounded it with all his customary poise and intensity as if there were no
joker anywhere in the pack.
There is room for a contrary opinion: that when Schubert fulfilled his
commission for the arpeggione (a species of bass viol, now extinct) he
traded both upon its comical capacity for jumping between registers - which
Bashmet's viola did with cool grace - and on its natural bent toward popular
jollity, in the second subject of the Allegro moderato and most of the
Finale. In those places there was no trace of a smile from Bashmet. Yet he
expanded beautifully into the little Adagio, which can rarely have struck
such depths of feeling.
In place of the advertised Schnittke, we got a one-movement sonata by
Nikolai Roslavets (1881-1944), a Russian avant-gardiste who sank beneath
Stalinist disfavour. Some stretches of pure, late Skryabin, tritone-laden
chords and all; a 'rondo' form, in the same stretched sense that applies to
Skryabin's last piano sonatas, with similar extremes of clattery frenzy and
sudden, hushed intimations. Bar by bar, however, Roslavets's diction shares
only a couple of tropes with Skryabin's; there is more formally controlled
argument, and more than a whiff of practice-constrained-by-theory (he wrote
treatises on advanced chord progressions). At the piano, whose role is at
least as important as the viola's, Mikhail Muntian was fluent and clangorous
as required.
Throughout that first half of the recital the audience was respectfully
attentive, but not (I thought) much moved. In the circumstances the second
half, allotted wholly to Shostakovich's last work, his op. 147 Viola Sonata,
made a dour prospect: long, relentless, mostly slow, alternately
grief-stricken and numb, with brief bursts of livid fury. The writing is
cruelly spare, often reduced to sullen strings of single notes. Very few
works of any composer are at once so expressively, nakedly personal and so
disconsolate.
In this bleak territory, Bashmet is unequalled - and the veteran Muntian
partnered Fyodor Druzkinin, Bashmet's teacher, in the first (posthumous)
performance of the sonata in 1975. Their basilisk concentration compelled us
to listen, forbade critical detachment: the lean lines, subtly plain and
earth-coloured, spoke volumes. Since we live in fluey-cold times, several
people in the Barbican audience were at the point of choking on coughs and
sneezes during the Aria and Scherzo, but the entire hall held its breath for
the agonised final Adagio. It was a discomforting experience - scathing,
even; but indelible.

FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Ahmad Jamal - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miles Davis said of pianist Ahmad Jamal that he was 'knocked out by his
concept of space, his lightness of touch, his understatement, and the way he
phrased notes and chords and passages'. This was in 1953 and the beginning
of an association that saw the late trumpet player incorporating much of the
pianist's repertoire into his own.
Like the tenorist Sonny Rollins, who came to Davis's attention at the same
time, Jamal has always sprinkled his own compositions over a repertoire of
folksy standards - they share 'Surrey With A Fringe On Top' as a favourite.
Unlike Rollins, however, Jamal has traditionally dissected his preferred
tunes with a lighter touch and usually in a trio setting.
Forty years on, the trio remains his chosen format but the sound has become
richer, denser and if Jamal's concept and use of space, which so impressed
and influenced Miles Davis remains, the vortex of sound which he created on
Thursday in the octagon of the Union Chapel in Islington, London, puts his
spatial awareness to another, more vigorous use.
Accompanied by the churning drums of Yuron Israel and the discreetly busy
bass of John Heard, Jamal was in a vociferous mood. Taking material from the
new disc, Live in Paris '92 (Birdology 849 408), a mixture of originals and
traditionals, versions of Caravan and his own Acorn were almost torrential.
Waving over his shoulder to Israel and baring his teeth approvingly at
Heard, the pianist's right hand trilled transparently while the left surged
thickly. Where on record the Jamal pulse is magnified by tough electric
bass, it was Israel's near funky drumming that projected the trio's sound
into the vaulted arches of the Union Chapel.
Quotes came thick and fast, from Bizet's Carmen to bebop's Monk, the bars
measured by satisfied affirmations and cries from Jamal. Rising from the
piano stool to put extra weight behind crashing block chords or leaning into
Heard's pre-occupied rhythm, the pianist cascaded through a short set until
the flow was interrupted by an untimely intermission.

One of my most memorable jobs as a young reporter on The Times was to spend
a night in Rowton House, a hostel for homeless men. It was deeply
unpleasant. One of the largest of these hostels left in London today is
Arlington House which is near my home. Passing by frequently, and seeing the
sad inhabitants coming and going, I shall watch What Do You Expect -
Paradise? with particular interest. Part of Channel 4's 'Gimme Shelter'
season, this 60-minute programme (9.00) was made by Rex Bloomstein who has
an impressive record with fly-on-the-wall documentaries. BBC1 screens a
revised version of Rock Bottom (8.00), a programme originally shown as part
of BBC2's 'TV Hell' evening last year, in which John Peel selects his top 10
weird and worst novelty records. Horizon visits the Gobi Desert with
American scientists who are looking for fossil evidence that dinosaurs
evolved into birds (8.00 BBC2). ITV shows the last episode of September
Song, a sentimental drama about two middle-aged men, of a quality that has
helped banish some fears about programme standards in the new ITV.

FT  05 APR 93 / People: Imbert joins ranks of Securicor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Securicor has recruited its first ex-policeman on to the board in a
non-executive capacity. Sir Peter Imbert, who retired at the beginning of
February after five years as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, comes
in as part of a drive to widen the pool of expertise available from the
company's non-executive contingent. Until now, many have been Securicor
career men.
Roger Wicks, Securicor's chief executive, says that Sir Peter will be useful
in helping develop the overseas operations. Slightly more than half the
group's employees work abroad, concentrated in continental Europe and the
Pacific Rim. Within the past two years, the company has started up in St
Petersburg and has branches in Hungary. 'Naturally, we already know the
police forces in the UK very well, but Sir Peter's top-level relations with
forces around the world will be very helpful to us,' says Wicks.
Imbert, who turns 60 at the end of the month, joined the Met in 1953,
serving for many years in the Special Branch. During his time as
Commissioner he is credited with helping to repair the Met's tarnished
image, and successfully concentrating on police service to the community.
While Securicor numbers many ex-policemen in its ranks, and ex-deputy
commissioner Sir Colin Woods has been a director and consultant to parts of
the firm though not on the main board, no Met commissioners have been
involved to date.
Two non-executive directors, Eric Hollis and John Delaney, retired last
year; both were ex-Securicor executives. Sir Neil Macfarlane, MP for Sutton
and Cheam until the last election, has already joined the board, partly to
help smooth the way when the firm has dealings with government. Wicks says
he plans to add another non-executive in the course of this year, bringing
the total to seven out of the 12-man board.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Jack Wigglesworth come to rest for a while? Ever since the longstanding
and well known Greenwells partner left in 1986, he has had quite a variety
of jobs, none of which has lasted very long. Now, having worked as a
consultant to J P Morgan Futures for a year, he is joining Citifutures,
full-time, in the new position of director of marketing.
He says that with two children still in full-time education he 'fancied' a
permanent position. The JP Morgan post, as business development director,
was 'ongoing but without the feel of a permanent job'.
He left Greenwells after 15 years, 13 as a partner, for Lloyds Merchant
Bank. There he was head of government bond sales but the primary gilts
dealership was closed down nine months later. He also had a two-year stint
at Henderson Administration.
Wigglesworth, joint deputy chairman of Liffe, says that Citifutures has
always had a policy of forging closer links with the derivatives exchanges,
so that his familiarity with Liffe was regarded as an asset.

FT  05 APR 93 / People: Legal &amp; General splits its core business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Hatry, 44, has been appointed managing director of sales and marketing
of Legal &amp; General's life and pensions business following the group's
decision to split its core business in two.
David Prosser, 49, who took over as L&amp;G's chief executive 18 months ago,
says he wants to emphasise the clear division between the group's sales
operation and its 'manufacturing' process.
Two separate management structures take effect from July 1. Robin Phipps,
42, currently customer services director, has been appointed managing
director of services.
Although L&amp;G is stressing the logic of the move, some analysts speculated
that the reorganisation was more of an attempt to fill a gap which has
existed at the top of L&amp;G since John Elbourne, 48, managing director of
L&amp;G's life and pensions business, resigned in June 1991.
Elbourne had been with L&amp;G for 30 years and was responsible for the big
expansion of L&amp;G's life and pensions business. However, after losing out to
David Prosser for the top job at L&amp;G, he joined the TSB where he is now
chief operating officer of retail banking and insurance.
His departure, which coincided with the retirement of group chief executive
Joe Palmer, has left the L&amp;G board short of traditional life insurance
industry expertise. Of the three remaining executive directors, two are
investment managers and one is an accountant.
John Craddock, 59, who took over Elbourne's responsibilities for life and
pensions, was not given a seat on the board and retires this year. There has
been speculation that he might be replaced by an outsider, or an overseas
executive like Trevor Matthews, who heads L&amp;G's successful Australian life
insurance business.
In the event, the decision to split the job suggests that L&amp;G has still not
made up its mind who will fill the place on the board vacated by Elbourne.
The promotion of Hatry (right), who has a doctorate in mathematical physics,
and Phipps (left), who has also been with the firm for 20 years, gives a
clue as to who might eventually plug the gap.

FT  05 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Staffordshire bypass development
plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Four contracts, worth a total of Pounds 32.5m, have recently been awarded to
ALFRED McALPINE CIVIL ENGINEERING.
The largest of the three, worth Pounds 26m, is the A5 bypass at Tamworth in
Staffordshire for the Department of Transport.
The 8km long dual carriageway bypass will diverge from the existing A5 at
Bangley, taking a route to the north and rejoining the original A5 again at
the junction with the M42. The work also includes 2km of single carriageway
at Kettlebrook to replace part of the A51.
The project involves a total of 20 structures including a 180 metre long
viaduct over the A4091 and the River Thame.
The bypass is believed to be the first trunk road to be constructed using
porous asphalt surfacing which reduces noise pollution and spray.
The second contract, worth Pounds 11.8m, also for the DTp, is for the
widening of the M56 at Wythenshawe, Manchester.
The work involves the conversion of 3km of motorway from dual three lane to
dual four lane standard and also includes the demolition and replacement of
several bridges and construction of 3.5km of mass concrete retaining wall of
up to six metres high. Completion is set for July 1994.
The two remaining contracts concern coastal protection for Colwyn Borough
Council at Rhos-on-Sea, Clwyd, worth Pounds 3m, and the renewal of training
walls on the River Crane at Hounslow for the National Rivers Authority,
worth Pounds 1.7m.

Construction, has been awarded three prison projects in Texas worth
USDollars 67m (Pounds 45m).
For the Texas Department of Correctional Justice, Charter Builders is to
build two virtually identical Alberti units at Abilene and Huntsville,
Texas.
Valued at Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.5m) each, the units will comprise 15
buildings, including gatehouses and guard posts, extending to approximately
320,000 sq ft. They will house 2,000 inmates in a medium security
environment, mostly living in dormitory accommodation.
Each housing unit has an adjacent outdoor exercise and recreation yard.
Fifty isolation cells will also be provided. Construction will primarily be
pre-engineered, prefabricated metal buildings.
Charter's primary challenge on the projects is the requirement to complete
all the buildings within a 240-day period.
The third contract, worth Dollars 16m (Pounds 10.7m), is to build Dallas
County Juvenile Justice Center, comprising court rooms, detention areas,
attorney and social workers' offices and outdoor recreation facilities.
Extending to about 220,000 sq ft, construction will be structural steel
frame with composite floors, precast planks and concrete masonry
load-bearing walls.
Completion of the project is due in November 1994.

FT  05 APR 93 / Management: A very uneasy alliance - The client/consultant
relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHANNA FULLERTON and MICHAEL WEST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why are companies which hire consultants so often disappointed with the
results? And why do consultants often feel disappointed with the practical
outcomes of their work?
A report* of a recent study of consultants and their business clients
reveals the problem is caused by the different views each side has about the
relationship. Consultants view 'relationship building' and achieving
'trusting, warm, equal, experimental and open relationships' as the most
important part of client-consultant relationships. However, clients
emphasise that consultants must be aware of the practicalities facing them
and want value for money. When asked what happens in practice, clients say
that consultants are often not expert in managing change.
The study was carried out by researchers at the University of Sheffield who
conducted interviews with 22 organisational change management consultants
from a leading British commercial service organisation and with 16 of their
clients.
The report showed that consultants emphasised the importance of rapport, and
of 'working together'. The consultants stressed working at the client's
pace, rather than demanding too much change.
Clients' overriding concerns were that consultants should use time
effectively, remain objective (which consultants acknowledged they had
difficulty doing) and give value for money.
The results revealed that both sides felt the consultant should listen to
the client's views and agreed the client should 'own' the problem and take
responsibility for solving it. Both agreed there should be clear objectives
and that mutual honesty was important.
Consultants criticised clients for using unnecessarily technical language to
describe their organisational problems.
Clients, on the other hand, said consultants used too much 'consultancy
speak' which hampered their ability to work effectively together.
The report also describes what happens in practice during client/consultant
relationships. Clients reported that in less than one in three cases did
they feel confidence in the consultant's expertise to manage change. In the
majority of cases they felt consultants were not aware of the organisational
practicalities facing them.
The report advises consultants and clients to place more emphasis on
clarifying what they want to achieve and the type of working relationship
they will have. Clear aims and objectives for the consultancy project should
be established at the outset. There should always be a clear contract and,
given the pressure on consultants to win contracts, clients should check
relevant experience of the consultant.
Both sides should be clear about whether the consultant is expected to
provide expert advice or to adopt a counselling role.
Consultants must understand the practicalities facing the client within the
organisation and not simply adopt 'off-the-shelf' solutions. Clients want
tailor-made solutions from the consultants which reflect the challenges they
face, not formulas applied as universal panaceas. Consultants should also
avoid using jargon and 'consultancy speak' which can alienate clients.
Clients should be more accessible to consultants and less passive in the
process by working with them to find answers. The process of consultancy the
research suggests, involves clients and consultants working together in an
active collaborative relationship to find solutions to organisational
challenges.

FT  05 APR 93 / Management: Creating cracks in the layers - Ciba is paying
more than just lip-service to the term empowerment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alex Krauer knows the gap between rhetoric and reality is nowhere greater
than in the domain of organisational management.
While chairmen pronounce their latest vision for their company, more often
than not in the bowels of the organisation their instructions are
interpreted, subverted or merely ignored.
Krauer should know. Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and drugs group where he is
chairman, is a perfect example. For two years, senior managers at the
company, which last week reported post-tax profits up 19 per cent, have been
struggling to implement a cultural revolution. Its aim is to make the
organisation more flexible and responsive by giving its shop-floor employees
more responsibility. The scheme, called Vision 2000, is, in current
management jargon, all about empowerment.
'Everything depends on implementation,' says Krauer. 'This mustn't just be a
declaration of intent. We must actively involve every employee in the
process. The danger is that we create a level of expectation and then
nothing happens.'
The implementation of Ciba's vision has not run smoothly. Heini Lippuner,
chief operating officer, admits: 'We do not have a uniform adoption of the
leadership style we would like. There's a difference between the various
divisions. Some are far advanced. In some others, I'm sorry to say, there is
not much difference at lower levels.'
The causes for the different degrees of implementation are multiple, says
Lippuner. Partly it depends on the attitudes of the individuals at the top
of Ciba's 14 divisions. Partly it is the cultural differences between
countries.
Italy is touted as one of the examples where empowerment has worked. Sergio
Giuliani, corporate head of Ciba Italy, says the Italian management during
the early 1980s was authoritarian, hierarchical and bureaucratic. 'By
definition a successful company becomes complacent and conservative,' he
says. Since then, layers of management have been ripped out and a start made
in devolving decision-making down the organisation.
But in Basle, at Ciba's headquarters, a risk-averse bureaucratic culture
still exists, says Lippuner. There is a passion in Basle for avoiding
mistakes, he says. That makes empowerment difficult, because personal
initiative brings the possibility of making errors. 'The Swiss character
cherishes its traditional ways,' says Lippuner.
In an effort to escape the deadening hand of Basle, the company has moved
the headquarters of three of its divisions out of Basle. A fourth, the
eyecare division, Ciba-Vision, is relocating to Georgia later this year.
At Ciba's pigment division headquarters in Paisley, Scotland, Jean-Luc
Schwitzguebal, managing director, says moving divisional headquarters out of
Basle is vital. 'Our performance is now our responsibility. We can't blame
anyone else. We can't bitch that we are doing everything right, but Basle is
screwing it up.'
Krauer identifies a further key component for successful implementation.
'The critical area is middle management. If it stops there, then the whole
exercise is wasted. Some fully support the changes, while others are afraid.
Others refuse to delegate because they believe that by doing so they lose
power,' says Krauer.
Lippuner explains: 'I meet young people on the shop-floor who tell me they
like the vision, they believe we are sincere about empowerment. But they
complain there has been no real change. To put it pointedly, it looks as
though we have a layer of clay that prevents anything going either way - up
or down. That layer is middle management.'
The resistance to change is sometimes unconscious, says Giuliani. 'There is
often an unspoken contract between the boss and employee. They play a game,'
he says.
Ciba is putting immense effort into explaining the programme. 'If you don't
understand, you don't believe and if you don't believe you won't take on the
vision,' says Krauer.
Senior management plans to crack the layer of clay by creating pressure from
both above and below and through education. Questionnaires were sent to the
20,000 employees in Switzerland about their superiors' leadership behaviour.
The aim, says Krauer, was to set up a level of expectation from employees
and use that expectation to force middle managers into dialogue.
Krauer believes 90 per cent of managers are capable of adopting the vision.
'A few, and I hope only a few, will not want to co-operate and they had
better look for a job outside Ciba,' says Krauer. 'There's too much at stake
for people in key positions not to be part of the process.'
Lippuner says he does not want to paint too black a picture. There have been
changes in small units away from Basle where leaders have been particularly
dynamic and deployed private initiative.
Jim McDonald says he is at the bottom of Ciba. A team leader at Paisley  - a
plant cited by Lippuner as a success - McDonald says the vision has filtered
its way down.
'We are now treated reasonably and responsibly,' says McDonald. Clocking in
and out has been abandoned. At the start of the day workers no longer wait
to be handed work slips because they know what to do. By being given
responsibility, most of the workforce - and he admits there are still some
from the old school - are far more highly motivated.
Colin MacKay, the boss of his plant, is delighted. He explains how
maintenance problems have been resolved by giving workers responsibility.
'Previously, production people waited until something broke and the shit hit
the fan. They then blamed the maintenance people. The maintenance people
blamed the production people for treating the machinery badly,' says MacKay.
Maintenance workers have now been incorporated into the production team,
helping production staff spot when machinery is likely to break down. Rather
than running the plant to destruction it can be shut down for half a day for
preventative maintenance, saving three or four days' down-time. 'It sounds
obvious, but it took time to change the habits of a lifetime,' explains
MacKay.
Attitude surveys at Paisley suggest that nearly 70 per cent of employees are
proud to work for Ciba. 'That includes people who spend most of their day
shovelling chemicals. They're surprisingly good figures,' says Schwitzguebal
who claims Paisley was the only classical pigment producer making money in
western Europe last year.
McDonald agrees that management is now far more effective, allowing the
possibility of avoiding problems before they happen. But in spite of
Paisley's model status, he argues there are still difficulties. Team leaders
wanted to meet to discuss similar issues, but the middle management
initially blocked their meetings. 'We should meet one another - we have
plenty to talk about,' he says. In the end, permission was given.
Elsewhere, employees are also enthusiastic about the changes. At Ciba's
epoxy-resin plant in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, Lionel Webb, customer service
centre manager, describes proudly how his department was restructured after
employees were polled about the business's problems.
The survey revealed the business's top problem was the telephone system
which was technically good, but poorly used, says Webb. Technical, sales and
order advice was handled by different people on separate lines. Both
customers and employees became frustrated as more than 25 per cent of
incoming calls - between 50 and 60 a day - went unanswered as calls were
bounced from department to department.
Staff decided to set up a customer service centre with a direct line. They
were given more responsibility and retrained to handle all aspects of
inquiries in a single call. A graph at the site's main entrance shows that
now only a couple of calls are unanswered a day.
Ciba managers admit the success of the Italian and Paisley businesses cannot
be put down just to the vision. For various reasons, the cultural change
started earlier than the programme. Many other divisions still have a long
way to go.
'I have no illusions about inertia - I've worked in this organisation for 35
years. But that does not mean we will capitulate,' says Lippuner.

FT  05 APR 93 / Economics: Further signs of German slowdown expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW indications about the extent of economic decline in Germany may arrive
later this week with the latest unemployment figures for the western part of
the country.
The market expectation is that unemployment will jump by around 45,000, in a
further sign of the slowdown in activity which has alarmed much of Europe,
though awakened hopes that the Bundesbank may be moved soon to make further
cuts in interest rates.
Elsewhere, in a thin week for economic data ahead of the Easter holidays,
attention will focus on the figures due to be announced today in the UK for
new credit business by consumers in February. With the markets looking for
further signs that economic activity in Britain may be turning up slightly,
the central prediction is for credit to have increased by a reasonably
robust Pounds 100m.
However an important caveat is that much of this extra borrowing may
conceivably be due to consumers taking on more credit in order to pay off
old debts, in a reminder that Britain may still have some way to go before
it shrugs off the torpor of recession.
In the US, a smattering of data about home completions, car sales and
consumer credit may provide something of a guide as to the degree to which
the North American economy is on the rebound.
For aficionados of economic data, some interest may be provoked by the
unveiling today of the latest cyclical indicators from the Central
Statistical Office which attempt to shed light on whether the economy may be
picking up.
With the CSO investigating the indicators to see whether they could be
improved to show a better correlation with measured economic activity, fans
of the current generation of indicators will be eager to see how well they
are performing in monitoring a possible upturn.
Highlights of the week are as follows. In brackets are the median market
expectations for the numbers concerned, according to data provided by the
MMS business information company.
Today: Luxembourg, EC foreign ministers discuss co-operation with Russia.
Australia, February retail trade (down 0.5 per cent on month). UK, latest
cyclical indicators, consumer credit in February (up Pounds 100m), M0 growth
in year to March, M0 growth between February and March. US, February home
completions, car and truck sales between March 21 and 31.
Tomorrow: Switzerland, March consumer prices index (up 0.7 per cent on
month, 3.8 per cent on year). US, February wholesale trade. Canada, January
labour income (up 0.3 per cent on month seasonally adjusted).
Wednesday: Germany, March unemployment and employment on a seasonally
adjusted basis and in western part of country only (up 45,000 and down
75,000, on month); March vacancies in western Germany (down 5,000), short
time working in eastern Germany (increase of 18,000), unemployment in
eastern Germany (down 20,000, not allowing for seasonal changes). US,
February consumer credit.
Thursday: Australia, March unemployment rate (11.1 per cent). US, March
producer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month for both the unadulterated
index and for the index minus the effects of food and energy prices),
initial claims for week ending April 3 (360,000), state benefits for week
ending March 27, 1992 capital spending, money supply data for seek ending
March 29. Canada, March unemployment (10.9 per cent) , February vehicle
sales (down 9.4 per cent on month), March housing starts (160,000).
Friday: Many markets closed - Good Friday. US, March consumer prices index
(up 0.3 per cent on month for both the unadulterated index and for the index
minus the effects of food and energy prices), March real earnings.
During week: Germany, February manufacturing orders (down 2 per cent on

FT  05 APR 93 / Lilley hints at 65 pension age for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, the social security secretary, yesterday reinforced
expectations that the government will move to equalise the state pension age
for both men and women at 65.
Quoting the costs of equalising at 60, he emphasised that other countries
were moving to higher pension ages, with Scandinavian countries and the US
on the way to setting the retirement age at 67.
Mr Lilley said during BBC television's Breakfast with Frost that reducing
the state pension age for men to 60 would cost an extra Pounds 4bn, while
raising it to 65 would save about Pounds 4bn.
He pointed out that the number of people in work, relative to the number of
pensioners was declining and was likely to decline further in the next
century.
The raising of the retirement age would be very controversial, although
equalisation would not take effect immediately.
There are already clear signs that the timing of the government's plans has
slipped and that legislation is most unlikely until the 1994-95
parliamentary session.

FT  05 APR 93 / NUM court threat over pit safety row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of the detailed health and safety legislation governing the operation
of British mines, which some private contractors believe is a necessary
condition for privatisation, could be blocked in the courts by the National
Union of Mineworkers.
The NUM has received legal advice which suggests that a judicial review
could successfully challenge any attempt by the government to reform the
relevant 'management of mines' part of the Mines and Quarries Act.
Health and safety in the mines is regulated by detailed provisions in the
act, which NUM officials say makes British mines three times safer than
mines in the US.
The roles of production supervisor and safety inspector are combined in
British mines through the deputy - represented by the union Nacods - ruling
out conflict between productivity and safety.
Reform proposals supported by the government and British Coal have been
presented to the Health and Safety Commission. These would abolish the
existing deputy function, replace statute with codes of practice and give
mine managers much more discretion in applying the rules.
Mr Peter McNestry, general secretary of Nacods, which is fighting the
proposed changes alongside the NUM, said: 'This is where the real battle
over labour relations in the mining industry is going to be.'
According to Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, which is
negotiating to buy pits from British Coal, changing existing regulations is
a condition of making many pits profitable.
He does not believe the proposed changes would lead to a deterioration in
safety standards, but they would improve productivity. 'At the moment a hell
of a lot of people are paid to do nothing,' he said.
The proposed changes are likely to be presented to the government, employer
and trade union representatives on the Health and Safety Executive either
this month or next but the TUC representatives, Mr Alan Tuffin, the former
postal workers leader, and Mr Peter Jacques, a senior TUC official, are
certain to reject them in their present form.
The HSE has never over-ruled its union representatives on a matter of
substance. But the NUM believes that if the government decided to press
ahead with the changes in spite of a divided HSE, it could still be saved by
a clause in the Health and Safety at Work Act which requires any change to
health and safety laws to either maintain or improve safety standards.
One NUM official said: 'We might lose the battle over changing working
practices but our legal advice tells us that we can hold on to the safety
legislation.' That was rejected by Mr Budge, who said that the proposed
changes would not be seen by the judges as a deterioration in safety
standards.
British Coal and the unions are already in the middle of a consultation
exercise over working hours, prompted by the Department of Trade and
Industry. The NUM and Nacods will resist changes making 10-hour shifts and
Saturday working routine.
These changes have been accepted in most pits where the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers is dominant and at pit level in most NUM mines.

FT  05 APR 93 / Crash course in survival teaches caution: FT writers asks a
range of businesses whether they believe a recovery may have begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of a modest revival in consumer demand have begun to raise hopes of
recovery. The outlook for unemployment and new credit business remains bleak
but the governor of the Bank of England thinks that 'in all probability' the
recession is over. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist of Nomura Research
Institute in London, says there are 'enough green shoots to make a salad'
but the downturn in Germany and other Continental markets bodes ill for
exports, and consumer confidence at home remains fragile.
THE SUN has brought out the shoppers at Peacock's Stores, but the retailer
says it would be premature to see that as the dawn of recovery.
'The first seven weeks of this year weren't too clever - we weren't
achieving our targets nor year-for-year growth. But the past five or six
weeks have been pretty good,' says Robert Peacock, chairman and joint
managing director of the budget clothing and household textiles stores.
'We are incredibly dependent, as every retailer is, on the weather. I
certainly don't detect any underlying strength in increased spending.'
Mr Peacock, 51 - grandson of the company's founder, who started selling
pinafores and aprons in 1882 - says that gaining an edge on his rivals, not
increased demand, has been the principal reason for increased business. 'Any
gains we are making is that we have sharpened our pencil, reduced our profit
margin slightly and we are looking for more growth from more competitive
prices.'
Peacock's, a chain of 142 shops including the camping and country-wear
stores Millett's, might have expected to gain as shoppers traded down in the
recession. But Mr Peacock says it has not worked out that way. 'I think many
retailers have become more streetwise.
'The major chains and even department stores have traded down to maintain
their customer base. In common with many other retailers we've had to reduce
prices to turn stock faster. There is a lot of stunting on the high street
now - prices being marked up in order to be marked down.'
Peacock's, a private company based on a Cardiff trading estate, has grown by
opening stores. Even during the recession it has continued to do so,
although not at the same rate as during the 1980s. It has plans for two more
this year. The company's turnover increased from Pounds 42.78m in 1991 to
Pounds 54.22m last year but profitability has been cut.
Reflecting on last week's statement by the governor of the Bank of England
that the recession was 'in all probability' over, Mr Peacock says: 'I am
cautiously optimistic for this company by virtue of the measures we have
taken. But for UK Ltd, until confidence returns and until people are not
frightened they are going to lose their jobs, I'm not sure it is all over
yet.'
Some companies in the building sector, one of the hardest hit, are a little
more upbeat. Mr Martin Smout, regional director of Wimpey Construction in
Bristol, says: 'I think everybody in the industry feels we have touched
bottom. There is confidence in the fact that we are at the bottom. The
concern has to be that this is now going to be the norm, and I don't see
these green shoots springing into daffodils in the spring. We see very, very
gradual growth but nothing like a recovery to where we stood in the past.
There is still a lot of overcapacity.'
Last month Wimpey reported a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss in 1992 but Mr Joe
Dwyer, chief executive, says the worst might be over, with house sales up a
third in the first 10 weeks of 1993 compared with 1992.
Mr Smout's region covers the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands and
includes work other than private housing, which comes under Wimpey Homes.
The recession, he says, has been 'desperate - very severe. We as a company
had a large percentage of our turnover coming out of the private sector. In
the late 1980s the tap was turned off.
'The biggest stimulus we need is confidence. Housing has been identified as
the engine for recovery, but we need confidence to act as the fuel. The
private industrial sector is dead because the confidence isn't there.'
This year, he says, there has been an increase in invitations to tender  -
'albeit that bid levels are suicidal'. Most contracts are from the public
sector, with his region's largest current contract being Pounds 21m for a
new hospital in Exeter.
Mr Smout says the recession has forced change: 'The industry was
overheating, you couldn't get labour, you couldn't get materials. We have
all had to pull ourselves up over the last three or four years and improve
the quality of what we do.'
Bluebird Toys, the Swindon-based manufacturer which includes Peter Pan
Playthings, makers of Plasticine, describes itself as 'quietly confident'
for 1993. But Mr David Sandilands, finance director, says: 'We are not
expecting an easy time. Of course you are in a buyer's market and so you
have to have the right products and a hell of a negotiating team.'
Orders are up both in the UK and internationally compared with the same time
last year, although Mr Sandilands says it is a cyclical business: 'It is
difficult to know what is going to happen in this industry until it has
happened.'
Before the recession, nearly all Bluebird's sales were in the UK; now more
than a third are overseas. 'The UK market has been a declining market for
us. Because of the recession there is just less money around, which isn't
helped by the fact that you've got these video games (which Bluebird does
not make) draining an awful lot of cash from disposable income.'
Bluebird has responded by making cheaper toys and it has been encouraged by
this year's trade fair at Earls Court in London. 'Attendances at both of our
stands were definitely up. There was a lot of interest with the obvious
success of Polly Pocket and Mighty Max.'
The Polly Pocket, a range of cheap plastic toys for girls, and Mighty Max,
the boys' equivalent ('His fate is in your hands'), are currently the
company's 'hot toys'.
Last month, Bluebird reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.55m in 1992 after
losses of Pounds 3.55m the previous year when there were exceptional costs
due to restructuring. The recession has spurred a rethink. Factories at
Peterborough and Swindon have closed and production switched to Merthyr
Tydfil in south Wales, and to China.
Mr Sandilands also believes adversity has had its benefits: 'If there is a
good thing to come out of the recession, probably the only good thing, it is
that it teaches companies how to run their business, because they have to
run it properly to survive.'
But even so Mr Sandilands won't be rushing to increase production:
'Retailers would love to latch on to hard evidence that the industry is
coming out of the doldrums. But they are exercising a high degree of
caution. They want to be in with the hot products, but they don't want to
catch a cold by overstocking with products that don't sell.'

FT  05 APR 93 / Women managers 'fare worse outside London'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES outside London are significantly less likely to employ female
managers than those in the capital, a survey of directors and personnel
managers in England has found.
More than a quarter of companies outside London said they employ no women at
all at managerial level, compared with about a tenth in London which had no
female managers.
In only 10 per cent of organisations throughout the country were half of all
managers women. Women remain rare in the boardroom too. More than 70 per
cent of companies in the survey have no female board members.
In manufacturing companies women are less likely to be in managerial
positions. Less than 3 per cent of manufacturing companies have half of
managerial positions occupied by women, compared with nearly 15 per cent in
service-sector companies.
The survey of more than 200 companies, carried out by the Select employment
agency, shows that companies set up since 1979 do not hire or promote more
female managers than longer-established organisations.
The survey also found that far fewer companies are planning redundancies
this year. In the last two years half of the companies surveyed cut staff,
compared with only a tenth who plan to do so this year.
Salaries were found to be falling in line with inflation, with less than a
tenth of companies reporting that they intend to give pay rises above the
rate of inflation this year.

'We're finding industry in this country generally unable to react to

wake up industry, there's a market out there.'
Graham Bishop, Binns department store
'The UK finance market is being swallowed up by overseas players. I've said
to my customers they are foolish in not looking outside the UK market . . .
Their atititude seems to be, we'll let others find out how difficult it is
to do overseas business. It's a sort of arrogant attitude.'
David Haycox, Tenhill computers
'Our order book value today is infinitely better than it was 12 months ago .
. . but I don't sense things (in the economy) are on the up at all. I
honestly believe it's due to us getting off our backsides. If we had to rely
on the UK market we wouldn't survive.'

FT  05 APR 93 / Rallies in Northern Ireland and London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of people demonstrated for peace in Ulster at rallies in Northern
Ireland and in London yesterday. The rallies came only hours after one
Britain's most wanted IRA suspects, Nessan Quinlivan, was arrested in
Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, Charles Batchelor writes.
Peace activist Susan McHugh took part in peace rallies in Belfast and at
London's Hyde Park (above), each attended by about 2,000 people, and called
for an end to terrorist violence. Mrs McHugh was at the centre of a
10,000-strong rally in Dublin last week after two children died in the
Warrington bombing.
Smaller peace rallies took place across Northern Ireland though up to 2,000
nationalists marched through West Belfast to protest against alleged
security force violence.
Meanwhile moves to extradite Mr Quinlivan, who broke out of Brixton Prison
in south London two years ago, are expected to start today.

FT  05 APR 93 / More pressure on employment seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE further fiscal tightening needed to control Britain's growing government
deficit will add to pressures on unemployment over the next five years, a
leading forecasting group warns today.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club says that, without public spending cuts or a
tough programme of tax increases, the fiscal position 'is not sustainable'.
The fiscal measures would be needed on top of the Pounds 16bn worth of extra
taxes announced in the Budget for the next three years.
A combination of tighter fiscal policy, and the high debts of many
businesses and consumers, will restrict average year-on-year growth in UK
output to a sluggish 2.2 per cent over the next five years, the consortium
says.
The Treasury is assuming that growth will be significantly higher at 2.75
per cent a year on average.
On existing government fiscal plans, unemployment is set to rise from 3m to
nearly 3.5m by the end of 1997, according to the club, whose 22 members
include British Aerospace, Nomura, Bass and the Halifax Building Society.
Assuming no further Treasury action to reduce the deficit, the ratio of
government debt to UK output is set to double over the next five years from
30 per cent to 60 per cent. 'In the long run, this is not sustainable,' the
group warns.
During 1993, Item predicts a modest recovery with gross domestic product
expanding by 1.3 per cent on last year. Company profits are likely to be
boosted substantially by to stronger manufacturing output and a pick-up in
exports.
On a gloomier note, the club thinks interest rates may have to rise - from a
projected 5 per cent by the end of this year to 7 per cent by the end of
1994 - to prevent underlying inflation breaching the government's 4 per cent
upper limit.
Unemployment among 18-to-24-year-old Londoners has risen by 132 per cent in
less than three years, a report from the Association of London Authorities
says. There were 50,851 young adults unemployed in April 1990, by January
this year that number had risen to 118,178 and half of that group had been
out of work at least six months.

FT  05 APR 93 / London Tec first to report loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST operating loss has been made by a Training and Enterprise Council
after the government said it was clawing-back more than Pounds 300,000 from
the Tec because of inadequate substantiation of its claims for equipping
young people with jobs and qualifications.
London East Training and Enterprise Council (Letec) made an operating loss
of Pounds 483,267 in the 17 months to March 29 1992 on a turnover of Pounds
27.522m. The operating loss included a general provision of Pounds 200,000
to cover the clawback.
The department of employment originally wanted to claw back Pounds 1.9m but
agreed to negotiate a lower sum after the Tec, whose chief executive
resigned earlier this year, provided documents to substantiate most of the
claims.
Letec, which is expected to make an operating profit this year, is
understood to be the only Tec to make a loss last year although several
others are believed to have had funds clawed back after making similar
inadequately substantiated claims.
The National Audit Office last year questioned the accounts of the
Department of Employment for 1991-92, the third consecutive year, and found
that Pounds 21m of payments to Tecs and the Employment Service had been
incorrectly made.
Tecs are responsible for payments to provider of training for the two main
national training programmes, Youth Training (YT) and Employment Training
(ET).
Among lapses of financial control identified by the government's spending
watchdog was allowing claims that were not adequately substantiated.
Tecs have complained about the complexity of audit trails imposed upon them.
Mr David Dickinson, chairman of Letec, said that his Tec, which had been
obliged to use the government's own computer system in collecting data, had
provided the department with information on the total number of 'outputs'
that training providers had told the Tec they had produced.
However, the department demanded individuals' certificates for
qualifications and proof of jobs found.
Letec said its attempts to do this had been exacerbated by the fact that one
large provider went into liquidation and the receiver declined to give names
of trainees.
Mr Dickinson said that Letec had incurred substantial costs securing
college-based Youth Training places at a time when few employers were
offering training.
The Tec also made a provision of Pounds 200,000 for this financial year to
further cover financial claims it made on the government but for which it
might not be able to provide adequate documentation to back up its claim.

FT  05 APR 93 / Buy-out activity declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out activity fell to a two-year low in the first quarter of
1993, with just seven large deals worth a total of Pounds 390m being
completed, accountants KPMG Peat Marwick said.
One reason for the decline was the cautious approach that managers and
vendors took to deals, said Mr Chris Beresford, head of management buy-outs
at the accountants, said. 'They are taking a belt and braces approach to
negotiations and to legal documentation. The larger deals are taking nine
months or even longer.'
The most recent quarter represents the lowest level of buy-out activity
since the first quarter of 1991, when seven deals worth Pounds 120m were
completed.
However, it compares poorly with the first quarter of last year, when 16
deals worth Pounds 640m were completed.
The largest deal completed in the first 1993 quarter was that of McDonnell
Douglas Information Systems, valued at about Pounds 200m. Other deals
included Colas, a road services and building materials company, from Shell
for Pounds 72m; Ashbourne Homes for Pounds 53m; and British International
Helicopters for Pounds 33m. In roughly equal measure the buy-outs involved
purchases from receivers, corporate restructurings and disposals of non-core
activities.
In total, Peat Marwick calculates that 130 deals worth Pounds 570m were
completed in the first quarter of 1993 compared with a total of 520 worth
Pounds 3bn in the whole of 1992.

FT  05 APR 93 / Report endorses private prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLDS, Britain's first privately managed prison for nearly 200 years,
combines successful features with causes for concern, a Prison Reform Trust
report says today.
The trust says that available evidence about Wolds, opened on Humberside a
year ago to accommodate remand prisoners, 'contradicts both the view of the
apologists for privatisation and the wilder claims of the prison's critics'.
It says the prison, managed under a Home Office contract by Group 4 Remand
Services, offers prisoners up to 14 hours a day out of their cells and
better entitlement to visits than comparable prisons. Staff generally
treated inmates in a 'just, fair and humane way' and were responsive to
reasonable requests.
But, says the report, the level of incidents and disturbances at Wolds was
worse than national averages. Use of drugs by prisoners was a problem in
many prisons, but the trust understood that at Wolds the level of the
problem was 'alarming and getting worse'.
Public accountability was hindered by the fact that financial details of
Group 4's contract with the Home Office were confidential. 'The company is
not required to produce an annual report to the Home Office and, if it was,
presumably this too would have been secret. In any event, proper
value-for-money comparisons cannot be made.'
A second privately managed prison, Blakenhurst, Hereford and Worcester, is
about to open, and later this month ministers will consider public and
private bids to run Strangeways prison in Manchester. Bids to manage the new
Doncaster prison, and possibly others, are likely to be invited later this
year.

FT  05 APR 93 / Mersey dock plan dispute resolved
</HEADLINE>

   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEYSIDE Development Corporation and English Heritage have resolved
differences over Kings Dock, the last 40 acres of Liverpool's prime
waterfront to be developed.
The site, next to the successful Albert Dock redevelopment, overlooks the
river Mersey and the Wirral. Filling it would complete the reconstruction of
Liverpool's south docklands, which was started 12 years ago by the
corporation after the area became derelict.
The corporation and English Heritage have agreed that a plan by Richard
Rogers Partnership, the architects, should provide guidelines for a mixed
commercial and leisure development.
Part of the scheme is an indoor arena to be used for the 2000 Olympic boxing
tournament if Manchester succeeds in its bid to stage the games.
Because of the proximity to Albert Dock and its warehouses - Britain's
largest single collection of listed buildings - English Heritage had
objected to the redevelopment.

FT  05 APR 93 / Bomb forces market into the 21st century / A look at the
Baltic Exchange's future as its HQ reopens today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BALTIC Exchange, the world's largest shipping market, returns today to
its historic City of London headquarters less than a year after the premises
were wrecked by an IRA bomb.
Trading, which has taken place in the nearby Lloyd's insurance market
building, will resume in the Baltic's St Mary's Axe building. Traders will
work in the Queen's Room, an austere underground banqueting hall built in
the 1950s - the 1903 neo-classical trading floor is not yet rebuilt.
The Baltic Exchange accounts for more than half the world's bulk cargo
chartering business - buying and selling space in oil tankers and in
dry-cargo vessels carrying commodities - and an even larger share of ship
sale and purchase contracts.
Rebuilding the trading floor and the rest of the headquarters building will
take another two to three years - hundreds of numbered blocks of marble and
stone are resting in a stonemason's field in Dorset awaiting return to the
exchange.
The shipping brokers who rented offices in the building have found
alternative accommodation. But the Baltic hopes to make up lost rental
revenues by careful investment of its Pounds 27.6m insurance settlement.
For all the effects of the bombing, which demolished the exchange's
marble-clad pillars, glass-domed roof and granite and Portland stone facade,
the real threat to the exchange's traditions remains the spread of
electronic communications and the growing use of dealing terminals.
Heir to the coffee house traditions of the 1740s, when tallow from the
Baltic was an important commodity, the Baltic Exchange has clung to the club
atmosphere of its chandelier-hung exchange building while many other 'open
outcry' markets around the world, including the London Stock Exchange, have
closed their trading floors.
On the Baltic's busiest days, Mondays and Tuesdays, up to 500 members meet
for an hour or so around lunchtime to discuss deals and market trends. Few
transactions are concluded on the exchange but the face-to-face contact and
the conversation give the impetus to deals.
The Baltic's 1,700 individual members, representing 600 companies, earn
Pounds 800m of commission income a year on deals worth tens of billions.
Although trading was only halted for two days after the bomb, the upheaval
prompted a fundamental rethink of the Baltic's role and its future.
Mr Jim Buckley, chief executive, said: 'The market was changing anyway. This
gave us an opportunity to stand back and ask our members what they wanted in
the 21st century.'
The overwhelming response from members was that the exchange should maintain
and, where possible, expand its trading role. Mr David McNally, chairman of
L. Dens, a shipbroker, said that for all its 19th century flavour, a daily
market place did provide important advantages.
Traders say the complexity of the dry cargo market requires face-to-face
discussions, unlike the relatively straightforward tanker market, where
cargoes, vessels and routes are more standardised.
As well as the position and cost of a vessel, the broker will need to take
into account whether it has the right handling equipment for a particular
cargo and whether, for example, it is free from infestation from a previous
shipment.
Even so, members are aware of the threat to the traditional market. The
numbers attending the daily market sessions and the length of the sessions
have declined over the years. Most tanker contracts are now negotiated on
computer screens.
Mr David Giles, managing director of Simpson, Spence &amp; Young Shipbrokers,
said: 'We cannot deceive ourselves that we can go back to leisurely ways of
doing business.'
Mr Buckley believes the future for the exchange lies in upgrading
communications links so that brokers need not feel cut off from head office
while they are on the trading floor. Improved computer links and connections
with international messaging networks have been installed in the Queen's
Room.
Other facilities must also be improved and one plan is for an upmarket
restaurant where brokers can take their wealthy overseas customers.
Beyond technical improvements to the trading room, the Baltic is seeking a
higher profile. It is lobbying for a London shipping register designed to
attract Far Eastern and other shipowners while allowing their overseas
earnings to be taxed in their home country.
London has retained its role as the centre of the shipping world in spite of
the dramatic decline in the size of the British merchant fleet. This is
because, alongside the Baltic Exchange, it has the Lloyds shipping insurance
market and the commercial courts, which play an important role in
international shipping disputes.
So far this combination has proved attractive to the international shipping
community. Greek shipowners, who control the world's largest shipping fleet,
make up one third of the Baltic's membership and made generous contributions
to help rebuild the exchange.
But the physical reconstruction which is going on pales in comparison with
the rebuilding of its influence on which the Baltic is now engaged.

FT  05 APR 93 / Labour to float plan for two-tier boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCEPT of the European-style company, with a two-tier board, is being
canvassed by Labour as part of its drive to bring more 'long-termism' into
British industry.
Labour sees some merits in the German model, in which a firm's governance is
split between a supervisory board responsible for monitoring management and
setting policy, and an executive board dealing with the management of the
policy. Worker directors would be elected to the supervisory board, to which
the executive board would be accountable.
The idea is expected to be floated tomorrow by Mr Stuart Bell, the
opposition's City spokesman, in a speech to the British Accounting
Association. He is expected to argue that one of the benefits of this form
of organisation is that the company is less susceptible to hostile
takeovers.
This accent on long-term planning in industry is reflected in Labour's new
policy paper to be launched tomorrow. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary, will use the discussion paper Making Britain's Future,
as the basis for consultation with commerce and industryover the coming
months.
One of its elements is a proposal to shift the burden of proof when hostile
takeovers are referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission so that the
takeover rather than the defence has to be justified.
The argument for a takeover would have to take in not only the financial
rationale and the benefits to the companies involved, but include the wider
impact of the deal on the economy and whether the takeover was in the
national interest.
The paper envisages that Britain's manufacturing base could be broadened by
ensuring that pension funds could have a greater emphasis on industrial
investment - and perhaps by diverting some building society funds to
industry rather than property.
It also proposes a change in the law to prevent banks forcing the closure of
companies that could be revived.

The move follows British Midland's decision a week ago to introduce new
business class fares on its flights to Paris and Amsterdam, with reduced
rates for three-day and other restricted tickets. KLM and Air France quickly

A CONSERVATIVE think-tank is warning that the government could face 'a
second coal crisis' over its rail privatisation plans unless imbalances
between rail and road transport are addressed, Richard Tomkins writes.
The Bow Group says failure to put the financing of railways and roads on a
similar footing will mean that many lines will be unable to compete with
roads. It says: 'The parallels with the rigged market in electricity and its
impact on demand for coal are striking.'
Railway freight and passenger traffic is being lost to the roads because
road users are not required to pay full costs.

FT  05 APR 93 / Pain fears over new mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE wearing hearing aids or listening to personal stereo players risk
exposure to painful noise levels when the latest generation of portable
telephones is launched this year.
The warning, from the European Hearing Instrument Manufacturers Association,
is backed up by research carried out by Jydsk Telefon which runs one of two
Danish laboratories qualified to test for 'electromagnetic compatibility',
or radio interference.
The studies showed that the sound level generated in a hearing aid at a
distance of 1.5m from a cellular telephone handset was 130 decibels -
equivalent to standing behind the engines of a jet aircraft.
The studies, reported in today's issue of Microwave Engineering Europe,
showed that the telephone could interfere with other electronic apparatus at
distances of up to 90 metres. Television remote controls could be affected,
for example, causing channels to switch unexpectedly.
The new telephone systems transmit digital signals rather than the analogue
radio waves used in current cellular and cordless phones.
The publication said the Nice-based European telecommunications standards
body ETSI has known of the problem for more than two years but has been slow
to create new standards.
Simple modifications to hearing aid circuitry will remove the risk, experts
say, but there is no agreement on who will pay.

FT  05 APR 93 / Revised small-business loan scheme delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS SAY that the revamped small-business loan guarantee scheme, announced
in the Budget last month as one of the measures to speed recovery from the
recession, will not be ready until October this year.
In addition, the scheme's new Pounds 250,000 ceiling will not be universally
available, applying only to existing businesses. Start-ups will be limited
to the scheme's old ceiling of Pounds 100,000.
The scheme enables small businesses to raise bank loans when security is not
available. Under the existing scheme the government guarantees up to 70 per
cent of a loan and the borrower pays a 2.5 percentage point premium on the
interest rate.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced that the level of eligible loan
would rise by Pounds 150,000, with the maximum guaranteed portion rising to
85 per cent.
The premium will be cut to 1.5 per cent for variable-rate loans and 0.5 per
cent for fixed-rate loans.
About 20 lenders, including the large clearing banks, many smaller banks and
small-business advisory and finance bodies, take part in the scheme.
The delay in the start of the new scheme was greeted with surprise and
dismay by corporate finance advisers. Mr Peter Folkman, head of North of
England Ventures, a venture-capital fund backed by Schroders, said banks had
been telling applicants they would have to wait until October.
The Department of Trade and Industry said: 'We are not so pessimistic as to
think it will be October. We think it will be brought in sooner than that,
but we cannot be certain when at this stage. It takes time to make the
arrangements with the banks.'
But Mr Ian Templeton, senior partner of the Manchester office of Stoy
Hayward, the accountancy firm, said that DTI officials in Sheffield had told
him the scheme would start in October.
North of England Ventures had hoped that the scheme would enable Panel
Signs, a Nottingham management buy-out in which it has Pounds 550,000
invested as equity for a 60 per cent stake, to trade its way out of trouble.
Now, it said, the company would almost certainly close this month - with the
loss of 60 jobs - because it could not bridge the gap to the new scheme's
introduction. The company makes illuminated signs for businesses such as
supermarkets and filling stations.
The DTI confirmed yesterday that the existing ceiling would apply to
start-ups, and that the new limit was to help established businesses.

FT  05 APR 93 / Change in courts may save Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT committee has suggested ways to make substantial savings by
reducing the number of cases that are tried in crown courts.
A paper by the criminal justice consultative committee highlights the Home
Office estimate that up to Pounds 100m a year could be saved if magistrates'
courts dealt with all the cases where the sentences finally passed in the
crown court were within magistrates' powers.
The document, drawn up by a group of senior figures from different parts of
the criminal justice system, says that there could be 'significant' savings
in court spending, legal aid, and the police and prison services if
magistrates' courts took more cases.
Suggestions in the discussion paper are aimed at magistrates, prosecutors
and defendants. They include training magistrates on the scope for deciding
cases themselves rather than referring them to the crown court, and
reminding prosecutors that when they recommend where a case should be heard
they should take account of the time and cost implications of the delay from
taking a case to the crown court.
Since many defendants opt for trial in the crown court in the mistaken
belief that a lighter sentence is more likely, there is a proposal for an
information leaflet giving accurate information on sentencing, particularly
the crown courts' use of prison.
The committee also raises the prospect of changing the law to prevent petty
theft being tried in crown courts.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: US farmers reap gains from aid
package - Washington's Dollars 1.62bn for Moscow reflects Clinton's
fascination for micro-programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VANCOUVER, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Dollars 1.62bn US assistance package for Russia is larger than expected
and is carefully crafted to appeal to the US farm and commercial sectors.
It is also, according to officials in Vancouver, 'the maximum the Clinton
administration can do with available funds' that do not require approval by
Congress.
In its detail, it is very much the handiwork of President Clinton, whose
fascination for interventionist micro-programmes is well established.
The predictably largest component, about Dollars 900m, is for subsidised
food sales and grants, an attraction to US farmers and, through its use of
the Food for Progress programme, a way round the block on sales financed
through the Commodity Credit Corporation caused by Russia's Dollars 630m of
arrears.
The US intends disbursing its food aid mostly over the next half-year before
the Russian crop is harvested. The separate Dollars 194m food assistance
programme, also involving Food for Progress, covers direct delivery to those
in need and stocks for Russian commodity auctions.
The US is also making much of the private sector development elements of the
package, worth about Dollars 148m. Of this, in 1993, Dollars 50m has been
earmarked for the Russian-American enterprise fund for small business, a
further Dollars 60m to promote privatisation and Dollars 20m for
agri-business co-operation.
The 'Democracy Corps Initiative,' worth another Dollars 48m, is designed to
assist Russian progress in its transition from authoritarian rule.
Programmes, each worth a few million dollars, encompass education, the law,
administration, the media and other aspects of the market economy.
The Dollars 6m officer resettlement plan, a direct response to an appeal
from the Russian government, is initially a pilot project to provide 450
houses for returning Russian officers over the next 16 months.
The trade and investment segment, to which the US attaches particular
importance because of its potential appeal for US businesses, is dominated
by Dollars 232m of credits and insurance from the Eximbank and the Overseas
Private Insurance Corporation. It comprises the recently finalised Dollars
82m Eximbank loan to finance the sale of Caterpillar pipeline construction
machinery and a Dollars 150m Opic package in support of Conoco's 'polar
lights', a large oil development scheme.
The US will also support full Russian membership of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and seek to extend to Russia the benefits of its
Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), granting duty-free access into the
US of a wide range of products from developing countries. Russia, which like
the former Soviet Union is excluded from GSP, last year shipped to the US
Dollars 46m in goods that would have qualified for GSP treatment, a volume
expected to increase sharply.
The Dollars 38m energy and environment initiative consists of a fistful of
programmes for improved energy efficiency and environmental clean-up. A
further Dollars 215m will be available this year to assist the dismantling
of Russian nuclear, chemical and other weaponry.
Two new high-level committees have also been established. Vice-President Al
Gore and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, will focus on trade and
investment, while Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, and deputy prime
minister Mr Alexander Shokhin are to chair a US-Russian business development
committee.
Laurie Morse adds from Chicago: The Dollars 700m earmarked for new grain
sales will restart farm exports that have been stalled since November 30,
when Russia fell behind on its interest payments.
US grain prices, which rose slightly on Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade
ahead of the Vancouver summit, are expected to rally further today.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers are today expected to agree to widen
negotiations with Russia on setting up an EC-Russian free trade zone during
the coming decade.
The principle of a free trade accord with Russia has been agreed by EC
ambassadors, but there is still some argument over conditions, and about the
financial and technical assistance needed to make a free trade zone
possible.
Some member states, particularly the UK, want a stronger human rights clause
in the agreement.
On the main free trade issue, it is still not clear whether the
'evolutionary clause' sought by the Commission will be replaced by an
agreement to open up EC markets only after Russia reaches a certain level of
reform and development. 'An evolutionary clause should be just that -
filling it up until you've got a free trade zone - not deciding (on free
trade) later,' argues one ambassador from the liberal EC camp.
Equally, the 'safeguard clause' against any surges of competitive Russian
goods may be strengthened, and made conditional on Russia joining the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Commission had drafted a generous clause, to be invoked only 'in the
event of a serious injury, or threat of a serious injury, to domestic (EC)
producers of like or direct competitive products.'
The free trade zone is now likely to be on offer only to Russia, rather than
all former Soviet republics.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Japanese fall into line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINGERING doubts about the extent of Japan's commitment to the multilateral
Russian aid process have been resolved.
According to the White House spokesman, President Clinton spoke on Friday to
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister.
Mr Clinton then told President Yeltsin in their first round of talks that
the US backed Japan's claim to the Kurile islands and that Mr Miyazawa has
assured him of Japan's strong support for the Group of Seven and bilateral
assistance.
This represents no shift in official policies. The US has always supported
Japan's claim to the Kuriles, occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the
last World War, while Japan, its reservations about the efficacy of
large-scale assistance to Russia notwithstanding, has never publicly
threatened not to take part in the multinational effort.
But it has been important for Mr Clinton, both for his own domestic purposes
and in his presentation to Mr Yeltsin, to demonstrate that the leading
industrialised nations are willing to act in concert to help Russian
economic reform.
Thus the US side in Vancouver emphasised that both Britain and Canada had on
Friday announced increased bilateral contributions, with expectations that
the rest of the G7 countries will have fallen into line by the time the
foreign and finance ministers meet in Tokyo on April 14.
Mr Miyazawa's commitment, as conveyed to Mr Clinton, appears designed to
satisfy US criticism about the extent of Japan's willingness to help
bilaterally and, as current chairman of the G7, to ensure the success of the
Tokyo session. The US is not pushing for early permanent Russian membership
of the G7, which would have disconcerted Japan.
Mr Clinton mentioned, without disclosing details, that other countries
outside the G7 would be approached.
His officials have implied that Middle Eastern nations, most obviously Saudi
Arabia, would be asked to help.
The spokesman also announced that Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Robert
Michel, Democratic and Republican leaders in the House of Representatives,
will would go to Moscow this week to assess Russian reform.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Fund to boost small business
proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development, is trying to persuade G7 countries to provide Dollars 500m to
help start small businesses in Russia.
The EBRD is concerned at growing unemployment in Russia, and the small
business sector is undeveloped, following decades of centralised economic
control. To date the EBRD, set up to help develop the private sector in
former Soviet bloc states, has provided only tiny amounts for investment in
small and medium sized enterprises.
Investing in small business carries greater risks than EBRD's national
shareholders want the bank to take. Mr Attali therefore wants a new pool of
money, which could invest in these riskier enterprises.
A second obstacle to investing in the small business sector is the lack of
an effective network for distributing small amounts of capital, because the
Russian banking system is so antiquated. Mr Pierre Pissaloux, EBRD's
director of the cabinet and of corporate planning and the budget, said young
westerners would be sent all over Russia to assess local entrepreneurs
wanting funds. These westerners would train Russians to become venture
capitalists, so that eventually the Russians could disburse funds
themselves.

LINGERING doubts about the extent of Japan's commitment to the multilateral
Russian aid process have been resolved.
According to the White House spokesman, President Clinton spoke on Friday to
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Clinton then told
President Yeltsin in their first round of talks that the US backed Japan's
claim to the Kurile islands and that Mr Miyazawa has assured him of Japan's
strong support for the Group of Seven and bilateral assistance.
This represents no shift in official policies. The US has always supported
Japan's claim to the Kuriles, occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the
last World War, while Japan, its reservations about the efficacy of
large-scale assistance to Russia notwithstanding, has never publicly
threatened not to take part in the multinational effort.
But it has been important for Mr Clinton, both for his own domestic purposes
and in his presentation to Mr Yeltsin, to demonstrate that the leading
industrialised nations are willing to act in concert to help Russian
economic reform.
Thus the US side in Vancouver emphasised that both Britain and Canada had on
Friday announced increased bilateral contributions, with expectations that
the rest of the G7 countries will have fallen into line by the time the
foreign and finance ministers meet in Tokyo on April 14.
Mr Miyazawa's commitment, as conveyed to Mr Clinton, appears designed to
satisfy US criticism about the extent of Japan's willingness to help
bilaterally and, as current chairman of the G7, to ensure the success of the
Tokyo session. The US is not pushing for early permanent Russian membership
of the G7, which would have disconcerted Japan.
Mr Clinton mentioned, without disclosing details, that other countries
outside the G7 would be approached. His officials have implied earlier that
Middle Eastern nations, most obviously Saudi Arabia, would be asked to come
forward.
On the domestic political side, the spokesman also announced that
Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Robert Michel, Democratic and Republican
leaders in the House of Representatives, would go to Moscow this week for
their own look at the state of Russian reform.
Even though the US bilateral assistance proposals are supposed to include no
'new money', the congressional debate about an appropriate US response is
gathering steam. Also the Russian side has raised one issue, in particular,
which falls within congressional competence - its discontent with the
20-year-old Jackson-Vanik amendment that explicitly linked US trade and aid
to emigration policies, especially as they affect Jews.
Russia, claiming emigration has been liberalised, would like Mr Clinton to
seek a permanent waiver from the amendment, which has been automatically
renewed every year. US officials said there were still 'some problems' with
the status of a few former political dissidents.
The amendment was not the only 'irritant,' as the US spokesman called it,
raised by Mr Yeltsin. He also complained about the continuing Cocom
restrictions on technology trade with the former Soviet bloc and a recent
collision between US and Russian submarines, for which incident Mr Clinton
expressed regret.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: 'President Yeltsin does not have
supporters. He has hostages'

LIKE the western leaders backing President Yeltsin and his reforms, many
Russians feel that there is little choice but to support him for fear of the
alternatives.
As Mr Mikhail Leontiev, a leading Russian economics commentator, observes
wryly: 'Yeltsin does not have supporters but hostages. He puts one in a
situation where one has no choice but to support him.'
The question now is whether new western help spearheaded yesterday by
President Clinton and to be pursued by the Group of Seven in Tokyo can boost
support for Mr Yeltsin in an April 25 referendum. The answer is that it
probably cannot hurt.
Most people interviewed yesterday at Moscow's Kiev railway station, around
the street stalls and kiosks which are the most visible consequence of
market reforms so far, welcomed western assistance, if it was made more
effective.
'Humanitarian aid only ends up in these kiosks where the hoods in leather
coats make money out of it,' claimed Mrs Liudmila Konstantinova, a retired
engineer on a pension of Rbs8,500 a month. But she added that Mr Yeltsin
still needed some sort of help 'because he's not managing on his own'.
'Help is always good. The question is how to use it. We need investment in
specific regions and businesses,' said Mr Albert Koplinsky, a factory
worker.
Mr Yuri Feldman, who has a computer programming business, suggested that the
west send managers to Russian enterprises 'to teach us how to work
properly'.
Natasha, an atomic engineering student from Obninsk, had mixed feelings
about aid but would vote for the president. 'On the one hand, if we could
have avoided getting into this mess, we would not need help. But since
people don't want to work hard, we are finding it difficult to get out of
this ourselves.'
A minority were resolutely opposed to western help. Expressing indignation
about the rubbish and dirt surrounding the street sellers, Galina, an
accountant, said she had lost faith in Mr Yeltsin. 'Before going to a market
economy, we should have prepared for it. I feel terrible that we are now so
poor we need help.'
Another woman said: 'The only kind of help we need is our own. We've got to
force people to work hard and put all the goods which are now on the streets
into the (state) shops.'
But Nikolai, standing behind a table laden with plugs, screwdrivers, and
electrical wire, expressed full support for Mr Yeltsin. 'If the Communists
come back, they won't even let us breathe. I supply things that people need,
more cheaply than in the shops. What's wrong with that?'

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: West's backing for Yeltsin a big
gamble

THE Clinton-Yeltsin summit cannot be a success on its own. It is the formal
centrepiece of a process of organising aid for Russian reform: a process
which should see clear decisions made on assistance by the foreign and
finance ministers of the Group of Seven countries in Tokyo in ten days'
time, but which cannot be consummated without a political victory for
Russia's reformers.
President Yeltsin came to Vancouver having committed himself to taking part
in an April 25 popular vote which he initially called on questions of trust
in his presidency and approval of a draft constitution. Just before the
summit, he agreed instead to a referendum under the control of his opponents
in the parliament.
In this poll the question of trust remains, but is supplemented by questions
on social and economic reform and on elections of the president and the
parliament. Further, these questions must win a majority of more than 50 per
cent of the electorate - a high qualifying margin which may render the
exercise inconclusive - as intended by parliament.
Yet from this vote - if it goes ahead - Mr Yeltsin must claim enough of a
political victory to allow him to dominate parliament and to protect reform.
Only if this is possible can foreign aid be applied. President Bill Clinton
and other western leaders are thus right to say they are betting heavily on
Mr Yeltsin.
But if he does pull it off, says one senior western official, 'stabilisation
of the economy is closer than it has ever been'.
The government has a plan, drawn up by Mr Boris Fyodorov, who was at the
Vancouver talks, and as deputy prime minister in charge of finance and the
economy is the shaper and controller of economic change.
He has told western governments he will need, in the coming year, Dollars
20bn for stabilisation of the rouble, support of the budget and
restructuring of industry. He may not get it all. But he should get at least
half, and with that he can start his transformation.
The western countries are likely to change the way aid is provided. They
will bypass the International Monetary Fund, for over a year the west's
arbiter of Russian reform and disburser of aid. The IMF will continue to
judge the performance of the government and to work with it to set targets.
But the leaders of the G7 now appear determined to take the disbursement of
aid into their own hands.
It should mean that, rather than aid being held out as a reward for good
behaviour, it would be given in order to promote good behaviour. Rather than
demand a budget deficit of 5 per cent of gross national product, for
example, as the IMF has done over the past year, funds would be provided to
support the budget which would make such a target realistic.
Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, made the new relationship
between the IMF and its chief paymasters clear in Vancouver when he said
that 'after all, the leading industrial countries are the majority of the
shareholders of the IMF' - a sign that the Fund will be subordinate to the
perceived necessity of helping a reform process which cannot conform to the
Fund's guidelines.
Thus, in two weeks, the G7 should have completed their side of the bargain.
They will have offered Russia a substantial package of support which would
allow its government to make the critical moves to bring inflation under
control and to make the rouble convertible on current account.
However, there remains a doubt that Russia's politics will stabilise
sufficiently to support the policies on which the provision of aid is
predicated. While Mr Yeltsin enjoyed the hospitality of Vancouver, his
opponents - and even his allies - in Russia were undermining his position.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, denounced the west for
taking sides in the struggle between parliament and president. Mr Valery
Zorkin, the head of the constitutional court, called Mr Yeltsin's
participation in the summit a waste of time.
And Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who had last week said that
Mr Yeltsin's support of the government was indispensable to reforms,
launched a savage attack on his own deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation, Mr Anatoly Chubais, for conducting a programme reminiscent of
the Stalinist collectivisation of the peasant farms in the 1920s and 1930s.
Though Mr Chernomyrdin and the other corporatists in the cabinet have
accepted that stabilisation is essential, they are not reconciled to
privatisation.
'Our interests lie with Russian reforms and with Russian reformers led by
Boris Yeltsin,' Mr Clinton has said. Now Mr Yeltsin, after the unequivocal
support delivered in Vancouver this weekend, must show that he really does
lead, and that the reformers are still in a position to be led.

FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: G7 aid a condition for Russian
reform, not a reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin should savour the reception he received from
US administration official at this weekend's Vancouver summit. He can expect
a more sceptical welcome from some other members of the Group of Seven
industrial countries, in whose collective name any multilateral aid package
is likely to be provided. The economic arguments may be on the side of Mr
Yeltsin. But he will have a tough time persuading deficit-burdened G7
countries that up-front aid makes good political sense.
Western worries over the sagacity of committing aid to the Russian reform
programme are understandable. Moscow politics remain unpredictable, while Mr
Yeltsin's grip on power appears tenuous. Russian inflation is also
accelerating fast, nearing 30 per cent a month over the last quarter.
Inevitably, sensible investors are desperate to sell roubles for western
dollars in order to salt their savings away in Swiss bank accounts.
Yet none of these concerns weakens the case for aid. Indeed, the pace at
which the Russian economy is approaching hyperinflation, and the scale on
which capital is fleeing the country, make it all the more important that
the G7 takes the plunge. For capital flight is only a symptom of the
underlying economic malaise. It is the threat of hyperinflation, and the
potential political disintegration that could follow, that make capital
flight the only sensible strategy for would-be investors.
Only by bringing the credit creation under control can the Russian
government reduce inflation and stabilise the slide in the value of the
rouble. That means stemming the flow of bank credits to indebted state
enterprises, while bringing remaining subsidies within the government's
budget. Central bank credits are currently growing by 20 per cent a month,
over 70 per cent a quarter, of which more than half go to state enterprises.
But the Russians cannot control inflation on their own, a point made
repeatedly both by the Russian government and by enlightened external
observers such as Mr Stanley Fischer, professor of economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and previously chief economist at the
World Bank. Western aid, they argue, is needed to provide a non-inflationary
way of bridging the gap in the government budget that central bank credits
now fill.
But how much aid is needed? About Dollars 2bn in the second quarter of this
year rising to Dollars 4.5bn a quarter by the beginning of 1994, according
to a stabilisation plan devised by Mr Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor and adviser to the Russian government. The plan is designed to
reduce the quarterly rate of inflation from over 100 per cent today to 14
per cent in the first quarter of 1994. Meeting these inflation targets
requires the rate of growth of central bank credit to fall to a fifth of its
current level. Total credit creation continues to grow each quarter by a
little over 15 per cent of gross domestic product, of which the share of
central bank credit is to fall from 100 per cent today to a quarter by the
end of the year, with western aid filling most of the gap.
And when should aid commence? Standard IMF practice is to wait for a country
to establish an anti-inflationary track record before supplying aid. But the
Russian government argues that the urgency of their plight, and their
financing difficulties, require up-front aid in order to allow the programme
to begin. Mr Fischer agrees. 'The west rightly fears that economic
assistance would simply be wasted,' he says. 'But without western financial
assistance, the Russians will not be able to balance the budget and bring
inflation down to a level that will allow other reforms to proceed.'
Western aid, both Fischer and Sachs argue, should flow as soon as deputy
prime minister Boris Fyodorov is in charge of credit creation and starts
implementing stabilisation measures. Of course, the reformers may fail even
with aid. But their chance of success depends critically on whether they can
convince reluctant G7 governments to take the risk.

FT  05 APR 93 / Tide running out for royalty in Australia: Kevin Brown in
Sydney sees a drift towards republicanism as old ties with Britain fade

WELL MAY we say 'God Save the Queen', because nothing will save the
governor-general.'
So spoke Mr Gough Whitlam, former prime minister, shortly after his Labor
government was dismissed by Sir John Kerr, the governor-general, at the
height of Australia's worst constitutional crisis in 1975.
Mr Whitlam was wrong (he lost the subsequent election in a landslide). But
18 years later, it seems that nothing can now save either the
governor-general or his sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II, from the rising tide
of republicanism.
Republicanism was not an issue in last month's federal election, which was
narrowly won by Mr Paul Keating's incumbent Labor government after a
campaign fought almost entirely on economic issues.
But Labor's unexpected victory has unleashed a surge of support for
constitutional change in the Liberal party, the larger of the two partners
in the opposition coalition. Three state Liberal leaders this week urged the
party to consider dropping its traditional support for the monarchy,
including Mr John Fahey, premier of New South Wales, the most populous
state.
Other prominent Liberals remain sceptical. Mr John Hewson, the federal
leader, has avoided committing himself, and Mr Jeff Kennett, premier of
Victoria, describes republicanism as 'a tenth-order issue'. The party's
freedom to change course is also limited by its need to avoid a split with
the strongly monarchist National party, the coalition's rural-based junior
partner.
But the willingness of so many leading Liberals to contemplate
constitutional change suggests the party will accept that a gradual
transition to a republic is inevitable.
Diminishing support for the monarchy reflects Australia's gradual drift away
from its traditional links with Britain, the former colonial power, which
annexed the continent in 1788. Australia achieved independence in a series
of steps between the federation of the continent's six states in 1901 and
the abolition by the UK parliament of its residual legislative rights in
1986.
The monarchy has remained untouched largely because of the difficulty of
amending the 1901 constitution, which says Australia's head of state is the
British monarch, represented by a governor-general.
Surveys suggest that up to 70 per cent of Australians now think this last
link should be broken. But there are a host of problems to be solved before
any practical steps can be taken. Most importantly, there is no consensus
between republicans on what sort of constitutional framework Australians
should be asked to accept.
The simplest procedure would be to change the governor-general's title to
president, and remove the requirement for the Queen to appoint him.
This minimalist approach is favoured by the Australian Republican Movement,
led by moderates such as Mr Thomas Keneally, the novelist, and Mr Malcolm
Turnbull, a Liberal lawyer and merchant banker.
However, the more radical Australian Republican Party says the transition
should be used as an opportunity to abolish the states. Mr Ian McPhee, a
former federal Liberal minister, has argued a similar case. Other ideas
include the entrenchment of a bill of rights, notably lacking from the
existing constitution, and indirect elections for the presidency, which
would substantially increase the authority of the office.
All previous attempts to amend the constitution have been determined by
referendums under a provision requiring support from a majority of voters in
a majority of states. Only eight of 42 proposals have succeeded, suggesting
widespread agreement on a republican amendment would be crucial to success.
But even a successful referendum proposition would be open to a High Court
challenge by monarchists, who could seek to have it struck down on the
grounds that parts of the constitution cannot be amended by this mechanism.
This is because the document known as the Australian constitution is
technically the ninth section of the 1900 Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution Act of UK parliament.
Mr Tony Blackshield, professor of law at Macquarie University, says most
lawyers think the referendum procedure does apply to the first eight
sections. But only the sometimes unpredictable High Court could determine
this.
The alternative would be to use an obscure provision allowing federal
parliament to pass any law that could have been made only by the UK
parliament at the time of federation.
But this section has never been used because it requires simultaneous
consent of all state legislatures - seen by Mr Greg Craven, reader in law at
Melbourne University, as a 'virtual impossibility'. A further complication
is that it is unclear whether an amendment of the federal constitution would
abolish the states' links with the Queen, which derive from colonial
constitutions which continued in force after federation.
This means a federal republic might have to co-exist with one or more
monarchist states.
Mr Keating plans to appoint a committee of six eminent persons to consider
these issues and prepare the ground for change. Optimistically, perhaps, he
has set it a target of 2001, the centenary of federation, to complete the
job.

A FOUR-MEMBER Taiwanese delegation left for China yesterday to pave the way
for a ground-breaking meeting between representatives of both sides, Reuter
reports from Taiwan.
The delegation from Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official
body which handles ties with China, will make preparations for a trip to
Beijing by SEF secretary-general Cheyne Chiu later this week.
Mr Chiu will visit China from April 7 to 11 to plan a meeting between SEF
chairman Koo Chen-fu and Wang Dao-han, head of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Singapore later this month.
The association, like the SEF, is a non-governmental body which handles ties
between the two sides in the absence of official ties.
Taiwan has banned official contact with Beijing since the end of the Chinese
civil war in 1949. But trade and civilian ties have expanded rapidly since
political tensions eased in the late 1980s. The Singapore meeting would
focus on ways to protect Taiwanese investment in China and co-operation to
fight crime.

FT  05 APR 93 / LDP aims at big stimulus to economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party has proposed a spending package of
more than Y13,000bn (Pounds 76bn) to stimulate the economy, but has yet to
agree the amount with the Ministry of Finance, which is pushing for a lower
figure.
The Y13,000bn figure, decided at the weekend, is essentially an LDP 'wish
list' in response to a promise by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
that the package will be 'the biggest ever' and certainly larger than the
Y10,700bn emergency package of last year.
Mr Miyazawa wants to take an impressively large figure with him to
Washington later this month, as the US has been pressing Japan to revive its
economy, but doubts remain about the quality, if not the quantity, of the
new measures.
The LDP list includes Y9,000bn in public spending, Y2,000bn in 'social
infrastructure' and Y2,000bn in additional lending to home buyers and small
businesses by government-linked financial institutions.
'Social infrastructure' spending is designed to improve the quality of life
in line with a past suggestion by Mr Miyazawa that Japan will become a
'lifestyle superpower'.
But it is unclear how much of this investment is the front-loading of
already planned spending schemes. For example, at least Y1,000bn on the
public spending list is for early purchasing of land for public works
schemes.
A surge in stock prices and the assertion by some prominent Japanese
economists that the economy has turned around have complicated the
negotiations for the spending package. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, heading the
LDP's package committee, had earlier suggested that support for the stock
market and assistance for ailing banks would be included.
But both these measures are unpopular among ordinary Japanese, as is the
proposal to buy land to support property prices; these ideas are seen as the
LDP responding to demands by corporate supporters. Most Japanese would
prefer that the package contained income tax cuts, which Mr Mitsuzuka said
'may be considered at a later date'.
There is also public anger that one of the biggest beneficiaries will be the
construction industry, now at the centre of a scandal over illegal donations
to the LDP. Prosecutors allege that contractors routinely rig bids for
public works projects and give a share of their earnings to LDP officials.

EGYPT'S President Hosni Mubarak is seeking a summit with Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the Israeli prime minister, after his discussions on reviving the Middle
East peace process in Washington, Israeli officials said yesterday.
Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had
requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates
and in terms of location, nothing is set.'
Mr Mubarak, the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace
talks, meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he
would report the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return.
The Egyptian leader has met both President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr
Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in the run-up
to his trip to the US.
The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to
resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in
December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks.
The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next
round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from
Washington.

THE Japanese are increasingly disillusioned with their politicians and have
lost confidence in the country's direction, according to an annual survey by
the prime minister's office, which found respondents unusually gloomy.
A record 70.1 per cent of the 10,000 polled said public opinion was not
properly reflected in national politics. The negative response follows a
series of scandals involving the ruling Liberal Democratic party in recent
months.
The level of disillusionment was highest among the young. About 81 per cent
of those aged between 30 and 34 said their opinions were not reflected in
political debate. Overall, 23.5 per cent of respondents thought that
politics did take into account their opinions.
As for the country's general direction, a record high of 44.3 per cent, up
from 35.5 per cent in the previous year, said Japan was 'off course', with
most concerned about a decline in working conditions and job security.
Meanwhile, only 31.4 per cent consider that Japan is still on course.
The survey found that 49.8 per cent of respondents think Japan is valued by
the international community, down from the 50 per cent of a year ago, but
still above the 41.1 per cent who suggested that the country is not valued.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLORIDA'S legislature has approved a far-reaching overhaul of the state's
healthcare system that may foreshadow national reforms being considered by
the Clinton administration.
Governor Lawton Chiles said the plan would extend medical insurance to
millions of people left out by the current system, and should serve as a
model for national reform.
The plan adopted in Florida follows the 'managed competition' principles
that President Bill Clinton has said will form the framework of his reform,
and will be applied on a wider scale than different schemes adopted in less
populous states such as Oregon and Hawaii.
The current Medicaid programme gives health coverage to low-income families
and is sponsored by the federal government but paid for in part by the
states. The programme is already the dominant factor in most state budgets,
forcing them to consider ways of lowering medical costs, or at least curbing
medical inflation.
The heart of the Florida plan is the creation of 11 regional co-operatives
that will act as purchasing pools to negotiate directly with doctors and
hospitals for medical services. The pools will negotiate fixed annual fees
with the providers.
More than 2m people in Florida and 35m nationwide fall through the cracks in
current provision. They have no health insurance provided by their employers
but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.

FT  05 APR 93 / Bosnia's president spurns Serb calls for direct talks: Local
leaders prevent UN from evacuating refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday
rejected Serb calls for direct talks between the country's three warring
parties, aimed at reaching a compromise on a peace plan negotiated by
international mediators.
The face-to-face talks between Moslems, Serbs and Croats were proposed by
the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, after his self-styled Serb
parliament had rejected a map drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, UN
and EC negotiators, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
While admitting he had hoped the parliament's declaration would be 'a little
less tough and more positive towards the plan,' Mr Karadzic denied it had
been entirely turned down.
'We accept the positive achievement of the Vance-Owen plan so far and we
expect to correct the maps through direct talks face-to-face with the sides
to the conflict,' he said in an interview with Reuter TV. Mr Izetbegovic,
however, told reporters in Sarajevo yesterday that Mr Karadzic was up to his
usual 'games and tricks', and that he was confident the international
community would see through them.
'It is a rejection (of the plan) and nothing less,' he said.
After reluctantly signing the peace plan himself last month, Mr Izetbegovic
had made it clear he would withdraw his signature unless the Bosnian Serbs
endorsed the Vance-Owen plan unchanged.
Meanwhile, a ceasefire agreed a week ago broke down at the weekend, leaving
at least seven dead and 28 wounded in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. Fighting
was also reported around the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia. Lieutenant-General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of UN forces in
Bosnia, called on Bosnian Serbs to stop besieging the town and to respect
the ceasefire.
Local Moslem leaders yesterday refused to allow a UN aid convoy to evacuate
refugees from Srebrenica. Moslem leaders have indicated they believe such
evacuation would contribute to the Serbs' policy of expelling Moslems from
areas which Serbs want to claim as their own. Eight trucks, which delivered
75 tonnes of food to the stricken town which is within range of Serb gun
positions, left empty.
Hardline members of the Bosnian Serb parliament forced through a declaration
on Saturday which made clear that the Vance-Owen map, which would reduce the
territory allocated to the Serbs from the 70 per cent of the total surface
of Bosnia which they occupy now to 43 per cent, was 'unacceptable'.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also said in Vancouver at the
weekend that he thought there was still a possibility the peace plan could
be adjusted to meet Serb concerns. Describing the Bosnian Serb decision as
'regrettable', he nevertheless believed they had left the door open and that
efforts should continue to try to persuade them it was in their and the
world's interest 'to bring this slaughter' to an end.
'We're not ready to give up,' Mr Christopher said. The tone of his remarks
was noticeably more conciliatory than his previous statements about punitive
sanctions against the Serbs, probably in deference to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, who was attending a summit with US President Bill Clinton
in Vancouver.

FT  05 APR 93 / Lufthansa chief attacks US deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government should cancel its air transport agreement with the US,
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa chairman, said at the weekend.
All efforts to bring the national flag-carrier back into profit would be
fruitless as long as US airlines were allowed to swarm virtually unhindered
into Europe and while Lufthansa laboured under the constraints of an antique
bilateral treaty, he argued.
Mr Weber, a former aviation engineer installed two years ago to set the
loss-making, 51 per cent government-owned, German airline to rights, feels
he has filled his side of the bargain.
'I cannot take on the tasks of my main shareholder,' he told the FT.
He has slashed the workforce - 5,000 jobs have gone in less than a year - a
ground-breaking pay deal last summer, including a wage freeze, has helped
reduce personnel costs 27 per cent, and flights to the growing markets of
Asia and eastern Europe have been increased.
But recession and continuing price competition have continued to take their
toll. 'Last year we carried 11 per cent more passengers and 6 per cent more
freight, but the end effect was less in the till,' he said.
In fact, Mr Weber's efforts earned the airline a modest reduction in losses,
down DM30m to DM300m (Pounds 127.1m) in 1992. But that seems insufficient
for a man who has repeatedly promised that he will return the business to
profit in 1995, after just three years of his restructuring programme.
Now he believes it is Bonn's turn to deliver the changes he is unable to
engineer himself. He has sent government officials off to talks with US
authorities with his concerns ringing in their ears.
Mr Weber says that cancelling the aviation deal, which in any case is due to
be renegotiated by the end of October, will at least clear the ground for a
fresh, more even-handed agreement than the one which has limited German
airlines' access to a dozen US destinations.
'If it is cancelled then we will have a position where both partners can
start off on an equal basis,' he said.
But Mr Weber needs more than a level playing field to help him score in the
US. Although North American routes account for 30 per cent of group
revenues, Lufthansa has been unable fully to capitalise on the access it
already has.
The main reason is the links that other European competitors enjoy with US
airlines, and which enable them to move their passengers smoothly and
profitably on to regional destinations within the world's biggest domestic
market.
In the past two years Lufthansa has started partnership talks with both
American Airlines and USAir, only to abort them later. Last autumn it pulled
out of a proposed bid for Continental.
Now fresh talks are under way with an unnamed party. Their chances of
success would hardly be enhanced if Bonn's negotiators took Mr Weber's
weekend urgings at face value and chose confrontation. On the contrary,
improved access to main landing points in the US could strengthen
Lufthansa's hand with its new potential collaborators.

IG Metall, Germany's big engineering union, has called for nationwide
protests from April 24 in support of higher wage demands by eastern
Germany's electrical, metal and steel sectors.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the unon, also told a rally in the east German
city of Magdeburg at the weekend that members throughout the five east
German states would be balloted later this month on whether to hold an
all-out strike in the region. He added that IG Metall would continue warning
strikes in eastern Germany until the employers' steel, and metal and
electrical associations agreed a 21 per cent pay increase for the steel
sector and a 26 per cent increase for the metal and electrical industry.
The pay increases are part of a contract signed between the union, west
German employers and east German managers in March 1991 aimed at equalising
German wages by April 1994. Wages in the east are below 70 per cent of west
German levels. The employers say they cannot now meet the demands because of
the recession in western Germany and low productivity in the east.
Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal environment minister, arrived in
Bucharest yesterday to assess ways to clean up 400 tonnes of toxic waste
illegally exported by German companies to Romania in recent years, writes
Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
The waste, exported by both east and west German companies, has been stored
in and around the Transylvanian town of Sibiu in coroding containers,
according to Greenpeace.
Mr Topfer is expected to sign a co-operation agreement with Romanian
officials during his two-day visit.

FT  05 APR 93 / The European Market: Poor prognosis for EC drug agency - A
new body streamlining drug authorisations is facing delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Medicines Evaluation Agency, intended to streamline drug
authorisations within the European Community, faces an uphill struggle to
get under way by 1995.
The main decisions on the agency's operations - including location, cost and
staffing - remain to be taken. Prof Duilio Poggiolini, chairman of the EC's
committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP), which will advise the
new agency, says he hopes heads of government will agree a location when
they meet in Copenhagen in June.
But with several countries, including Britain, lobbying hard for the EMEA,
this may prove optimistic.
The EMEA is a crucial plank of the EC's single market programme for the free
circulation of goods within the 12 member states. Once the new system is
operational by the end of the decade, the same drugs, conforming to
standards of safety, effectiveness and quality, should be available
throughout the Community.
There will be Community-wide monitoring of adverse reactions.
Pharmaceuticals companies will submit new drugs for approval either directly
to the EMEA through a centralised procedure, or through a decentralised
route based on mutual recognition of authorisations by national authorities,
with binding EMEA arbitration in case of argument.
Biotech drugs will have to go through a centralised assessment by the CPMP,
which will be optional for other high-tech drugs. For the foreseeable
future, however, most drug approvals will go through the decentralised
system - which means companies can still choose which country they go to for
initial authorisation.
'What industry wants is a speedy decision at reasonable cost,' says Mr Ben
Hayes of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 'In the
end, companies will take a commercial decision on which route to take.'
Both procedures are supposed to be quick - crucial when limited patent life
can leave only a few years for companies to recoup costly investments - and
should obviate the need for separate sets of clinical trials and repetitive
paperwork now demanded by national medicines agencies.
Under the centralised system the CPMP, which consists of pharmaceutical
regulators and experts from the 12 member states, will appoint one or maybe
two national agencies to act as rapporteurs, or assessors, for a drug
application. The verdict, which must be delivered in 210 days, will normally
be made binding across the Community within another 90 days.
Under the decentralised procedure an even tighter timetable is envisaged for
marketing approvals granted by one member state to be recognised by others,
although arbitration could stretch this to 10 months or so.
Company preferences will be influenced by how smoothly the two procedures
work. Prof Poggiolini points out that the risk of national objections is
lower when people get together to discuss scientific evidence - a plus for
the centralised procedure.
However, pharmaceutical companies which have already established good lines
of communication with national agencies may be reluctant to switch to the
new, and therefore uncertain, EMEA system. There are also worries the CPMP
may choose rapporteurs on a rotational basis rather than for their expertise
in evaluating particular types of product.
As for cost, a recent report for the European Commission by consultants
Touche Ross and Besselaar suggests the EMEA may be more expensive to run
than originally envisaged, even though it is intended to co-ordinate rather
than replace the functions of national medicines agencies.
They estimate that by 1999 the EMEA will need a staff of about 250 and an
annual budget of some Dollars 60m (Pounds 42.2m). Prof Poggiolini describes
these figures as 'a basis for discussion'. No decision has yet been taken on
how this might be split between fees charged to companies and direct funding
by the EC.
The 12 Community countries employ 2,000-2,500 full-time staff, plus about
1,000 expert consultants, on drug evaluation. According to Touche Ross and
Besselaar this costs about Dollars 300m a year.
The consultants calculate that, by the end of the century, perhaps 40 per
cent of the 8,000-10,000 applications handled by national agencies each year
will no longer be necessary.
Prof Poggiolini argues that the new system should spur innovation and become
a platform for worldwide efforts to harmonise drug standards.
The CPMP is already involved in discussions with the US Food and Drug
Administration and its Japanese counterpart on standardising requirements
for drug effectiveness, quality and safety, in the International Conference
on Harmonisation. However, Prof Poggiolini says harmonisation on a global
basis will not be a reality before 'the early years of the next century'.

FT  05 APR 93 / Aids experts come to AZT's defence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AZT will remain the cornerstone therapy for Aids in spite of the preliminary
results of a large-scale Anglo-French study, published on Friday, that
raises questions about the effectiveness of the drug, US Aids experts said.
The so-called Concorde study should not cause alarm, medical experts and
Aids activists in San Francisco stressed.
The study 'doesn't really change what we already knew or suspected; that AZT
when administered as a single therapy is not very effective,' said a
spokesman for the San Francisco Aids Foundation, which offers counselling
and support to those with the HIV virus.
Current US treatment uses AZT (produced by Wellcome of the UK and marketed
as Retrovir) in combination with other drugs such as DDI (didanosine, made
by Bristol-Myers Squibb) or DDC (valcitabine, Roche), both of which have
been approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV infection.
This 'combination therapy' was developed as, in most patients, the HIV virus
became resistant to AZT after six to 18 months, Aids experts said. It was
not surprising the European study, which followed HIV-infected patients over
a three-year period, showed the limitations of AZT.
Early treatment of HIV infection is still critical, the experts maintain, as
studies suggest the virus is active in the lymphoid tissues ' the lymph
nodes, tonsils and spleen - during the so-called latent period, which can
last up to 10 years after infection, and before symptoms appear.

FT  05 APR 93 / Dispute dents Italian hopes for broad coalition
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects of a more broadly based coalition government being formed
after Italy's constitutional referendums on April 18 dwindled yesterday
after a deepening rift between two of the most important parties expected to
participate.
Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS),
attacked attempts by the majority Christian Democrats to cast doubt on the
testimony of 'supergrasses' who have accused senior Christian Democrat
politicians of collaborating with organised cime.
The participation of the PDS, currently in opposition, in a more broadly
based coalition after the referendums is seen as vital if Italy is to have
the stronger and more stable government able to pass electoral reform and
boost confidence in the economy.
Last week the leaders of the Christian Democratic party leadership called on
magistrates to investigate whether police collaborators were implicating
prominent Christian Democrat politicians to discredit the party.
The move followed last month's formal warning served by magistrates in
Palermo on Mr Giulio Andreotti, a veteran Christian Democrat and seven times
prime minister, that he is under investigation for alleged links with the
Mafia.
Some Christian Democrat politicians fear the leadership's challenge may
backfire given the immense public support now enjoyed by magistrates
investigating organised crime and corruption.
Mr Occhetto said the Christian Democrats' tactics contradicted claims by Mr
Mino Martinazzoli, its new leader, that the party, which has been the
dominant force in Italian politics since 1945, was being reformed.
In Naples, interrogations continued over the weekend into new strands of the
corruption investigations. Mr Mario Artali, managing director of the big
state-controlled SME foods group, was interrogated for several hours on
allegations that the company, to be partly privatised, provided illegal
funds to the Socialist party's newspaper.
Separately in Naples, Mr Benito Visca, secretary of the provincial PDS
branch, was interrogated by magistrates investigating the privatisation of
the city's refuse collection services. Mr Visca is one of the most prominent
PDS members to be implicated in the city's scandals.
Mr Renato Curcio, leader of the left-wing terrorist Red Brigades, which was
active in Italy in the 1970s, could soon be offered a limited form of
freedom after 17 years in prison.

FT  05 APR 93 / Pinheiro champions EC openness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN citizens would have the right to demand information on EC proposals
and decisions which affect them, under a new 'openness' regime the
Commission is due to discuss at the end of this month.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC commissioner for internal political
relations who has the job of trying to restore the Commission's credibility
at a time of widespread hostility, told the Financial Times he is planning a
radical overhaul of the Brussels information directorate.
The, until now, virtually invisible directorate known as DG10 will be
slimmed down and reorganised, with officials responsible for obtaining and
providing information on each area of EC policy on demand.
Under Mr Pinheiro's plans a small watchdog group, independent of the 'vested
interests' of other Commission departments, will monitor DG10 for the
quality and timeliness of its information. The operation as a whole would be
overseen by a consultative council made up of users of the service in each
member state.
'They will be there to provide the truth. There will be no propaganda, I am
very clear cut on that,' Mr Pinheiro said.
His plan has still to be discussed by the Commission, and although the
commissioner expects fierce resistance to the degree of openness, he claims
backing from Commission President Jacques Delors.
His chances of getting his reforms through should have improved after the
outcry that greeted a report on EC information policy last week by an
independent group of mostly public relations experts. The report,
commissioned by Brussels last November, recommended advertising and
propaganda techniques to sell European integration to citizens and
journalists.
'What we want is quite different,' Mr Pinheiro said. This would include
providing information on problems created by EC decisions and would oblige
the Commission to admit mistakes. 'A certain humility is called for,' the
former Portuguese foreign minister said. 'You can't pretend that whatever
you do is blessed by some hidden God who prevents you from making mistakes.'
As an example of how the new system would work, Mr Pinheiro said any steel
region or company in the EC would be able to get full, comparative
information and background on the controversial cuts in steel output now
under discussion.
'Information has to be based on reality,' the commissioner argued,
acknowledging that the EC had until now tried to hide the downside of
programmes like the single market, which started up this year.

FT  05 APR 93 / Convergence criteria on public debt to act as safeguard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The convergence criteria on public debt agreed as part of the Maastricht
treaty on economic and monetary union will act as a safeguard should markets
fail to respond to budgetary excess, according to Mr Chris Boyd, a member of
the cabinet of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor.
In a paper to the Trades Union Congress in London which seeks to rebut the
claim that the convergence criteria are deflationary, he states: 'The
criteria may act as a safeguard should the markets, whose judgment is not
always perfect, fail to recognise the signs of budgetary excess.'
The public debt criteria of the Maastricht treaty set 'reference values' of
60 per cent of GDP for public debt and 3 per cent of GDP for annual public
deficits.

FT  05 APR 93 / British Coal expects sharp fall in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is expected to report substantially lower overall profits - and
may sustain losses - for the year just ended in spite of increased
efficiency and significant improvements in operating results.
The reduction in overall profits will result from exceptional losses arising
from write-offs due to coal price falls and from delays in pit closures.
Separately, unions and trustees of the British Coal staff pension scheme are
expected to decide later this week how to challenge legally the
corporation's move to use a pension fund surplus to finance payments to be
paid into a fund for redundancy payments.
British Coal owes the special fund Pounds 480m, but says it is entitled to
Pounds 470m of the Pounds 1bn pension scheme surplus. Unions argue that the
BC move is illegal. The corporation already enjoys a pensions contribution
holiday until 1997 due to a previous surplus.
The steep fall in overall profits from Pounds 170m in 1991-92 will be the
first worsening in the corporation's overall financial performance in three
years.
However, in the run-up to privatisation, expected in the next two years, the
government will be able to point to a significant rise in British Coal's
operating profits from Pounds 360m in 1991-92.
Ministers will argue, and British Coal's potential buyers are likely to
accept, that operating profits are the best gauge for judging British Coal's
potential.
It will irk the corporation to report a fall in profits in a year when
productivity has risen 20 per cent. However, Whitehall is braced for a sharp
fall as a result of two exceptional items.
The first item results from having to keep open 10 pits no longer being
mined but which British Coal has been forced to maintain because of a High
Court decision that it failed to consult properly on their future. It
intends either to close them or license them to the private sector. The cost
of keeping the pits in a state which would allow them to be mined again is
about Pounds 13m a month.
Since British Coal stopped mining at most of the 10 in November the effect
on the results for the year ending March 28 is likely to be at least Pounds
60m.
The accounts for last year, due to be published in July, are also likely to
be affected by a fall in the price of coal. British Coal executives are
working on proposals to write down the corporation's assets on the grounds
that the falling price of coal means stocks and machinery are no longer as
valuable. The write-offs could amount to over Pounds 100m.

FT  05 APR 93 / UK brewers top list for dear beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIST prices which British brewers charge trade customers are the highest
in Europe, while the UK is the only country whose brewing industry has
failed to improve its productivity in recent years, according to stockbroker
Lehman Brothers.
The UK trade price of canned and bottled standard lager, at Pounds 117 per
hectolitre (hundred litres) is twice the level in France and the
Netherlands, the two cheapest countries, according to a study by the broker.
The UK list price of draught lager, at Pounds 85 per hectolitre, compares
with prices as low as Pounds 47 in France and Pounds 56 in Spain.
The study, based on exchange rates prevailing in the middle of last month,
compares prices of popular lagers of similar quality and alcohol content,
including Heineken, Stella Artois and Holsten.
The prices exclude tax and do not take account of discounts, which have
recently widened in the UK to as much as 65 per cent. However, Mr John
Wakely, author of the study, says special deals for trade customers are
common in most of Europe.
The study says German brewers cite a list price of Pounds 115 per hectolitre
for draught and packaged lager supplied direct to trade customers - the same
as charged by their wholesalers. However, it says the prices which the
wholesalers pay the brewers are much lower.
The study finds that brewers' productivity increases, measured by
hectolitres per employee, ranged from 3 per cent in Norway to 23 per cent in
Ireland between 1989 and 1991. However, it fell 11 per cent in Britain, the
only European country to suffer a decline.
High transport costs have limited beer imports to less than 10 per cent of
total consumption in most European countries. But Mr Wakely argues that
cross-frontier competition is set to grow, and will be encouraged by large
price differentials between countries.
He says these are so large at present that Bavaria, a Dutch brewer, finds it
profitable to ship inexpensive private-label beer in volume to retail
customers in Spain.
He forecasts that declining beer consumption, due to changing demographic
trends, health concerns and tighter regulation, will lead to steadily
increased pressure on European brewers to look beyond their national
markets.
The study expects some of the most aggressive cross-border competition to
come from Germany.

FT  05 APR 93 / Clinton commits Dollars 1.6bn in support of Russia reforms:
US president urges industrialised nations to stand by Yeltsin in 'hour of
challenge'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton of the US and Boris Yeltsin of Russia declared
yesterday they had established the basis for a 'new democratic partnership'
between the former cold war rivals.
Effusive in his praise of the Russian leader's 'humble roots' and 'heroic
deeds', Mr Clinton unveiled a larger than expected Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds
1.01bn) US financial assistance package. He said it was 'the self-interest
and high duty of all the world's democracies to stand by Russian reform in
its hour of challenge'.
Mr Clinton predicted that the other leading industrialised nations and
Russia would take 'mutually reinforcing steps' to further Russian reform at
a meeting of the Group of Seven foreign and finance ministers in Tokyo in 10
days.
Equally complimentary of the US president, Mr Yeltsin said the US assistance
would henceforth be known as 'Bill Clinton's package - a large, wise package
that will make history'. Questioned about his own political future, he
declared that in Russia at present 'there is no alternative to Yeltsin.
There will be tomorrow, but not today'.
After two days of what Mr Clinton called 'intensely productive' talks, the
two leaders also disclosed a number of additional steps.
They agreed, pending the acquiescence of other G7 countries, to establish in
Moscow a central co-ordinating office to ensure that assistance reached its
targets and avoided duplication. A likely candidate to head this operation
is Mr Gerald Corrigan, recently retired head of the New York Federal Reserve
Bank.
Mr Yeltsin said it was important that assistance would be delivered
according to strict 'monthly' deadlines. Mr Clinton repeated that
three-quarters of the US package was earmarked for non-governmental Russian
organisations.
Mr Clinton also promised to review all outstanding cold war US regulations
that Russia felt was hindering its economic development. These include the
20-year-old Jackson-Vanik amendment, aimed at pressing the former Soviet
Union into allowing more Jews to emigrate, and the Cocom rules restricting
technology sales to the former Soviet bloc.
The US president also held out the hope of a second wave of US assistance,
saying he would consult Congress over additional measures in the energy,
environmental, housing and broader economic reform fields. The Dollars 1.6bn
package announced yesterday, of which Dollars 900m in food credits and
grants was the largest element, involves only funds already authorised by
Congress.
The two leaders also discussed a wide range of foreign and security issues,
with Mr Clinton again regretting, and promising a review of, the recent
submarine collision in the Barents Sea.
The Russian president was sharply critical of the treatment by Latvia and
Estonia of Russian minorities, threatening to reschedule Russian troop
withdrawals if human rights were not respected. But the withdrawal from
Lithuania would proceed.
Senior officials in Vancouver said the total package of aid from the G7
countries should be approved at the forthcoming Tokyo meeting of foreign and
finance ministers.
This sum, estimated at between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn, will be
available to Mr Yeltsin's government once the west is satisfied that it has
control of the main economic levers, crucially the central bank.
Mr Clinton particularly emphasised to Mr Yeltsin in talks on Saturday night
that the central bank, whose credit expansion is seen as the main motor of
the 20 to 25 per cent monthly inflation rate, must be disciplined.
The US package followed some good days for the Russian president. He
received pledges of assistance of Pounds 120m from Mr Douglas Hurd, the
British foreign secretary, in Moscow on Thursday and Dollars 200m from Mr
Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, in Vancouver on Friday - a
total, with the US package, only just short of Dollars 2bn.
In addition, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy premier, negotiated a
debt rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of debtor nations last
Friday which relieves Russia of Dollars 15bn of debt for between five and 10
years.
Details emerging in Vancouver at the weekend reveal that Russia has promised
to pay Dollars 3.5bn in the first year of the agreement after a six-month
grace period during which the paybacks will be worked out with the
individual countries and with the London Club of private creditors.

FT  05 APR 93 / Pensions blow to government contracting-out plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROGRAMME of market-testing public services faces another serious
setback after a ruling from the attorney-general that contractors will have
to provide 'broadly comparable' pension rights in many cases where staff are
transferred from the public sector.
Under Transfer of Undertakings (Tupe) regulations, which apply to many
contracts, companies are obliged to retain the existing workforce on the
same terms and conditions. But most companies had assumed, encouraged by the
government, that big savings could be made in pension payments.
Many contractors have only been able to take over profitably services in the
National Health Service, local government and the Civil Service by offering
less generous pension arrangements than the typically index-linked public
sector pension.
But Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, has upheld his department's advice
on Tupe, ignored when granting most previous contracts, that contractors
should give comparable pension rights when taking over staff from government
departments.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, had suggested that
departments should avoid giving such guidance on Tupe. Sir Nicholas has told
her that advice previously given by law officers, that pensions were covered
by the regulations, was correct.
His insistence on the law officers' view follows guidance from Mr William
Waldegrave, civil service minister, that occupational pensions were not
affected by the regulations, a view echoed by the Department of Health.
Some contractors, when told of Sir Nicholas's ruling, reacted with dismay,
though others said the definition of 'comparable' might provide some room
for less generous benefits.
Mr Simon Cox, managing director of ISS Mediclean, which has 80 cleaning
contracts with the NHS, said: 'This is the crunch. It is just about possible
to cope with the other aspects of Tupe and run a profitable business. But if
we have to provide fully-funded, index-linked, pensions, it becomes
impossible.'
Typically, in the funding of a public service pension the employer and
employee between them pay in up to 13 per cent of salary each year compared
with less than 10 per cent in a small private sector service company.
Some of the contractors pay no pensions at all. A trade union official said
the government could face a 'deluge' of retrospective claims from people who
had had to accept reduc-tions in pension provision.
Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, has confirmed that Sir
Nicholas's ruling is correct by stating in a letter to Mr Lyndon Harris, the
Labour MEP, that the Acquired Rights Directive, on which Tupe is based, does
extend protection to occupational pension schemes.
Mr Tino Hernandez, head of research at the CPSA public service union said:
'The last avenue through which private contractors might have been able to
make savings to enable them to beat in-house bids has effectively been cut
off.'

<TEXT>
MR Riccardo Ruggeri, chief executive of New Holland, Fiat's London-based
agricultural machinery and earth-moving equipment venture with Ford,
yesterday presented himself to Milan magistrates to answer charges of
alleged corruption, Robert Graham reports from Rome.
Milan magistrates had issued an arrest warrant for Mr Ruggeri on March 24
and are understood to be questioning him about the period when he was
working in Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicules subsidiary. Iveco's Milan
concessionaire is alleged to have paid 4 per cent of a 15 per cent discount
on a bus sale to the Milan municipality into a Swiss bank account, for use
by Italian political parties.
On Thursday, an arrest warrant was issued for Mr Mauro Bertini, managing
director of Fiat Avio, the Turin auto group's turbines subsidiary,
concerning some L6bn (Pounds 2.5m) alleged to have been paid to the
Christian Democrat and Socialist parties so as to secure a turbine contract
in a power station. This followed the arrest of an intermediary and Avio
consultant, Mr Roberto Araldi, on Wednesday. Mr Bertini is believed to be
abroad.
Mr Mario Artali, managing director of the state food group SME, was arrested
in Rome on a charge of illegal party financing, according to the Italian
news service Ansa. SME, part of Italy's Iri holding company, is one of the
first companies slated for privatisation under a plan by Italy to sell off
much of its state sector.

FT  03 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Valued words snatched from fire
and flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the Chinese found 2,000 years ago that tree bark, rags and fishing
nets could be macerated into a new form of writing material, paper became a
staple of civilisation. Even the electronic office has failed to consign
paper to the waste bin as a tool for carrying information.
Paper, however, is a vulnerable material. Chuck a piece in the dustbin by
mistake or feed the wrong file through the shredder and it is lost, unless
there is a spare copy.
For many organisations, a big risk is deterioration of documents through
water damage from leaking pipes, mould, smoke and charring from fire.
'Britain has some of the highest rates of arson attacks on libraries in the
world,' says Georgine Thorburn.
Thorburn has unearthed a tiny but very profitable business niche.
Deterioration does not necessarily mean ruination. Her company, Document
SOS, specialises in paper salvage and conservation, using chemicals and
special drying techniques to remove soot, mud, even sewage from documents
vital enough for organisations to pay to save them.
'There has really been nobody handling documents and there was therefore a
huge void in the market,' she says.
Georgine completed a four-year BA degree course in paper conservation in
1987 and, three years ago, set up Document SOS with the help of Midland
Bank's small business advisory service and the London Enterprise Agency. In
its first full year it took contracts worth Pounds 100,000 and its second
year turnover was between Pounds 195,000 and Pounds 210,000. On this, it
makes a healthy pre-tax profit of about 25 per cent, according to the
company's accountants. A quarter of its turnover comes from providing
companies with disaster prevention reports on their document storage.
Document SOS operates from small rented premises in a London mews. It can do
this because all its salvage and restoration work is done on site. There are
just four permanent staff. Professional conservators are brought in as
freelancers for jobs which usually last from a day to a few weeks and are
paid about Pounds 300 a week.
Last year the company handled 15 to 20 large contracts and also performed a
range of tiny ones. At present it is repairing damage to a book for a fee of
Pounds 43. Disaster audits in which the company assesses how a client can
minimise the risk of document damage cost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds
3,000.
Georgine says the skills of paper salvage were partly born out of the 1966
river flood in Florence. The waters of the Arno caused tremendous harm to
many treasures. Some of the people involved in restoration work there became
tutors at Camberwell School of Art where Georgine took her degree.
Fortunately for Georgine, hardly any of her fellow students decided to set
up a salvage business.
Georgine says the company does no advertising. It has told all the UK's loss
adjusters, the people who investigate insurance claims, about its services.
Much of the company's work is from this source. 'Most of our work comes from
disasters like fires and you never know when the next one will happen. We
might have five in a row and then may be five months with nothing
substantial.'
Document SOS's first contracts included London's Hammersmith hospital where
fire damaged research books and files and a school in Barnet where smoke
harmed books and papers in the head teacher's office.
Customers include architects and computer companies where original plans and
operating manuals have been damaged by fire or water, and libraries, often
in schools, keen to save books harmed in arson attacks. 'One of the most
difficult things is to really set fire to a book but the little blighters
think it is easy,' says Georgine referring to the youngsters who are often
the perpetrators of such attacks. The covers are burnt but most of the pages
are only blackened round the edges.
The company's contracts also included salvage work after the Baltic Exchange
bomb attack and the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion. In that case, documents
were under water for three months.
'Water damage is the worst, the nastiest scenario being a burst river bank
with silt, sand and mud.' Georgine says. 'If that is not treated properly
you will also get mould. That could develop in as little as 12 hours.
Moisture and stagnant air alone can create it and it simply feeds off the
cellulose in the paper. With a fire, the seat of it can be quite small and
up to 98 per cent of the damage can come from smoke, which is very acidic
and incredibly corrosive. Handling the paper and laying just the oil from
your fingers on soot can make it much worse.'
A lot of damaged paper is beyond restoration. But Georgine demonstrates how
fully-blackened smoke-damaged material with no writing visible can be
restored so that every line is readable.
She says that before restoration starts, the conservator usually assesses
the type of ink on the paper, the paper's 'loading' - the chalk filling in
between the fibre - and the type of heat-sensitive coatings it uses.
Georgine's techniques include chemically impregnated sponges and deodorisers
for smoke damage, fungicides and controlled drying for water damage.
Preventing charred paper from disintegrating involves consolidating it with
synthetic resin and polyvinyl acetate. The equipment includes dehumidifiers,
disinfected gloves and, in bad post-fire conditions, respirators.
Georgine wants to extend her business into continental Europe and has
representatives in Switzerland and Spain. Though she says there are few
direct rivals in her business, general industrial cleaning companies are
getting in on the act. She questions the techniques they offer - which
include freeze drying which she says can worsen the damage - but these
companies are proving irksome competitors.

FT  03 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Earning a crust in a gastronomic
wasteland - Ian Hamilton Fazey visits a sandwich bar which has found a
hungry market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE who believes that the management techniques of big business cannot be
applied to small ones should meet Helen Jessop. She learnt about market
research and marketing while working for two Manchester advertising
agencies. When she started her own business in 1991, she put everything she
knew to the test. It has worked better than she ever imagined.
The business is called HJ's Quality Sandwich Makers. What makes it unusual
is its insalubrious location near the Old Trafford football and cricket
grounds, and because marketing has turned it into more of a factory than a
shop.
Of 800 sandwiches sold every day, about 500 go in three rounds to the office
blocks of Old Trafford, Trafford Park and Salford Quays. She has three vans
and 10 employees, including a full-time chef. They work flat out from 5am
each day making lunch for hundreds of office workers, with executive and
boardroom buffets a growing sideline.
She started only 19 months ago with three employees, a Pounds 7,000 loan
from Barclays, Pounds 40 a week from the government's enterprise allowance
scheme and a day's obligatory awareness training at Trafford Business
Venture, the local enterprise agency.
She now turns over between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000 a week and has
nearly paid Barclays back. 'It was because I knew the market was there that
we have succeeded,' she says. 'It was a classical case of a finding a hole
and filling it.'
Her husband, Mike Featherstone, an independent financial adviser in
Manchester city centre, first put her on to it. He used to work for Allied
Dunbar in Old Trafford and was always annoyed at the limited range of local
choice for lunch.
Helen also used to work nearby, for BDH, a Manchester advertising agency,
where she was assistant to the planning and research director. Its staff
used to repair to a local pub for lunch because of the shortage of choice.
Helen went on to work for BCMB, another agency, where she was an account
supervisor. She left to have a son, Henry. Rather than return to
advertising, Helen, now 30, told Mike, 15 years her senior, she wanted a
business of her own so they would have more control over their lives.
She researched his sandwich shop idea, and quickly discovered potential bulk
customers among companies in local office blocks.
'But I didn't just offer to supply any old sandwiches,' she says. 'I did
what I had learned to do in marketing: I spent time with people discussing
their likes and dislikes so we could give them what they wanted.'
This included comparison of sandwiches available in Manchester's many shops.
Philpotts, which has popular sandwich shops in central Manchester and
Chester, was universally praised, so she deliberately set out to match them,
seeing no point in trying to reinvent the wheel. Her menu ranges from a
cheddar cheese sandwich, for 70p, up to an avocado and prawn baguette for
Pounds 2.
Armed with a sound top line for her business plan, she had no trouble in
raising her bank loan or getting approval to join the enterprise allowance
scheme. Mike put up Pounds 40,000 to buy HJ's premises, an unimpressive
former dental surgery with a flat above - now home for Henry's nanny - in a
run-down parade of shops in Old Trafford.
Menus are distributed widely and orders are can be faxed to the shop - or
customers can buy from the trolleys her three drivers wheel out of their
little Suzuki vans and into the office blocks HJ's supplies.
The trolleys were designed by Frank Whitty, an engineer in Altrincham, where
Helen and Mike live. They stand nearly five feet high and their many trays
can be swivelled out, forming mobile displays.
The vans themselves have her business's name sign-written on them and have
proved effective peripatetic advertisements, attracting new office blocks of
customers who have seen them parked outside neighbouring premises.
One of her customers buys 500 sandwiches a day for its employees - and gets
a bulk discount. The deal has wiped out long lunch hours caused by staff
leaving the building in search of food.
The office blocks she does not supply are those within a few hundred yards
of the shop. These customers walk to her, and queue. This frees the vans to
go farther afield in a five-mile radius.
In December, she ploughed back Pounds 15,000 of investment into the most
modern cooking, chilling and food storage equipment available. Nearly all
sandwich fillings are cooked daily on the premises. Soups are home-made in
true culinary waste-saving tradition.
Getting the right staff has been her biggest problem. The area is not the
best, bordering Moss Side, Manchester's inner city problem area. 'I used to
use the local Jobcentre but the quality of applicant was not good enough,'
Helen says. 'I offered two of them jobs, but they never turned up for work.'
Others were sacked for unreliability or stealing stock. Now she relies on
word-of-mouth to recruit new staff. 'The team is now excellent,' she says.
Mike does the books and wages every Friday.
Helen pays Pounds 3.10 an hour and has part-time helpers on Sundays, when
Monday's sandwich fillings are prepared. Things do not always go to plan. A
few weeks ago she had to put in nine hours one Sunday on her own, boiling
and shelling 12 gross of eggs and producing thousands of cucumber and tomato
slices.
It is the price of success.
'I never thought it would take off like this,' Helen says, 'but I was always
trained to believe that if you research the market properly, produce then
right products and promote them to the right people, then the sales will
come. They have.'
There is no competition yet, but now she has opened the market, her big
business experience tells her this will probably be the next challenge.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A quiet one to watch - Investment
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A TRUST with half a billion pounds in assets, Anglo &amp; Overseas gets
surprisingly little attention. Indeed, one symptom of this low profile is
the near-20 per cent discount at which the shares trade.
These remain largely in the hands of institutional investors, perhaps
because of the trust's lowish yield and the fact that its international
portfolio makes it ineligible for full Pep status. But it could be argued
that its aims - to invest in world-wide companies with greater emphasis on
capital appreciation than income - are designed better for private investors
than for institutions, which these days can manage international exposure
for themselves.
The trust was founded in 1890 as Anglo-American Debenture Corporation in
order to buy bonds and other securities in the US, Canada and elsewhere.
The 'debenture' tag was dropped as the portfolio became concentrated in
equities, but the trust was known as Anglo-American Securities until 1987
when its name was changed to avoid confusion with the South African
conglomerate. Morgan Grenfell took over management of the trust from Robert
Fleming in 1981.
The lead manager, James Fox, has been a fund manager since 1968. He joined
Morgan Grenfell in 1985 after spells at Hill Samuel and Warburg Investment
Management.
As well as making the overall asset allocation decisions, he also looks
after the continental European element of the portfolio. The rest of the
team is Adrian Frost (UK), Kazuichi Mihara (Far East) and Alan Nesbit (the
Americas).
The trust is more international than most of its competitors - the UK
weighting (39.9 per cent at the end of 1992) is designed to generate income.
The rest of the portfolio at end 1992 was split: the Americas (19.8 per
cent); Japan (19 per cent); other Far East (6 per cent); and Europe (15.3
per cent). Since then, the American portion has been reduced and the
Japanese and European elements increased.
Over the past few years, Anglo &amp; Overseas has had quite a high weighting in
Japan relative to its competitors. This damaged its performance in 1990 when
the Tokyo market fell out of bed, but has been of benefit in the opening
quarter of 1993.
Fox says the trust tries to take a contrarian approach, as shown by its
increased exposure to Japan in the teeth of conventional wisdom. He cites,
as another example, the trust's Pounds 15m direct investment into UK
property over the past two years.
'We have bought five buildings outside London, on an average yield of around
10 per cent and with good tenants,' he says.
Anglo-Overseas also believes it is the first trust to issue commercial paper
(a form of short-term debt). It is using the paper to play the yield curve,
borrowing short in dollars at 3.2 per cent and investing in dollar Eurobonds
at 6.4 per cent.
The 10 biggest investments in the portfolio reflect the international
flavour. They are: Foxhurst (the property subsidiary); Generale des Eaux;
BTR; BAT; GUS; Sandoz; Robert Fleming; Export-Import Bank of Japan
(Eurobond); UBS; and Export Development Corporation (Eurobond).
The trust's performance has been respectable, rather than inspiring. In
terms of net asset value total return, it was 6th out of 14 trusts in the
international capital growth sector over the year to March 1 with a rise of
25.1 per cent (according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies).
Anglo &amp; Overseas was eighth (out of 12) in the sector over a five year
period and fifth (out of 10) over a 10-year period.
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says: 'It is
one of those trusts which has chugged away without doing anything special.
'Because of its size, it tends to be a core holding of institutional
investment trust portfolios, but it has not really succeeded in attracting
the private investor.'
Hamish Buchan, of NatWest Securities, adds: 'It is a classic flexible
international trust. It will never be a high yielder, but it has good
revenue reserves and there is the prospect of steady dividend growth. It
does not have the track record of Foreign &amp; Colonial, which explains why the
discount is so wide.'
But the discount does increase the attractions of the trust for those who
want overseas exposure and who believe, like Morgan Grenfell, that the
Japanese market is due for further recovery.
Key facts
Gross assets are around Pounds 525m and net assets were Pounds 469m. On
April 1, this translated into net assets per share of 408.8p, according to
NatWest Securities. This put the shares, then at 332p, on a discount of 18.8
per cent. The yield was 2.8 per cent. Morgan Grenfell's management expenses
were 0.3 per cent of assets.
Board
The chairman is Lord Wakehurst, who has been on the board since 1968. Other
directors are John Boyer, a former deputy chairman of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation; Michael Dobson, chief executive of Morgan
Grenfell; Peter Ogden, chairman of Computacenter; and James Fox. Lord Catto
is about to retire.
Savings scheme and Pep details
The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 30, or Pounds
250 for a lump sum. The only charges are commission of 0.2 per cent and
government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. Because of its high overseas
weighting, Anglo &amp; Overseas does not qualify for full Pep status. But as a
non-qualifying trust, self-select Pep investors could put Pounds 1,500 a
year into it.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: US networks win right to slice
of Dollars 5bn TV syndication market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG US television networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - were yesterday
celebrating a crucial breakthrough in their efforts to take from Hollywood
studios a slice of the Dollars 5bn-a-year market for the syndication of
prime-time television shows.
The Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees
the industry, overturned on Thursday a 23-year-old rule which prevented the
networks from owning re-run rights to the prime-time shows they carry, or
producing more than 40 per cent of prime-time shows themselves.
The ruling is not final, as it has still to be reviewed by a federal court
in Los Angeles, and is likely to be the subject of further legal challenges.
However, it opens up an important new source of revenues for the networks
and is a blow to Hollywood studios, which had lobbied furiously to keep the
restrictions in place.
Analysts said the most important long-term implication of the FCC move could
be to pave the way for mergers between the networks and leading film
production companies.
However, the FCC ruling does not allow the networks to syndicate programmes
directly themselves. This must be done by an outside party, with the
networks taking their share of the profits. It also keeps them out of the
important market of first-run syndication, which covers programmes developed
for use by local stations outside prime-time schedules.
The old FCC regulations, known as the financial interest and syndication
rules, were adopted in 1970 following an anti-trust case against the three
networks, which then controlled more than 90 per cent of the US prime-time
audience.
However, the networks argued that their hold over the market had been
undermined by the rise of the cable television industry and the rules were
being used by Hollywood to restrict competition.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Italgas advances 6.5% to L658bn
despite recession and mild winter

ITALGAS, the listed Italian gas distribution group controlled by the Eni
state holding company, raised gross operating profits by 6.5 per cent to
L658bn (Dollars 411.25m) last year, according to preliminary figures
released yesterday,
Group sales were little changed at L3,381bn, against L3,353bn in 1991, in
spite of the recession and a relatively mild winter, which tended to depress
gas sales, said Mr Carlo Da Molo, chairman.
The company gave a strong hint that the dividend would be increased for the
second year running, up from the L100 a share paid last year. Full figures
for the group, which in 1991 raised net profits by 16.7 per cent to L91bn,
will not be available until later this month.
While gas supplies remained broadly stable at 6.4bn cubic metres last year,
sales of drinking water, the group's second main business area, rose by
about 10 per cent to 175m cubic metres, while the number of towns served
rose to 389 from 319. Investments during the year rose by 11 per cent to
L761bn.
Banco di Napoli, the big Naples-based Italian bank, has moved a step closer
to buying the remaining minority stakes in Isveimer, a Neapolitan long-term
lending institution.
Last month, Banco di Napoli revealed it had gained majority control of
Isveimer, which administers about L25,000bn in loans to borrowers in
southern Italy. The impact of a full merger between the two companies is now
being considered by the Bank of Italy, which will have to find that the deal
does not create a monopoly.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Unigate to float Black-eyed Pea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, has filed a preliminary prospectus
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the public offer of its
US restaurant chain.
The float is expected to be priced at between Dollars 220m and Dollars 250m
(Pounds 145m to Pounds 164m).
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said that if there was a sharp
fall in the stock market and the price had to be cut then Unigate would not
proceed with the sale. But he said Unigate had 'a moral obligation to go
forward if it is in the price range'.
In February Unigate signalled that the business, called Black-eyed Pea
Restaurants, was up for sale with a public offer under consideration. The
restaurants offer 'home-style' cooking at value-for-money prices.
Analysts said that the decision to go ahead with the flotation suggested no
trade buyer had appeared at a high enough price.
Mr Buckland said the proceeds would cover the cost of three recent
acquisitions - the purchase of Clifford Foods for Pounds 50.4m, Glass
Glover, the distribution company, for Pounds 54m, and some of the milk
business of the Co-operative Wholesale Society for Pounds 17m.
However, he said that if the float was pulled it would not put a strain on
Unigate's balance sheet. He promised more activity on acquisitions and
disposals. Last autumn Unigate sold its US cheese business for Dollars 75m
(Pounds 37m at the time).
One analyst estimated that the sale of the restaurant chain would cut
Unigate's gearing by the end of the 1993-94 financial year to around 20 per
cent.
However, analysts also feared that the sale could dilute Unigate's earnings
as the return on the cash would be less than the profit from Black-eyed Pea.
In the 1991-92 financial year the restaurant business made an operating
profit of Pounds 13.3m. The exit multiple on the indicated price range is
14.8 to 16.9.
If the SEC approves the document, and the underwriters to the issue find
sufficient interest from investors, the deal should go ahead in May.
Unigate aims to sell the whole of its interest, but could retain up to 10
per cent to provide a 'green shoe' enabling the underwriters to supply extra
shares if demand is strong. The capital employed in the restaurant business
was shown in Unigate's 1992 accounts at Pounds 34.2m.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hawtal Whiting shares plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NATHALIE LEMOINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Hawtal Whiting Holdings yesterday plunged from 62p to 37p, as the
automotive design engineer warned that its 1992 results might be affected by
higher bad debts. It had, however, returned to an underlying profit in the
second half after a first-half loss of Pounds 1.38m.
The failure of Leyland-DAF leaves the group unpaid for Pounds 1.1m of
engineering work on the Excel range of vans. It is 'vigorously' pursuing its
claim with Renault, who were in the joint-venture with Leyland-DAF.
This year's performance would not be significantly affected by Leyland-DAF's
failure as Excel accounted for about 5 per cent of the budgeted turnover.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon disposes of French packaging
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group, yesterday
sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox the French packaging group,
raising FFr3.9bn (Pounds 473m) before costs.
The group is expected to use the money to finance acquisitions but said
yesterday it did 'not have any major acquisition in mind at present'. Even
so a number of companies in the building materials sector saw their share
prices rise in anticipation. MB-Caradon's shares rose 2p to 320p.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said 'the disposal gives us substantial
cash resources. We are confident that we can deploy these into businesses
that we manage, and whose cashflows we control, for the long-term benefit of
our shareholders'.
The buyers of the holding of 20.5m shares, included CGIP, the French
industrial holding company which added 7 per cent to its existing 25.3 per
cent stake.
The interest dates back to the merger in 1989 of Metalbox Packaging, part of
the former MB Group which then bought Caradon, and Carnaud, the French group
in which CGIP was a large investor.
Although CarnaudMetalbox had a somewhat shaky start, new management has
improved profits in the last 18 months and the share price has risen. On
Wednesday it announced results for 1992 which showed net profits up by 15
per cent to FFr976m.
The stake was valued in MB-Caradon's 1991 accounts at Pounds 337.5m, and it
contributed Pounds 31.8m to profits that year. But the dividend received in
1991 was only Pounds 7.8m.
Mr Jansen said he had been under pressure from shareholders to sell the
stake since 1990, when he would have been glad to get Pounds 250m for it.
In February MB-Caradon called a meeting of shareholders for March to give it
authority to sell the stake. Despite this signal that the shares were for
sale, Mr Jansen said that there had been no firm offers for the complete
hold-ing.
Now, he said, it was 'cyclically a good time' to buy building products
businesses in the UK, but that MB-Caradon would also be looking in
continental Europe and North America. With its borrowing facilities and the
cash, it could spend Pounds 1bn.
Although the deal will give CGIP 32.3 per cent of the shares, it will hold
46 per cent of the votes in CarnaudMetalbox because shares held for more
than two years have double voting rights.
Parfinance, a company controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the Canadian
businessman, and Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian businessman, bought 6 per
cent. Parfinance was found by CGIP which wanted an 'associate investor' but
the two holdings are not deemed by the French stock exchange to constitute a
concert party. The remaining shares were placed by Warburg.
Warburg bought 10m shares at FFr190 each and placed them at FFr197, against
Thursday's close of FFr217, taking a gross profit of FFr70m.

FT  03 APR 93 / Clients of factor company investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue is monitoring the circumstances of the collapse of two
companies which had business dealings with London and Provincial Factors,
the debt trading company that failed five weeks ago.
In an unusual move a tax investigator attended creditors' meetings which
were held to wind up Brentford Radio Cars, a car hire company, and
Europublishing, both operating in London. The investigator, from the
Revenue's special office in Edinburgh which examines cases outside the scope
of local tax offices, has also joined the creditors' committees monitoring
the liquidation of the two companies.
The collapse of London and Provincial Factors with net debts of more than
Pounds 7m surprised other companies in the industry.
Debt trading companies - known as factors - provide services which range
from taking over the management of their clients' sales ledgers to lending
them a percentage of the value of their invoices. Clients are usually liable
for bad debts and it is rare for a factor to go bust.
Matters relating to LPF's collapse are also being examined by the Fraud
Squad. It is understood that the squad will decide whether to launch a
formal investigation later this month.
LPF's receivership caused difficulties for up to 40 of its clients.
Mr Stephen Mills, managing director of Leo Lithographics, a small printing
business, said his company faces collapse within seven days because its
invoices are now held by LPF's receivers, two accountants from Grant
Thornton.
The receivers said: 'All the clients of LPF have been given the opportunity
of getting back invoices sold to the factoring company on payment of the
amounts advanced to them by LPF.' The receivers said they 'have agreed a
number of deals on this basis. In the case of the Leo company it has been
unable to raise the necessary funding'.
LPF's collapse has prompted the Association of British Factors and
Discounters to urge the Bank of England to regulate independent factors,
such as LPF, more tightly. The association's members account for more than
90 per cent of the industry's turnover. LPF is not a member.
At least five companies, which were all clients of LPF, are known to have
gone into liquidation since July 1990, owing more than Pounds 3m to the
factoring company, according to liquidators' estimates.
The remaining three are Isleworth Press (formerly Recorder Newspapers plc),
Embassy Radio Cars, Boston Publications (formerly Recorder Newspapers Ltd)
and Heathrow Engine Centre.
At the Brentford Radio Cars creditors' meeting, Mr Ian Lowe, an executive of
the car hire company, listed several assets which he said he believed should
not be included in the company's statement of affairs because they were
secured against the personal assets of the executives. These included a
yacht and three properties.
Europublishing's directors said in their written report to creditors that
the company's liquidation had been precipitated by LPF's receivership. They
claimed the factoring company owed Europublishing more than Pounds 4m in
losses suffered because of the need for a speedy sale to an unconnected
newspaper group.
A spokesman for the receivers of LPF said: 'Far from LPF causing the failure
of Europublishing, LPF actually provided Europublishing with more funds than
they were entitled to under the factoring agreement.
'In fact, based on figures prepared by the company and on information
provided to the receivers, the receivers believe LPF is looking at a
shortfall in excess of Pounds 500,000 on this account.'
Europublishing, which traded as Recorder, lists creditors including Mr Mario
Nicolaides and Mr Michael Rowan, both former directors of Recorder
Newspapers Ltd, which changed its name to Boston Publications before its
collapse in April 1991.
Mr Rowan was also until last summer a director of Embassy Radio Cars (1981),
which changed its name to Brentford Radio Cars last month.
Mr Nicolaides was sentenced to 80 hours community service for fraudulent
trading in a separate company last month.

THE NAME Phillips &amp; Drew, once one of the strongest brand names in the UK
stockbroking business, has been dropped by UBS, the London-based investment
banking arm of Union Bank of Switzerland which took over the broker at the
time of Big Bang in 1986, Richard Waters writes.
Mr Rudi Mueller, head of UBS in London, called the move a 'logical
extension' of the integration of P&amp;D with the former UBS Securities
business.
The name will live on for a short while in Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management,
one of the leading pension fund managers in the UK, although here too it is
expected to be dropped after a period.

FT  03 APR 93 / London bears brunt of transport strike: Regions complain
about capital's day-off as roads 'bedlam' fails to materialise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, RICHARD EVANS, JIMMY BURNS and RHODRI DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON holiday, with business as usual for much of the rest of the UK, was
the verdict on the effects of yesterday's rail strike.
British Rail ran almost no services - the Thames and Chiltern line from
Banbury and Aylesbury into London was one of the few exceptions. London
travel problems were compounded because half of the red buses were off the
road in a separate dispute. However, London Underground's services were
operating nearly normally, except where tracks are shared with BR.
The 'bedlam' on the roads being predicted by motoring organisations largely
failed to materialise, apart from snarl-ups in the morning on the M6 north
of Birmingham and heavy congestion on the M1 through Northamptonshire.
For regular motorway users life was generally more pleasant than usual. Mr
Brian Harries, a salesman from Nottingham said: 'If the roads were as quiet
as this every time they strike - keep striking, lads.'
Many of those who began their journeys by road before dawn were sitting at
their desks at an unearthly hour with nothing to do and nobody to talk to.
Mr John Stevens, director of policy at the Institute of Personnel
Management, had breakfast at 7am in a roadside cafe after arriving in record
time at the institute's Wimbledon headquarters.
The Confederation of British Industry said thousands of workers had taken a
day's leave or had taken work home. In some organisations it had been
possible for employees to go to local offices instead. For example at Grant
Thornton, accountants, partners were working in out-of-London offices where
possible. At Touche Ross they were arranging to see clients based out of
central London.
The CBI's conference in London on trading with Zambia, had a 90 per cent
turnout.
Regional chambers of commerce reported irritation from businesses unable to
communicate with people in London. The Thames Valley regional chamber, for
example, said it had had difficulty getting in touch with anyone in the
capital. Glasgow chamber of commerce said it had 'heard about London getting
the day off'. In Birmingham, businesses reported only 10-15 minutes added to
journey times and chambers in Teesside and Manchester said companies had
been unaffected.
The British Retail Consortium said plenty of tourists took advantage of the
fact that it was a bit quieter in London's west end. Shops reported few
difficulties getting store staff to work, although among head office
workers, for example at Marks and Spencers' head office in Baker Street,
many had spent the day working at home.
In central London there was a distinct holiday atmosphere: Mr Jean-Luc
Martigny, a French banker living in Kensington, said: 'It reminds me of
France. Whenever we have a religious or bank holiday we take a pont, or
bridge, to the weekend. The habit seems to be catching on here.'
Restaurant and wine bar owners were not convinced though. Mr Paul
Blannerhassett, assistant manager of Balls Brothers wine bar at Hays
Galleria near London Bridge, said he had never seen fewer customers on a
Friday. It was not like previous rail strikes when everyone had been
determined to get to work.
The manager of the Cafe D'Arte, an up-market sandwich and salad bar at
Blackfriars, said customers had told him only half their staffs had turned
up, although he had about 75 per cent of his normal business.
The Paperchase shop on a deserted Waterloo station was a particularly
forlorn sight. By late afternoon when the staff decided to close, 60
customers had been in compared with the usual 700. 'It's been a disaster of
a day, but we felt we had to open,' said Ms Emma Carr, assistant manager.
There were beneficiaries, however. A welcome boost was given to the
financially troubled Thames riverbus service as a number of Londoners chose
to go to work by river.
Services were increased and the normally half-empty launches were fully
booked on the morning run up the river from Greenwich. The launches were
also much more crowded than usual on the eastward route from Chelsea.
Miss Jill Boezalt, office manager with a landscape architect, found the
Pounds 3 river trip from Chelsea more expensive than her usual Pounds 1.20
bus journey from Battersea, but she could not remember a less troublesome
trip to work. 'This is a real treat . . . a delightful way to get to work.
I'd do it every day if only it were cheaper.'
Coach companies and National Car Park sites reported roaring business, with
substantial bookings. 'They started coming in from 5.30 this morning, well
ahead of normal, and we've been full until mid-afternoon,' said an attendant
at an NCP South Bank site.

FT  03 APR 93 / British Gas in Argentine oil talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas and YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company, are negotiating
the possibility of jointly exploring and developing offshore gas and
oilfields bordering the Falkland islands' territorial waters.
A British Gas executive yesterday confirmed that 'we have been discussing
with YPF a number of possible joint ventures. There is an offering in the
South Atlantic and we have discussed the possibility of joining up with YPF,
but there is nothing formal yet.'
The government plans to sell rights to six blocks in Argentine waters
adjacent to Falkland waters. A tender was scheduled for last Wednesday, but
YPF requested it be postponed for 90 days after British Gas had asked for
more time to analyse technical data.
A government official said no other companies were interested in the region
because of the dispute with Britain over the Falkland islands. None the
less, two companies are carrying out seismic exploration surveys off the
Falklands under licences issued by the islands.
Buenos Aires is anxious to increase British trade and investment, which it
hopes would allay the Falklands' suspicion of Argentina and create
commercial ties with Britain that would offset the vociferous pro-Falkland
lobby in London.
British Gas already produces oil in Argentina and last December bought a 29
per cent share in the privatised Buenos Aires gas distribution company.
UK plans to invite Argentine ministers to Britain later this year have been
welcomed in Buenos Aires.

THE MOST spectacular finds from the exciting excavations over the last
quarter-century at Akrotiri on Thera (Santorini) in the Aegean have been the
3,500-year-old wall paintings.
Preserved by the ash when the volcanic island erupted in the Late Bronze
Age, they reveal an undreamt of sophistication in the life of the rich
island town coupled with a keen eye for nature. Restoration is continuing of
the pictures of marine scenes, rites of passage for the young men, swallows
in spring, monkeys, antelopes, and women gathering saffron.
The smart woman above has still to be fitted into a larger composition. She
appears in The Wall-paintings of Thera by Christos Doumas (The Thera
Foundation, Pounds 39, 191 pages), which illustrates all the fabulous
pictures recovered to date with a wealth of stunning photographs - a treat
of a book.

FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rathbone hits a record Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATHBONE Brothers, the private banking and asset management group which
operates in London and Liverpool, reported record 1992 pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.08m, an increase of 31 per cent on 1991's Pounds 3.12m.
Turnover was up 25 per cent at Pounds 14.97m (Pounds 11.92m), thanks partly
to the acquisition of Framlington's private clients and three independent
investment managers in Liverpool joining the company with their clients'
portfolios.
There is no final dividend. However, befitting its role as a specialist in
financial and tax planning, Rathbone declared a second interim last week to
ensure its payment yesterday, thus beating the Budget, which will cut tax
relief on dividends paid after April 6. The second interim of 4.5p compares
with last year's final dividend of 3.5p. The year's total is 6p (5p).
Earnings per share were 16.07p (13.31p).
Mr Michael Bryant, deputy chairman, said 1993 was shaping well, with
word-of-mouth among investors a potent source of new business. 'With
interest rates coming down so much, the balance of private client interest
is shifting to equity markets. People are looking for long term growth,' he
added.

<TEXT>
THE FORMER Soviet republic of Azerbaijan declared a state of emergency
yesterday, after gains by Armenian forces in battles just inside Azerbaijani
territory, agencies report.
President Abulfaz Elchibey ordered a curfew and travel restrictions, and
banned political activity that might destabilise the situation. The
emergency would apply throughout Azeri territory for three months.
Mr Elchibey had earlier sent a message to the Russian and US presidents, and
called on democratic nations to denounce the Armenians as aggressors.
An Azeri defence ministry spokesman said Armenian forces had captured 25
villages in western Azerbaijan and reached the regional centre of
Kelbadzhar. He said the Armenians were fighting inside the town limits.
More than 2,500 people have been killed in five years of Azeri-Armenian
fighting, the deadliest and longest conflict in the former Soviet Union.
Most of the unrest has been near the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh,
but fighting has often spilled into border regions of the two states.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN SERBS yesterday defied pressures to accept the peace settlement
proposed by international mediators, heightening the risk of further
conflict in the former Yugoslav republic.
The self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, called to a special session at
Bileca, spurned a resolution that would have allowed conditional acceptance
of the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The resolution, proposed by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
was branded by deputies as 'too moderate'. It was cast aside without a vote.
Mr Karadzic had poured scorn on the map proposed by the mediators, Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But
he argued that the boundaries proposed were 70-80 per cent acceptable.
He called for direct talks between the three warring parties in Bosnia to
reduce the disputed territory to 10 per cent. It was not worth 'killing each
other' over such a small area, he said.
'By this resolution we do not accept the maps,' Mr Karadzic argued. 'What we
are saying is: peace yes, talks yes, but the maps not yet.'
But unconvinced, the deputies formed a commission to reword the resolution
in stiffer terms for today's session.
The Serb forces occupy 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, hundreds of
thousands of Moslems having fled or been expelled from their homes.
Mr Karadzic warned of the probable consequences of a negative vote by the
Bosnian Serb parliament on the Vance-Owen plan.
It was likely to lead to sharper sanctions, arming the outgunned Moslem
forces, and even to foreign military intervention, he said.
In a move to put pressure on the Serbs to sign the peace plan, the UN
Security Council on Wednesday had approved a resolution to allow Nato
warplanes to shoot down aircraft flouting a five-month-old ban on flights in
Bosnian airspace.
Nato permanent representatives agreed in Brussels yesterday to send US,
British, French and Dutch fighters to enforce the no-fly zone.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the plans to send the
warplanes would be ready less than two weeks from now.
Sarajevo Radio reported 'bitter fighting' yesterday around Srebrenica, the
besieged Moslem town in eastern Bosnia. It claimed that Serb forces launched
artillery, tank and mortar barrages against the town. The radio said
government forces repelled a Serb infantry attack.
Elsewhere in Bosnia, a five-day-old ceasefire held with only minor
violations, though snipers were reported to have killed one person and
wounded four in Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norwegian foreign minister, announced in
Oslo he had agreed to take over from Mr Vance as the UN peace mediator on
the former Yugoslavia, joining Lord Owen, the European Community
representative.
The minister will probably take up the job at the end of this month, after
the peace negotiations have moved back to Geneva from New York.

FT  03 APR 93 / Businessmen who bore for Europe: Dominic Lawson asks why
employees of multi-nationals care so little for their democratic birthright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE always enjoyed talking to businessmen. About business, that is. When
people know what they are talking about, it always pays to listen and learn.
But when businessmen get on to politics, they tend to divide into two
categories, neither of them edifying or instructive.
On the one hand there are the saloon bar bar gin-and-it bores whose views
are indistinguishable from the traditional taxi-driver's, but without the
pithy articulacy of the cockney cabbie.
On the other hand there are those businessmen, normally employees of very
big companies, whose political views, such as they are, seem to be entirely
conditioned by their corporation's business objectives. As individual
citizens they have virtually no political views at all.
One can see this most clearly in the debate over the Maastricht Treaty on
European Union (to give it its proper name). Almost limitless seem to be the
articles by businessmen denouncing notions of sovereignty as 'sentimental',
and demanding the speedy implementation of moves towards European currency
and political union.
They think, with their employee's hat on, that it will make running their
business so much simpler. No need to hedge against nasty foreign exchange
risks in the European market, no need to bribe, sorry, wine and dine, lots
of silly ministers, when you will only have to br . . . wine and dine one
commissioner in Brussels. And thus they are quite happy, as citizens of one
country, to sign away the absolute right to vote in or out of office those
who decide how much tax they will pay, those who decide what battles their
armed forces will fight.
It is, I suspect, no accident, that the businessmen who have such a limited
vision of political morality tend to be managers in multi-national
corporations. They spend so much of their time flying from one time zone to
another, living off airline food, staying at hotels of truly international
colourlessness, talking only to other people with the same way of life, that
they have quite lost a sense of the intrinsic differences between countries.
Business class air-conditioning has frozen their synapses and jet lag has
entered their souls.
The Confederation of British Industry, increasingly dominated by the larger
multinational companies, has become particularly addled. It was almost
comical, and certainly tragic, how that organisation loudly and persistently
defended the notion that sterling should not be allowed to fall below
DM2.78, even as that rate was demolishing the earnings of its members and
the domestic interest rates required to support the rate were becoming
politically unsustainable. And all was justified because this havoc was
deemed essential to keep Britain on the fabled 'fast train to Europe.'
ICI had been a particular supporter of this doomed policy, and it was hard
to stomach its chairman's recent statement, as the company laid off 4,000,
to the effect that the newly competitive pound would help to restore its
business opportunities. If I was one of those 4,000 I would have liked to
see Sir Denys Henderson next to me in the queue at the Jobcentre. His
company was at it again last week. An article by ICI's chief economist, one
Richard Freeman, in the Evening Standard, went under the strap line 'The
benefits of a complete Single European Market are too large to be put at
risk by sentiments about UK sovereignty.' Freeman showed he is not
sentimental about sovereignty. The 'S' word appeared only once in an article
of about 1,500 words.
As Lord Stoddart responded next day: 'How well it shows that big business is
more concerned with profit than democracy, freedom and self-government. It
is surely no coincidence that it is big business in Hong Kong which is
opposed to Mr Patten's democratic reforms and big business here in Britain
that wishes to give away to remote institutions those democratic freedoms we
have left.'
We should not be unjust. Perhaps we have left out a third category of
businessman, who is neither a saloon bar bore, nor a deracinated jobsworth.
He is the one who knows that the drive towards European federalism is
unworkable but is damned if he is going to stick his neck out and say so in
public. As has been said before now, capital is a coward.

<TEXT>
MY FAX line to Beverly Hills ran scalding hot on Tuesday following a mix-up
over Emma Thompson's acceptance speech at the Oscar ceremonies. You will
have read of Emma's tremendous victory in the best actress category. What
you will not know is that four hours previously, at the behest of three of
her agents, I had faxed to Los Angeles a snappily-written victory speech,
intended as a substitute for the dozen versions her agents had commissioned
 -and rejected.
But my speech never reached her. I expect that one of her agents read it and
tossed it on the floor as too imponderably British. Which means that my
agent is now arguing with her agents about my payment. It was a sly little
speech. Here it is in full:
'Oh, golly] Oh, crumbs]
'I have to say at once that I am tremendously and deeply chuffed at the
sheer unexpectedness of this humbling yet thrilling award. I mean, it's all
so unexpected. Yet wonderfully, thrillingly nice.
'Let me catch my breath. Gosh, but this is exciting] I mean, I didn't know
what to wear, and I haven't written a speech. I feel so unprepared, but
deeply and movingly grateful.
'In a sense, I suppose, this glorious Oscar isn't just for me but for all my
fellow actresses, wherever they may be. Indeed, for women everywhere. I know
you'll have heard it before - I mean, I don't want to bore you, we're
running late as it is - but in a wonderfully meaningful sense this little
Oscar, this blissful statuette - God, but it's heavy, it's so unexpected, I
can't begin to tell you - is an award for the fairer sex everywhere, in all
global trouble spots. Bosnia springs to mind. Peru and Patagonia. Canada, of
course. All the women in China, Burma, too, I suppose. To all women
everywhere I say - your day has yet to dawn.
'Which brings me, rather neatly, to the vehicle for my award tonight, dear
old Howards End. How long ago it seems now. What super, super fun] And
testimony, I should say, to the gumption and boundless energy with which we
Brits - our wonderful directors, our cameramen and actors, the women who do
the make-up, the women who make the tea - are still able to rally when it
comes to making films.
'I mean, we don't have a film industry. In fact, we don't have any industry.
Our shipbuilding's disappeared, and our car-making, too. Nobody's buying our
porcelain and our coalminers are down the drain. It's all gone up in smoke,
you know, which is such a desperate tragedy. Talk about gloom and doom]
'But we still have our wits, and all our marvellous craftspeople, and we
still make wonderful films. We just sort of do it. I mean, we just stand
there and do it without any help from the government or any money at all or
any sort of encouragement. It's absolutely brilliant, you know, the way we
still make films, our little entertainments, our Shakespeare and our
Dickens, not forgetting Trollope, all of it done on a shoestring, but with
integrity and love.
'Gosh, I'm rabbiting on, but I'm starting to enjoy myself. I mean, it's all
so unexpected. Am I really here? You mean I've won an Oscar? Oh, knickers
and hockey-sticks]
'Which brings me to cinema violence. I do think, you know, that violence in
the cinema has gone totally over the top. Which is why I've told my agents:
I will not do violence or sex] I mean, our wonderful profession has got more
to offer, surely, than gels stripping off because some producer says so, or
buckets and buckets of blood. I mean, we have got to think of the children,
and of all the people in prison. There's more to life than money, you know -
just look at this horrible dress] I have a little motto: if a thing is worth
doing, it is worth keeping your clothes on - or words to that effect.
'Which brings me to population. And plans to restart whaling - what a
tragedy that would be. And of course the ozone layer. And our water's
running out. And mass starvation. And people selling arms. And trade wars
starting up. And of course the Japanese. I know they own the studios, but
they don't own you and me. And hamburgers and cattle and the slaughter of
all the species. And nuclear reactors. Our poor weary planet]
'There is a man waving me off, now. So I guess I have got to go. Musn't
outstay your welcome, Em] Love you, love you, love you . . . ]'

FT  03 APR 93 / Interview: Trial separation from a claustrophobic God -
After seven years as a nun, Karen Armstrong turned her back on the Catholic
heirarchy. Now she has rediscovered her faith in a different kind of deity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY YEARS ago, Karen Armstrong got married. She borrowed some white
winklepickers and cut her hair with rusty scissors. She vowed to give
everything to her groom and she struggled with the relationship for seven
years, striving to obey, humiliating herself, even whipping her own flesh in
an attempt to become more obedient.
The marriage ended in divorce as Armstrong, by then ill with undiagnosed
epilepsy, began to doubt if her groom existed at all. Now well again, and
writing books in a pleasant little house in the north London suburb of East
Finchley, she has just finished the biography of her ex-husband, whom she
thought she had lost forever. Yet, in researching The History of God, she
has found 'Him' again.
Armstrong joined her strict Roman Catholic order as a novice nun of just 17.
As the 1960s swung outside, she was on her hands and knees wearing scratchy
underpants, engaged in a search for the supreme being. She says: 'At
adolescence, when you are so bogged down in misery about your own
confusions, the idea of losing yourself in God and finding an enhanced self
seemed enormously attractive.'
Instead of losing herself, she found she was confronted endlessly by her own
inadequacies. 'The convent made us so concerned about ourselves, there was
no way we could have a religious experience.'
If the search for God in the convent was painful, life outside was even
worse. 'It was hard, because people assumed it would be great to be out. But
I was just sick with grief, and very ill for about six years. I was grieving
the loss of God, of me, of a whole life.'
In leaving the convent to study English at Oxford, she traded one
claustrophobic institution for another. 'I found Oxford was a highly unkind
society, where distinguished academics sat around bitching about each
other.' In spite of her dismissiveness, the university has left its mark:
her intense manner, antique furniture, books, black leggings and the
Cuban-heel boots tell more of the stylish intellectual than the ex-nun.
After a few years outside, she gave up Catholicism and started to think of
herself as an atheist. 'It was a great relief to be rid of the big brother
noting your every failure. A god who is organising Bosnia, the Sudan,
Somalia - frankly, I don't want to know anything about him or her.' Faced
with cruelty around her both on a big and a small scale, she became obsessed
with the need for kindness. 'Over the years, compassion became more and more
central to me,' she says, managing to sound neither goody-goody nor pompous.
Yet, after steeping herself in 4,000 years of man's thoughts on God, she
found she remains a believer. She rejects much of Christianity and is
opposed vehemently to anything that smacks of doctrine or idolatry.
Nowadays, she describes her self as a 'freelance monotheist.'
The research for her book showed her that the quest for a supreme being was
flawed at the outset. To her surprise, she says she found that all the
wisest thinkers in Christianity, Judaism and Islam had reached the same
conclusion independently: that God is not - contrary to popular belief - an
objective reality at all.
'God is an experience of something larger. It is not just within - it is
something beyond. The religions are an endless dance between an immanence
and a transcendence, something that pulls us beyond our little prejudices
and which offer a challenge.' This transcendence struck her first when she
was reading TS Eliot and John Donne as a teenager. 'Poetry and music did it
for me. A sense of something beautiful, just out of reach.'
That sense now comes to her through study, and she likens herself to the
black-coated Jews who stand muttering over their prayer books. It is just as
well she likes study, as she has much ahead: in conversation, almost every
fresh subject suggests a theme for a future book. Once she has finished
writing about the ordination of women, she plans to tackle the rise of
fundamentalism world-wide, the role of women in religion, and a history of
religious fanatics in the US.
She says the point of religion is to hold us in a state of wonder. It should
help us to ask questions: the problems arise when it starts to answer them.
'A lot of religion crowds out that wonder by giving doctrinal answers that
explain everything. Who is God?' Impatiently, she rattles off catechisms
learnt as a child as if they were, self-evidently, nonsense. 'One of the
mistakes of western Christianity is to put so much emphasis on extraordinary
doctrines about God somehow being three in one, and on lengthy creeds about
the resurrection and life everlasting.'
Most people - she says 99 per cent of Americans and two-thirds of Britons
claim to believe in God - remain stuck with a notion of Him learnt in
childhood. 'Our ideas of other disciplines become more sophisticated as we
grow up, but most people's ideas of God - including those of atheists - have
remained at that infantile level.'
Having shunned the 'multifarious and bizarre things' that Christianity
expects people to believe, Armstrong has picked her own beliefs from
different religions at different times. A bit of Greek Orthodoxy here, some
Buddhism there, and a sprinkling of mysticism over everything. She also
admires Islam. 'In the Moslem creed, there is no divinity but God and
Mohammed is the prophet. That's it,' she says, approvingly.
'A cross-fertilisation of ideas is now just what is needed to give tired old
monotheism a shot in the arm. Now, in the 20th century, you do not have to
be a Jew or Christian just because you were born in Europe. We have
discovered through better communications that all these religions have been
doing the same thing. They will talk about God, or they will not, but the
experience and the ideals are pretty much the same.'
Yet, Armstrong is not optimistic: the rise of fundamentalism in all three
religions shows people digging themselves deeper into their narrow trenches.
She does not notice the western church looking outside for fresh ideas. 'The
churches, as a whole, have a great deal of re-thinking to do. Look at all of
them quarrelling about the ordination of women - where is their compassion
for a suffering world?'
Throughout the discussion, it is to the issue of compassion that she returns
constantly. This, she says, is the acid test of all religions; without it, a
religion has failed. 'All the great religions of the world have found that
the ability to integrate your religious experience with normal mundane life,
and become more compassionate, is what matters.'
Had she known all this three decades ago, might she have stayed in the
convent? Armstrong shakes her head, emphatically. She believes some people
are natural nuns - but not her. It was not that convent life was unendurably
hard, nor that she was expected to behave as a submissive Victorian woman.
(She joined just before the Second Vatican Council swept away some of the
repressive practices that she refers to, politely, as 'clutter').
One problem was celibacy. 'It's the loneliness. That is the side of celibacy
that is hard. Even though you are in the middle of a community, you are
deeply alone.' Another was having to live with a group of people she had not
chosen. 'In the convent, there were some nuns who did not love people but
who loved the cat. They had started grabbing back little satisfactions to
take the place of big things. I knew that would happen to me.'
Apparently, many other inmates reached the same conclusion: there was an
exodus from the convents in the 1960s and 1970s, and many of the orders -
like hers - set up to do good works have had to re-define their role. 'A lot
of the so-called good works are now performed by the state. The orders that
are getting the same number of vocations are the contemplative orders. They
are doing very well.'
She thinks those kind of orders will always do well. In delving into the
past 4,000 years, she has found religious communities seeding themselves in
all ages and all societies. 'There always have been, and always will be,
people that have the need and the talent for contemplation, just as there
are people who are going to want to write poetry or become musicians.'
If not a contemplative, then, was she just an escapee from the real world?
She looks impatient. 'There is too much unhealthy concentration on motives.
We are all drop-outs. Marriage can be a great selfish act of dropping out.
Some people put up the net curtains and shut the world out.' Although she
has never been married, she makes the observation without bitterness. 'I
still live alone because I am that kind of person. I suppose I am still
looking for something. I went into a convent looking for something and here
I am, at the grand old age of nearly 50, still writing books about God.'
Surely, though, she is nearer her destination now? Not at all. Perhaps it is
more a case of having found her means of transport. 'Buddha said that
questions about the ultimate reality were improper. The most he could say
was that there is a shore on the other side of the river and give you a raft
to take you over. That is what religion should be.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Essay in diversity - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SZYMANOWSKI'S Stabat mater (1925-6) and Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin (1926)
are unlikely components of the same concert programme. Both were written
during the same decade, and both employ a chorus (the Bartok confines its to
a brief passage of wordless humming) and a large modern orchestra.
Otherwise, their attributes could not be more dissimilar: the Szymanowski
prayer a rapt re-discovery of an 'archaic', specifically Polish quality of
spiritual intensity, the Bartok ballet-score a penny-dreadful tale of urban
violence clothed in luridly colourful musical modernism.
It was, therefore, the special, splendid achievement of Simon Rattle and his
City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus to make such a success - in
part and sum equally - of their inclusion in Thursday's concert at the
London Festival Hall. The planning was aided, of course, by the larger
thematic concerns of the South Bank series enclosing the event: this was the
latest on the 'Toward the Millennium' schedule, which is currently focusing
on all the diverse, complex and often wildly contradictory musical of the
1920s.
A pointed essay in extreme diversity was, indeed, what we were given: along
with Bartok and Szymanowski, Busoni's subtly piquant New Classicism was also
represented (by two instrumental sections from the opera Doctor Faust) and
Sibelius's final refinement of the late-Romantic symphonic ideal (by the
Seventh Symphony).
But mainly it was the extraordinarily unstinted advocacy of Rattle and the
profoundly musical playing and singing of his Birmingham forces that
achieved appropriate weight and balance in each of the concert's sharply
contrasted items. On this occasion, the Bartok particularly exposed a
shortage of fibre in string tone; it could also be argued - but not, I hope,
too stringently - that Rattle's enthusiasm for the glorious 'arrival' of the
Sibelius finale was advertised a degree too early and too obviously. Between
soulless international-orchestral virtuosity and the kind of impassioned
commitment to musical meaning on offer here, there has seldom seemed a
greater or more illuminating difference.

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Singer at the top - Andrew Clark talks to Jose van
Dam, an artist in control of his destiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Salzburg Easter Festival opens tonight, one of the few surviving
links with its past will be Jose van Dam, who sings the title role in Luca
Ronconi's new production of Verdi's Falstaff. For nearly 20 years, van Dam
was the favourite bass-baritone of the festival's founder, Herbert von
Karajan. That did not stop him turning down invitations from Karajan to take
on roles he considered unsuitable. Nor has it prevented van Dam finding
favour with Karajan's successors.
Sir Georg Solti, who conducts Falstaff and has been the Easter Festival's
artistic director since 1990, chose him for last year's recording of Die
Frau ohne Schatten - even though van Dam did not want to sing the role of
Barak in the festival stage production. His Belgian compatriot Gerard
Mortier, the new broom at the Summer Festival, engaged him at the Monnaie in
Brussels throughout the 1980s, and built last year's Salzburg production of
Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise around him.
Now 52, van Dam is at the summit of his career. After more than 30 years in
the profession, his smooth, well-coloured voice is still in perfect
condition. He is equally at ease in the lyric bass roles of Massenet, Gounod
and Verdi, as in heldenbariton parts like the Dutchman and Hans Sachs. He is
a master at marrying text to music so that it makes sense. Despite his
modest physical stature, he is a commanding presence on stage, because of
the conviction he brings to each role. Van Dam is what the French call un
homme de bon sens - he has his feet on the ground in a profession where it
is easy to get carried away.
The clearest evidence of this is the astute control he has exercised over
his vocal development: he has never sung a role which was beyond his means.
He attributes this partly to instinct, partly to the influence of his
teacher, the late Frederic Anspach, and also to his own understanding of
voice and technique. 'A teacher can only give you so much. When you're on
stage, you're alone. You yourself have to know what you can and can't do,
and that means knowing your own voice. Many people will say 'You must sing
this role', but only you can judge if it's possible. You have to have that
confidence and knowledge.'
Van Dam made his professional debut at the Paris Opera aged 20. The next 12
years were spent as an ensemble member in Paris, Geneva and Berlin's
Deutsche Oper. He sang Masetto before moving on to Leporello in Don
Giovanni, tried out Paolo and Fiesco before tackling the title role in Simon
Boccanegra, observed experienced Germans singing Sachs from the vantage
point of Kothner. For his debuts at the Met, La Scala and Covent Garden
(under Solti) in the early 1970s, he sang Escamillo. To other French roles
like Golaud he brings a native speaker's understanding of what he calls
'this typically French line of song'. He has kept clear of 'belting' roles
like Telramund and Luna, and is only now debating whether to sing Wotan. He
is more suited to thoughtful, philosophical parts than buffo - though his
Figaro was always beautifully sung. His next new role is Scarpia, but he
talks of retiring from the stage and devoting himself to recitals and
teaching.
That leaves little hope for British admirers, who will have to be satisfied
with a single Wigmore Hall recital next year. His last appearance at Covent
Garden was in 1986. Why the long absence? Van Dam pins the blame on the
previous Royal Opera management of Sir John Tooley. After two visits as
Escamillo, he was asked back to sing the same role. 'I said if I was offered
another contract alongside Escamillo, I would come. But they didn't offer
anything. It was quite a few years before I was invited back for Wozzeck and
Salome. Now my diary is full till 1996. It's a pity - I always had good
experiences there. The people know how to work, and my wife and I like
London.'
Which makes a stark contrast to the Bastille in Paris, where van Dam says
the acoustic is poor and the atmosphere dreadful. 'It's so badly managed -
they have three or four chiefs running round at the same time, to no
purpose. Chung (the Bastille's young Korean music director) is too
inexperienced to have responsibility for such a huge operation. How can he
know which singers are suitable for each role?
'They've spent all that money on a building which doesn't even resemble a
theatre - it's more like a tube station. The Met in New York may be big, but
at least the acoustic is good. The problem with the Met is that the work is
uninteresting. All through my career I've said that wherever I go there must
be some bait - either artistic or financial. At the Met you have neither.
They're more concerned with show than music. It's the same at the Bastille:
the priority is to fill seats.
'Of course, if I was well paid, I admit I would go for the money. But when
the rewards are so small, the best thing is to stay away.'
Van Dam's professional satisfaction comes increasingly from recording rarely
performed French operas and from song recitals. He learns the text and music
separately - reciting the words like a poem, whistling the vocal line -
before bringing them together. Adjusting to the disciplines and repertoire
of the recital hall has not been easy, 'but you don't make this sort of
career in order to live simply. My belief is that if you're an artist, you
have to deny yourself the easy path. It's part and parcel with being an
artist. If you only take the easy path, you never move forwards, you don't
give art the chance to develop. If there's no struggle, there's little point
doing it.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Springboard for 'Somewhere'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER the aegis of its Springboards Festival, the National Theatre is
staging a series of new plays at its own Cottesloe Theatre, in collaboration
with the Royal Court Upstairs and Bush Theatres in London, and with studios
at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the
Salisbury Playhouse. This welcome association comprises nine plays, and
continues until July. Springboards opens at the Liverpool Playhouse Studio
with Somewhere by Judith Johnson.
The series looks diverse and exciting, and should be a fillip for new
writing. The regional work will arrive in April and May at the Cottesloe
sure of a venue; while in Leicester and Liverpool, where two of the plays
open, the productions will have the prospect and purpose of a London run.
At Liverpool, Somewhere is an affecting, discursive play about the effects
of the 1980s on people now. It opens on school leaving day, when the role
models were Sid Vicious and Debbie Harry, and when every cigarette was
clamped between thumb and second finger and smoked with an anarchic squint.
The music was Punk and the tattoos, like the entertainment, home-made.
The play follows a group of teenagers through a month's partying, and fixes
on the loose relationship between Dawn, a strong, wild girl revelling in her
capacity to shock, and Lee, a quiet manic likely to burst into violence.
Around them are victims, co-dependents and one Thatcherite - 'I want to be
an entrepreneur, me.' Lee becomes a soldier throughout the 1980s, demobbed
after Desert Storm; Dawn becomes a prostitute in King's Cross and now
Amsterdam, where the two meet ten years on in a brothel, still in love.
Somewhere tries to uncover the past while developing a situation in the
present. The balance is not yet right, tilted more toward reminiscence -
fine 1980s retrospective - than current interchange. Perhaps a larger
theatre and a revolving stage would juxtapose past and present more starkly.
Since no plot imposes a structure on the piece, the pacing of scenes is
crucial. Here, the lighting (Mark Rickards) and the direction (Polly Teale)
could drive the action faster and focus it sharper. The simple, strong
staging works well in the studio space: a lounge becomes a park and a
coffee-table a coffin within a wire fence set.
Johnson's dialogue is funny, brash, bawdy and clever, but it leaves too
little unsaid. However, she has written two fine strong parts for Katrina
Levon (Dawn) and John Hannah (Lee); both act them with power and conviction,
and it is these performances which carry the play. Other highlights include
Karl Draper as a sad thug too timid to leave his home town and Ian Dunn as
Barry the barman, now the nightclub entrepreneur he always dreamed of
becoming.
Liverpool Playhouse Studio until April 17; Cottesloe Theatre, London from
April 24 to May 15. Information about Springboards on 071-633-0880

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Macbeth with no scruples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACBETH has often been said to be the most bourgeois of Shakespeare's
tragedies. Unlike Hamlet, the central figure was not born to be king. The
Scottish court is not a patch on that of Denmark: there are no strolling
players, no intellectuals, passing through. Unlike Othello, there is not
even a touch of exoticism, unless you count the witches. The bard's view of
life in Scotland is decidedly grim, like that of many people who have never
been north of Stratford, and in the end it is England that has to come to
the rescue by supplying 10,000 troops. On the other hand, Macbeth is a
gripping tale with some wonderful poetry thrown in.
The new production at the Royal National Theatre is an odd mix. Richard
Eyre, the director, accepts the bourgeois nature of the play by reducing the
famous banquet, attended by Banquo's ghost, to a dinner party for eight. It
looks more like a scene from Harley Granville-Barker than Shakespeare. He
also makes Lady Macbeth (Anastasia Hille) unusually young, but otherwise a
woman without much distinction. It is no disrespect to Ms Hille's playing to
say that this Lady Macbeth is out of her depth very early on. She plays the
sleep-walking scene well enough, but the prime mover in Eyre's production is
clearly meant to be the husband, not the wife egging him on.
The husband is Alan Howard. The trouble with at least the first half of his
performance is that he seems to be playing Claudius, not Macbeth. He never
really has scruples. When he says 'Wake Duncan with they knocking] I would
thou couldst]' the line comes across more as a joke that a stab of remorse.
When he gives orders to the murderers, one is reminded inescapeably of
Claudius instructing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to take Hamlet to England.
In a more sophisticated court, he would have a Polonius to assist him.
Howard develops as he goes on. He speaks the 'tomorrow and tomorrow and
tomorrow' lines as movingly as I have ever heard them. It is the yesterdays
that are the problem.
There are other weaknesses. Robin Bailey's Duncan is a wholly conventional
figure who does not even make a pass at Lady Macbeth. It is a curious act of
national deference that English productions accept Duncan the king, however
dim, as someone close to sainthood. He must have had some defects. The
witches are not much to write home about either: pretty straightforward,
nothing like the Schiller Theater production that came to the Mermaid.
Yet there are also strengths. The Banquo murder in the dark is a suitably
effective scuffle and the production moves swiftly into the ensuing dinner
party. Eyre is good at table scenes. The breakfast with Lady Macduff and her
three children with cereals, brown bread and boiled eggs looks like a scene
from a more modern play, but is no less dramatic for that. Nicola Redmond as
Lady Macduff is an impressive, outspoken Scottish matron who would make a
good mother to Coriolanus. James Laurenson as Macduff puts some depth into
the character when he tries to suppress his grief at the killing of his
family. Until Macbeth gives way to fatalism, these are the best scenes in
the production which is sponsored by the RNT's private contributors.
Richard Eyre wrote in his book Utopia and Other Places that no Shakespeare
play can be properly performed with less that 15 actors. His theory can be
put to the test by going to the Battersea Arts Centre where there is another
production of Macbeth with a cast of only five. The Red Shift Company has
dispensed with the witches and the other superstitious bits altogether on
the grounds that no-one believes in witches any more. The subtraction does
not diminish the play, which is done a modern dress thriller, and I only
realised how few actors there were at the end. It depends, I suppose, on how
many times you have seen Macbeth and what you want, but I know this week
which production I found the more interesting.

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Good, bad and smudgy - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A movie on video cassette always looks better than it is, but is somehow
less interesting, whereas in the cinema films often look worse than they
are, but are more interesting. You figure it out.' Gore Vidal, quoted in
'Films On Video: The Essential 100', a Sight And Sound Magazine special
supplement.*
Dear Gore, I've already figured it out. Like many of your apercus it isn't
true, but it is interestingly untrue. It is the remark - pardon me - of a
literate humanist and an audio-visual philistine.
Movies on video look 'better' in the sense that by snipping screen ratios
and blurring pictorial values they direct the viewer's attention almost
exclusively onto the main characters and what they are saying or doing.
Ergo: the story becomes all foreground and no background. It may seem to
have more momentum - even more 'style' - while being less interesting
graphically and subtextually.
Correspondingly, a film on the large screen can 'look worse' to someone
fixated merely on that character interaction. (All those square feet of
otiose countryside in John Ford])
Am I being fair? Please get back to me if you think not. Respectfully, NA
I was roused to this open letter not just by Mr V's remark but by the place
where it was quoted. Sight And Sound's '100 Best' is a good news/bad news
enterprise. The good news is that it is a priceless guide to the best
classics now available on cassette: everything from Broken Blossoms to
Raging Bull via B. Keaton, S. Eisenstein, O. Welles and B. Bertolucci. Short
credits and appraisals accompany each film; mini-essays offer guidance to
different decades and genres.
But the bad news: no one warns you what kind of experience to expect.
Critics usually obtain good copies of videos. (So, I imagine, does Mr
Vidal). But the average punter can be in quite a different boat. Sticking
his pole where'er he can in the video-market waters, he either pulls it up
to discover a lot of mud and weeds, or he cannot pull it up at all and falls
into the river.
The second experience is common. Few video stores stock anything resembling
Sight And Sound's august pantheon. 'La Regle Du Jeu, sir? Does that star
that Chuck Norris or Jean-Claude Van Damme?' So the punter, especially if he
lives far from London or other major cities, tumbles headlong into the
compulsive, hopeless, finally drowning search for That Video.
Then again he might not want the video when he does find it. Last week at a
major London store I bought a copy of a Famous John Ford Film (Pounds 5.99,
Video Collection). When I played it, expecting two hours of pictorial
uplift, I could not believe what I saw. Filthy, mud-dredged colours; fuzzy
resolution; muffled sound. John Wayne was, I think, that pink blob swaying
across screen from left to right; and that chestnut-coloured mass beneath
him could have been a horse, then again it could have been Maureen O'Hara.
We began with a letter, so let us end with one.
Dear Sight And Sound, We greatly appreciate your attention to video in
general and your new library-building supplement in particular. But as a
monitor of our screen culture, you should be more conscientious in warning
readers about how debased the video experience can be in the hands of some
modern video companies. Why should the customer put up with sound and
picture quality that is often far worse in over-the-counter cassettes than
in recordings he makes at home from his own TV? Thank you. NA
Just time for a postscript on the new releases. Highly commended: Terence
Davies's dazzling elegy to a British childhood The Long Day Closes (Curzon).
Commended: Ghosts Of The Civil Dead (Electric), menacing avant-garde tale of
hi-tech prison life in Australia. Best reissues: Annie Hall (MGM/UA), The
Manchurian Candidate (MGM/UA), Zero De Conduite (Artificial Eye). And
remember: return all copies that are visually or aurally substandard. I do.

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Exhibition with a mission - Lynn MacRitchie shrugs off
a feeling of dismay to applaud the Whitney Biennial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING at a show like the Whitney Biennial, which opened in New York last
month to howls of protest, is testing for reviewer and gallery goer alike.
After my first visit I came out in despair - so many voices, so many
problems . . .
The Biennial, however, like most large group shows (82 artists are
participating), is best not taken at one gulp. It is the rushed attempt to
form a convenient overview which leads to that feeling of helpless dismay,
the urge to shrug the whole thing off as a gesture by the middle classes to
the dispossessed, or a protest by the blacks or the gays or the feminists or
whoever, got up entirely to make the rest of us, whoever we are, feel bad.
But the show is none of these things. The show is what it is supposed to be,
a selection of contemporary American art, fulfilling the function
established for it by its founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, nearly 60
years ago. Whitney was an artist herself, a sculptor who produced a fine
series of monumental works, including the memorial to the victims of the
Titanic. When in 1931 the Metropolitan Museum in New York rejected her
offered gift of 400 examples of contemporary America art, she decided to
start her own museum to show them. Being the richest woman in the country
made setting up a museum comparatively easy, but being an artist, committed
to supporting her fellow artists in their struggles and ambitions, made the
function of her museum unique.
This year's Biennial, the first under the directorship of David Ross and
with Elizabeth Sussman as curator in charge, has a mission. The majority of
the artists chosen are engaged with political questions, specifically those
of identity and community. This may be because they have been so throughout
their careers - the wall collage 'Mashe Brusinski' by Nancy Spero on the
subject of the identity of a young Jewish woman executed by the Nazis in
Russia in 1941 comes into this category, for example. Or it may be because
for many artists, such as sculptor Pepon Osorio and many others, making
visible the divers cultures which inform their work has become an accepted
part of the artistic process.
Some have seized the opportunity the Whitney invitation provided to offer a
challenge to an audience they believe to be unaware of the circumstances of
their lives - the entry badges by Daniel Martinez printed with 'I can't
imagine ever wanting to be white' come into this 'couldn't resist it'
category. But in a museum where, its director informed me, a distinguished
guest, standing next to him at the opening, was asked the way to the
bathroom by another guest because he happened to be black, a little 'in your
face'-ness is surely forgiveable.
Other works approach their concerns with subtlety. Of the many installations
in the show, one of the most imaginative is by Maureen Connor who has used
lipstick to make accurate models of the voice boxes of three women. Mounted
on slender stands and lit from above, these eerily beautiful sculptures are
displayed in a curtained area, where the viewer may contemplate their
singularity while listening to tapes of three different women making
wordless sounds.
Sue Williams, who paints about pornography, is not subtle, but she is
powerful, and makes good use of the crude graphic style she shares with
Raymond Pettibon, showing a set of drawings. His exploration of the graphics
of the supermarket and the comic book is evolving into a method of dealing
with the most profound issues (religion is one of the subjects of the
Whitney piece) in the most direct way. This commitment to the use of
'degraded' images or the subject matter of adolescent angst, also
demonstrated by Lari Pittman and Mike Kelley, is evolving into a powerful
statement about American culture, pushing through the trash to the feelings
 -raw, hurting, confused - beneath.
An aspect of the show which may console those worried about the impact of
such unusual forms or practices is the strength of its video section. First
included in the Biennial in 1975, video has become one of the most
satisfying of contemporary art forms. Most beautiful of a strong selection
is the installation 'Tall Ships' by Gary Hill. In this wonderful piece,
viewers enter a darkened space where their movements activate a series of
video projectors each of which shows the image of a different person. As the
viewer moves through the space, a series of ghostly figures advances and
retreats.
Hill's piece, which could only exist in the much maligned age of television,
is beautiful, moving and profound, a tribute to an artist's commitment to a
difficult medium and a rebuke to those who maintain that the new or
experimental can never produce art of emotional content and formal
coherence. Those flickering, wordless figures coming closer and then turning
resolutely away seem to sum up the transitory nature of human encounters and
the profound difficulty of ever really knowing the other - an appropriate
and solemn metaphor for a show which attempts to tackle just those issues.
1993 Biennial Exhibition, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison
Avenue, New York, until 13 June.

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Son of 'Heimat' - Screen / Victor Price on director
Edgar Reitz and his second epic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO THE admirable Maria has died at last, and all Schabbach has turned out to
see her off. Eccentric Glasisch has chosen this moment to slip away himself.
By five past one this morning Edgar Reitz's 15-hour epic had drawn to a
close on BBC 2. But Heimat is dead, long live Heimat. Because for the past
eight years Reitz has been working on a sequel, which the same channel will
be showing in weekly episodes, starting on April 17. Fifteen other countries
will be running the film as well.
The Second Heimat, which was premiered at the Venice Biennale and also shown
at last autumn's London Film Festival, takes us back in time to 1960, when
Maria's favourite son Hermann leaves the village to study music at the
Munich Conservatory. We already know from Heimat 1 that he becomes a
well-known composer. Heimat 2 shows us precisely how that comes about.
But, like the first epic, it is more than the story of just one man. It is
the portrait of a whole society, the artistic and bohemian world of the
Bavarian capital in the 1960s, and its 13 episodes have a total running time
of over 25 hours, the longest film ever made. Each of the episodes tells the
story of one of the young artists, students and rebels whose lives intersect
with Hermann's during the decade in question. Reitz calls them the
fatherless generation because their fathers were either killed in the war or
compromised by the Nazi past.
They comprise avant-garde composers, young film-makers, a lonely and
slightly ridiculous philosopher, a poetess turned Baader-Meinhoff terrorist,
a refugee from the GDR and many others. They experience the building of the
Berlin Wall and the assassination of President Kennedy. They experiment with
art, drugs and sex. They live in communes. They get involved in demos. They
do not quite know what they want or where they are going. Some succeed, some
fail.
The thread which holds them loosely together is the career of Hermann,
Reitz's alter ego. And Hermann's destiny is in its turn determined by his
love for the fiercely independent Clarissa, who is wedded to her cello. Both
make unsuccessful marriages before coming together briefly in the final
enigmatic episode, before Hermann withdraws to his native Schubbach, to
wait.
On April 12, BBC2's Arena will be curtain-raising Heimat 2 with a
documentary Edgar Reitz: Return to Heimat, which tells how the second epic
was made. Reitz emerges as a man of endless charm and patience who is
nevertheless uncompromisingly dedicated to his work. To make such a sequence
of films one needs phenomenal stamina: to finance them, one needs both a
genius for negotiation and complete faith in what one is doing.
The Second Heimat is, like its predecessor, freely-handled autobiography.
Reitz uses episodes from his own experience not as an ego-trip but to build
up a valid story. As he creates, the present flows into the past; the
telling of Hermann's love for Clarissa, for instance, has certainly been
influenced by Reitz's own developing relationship with Salome Kammer, the
actress who plays her. The films have been made in chronological sequence,
which has allowed the actors to develop the characters over a span of time.
And four years of intense work together has given the team - and the films
they have made - a rare sense of unity.
Technically Heimat 2 carries on where the first Heimat left off. It is
discreetly original. For example, colour and black-and-white alternate here
too; colour is generally used for night sequences and black-and-white for
day, but not rigidly; it is more a question of the emotional feel of the
scene. Pre-Heimat Reitz was an experimenter, and he can still invent
brilliant shots, as when the camera races over a dozen canteen table-tops to
home in on the young composers gleefully improvising a work for percussion
with cutlery, glasses and the top of a radiator. But such things are used
sparingly; true film, says Reitz, is not about the visible, but the
invisible.
Reitz is a literate, not to say literary film-maker; Heimat 2 puts one in
mind of certain German novels about artists' life in Munich, like Keller's
Green Henry or Hesse's Peter Camenzind. He is a conscious artist, not afraid
to say that his object is to rescue something from death. As this sequence
of films unfolds, in its leisurely, funny, sad and ironic way, it will
become clear that he has achieved just that.

FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Primitive times - Salon de Mars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL

<TEXT>
NO FEWER than 30,000 Parisians turned up last Tuesday for the opening night
of the fifth annual Salon de Mars art fair, spread out as usual under a
huge, white and badly-ventilated tent near the Eiffel Tower. They were
interested in socialising, not buying, and dealers complained that
collectors were unable to squeeze through the crush to the stands. But
recession, competition from other fairs, slow turnover and a dearth of new
items have all taken their toll this year on a Salon which started out
determined to become a big international event.
This year's Salon, which ends on Monday, has only 92 galleries compared with
115 last year and 120 in 1991. It quite simply lacks a lot of top dealers
who used to come - like pre-Columbian expert Galerie Mermoz and antiquities
dealer, Emmanuel Koutoulakis, of Paris, for example, or ancient Chinese art
specialist, Gisele Croes, from Brussels. None of the really big Paris
furniture dealers is present this year and a dozen stands are manned by
French provincial dealers offering the sort of 18th century furniture, much
of it alarmingly well varnished, which the Parisians do far better.
Five British dealers, however, came over for the fair and were content.
'This is more elegant than Grosvenor House. French buyers take far greater
interest in art than the British, they actually know about it and are
prepared to buy it,' one of them said.
Chinese art specialist Michael Goedhuis sold nearly Pounds 90,000 of art on
the first day to an American and two French collectors. His neighbour,
Robert Hall, from London, is showing tiny 18th and 19th century Chinese
snuff bottles, which have become so popular with collectors over recent
years. Carved in a variety of semi-precious materials, they are priced from
a couple of hundred to over Pounds 10,000 - the most expensive one being in
brilliant white and green jade, which the Chinese call 'pine needles in
snow'.
Martyn Gregory, from London, the world's leading gallery dealing in Chinese
coast paintings - mainly 19th century works by anonymous artists in Canton
for export to the West - is over for its first show in Paris. The art
includes highly-imaginative Chinese portraits of a Spanish and a French
couple of 1760 in gouache at Pounds 4,800 a pair, landscapes and even views
of St Helena and Napoleon on his death-bed, inspired by prints, for Pounds
1,100.
The Salon de Mars originally aimed to give pride of place to contemporary
art, but there are only a handful of dealers this year showing many works
which have been seen before elsewhere. In the field of 19th century
paintings, London's Stoppenbach &amp; Delestre were alone this year with
Barbizon school paintings - one Diaz and five Daubigny landscapes at
FFs120,000-300,000 - and watercolours by Harpignies for FFs35,000-90,000.
Mediaeval statuary is beautifully represented by Boccador and Bresset, from
Paris, and the Salon has two leading dealers in the rarified field of top
Art Deco furniture: Paris's Galerie Vallois has an articulated table by
Printz and two lamps made by Muthesius for an Indian maharajah. The Parisian
gallery, Arc en Seine, has a pair of leather armchairs by Ruhlmann, their
shape inspired by an elephant's head, furniture by Jean-Michel Frank and
alabaster lamps by Chareau, which quickly sold.
It is in primitive art that the Salon de Mars is proving strongest, thanks
to dealers such as Dutko, Ratton et Hourde, Monbrison, Dulon, Deletaille and
Guimiot, from Brussels. The latter is showing 14th and 15th century bronze
objects from the Lower Niger and some outstanding wooden Sepik sculptures
from New Guinea - one, a bird-like flute plug, was held to embody the voice
of an ancestor. Anthony Meyer, whose Left Bank Paris gallery, the only one
in Europe specialising in Oceanic art, brought objects such as a Korvar, the
statue of an ancestor wrapped in a scrap of the latter's shroud, and the
sculpture of a mythological hero by the Yimar people, of New Guinea.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LAST WEEK, Radio 3's play alternated the 15th century and the 20th. This
week's, Adam Thorpe's Offa's Daughter, is set in the 9th, though Offa, King
of Mercia, lives in the 8th, from AD 757 to 796. But it is his daughter
Eadburgh we deal with, following her from youth to age. She married, and
murdered, Offa's dependent, the King of Wessex, lacing his goblet with
powdered glass - not intending it for him but for his vassal Felix. When we
meet her in old-age, she is taken for a beggar, her robes and finery all
gone but for a gold ring bearing Offa's likeness.
At Pavia, in Lombardy, she encounters Brother Edward, whom she had known in
Mercia, in charge of a scroll to be carried back there. This actually
happens at the start of the play; the rest of the tale is told to Edward to
win his sympathy. Only one thing matters to her now, to get her faithful
servant Theya, into comfort and clean linen, as she promised when they were
young.
So once again we have these time-shifts, with characters spliced at
different ages. Director Jeremy Mortimer has a useful company: Eadburgh, who
is Sian Phillips at Pavia, is Tara Fitzgerald in her flighty period, an
effective amalgam. Mature Edward is Richard Johnson; Linus Roache his
younger counterpart; Melanie Hudson the servant Theya, who clearly models
herself on her mistress. I have to confess that I do not much like
time-split plays. As listeners wrote to Christopher Dunkley's Feedback last
week, the association of voice with character is one of radio's principal
requisites, and it is a great help if the character remains constant.
Ronald Harwood's The Dresser (Radio 4, Monday) provided a total contrast. It
presents, from offstage, a performance of King Lear, in a provincial theatre
in wartime, played by a touring company under an ageing actor known only as
'Sir'. There is never any doubt about what is going on or who is speaking.
The action is mostly in Sir's dressing-room; as Sir is played by Freddie
Jones (who gave it in the West End in 1980) and his eponymous dresser is
Michael Palin, in his first venture into radio drama, the clarity is ideal.
Adaptation and direction are both by David Blount.
It is not a great play, but very enjoyable, and certainly authentic, for the
author was dresser to Sir Donald Wolfit (who, he insists, was not the model
for Sir). Sir has collapsed on the day of his Lear, and the action covers
the efforts of Norman, his dresser, to restore him to form and see him
through the play whenever there are troubles. Sundry incidents involving
Sir's wife and the theatre company are all resolved by Norman's inventive
loyalty.
Yet Sir dies in his dressing-room after the play, and Norman shows a
touching mixture of affection and resentment at the old actor's ingratitude
for long service.
What with a new biography and a memorial tablet in Poets' Corner, Anthony
Trollope is still with us. Last week Radio 4 began six Wednesday talks by
Richard Mullen, not biography but study of Trollope's reactions to various
facets of his time. The first was about marriage, in which he was involved
fairly early, and this week's dealt with Ireland, where he lived for many
years. Extra liveliness was added by Paul Rogers's playing as Trollope.
Worth following.

MARY RENAULT: A BIOGRAPHY by David Sweetman Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 322
pages
MARY RENAULT - real name Molly Challans - was an English, Oxford-educated,
professional nurse, lesbian, mildly reclusive, who lived in South Africa
from 1948 until her death in 1983 and who wrote a sequence of the most
remarkable and successful historical novels of this century.
As this workmanlike and readable biography shows, she made a difficult
transition from her half-dozen 'contemporary' novels, usually setting
bisexual themes against a hospital background and climaxing in The
Charioteer (surely it cannot be 'the best British novel to come out of World
War Two') to eight novels which are extraordinary in the depth and detail of
their evocation of daily life in ancient Greece - The Last of the Wine, The
King Must Die, The Bull from the Sea, The Persian Boy, etc.
The most surprising thing about this is that she scarcely knew Greece: she
went there on holiday only twice - in 1954 (including a single day in
Crete]) and in 1962 - and appears to have had no particular affection for
its modern manifestation. She was no classicist but she did not shirk her
scholarly research, which evidently was as indispensable to her fictions as
her imaginative genius.
The child of a sad marriage, she had studied at Oxford in the years when
Gilbert Murray was giving his famous lectures and the Ashmolean was
benefiting from the discoveries at Knossos of its former curator, Sir Arthur
Evans. She drifted for years, signed up as a nurse at the Radcliffe, met her
lifelong partner, Julie Mullard, wrote her first novels, worked through the
war, and moved to South Africa (to the suburbs first of Durban and then of
Cape Town), where she was active in the Progressive politics of her adopted
country.
David Sweetman argues that she was consciously aware of a parallel between
the moral decisions offered to private citizens in fifth century Athens and
1950s South Africa, but that hardly seems central to her creative
achievement, where her identification with ancient Greece has something
uncanny and unforgettable to it. She discovered Jung fairly late - 'a most
exhilarating peak-in-Darien feeling' she commented, and added, with true
wit, that the travails of Theseus in The King Must Die should have been
called The Mother Strikes Back.
If this biography has a thesis, it is overstated: that she was 'a key figure
in the sexual revolution of the twentieth century'. True, her portrayal of
homosexuals as central characters in her novels probably helped to change
public and middle-brow attitudes, and she had a cult gay readership,
especially in the US. 'The Last of the Wine was a rite of passage, The
Persian Boy a gift for young male lovers. Gay bookshops in San Francisco had
prominent 'Renault' sections', Sweetman notes. Her books became part of the
curriculum of the new university discipline of Gay Literature. But she was
much more than that: I suspect that her novels will survive, and not just in
the bookshops of California and the tourist kiosks of Crete.
The King Must Die has just been re-issued by Sceptre (Pounds 5.99)

BEYOND THE CULTURE WARS by Gerald Graff W W Norton Pounds 13.95, 244 pages
IN 1985 at Harvard I spent Wednesday mornings at the graduate symposium
denying the existence of authors and texts and Wednesday afternoons teaching
an undergraduate seminar on Melville and the books he wrote. Then, such
schizophrenia could be assuaged by lunch at the Faculty Club. Now, since the
late 1980s, a chasm between theory and practice has opened and become home
to legions of academic settlers.
One of them, Gerald Graff, has written a sane, readable and immensely
stimulating book. Beyond The Culture Wars maps the difficulties which
universities now have in deciding what is to be taught. Old-established
values are challenged, but new ones threaten to fragment the syllabus into
an unwieldy number of subjects.
These disagreements about what should be taught in Humanities faculties
oscillate between extremes. Traditionalists want a collective body of
knowledge to constitute the subject, while radicals want minutely
representative coverage of social and literary diversity, past and present.
Graff's book is an elegant example of the academy outflanking dissent by
making dissent a real subject. Graff calls it 'Teaching the conflicts.'
Beyond The Culture Wars continues a growing tradition of academy watchers.
First was Secretary of State William J. Bennett's 1984 paper 'To Reclaim a
Legacy'; then Allan Bloom's 1987 hit The Closing of the American Mind; the
New York Times and the Washington Post have carried the flame sputtering
into the 1990s. Graff thinks it is time to mediate by meditating.
He makes three observations, born of his experience at Northwestern and
Chicago. First, the curricular malaise results from the communicative
disorders within the academy and between academics and the rest of the
world. Humanists find it risibly easy to see their worst imaginings
realised, and hard enough to understand each other. The Proceedings of the
Modern Language Association (October 1992) offers this: 'Women write from
the breast, with their own fluids for ink . . . the female character puts
the burgeoning male author into an impossible position: he cannot master
what she represents unless he switches gender . . . female metamorphosis
challenges androcentric Bildung.' Que?
Second, Graff tackles the view that the academy is the victim of
multiculturalism. This, George Will claimed (Newsweek, April 22, 1991) is
assaulting 'the common culture that is the nation's social cement.' Why
teach Hawthorne and not Garcia Marquez when 15 per cent of Americans are
Hispanic? Because to cater to minorities meant Black, Korean, Chinese,
Italian and Irish literature on the syllabus; the centre could not hold. In
1984 William Bennett called for 'a clear vision of what is worth knowing and
what is important in our heritage that all educated persons should know.'
Graff highlights the professional dilemma: 'The university is expected to
preserve, transmit and honor our traditions, yet at the same time it is
supposed to produce new knowledge, which means questioning received ideas
and perpetually revising traditional ways of thinking.'
Third, for Graff, nowhere is reading 'innocent'; and since college is not
kindergarten, students should not be sheltered from debates about the
curriculum, but should study them as part of the curriculum. Graff is right
to see debate as a sign of health and longevity.
There have been crises in the humanities before. JH Plumb edited an
excellent 1964 essay collection on the same theme, five years after his
colleague CP Snow's Two Cultures; the tradition goes back to AN Whitehead's
The Aims of Education (1929) and the 1880s science-literature debate between
Matthew Arnold and TH Huxley. In the 19th century, the decline of classics
and in the 18th the rise of science have all altered the shape of the
academy. The academic curriculum derives from political bargaining rather
than commonly shared educational philosophy. Now, under the contraction of
Higher Education funding, there is less, and therefore more, to fight over.
Graff's views work in practice, since discussion benefits from a
juxtaposition or interchange of agenda, and as a teacher it is greater fun
to convene than hector. I evolved a solution to my Harvard dilemma while
teaching at Columbia University in 1989. For a class on Keats' Odes and the
usefulness of the arts I asked students to see Spike Lee's prescient film,
Do The Right Thing, showing that Truth and Beauty are not the only game in
town. It was a thinner solution than lunch at the Faculty Club.

FALLING OFF THE MAP: SOME LONELY PLACES OF THE WORLD by Pico Iyer Cape
Pounds 14.99, 190 pages
NATURAL OPIUM: TRAVELLING TALES by Diane Johnson Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
10.99, 234 pages
TRANQUEBAR: A SEASON IN SOUTH INDIA by Georgina Harding Hodder &amp; Stoughton
Pounds 15.99, 205 pages
YOU can do almost anything under the broad banner of 'travel writing', which
is why travel books continue to churn from the presses, despite the alleged
shrinking of the world into smaller and duller bits. But it helps to have a
theme, and it is the theme of Falling Off The Map - lonely places: the parts
of the world that most people try to avoid - that serves Pico Iyer so well
in his extremely enjoyable book.
For Iyer, lonely places are the ones that do not fit in; that have no seat
at the international dinner table; that fall between the cracks of our tidy
acronyms (EC, Opec, Nato). They are, says Iyer, 'the places that are not on
international wavelengths, do not know how to carry themselves, are lost
when it comes to visitors. They are shy, defensive, curious places; places
that do not know how they are supposed to behave.'
No doubt Australia will object to being categorised in this manner. Iyer
found it 'quiet and unpeopled', the definitive terra incognita, not really
part of the planet. Australia is not quite as eccentric as he makes out, but
perhaps he is right; perhaps it is a lonely place: a seemingly new-born
world still peopled by elemental presences.
The remainder of his choices are far less controversial: North Korea,
Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam and Paraguay. North Korea must be
the strangest place in the solar system. Both South and North Korea are
zany, says Iyer, the difference being that North Korea is so cut off from
the world that it does not know how strange it is and cannot imagine
anything except North Korea.
The second strangest place in the solar system is probably Bhutan. At one of
Bhutan's dzongs - huge whitewashed 17th century fortresses cum monasteries
cum administrative centres - Iyer spoke to one of the students about a Royal
Government of Bhutan truck drawn up outside the gates. The men in the truck
were dog-catchers.
'You see', said the student, 'these dogs do many dirties here.'
'How many live in the dzong?'
'100.'
'100?]'
'Just now they will be taken to the Indian border and let out there.'
'The Indian border] That's seven hours away]'
'Oh, yes, very far.'
Iyer has a perfect ear and eye for oddness, and an intense, original style -
he went to Eton, Oxford and Harvard and is now an essayist for Time, which
must be rather jolly. For his next trick he ought to turn his attention to
John Major's Britain, which for deepening eccentricity is starting to rival
Bhutan.
Diane Johnson's Natural Opium is similar in theme to Iyer's book, though
quite different in tone. She is a novelist and a biographer (of Dashiell
Hammett and Mary Ellen Peacock) who has frequently accompanied her
doctor-husband to unchosen destinations and has attempted to describe the
curious condition of being a traveller.
She writes of China, Cairo, London, St Petersburg, Utah, Agra and the Great
Barrier Reef, always with charm and a quirky eye. It is all in the eye, of
course. Plenty of people write travel books, or even travel journalism,
without ever seeing a thing.
Georgina Harding's first travel book, about a journey to Romania, was
generously well-received. Her second describes a winter's stay, with her
14-month-old son, in Tranquebar, a village on southern India's Coromandel
Coast. Unfortunately, it's a plod.

FT  03 APR 93 / Books: The subterfuges of a poet - Anthony Curtis wonders
whether Philip Larkin would approve of this admirably frank biography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILIP LARKIN: A WRITER'S LIFE by Andrew Motion Faber Pounds 20, 570 pages
PHILIP Larkin's father - Sydney - the Town Clerk of Coventry before and
during the war, was an admirer of Hitler, a family tyrant who induced a
traumatic stammer in his sensitive son. 'They fuck you up, your mum and
dad./ They may not mean to/ but they do . . .' as Larkin put it in one of
his most famous poems. It was only after Sydney died in 1947 that Philip
started to become his own man.
As becomes clear from Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life, Andrew Motion's
admirably thorough and penetrating biography, that piece of received wisdom
about Larkin's relation with his dad tends, like much else extrapolated from
his poetic utterances, to falsify what really happened.
Though a bully, Sydney was complex. He combined an admiration for Nazi
Germany with a love of mainstream 19th and early 20th century literature,
particularly the novel. He lined the bookshelves of the family home with the
works of Hardy, Bennett, Wilde, Butler, Shaw, Lawrence, Huxley and Katherine
Mansfield, which his son devoured. Andrew Motion writes: 'Sydney shaped
Larkin's taste skilfully, leading him away from JC Powys and towards
Llewelyn and TF, towards James Joyce with no expectation that he would enjoy
him, and towards poets who would remain favourites all his life: Hardy,
Christina Rossetti and AE Housman'.
It was not only the literary side of his son's character that Sydney formed.
He bequeathed other important characteristics such as a complete
ruthlessness in personal relations essential if the creative life is to be
lived to the full; a racialist outlook, a basic Little Englandism; and, most
surprisingly perhaps, an outstanding ability in the field of public
administration.
This came into its own when Larkin was appointed Librarian at the University
of Hull in 1955, and was faced by the task of developing the library to meet
the rapidly expanding needs of the university in the late 1950s and the
1960s. Larkin's urgent problem as soon as he arrived was the replacement of
the old out-of-date library by a new one. He had to work with architects on
the plans, to draw up budgets and to restructure staffing arrangements,
while still attending to the ordinary routine matters of acquisition and
conservation. He became, says Motion, his father's son. The stooping,
bumbling, foppish, myopic man of letters rapidly turned into a brisk
bureaucrat with a prodigious mastery of detail, skilled at handling crunch
meetings, adamant in his defence of the interests of the library.
The Hull appointment came as the culmination of a career in librarianship
that had begun almost by chance with a job in 1943 in the then grotty public
library at Wellington in Shropshire. Because of his poor sight - and much to
his relief - Larkin had been graded unfit for military service. Unlike
Kingsley Amis, his Oxford contemporary, Larkin was able to pursue the normal
three-year honours degree course in English at St John's College without any
interruption. At the end of it Larkin was - to his genuine surprise -
awarded a First. He then needed to find a 'reserved occupation' for the
remainder of the war, and in his search for one stumbled upon his vocation
as a librarian. From Wellington he went to the library at University
College, Leicester, and from there to Queen's University, Belfast, where he
found colleagues on the campus who shared his love of jazz and
beer-drinking. Finally he got the top job at Hull, which he held until his
death in 1985.
In another famous poem - 'Annus Mirabilis' - Larkin wrote: 'Sexual
intercourse began/ In nineteen sixty-three/ (Which was rather late for me) .
. .' Until I read this book I had always taken that to mean that Larkin's
sexual initiation had indeed occurred in that year when he was over 40. Not
a bit of it. Motion probes Larkin's undergraduate fantasies and finds some
evidence of homosexual longings; but by the time he arrived in Wellington he
was ready for his first heterosexual affair. Rose Bowman was still a
schoolgirl when he first encountered her as an eager borrower. It was with
her that later he lost his virginity. She was the earliest among a number of
girlfriends, none of whom he ever married. He was a great brinkman in this
regard. Two outstandingly patient women emerge as lifelong companions -
Maeve Brennan, a colleague at Hull, and Monica Jones, an academic in the
English faculty at the University of Leicester. Both were devoted to him and
Larkin must have sighed, like Macheath in The Beggar's Opera: 'How happy
could I be with either/ Were t'other dear charmer away]'
Monica was away half the time teaching her students. For part of her
vacation she and Larkin would go on holidays together - an oddly unmarried
married couple. The delicate balance Larkin maintained between them over
many years was often on the point of breaking down. What kept it more or
less indefinitely poised were his escapes into literary work and his loyalty
to his widowed mother Eva, still in Coventry, whom he would visit regularly.
As if this emotional situation were not complicated enough, Larkin, while
still torn between the two Ms, started an affair with another close
colleague, Betty Mackereth - his 'loaf-haired secretary' he called her in
one of his poems. Love not among the haystacks but the book-stacks. Maeve
did not discover about this liaison this until after his death.
The biography is a revelation of how much emotional subterfuge there was
behind his comparatively small published output during his lifetime. Whether
he would have approved of his mistresses' posthumous frankness and his
biographer's candour in reporting it is another matter. The fuss Larkin made
over some revelations about his father's bottom-pinching proclivities in his
work-place, mentioned in a memoir by Noel Hughes, a school contemporary,
suggests that he would not.
The book is often enlightening about many of the local references in the
poetry and deals in full with Larkin's youthful novels and his unpublished
sado-masochistic fantasies, some of which survive in manuscript. To those of
us who, when we were young, tried to become poets and failed in the attempt,
there is some consolation in the thought that, after we are dead, a book of
this nature divulging our most intimate secrets will not be necessary.

THE ASTORS, 1763-1992: LANDSCAPE INTO MILLIONAIRES by Derek Wilson
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 439 pages
JOHN JACOB ASTOR, the butcher's son from Walldorf near Heidelberg, was the
first seriously rich American; in some ways, too, the first glaring
embodiment of the American dream of rags to riches in a generation. Yet his
public image was not good to Americans of his day; the press, especially,
did not like him, and even Derek Wilson highlights his weaknesses as a
landlord and as the hard man first of the fur trade and then of the Pacific
China trade. Of course, Wilson also describes how he endowed and enriched
one of the top three public libraries in the world, the New York Public
Library. To-day it is still the Astors, through Mrs. Vincent Astor, who help
fund its alarming budget.
In the next few generations after John Jacob I, the Astors were joined by Du
Ponts, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Delanos and Rockfellers, etc. The seriously
rich became large in number and created their own culture. However, the
Astors, after 200 years, are still a name to conjure with even in New York.
Their name still dominates New York society. Mrs. Vincent Astor at 91 is the
acknowledged queen of New York, an active patron and tireless supporter of
charities. Unfortunately Wilson only spares a sentence or two for Brooke
Astor, who is one of the most remarkable women New York has ever known.
Maybe she will be the last vivid blaze of the Manhattan Astors for, always a
restless lot, the bulk of the family are now in Britain.
It all began with flutes. London was the greatest market in the world from
1750-1830 for musical instruments. John Jacob's brother, George, started up
in London with flutes: a good craftsman and a good business man, he
flourished. His brother joined him, but not for long. He bundled together as
many flutes as he could get away with as personal luggage, bought the
cheapest ticket he could find and made for New York and set up in trade like
his brother. He was soon back to get more stock.
What a world it was in the last decades of the 18th century - opportunities
abounded, imaginative entrepreneurs plunged, swam or drowned by the
hundreds, and the world's commerce expanded at a rate mankind had never
before witnessed. Probably John Jacob by 1820 was one of the richest men in
the world, and in spite of the alarming children - one mad, one hysterical,
most extravagant - the family's wealth held up. His son, William Backhouse,
consolidated and enlarged their huge Manhattan real estate, and his sons and
grandsons did likewise (they were the first into great luxury hotels, the
Waldorf-Astoria, the St Regis, etc). Manhattan was the goose that never
failed to lay eggs for the Astors.
Yet they were restless people. John Jacob himself left his wife in Manhattan
for two years at a time to visit Europe with a daughter or so. On his last
return he became so hysterical that he tried to bribe the captain to change
course and drop him in Cork.
This stroke of hysteria and the need for instant decision seems to thread
the Astor story, and so is uneasiness - the fear that all daughters are
likely to be the victims of ne'er-do-wells and all sons wanton, dissolute
and interested in spending but not making money.
The Astors had such children in plenty in every generation but they, like
the Rothschilds about whom Derek Wilson has written so well in his last
book, threw up many men and women of great ability and distinction. That is
even more true of the British Astors than the American, although Vincent
Astor - a complex man - was outstanding too.
With the British Astors, Wilson has to deal with two issues: the pro-German
Cliveden set of the 1930s, and the Stephen Ward-Profumo affair. He does so
with excellent judgment, although perhaps he could have stressed more
strongly how the Astors never forgot their German ancestry nor severed their
links with Walldorf. On the Profumo affair he is quite excellent, showing
what has become the poison in English tabloid journalism, that it prefers
sensationalism to truth.
The book teams with good things: Wilson writes plainly but well; he is
sensitive to human beings in all of their complexity; and he understands, as
he showed in the Rothschild book, the extraordinary effects of extraordinary
riches. Now he has taken on the Guinnesses - another fruitful field. After
that, perhaps he will break off and write a philosophically inclined
assessment of the effects of extravagant wealth on human nature. Quite a
task.

FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Where bloodlust rules - Grand National / Michael
Thompson-Noel on the hypocrisy behind a violent horse race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW MANY horses will be slaughtered in today's Grand National steeplechase
at Aintree, near Liverpool? One horse, two horses - a trio of hapless
creatures?
In theory, this long-distance slog - 30 fences, 4 1/2 miles, with modern-day
winners taking about nine minutes to complete the course - has been tamed
and made safer for man and beast. In particular, the notorious Becher's
Brook fence has been rendered less barbaric following the carnage in the
1980s.
But the Grand National has not been neutered. In common with all
steeplechase and hurdle racing, it has a dreadful potential for mayhem and
mischief - as witnessed in 1990, the year when Aintree's management was
finally shamed into making significant alterations to Becher's, such as
removing the acute and backwards-facing slope on the landing side of the
fence, and raising the ditch (also on the landing side) by 30 inches.
That year, though, the race still claimed two victims. Scottish Grand
National winner Roll-A-Joint died when breaking his neck at the jump known
as the Canal Turn, and Hungary Hur broke a leg approaching the 19th fence.
The enduring popularity of the National, which attracts a huge TV audience,
is based on its excitement plus betting and bloodlust, although the latter
factor is never admitted. The media love the race. Watch this afternoon's
coverage and marvel at the tortuous lengths to which the BBC goes to cover
up the violence. If you believed its commentators, you would think 40 pit
ponies were hacking round Hyde Park.
Over the years, I have become a connoisseur of attempts by the Grand
National's apologists to present it in a favourable light. A recent example
is Reg Green's introduction to his revised edition of The History of the
Grand National: A Race Apart (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 14.99), in which he
calls the race the 'most enthralling of all sporting endeavours.' He goes
on: 'For thrills and drama, the race has no equal on Earth. But, more than
this, it seems to transcend mere sport in its unique power to reflect in one
afternoon the whole of life. Sometimes the tragic, the evil or the cunning
are seen. More often, though, it is the courageous, the humorous, the
generous, the triumphantly optimistic side of life that you will find in the
pages of its history.'
There is a distinct echo here of what Hugh McIlvanney, The Observer's star
sports writer, once claimed. 'The race,' wrote McIlvanney, 'is as arbitrary
and incalculable as life . . . The Grand National is often cruel, but
appreciation of it does not imply sadism or even callousness.' Pull the
other one, McIlvanney.
Even more fatuous was last Sunday's Observer in which Richard Baerlein,
doyen of Britain's racing correspondents, gave the entire game away. 'The
Grand National,' he started, 'is still the greatest betting medium of the
year, and enjoys a worldwide television audience of around 50m.
'But this exposure also brings critics of the race. Armchair viewers, with a
very limited knowledge of the intricacies of racing, protested so strongly
after the deaths of Brown Trix and Seeandem in the 1989 National that the
fences have been trimmed to make jumping less formidable, and the famous
ditch on the other side of Becher's Brook has been filled in.'
What Baerlein did not say was that Brown Trix and Seeandem died in the
grisliest of circumstances. One of them, fatally injured and in danger of
drowning, had to be winched out of the brook at Becher's in order to be shot
by the racecourse vet. What 'knowledge of the intricacies of racing' do you
need in order to write off such carnage as an everyday sporting incident,
let alone as a metaphor for life?
Baerlein did not leave it there, of course. On and on he stumbled. 'The
public,' he wrote, 'have gone 'soft' on their attitude to racing and are
getting softer all the time. If the authorities continue to give way to all
and sundry, in 10 years' time or so they may do away with steeplechasing
altogether, leaving only hurdle racing for the winter. That has already
happened in Australia, and the Americans are leaning that way.'
There is a great deal of patronising snobbery and self-deception in all
this. It is a favourite claim of the jumps crowd that they are a more
fun-loving, down-to-earth bunch than people who merely race horses on the
Flat. The jumps crowd detest being accused of cruelty. And they salve their
consciences by claiming that jumps racing is merely a dangerous sport in the
way that motor racing is dangerous. But racing cars do not smash their
backs, necks and legs, and never have to be shot by the track-side mechanic.
Their self-deception is akin to that of the fox-hunting mob - almost all of
whom are mad - who always claim, with spellbinding arrogance, to be genuine
horse- and country-lovers in touch, at a deeper level than the rest of us,
with Nature and her ways.
Today's Grand National is thought to be wide open. No doubt it will be a
spectacle. But I couldn't care less who wins. For me, the only acceptable
result will be 40 live horses at the start of it and 40 at the end.

FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Trade winds blow Smith to Spain - Sailing / Keith
Wheatley on a British skipper who has found his Fortuna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWRIE Smith's appointment to skipper the maxi ketch Fortuna in the 1993/4
Whitbread round-the-world race is a breakthrough, although not everyone sees
it that way. Partisan traditionalists say it is regrettable that Britain's
top professional sailor could not have a boat designed, built and funded
from his own country. Fortuna is sponsored by Tabacalera, the Spanish
state-owned tobacco giant.
In fact, Smith's link-up with Fortuna is probably the keystone in the arch
as the Whitbread becomes totally international in the same way as Formula
One motor racing. Dennis Conner, the world's best-known sailor, is entering
his first Whitbread with a yacht funded by Winston cigarettes, built in
Italy, and crewed largely by New Zealanders and Europeans.
Chris Dickson, the New Zealander who skippered for the Japanese in the last
America's Cup, has a Whitbread programme funded by a Tokyo advertising
agency. His back-up skipper is young British sailor Stuart Childerley. The
Ukraine has built and entered a yacht that is being fitted-out in Florida.
'I wasn't in the slightest bit bothered about whether it was a British team.
I've always just gone for the best people around,' says Smith, who won an
Olympic bronze medal in the Soling class in Barcelona. 'I would rather have
started earlier with a new boat, but I think we'll have a few surprises by
the summer.'
Fortuna competed in the 1989/90 Whitbread and held the record of more than
400 miles for a single day's run. Smith describes it as 'an out-and-out
speed machine but with a big weakness in light airs.' In those days it was a
sloop but last year it was cut in half, lengthened, and a mizzen mast added
to make it ketch-rigged.
The work was carried out at Vision Yachts in Cowes, Isle of Wight. Smith has
just brought Fortuna back from Spain to the same yard, and another nine-week
programme of modifications will begin. Designer Ian Howlett, an associate of
Smith's going back to the British challenge for the 1980 America's Cup, is
tank-testing new keel and rudder models.
'I don't think we'll be aiming to make it look just like the other maxis.
It's boring to copy and it probably wouldn't be effective. The fundamentals
are the foils, moving the main mast, and a bigger mizzen sail area,' says
Howlett, known throughout sailing as 'Boff' because of his preference for
Oxford academic life over the gin and tonics of the south coast yachting
set.
The bulk of the Whitbread fleet will be in the new, W60 class of 60ft
water-ballasted sloops. While the maxis are more than 20ft longer and carry
far more sail, there is still considerable disagreement among sailors and
designers about which will prove fastest around the 32,000-mile course.
Sponsors of the bigger, more glamorous maxi yachts have invested
considerable money and prestige in being first home, and race officials
already have begun modifying sailing instructions (purportedly on grounds of
safety) that will limit the amount of sail the W60s can carry in the
Southern Ocean.
'I've always wanted the boat that will cross the finish line first,' says
Smith. 'Joe Bloggs in the street doesn't care about anything else and that's
what gives the sponsor his value for money and lets us all go racing.'
Nevertheless, Smith, who skippered the game but slightly off-the-pace
Rothmans in the last Whitbread, knows the velocity predictions for the two
classes. Above 20 knots of wind, the W60s will be faster all the time. In
some downwind conditions, they could be up to 100 miles a day quicker than
the giant maxis.
Upwind, and in the lighter airs where half the race takes place in the north
and south Atlantic, the bigger yachts should have the upper hand. 'The best
predictions I've seen say that, with average weather, the maxis will be 48
hours faster round the track,' says Smith, adding the proviso that a tiny
meteorological change can throw the whole calculation into a reverse
conclusion.
Nevertheless, if he fails to do well this time, it will not be for lack of
resources. In 1992 Fortuna, backed by Tabacalera, threw around Pounds 4m of
sponsorship behind the Spanish sailing team at the Olympics. The return was
an extraordinary four gold medals in 10 events, dwarfing more traditionally
strong sailing nations.

FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Let battle begin - Baseball / Spring training over,
Jurek Martin previews the 1993 season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's rites of spring training were not generally wonderful for the
baseball season, which starts on Monday when Bill Clinton, a promising young
left-hander, throws the opening ball in Baltimore and his wife, taking a
break from US health care reform, does the same in Chicago.
Among the headlines: two Cleveland Indian pitchers were killed in a Florida
boating accident; George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees,
returned after a ban; and Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnatti Reds,
started one for racist remarks (so did her dog, banned from the field in
Cincinatti for unsanitary behaviour). Meanwhile, Barry Bonds, baseball's
highest-paid player, was proving he could be as boorish in San Francisco as
he was sometimes in Pittsburgh.
But spring training is also a time of hope and magic, and this one was no
exception because the truly beguiling stories centred on the possible
restoration to the big time of an illustrious pair who had seem consigned to
the scrap-heap; Fernando Valenzuela and Bo Jackson.
The Financial Times has long had an interest in Valenzuela. The Mexican
screw-ball artist was the best left-handed pitcher in the game for the first
half of the 1980s. We commemorated his arrival as a Los Angeles Dodger in
1981 as a 'pitcher of innocence': regretfully, we recorded his apparent
demise 10 years later under a headline 'Fernando the deceiver lays down his
arm.'
He picked it up again at home in the Mexican leagues over the past 18
months, but without staggering success. When, in February, the Baltimore
Orioles announced they had signed him to a minor league contract and invited
him to camp, it was seen generally either as a quixotic gesture or, more
darkly, as a public relations ploy because a senior Oriole scout had been
quoted in the Mexican press making disparaging remarks about Hispanic
players.
Valenzuela's first outing as an Oriole was almost a disaster. He loaded the
bases with nobody out and, after three consecutive pitches outside the
strike zone to the next batter, was one pitch away from giving up at least a
run. But two fast-balls and two screw-balls later he was out of it,
unscathed, with a strike-out and a double play. He followed that with three
scoreless innings, then another five, then another two, then two more.
Suddenly, he presented the Orioles with a problem because they seemed to
have no room for an extra starting pitcher. They have the marvellous young
Mike Mussina, arguably the game's next great pitcher; Rick Sutcliffe, ageing
and curmudgeonly but a clubhouse leader; Ben MacDonald and Arthur Rhodes,
both young and talented; and Mark Williamson, impressive after recovering
from arm surgery. But with Valenzuela showing that his screw-ball could
still get batters out, and with his fast-ball paced respectably again,
manager Johnny Oates began to rethink.
Although Valenzuela attracted ever-greater crowds in Florida, the Orioles'
Camden Yards stadium is pretty much sold out in advance, so he cannot
generate the extra income for the club that he did in his glory years in Los
Angeles when, routinely, he added thousands to the gate every time he
pitched. In any case, Baltimore does not have the Hispanic population of the
West Coast. But the thought of Mussina and Valenzuela in harness is a hugely
enticing prospect. Even the hard-headed Oates might find it so.
The Bo Jackson story is of comparable charm. A crashing football running
back and muscular baseball slugger, he was a two-sport phenomenon. Only
Deion Sanders, of the two Atlanta teams, pulls off the same trick - and he
is not yet in Jackson's league in either sport.
Crippled by a football injury two years ago and released by the Kansas City
Royals, Jackson played a little baseball, unsuccessfully, at the end of the
1991 season for the Chicago White Sox. Last spring, he had hip replacement
surgery - not usually the sort of operation from which people recover to
play anything else than the most sedentary sport. When the White Sox offered
him a provisional contract at the start of this spring training, it was
reckoned, like the Orioles with Valenzuela, to be partly an act of charity.
But Jackson was a batting leader throughout spring training and, if no
longer as powerfully graceful as he once was, he remains mobile enough to
play the outfield, even if with a minor limp and a hitch in his stride.
'I've never worked so hard in my life,' he said. 'Things always came easy to
me.' The man has a transcendent spirit.
Picking this year's winners is, as ever, a mug's game in spring. But in the
National League, Atlanta's pitching, reinforced by the acquisition from
Chicago of last year's Cy Young award-winner, Mike Maddux, is simply too
good to ignore. The New York Mets still have the talent on paper but their
pitchers have endured a roughish, injury-prone spring and last year's
clubhouse mood was dire.
The most competitive baseball probably will be played in the American League
East with the Toronto Blue Jays, winners of last season's World Series,
changed but still powerful and the Orioles and Milwaukee Brewers not far
behind. Nor can the Yankees be overlooked, Steinbrenner permitting, if Jim
Abbott and Jimmy Key, signed over the winter, pitch up to expectations.
Atlanta apart, the respective western divisions of both leagues have less
intrinsic charm although Nolan Ryan's final season down in Texas would, in a
just world, be crowned by another no-hitter. In such a world, Steinbrenner
and Schott would take Trappist vows; baseball's owners would see the wisdom
of finding an independent commissioner; there would be more day games,
especially in the World Series; and next year's season would not be
threatened by contract disputes. And, of course, Fernando would win 20 games
(well, maybe 15) and Bo would bang 30 home runs. In spring, one may dream.

FT  03 APR 93 / Motoring: How to beat the Budget rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORING in Britain will cost more: that, in the short term, is the main
effect of last month's Budget. Ten per cent more excise duty on unleaded
petrol and diesel has inflated pump prices by 12p a gallon. The 25 per cent
of car-owners who from choice - or, more rarely, necessity - use leaded
premium are 15p a gallon worse off. And, of course, what some still think of
as the road fund tax also went up by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125.
It could have been worse. Most of the petrol price rise can be clawed back
by more temperate driving habits, such as avoiding high speeds and sharp
acceleration. Bear in mind that a typical family car such as a Rover 214 or
Peugeot 405 uses nearly 20 per cent more fuel at 75 mph (120 kmh) than it
does at 56 mph (90 kmh). A road sign I saw some years ago in Virginia, US,
summed it up neatly: 'Those in favor of saving gasoline, raise their right
foot.'
Petrol in Britain - incidentally, still among Europe's cheapest - will
continue to go up in price by at least 3 per cent a year more than the rate
of inflation. The idea is not simply to raise money. It is all part of a
government strategy to ensure carbon dioxide ('greenhouse gas') levels in
the year 2000 are no worse than they were in 1990.
An immediate and predictable effect will be to boost sales of diesel cars.
Glass's Guide, the car trade's bible, estimates they will climb to 230,000
this year from 200,000 in 1992 (although a gut feeling tells me the figure
could be nearer 250,000).
The once-hefty price premium on diesels, which use up to 30 per cent less
fuel than petrol-engined equivalents, has been narrowed. Surging sales of
diesels have helped. But another reason is that all petrol cars registered
since January 1 have had to have expensive catalytic converters and fuel
injection systems.
Curiously, many cars, including some new ones, still have unnecessarily low
gearing. A 1.8- or two-litre engine spinning at nearly 4,000 rpm at 75 mph
(120 kph) does nothing for motorway fuel economy.
Gearing that is too high can be counter-productive because it leads to
excessive use of the lower ratios. But 25 mph (40 kph) per 1,000 rpm for
family cars under under two litres, and 30 mph (48 kph) for larger-engined
ones, is about right. We ought to be seeing more sensibly-geared cars soon.
Tyres with lower rolling resistance also will help to trim fuel consumption
at moderate speeds. So will improved aerodynamics, althugh there are limits
to what can be done to cut a car's drag if people are still to fit easily
inside.
The eventual casualties of the Budget will be the artificially
small-engined, tax-band beating cars. Some, like the BMW 518i, go
surprisingly well but are not much more economical than larger-engined -
although less income tax-efficient - versions. At 75 mph (120 kph), a BMW
525i uses less petrol than a 518i.
Apart from removing the Inland Revenue's manacles from moderately-priced
diesel cars over two litres cars, the Budget also will make large-engined
but relatively cheap petrol cars more attractive to business users. While
the old tax band rule covering cars under Pounds 19,250 and two litres,
those such as the quick, refined and utterly relaxed 2.8-litre, V6-engined
VW Golf and Vento VR6s made no financial sense. Under the new rules, they
will. So will the Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra in mainland Europe), which
has just gone on sale with a new, British-made, 2.5-litre, multi-valve V6.
Cars such as these make a simple point; plenty of cylinder capacity in a
fairly small, high-geared vehicle provides big-car performance and driving
pleasure. Light-footed drivers find them moderate drinkers, too.
Will there be a stampede by business drivers to have a pay rise instead of a
company car? The motor trade thinks not.
Many drivers might be better off driving their own cars on a mileage
allowance instead of paying income tax on the benefit of a company Mondeo or
Cavalier. But, in spite of the 8 per cent increase in tax scale charges, a
20 per cent rise in the tax cost of free fuel for private use, and abolition
of the over-18,000 miles a year fuel discount, a company car has three
benefits.
You do not have to borrow thousands of pounds (or lose interest on your own
capital) to buy it. Nor do you need to worry about depreciation, which can
swallow two-thirds of a car's purchase price in three years. Insurance or
maintenance costs are the company's problem, too, not yours.
Some business users have been limiting their tax liability by going for good
second-hand cars instead of new ones. My accountant, a prudent man, has done
so for several years. The trend will develop.
There is plenty of life left in a properly-serviced executive car of
quality. Bought from a franchised dealership under one of many
manufacturer-approved used car schemes, it can be a better bet financially
than a new one.
Saab GB even offers models of its own make up to seven years old, and with
100,000 miles (162,000km) on the clock, in its approved used car programme,
with free 12-month mechanical breakdown insurance thrown in.

FT  03 APR 93 / Gardening: Steamy times in a Berkshire jungle - Robin Lane
Fox pulls off the M4 to visit a tropical rain forest and its talented
creator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WET MIST fell in clouds behind us; simulated thunder rumbled in the
distance; there was an echo of chattering monkeys and I stood on the edge of
Britain's newest rain forest, just north of Newbury, Berkshire, off the M4.
From Wednesday, Wyld Court rain forest will be open to the public: a year
and a half's work, a considerable fortune and the imaginative backing of a
Gold Medal grower of tropical plants make it an experiment which deserves to
succeed. It is bold, lavish and a brainchild: it has something for everyone,
even if piranha fish give you the creeps.
Wyld Court stands in the village of Hampstead Norreys on the former site of
a famous nursery for orchids. Its tropical transformation dates back to a
meeting at Chelsea Flower Show. Since 1985, Barrie Findon has been
delighting the Chelsea public with displays of tropical planting, kept
healthy in a far-from-tropical Main Tent. Two years ago, an appreciative
visitor introduced himself: Keith Bromley, very much the senior citizen,
whose business ventures had left him with funds to invest in a tropical
dream. The Bromley plan was to build a rain forest under glass, put Barrie
in charge, and move in his famous exotics, collected over the past 30 years
and increased by contacts in the tropical world.
In your late 40s, you do not refuse a dream offer. Barrie is now in charge,
with his wife Janet, whom he described inadvertently as his top propagator.
A Dutch system of computers sprays the glass houses with clouds of fine
mist; Barrie has to water all his plants personally and although he has
recorded noises from a natural forest, he would secretly like to add a
visual flash of lightning to the sound of thunder whenever it comes round on
tape.
Wyld Court's aim is to show, preserve and, if necessary, export the flora of
threatened rain forests back to their countries of origin. Many people have
these dreams, but those which prosper are the shared dream of a team. The
plan reminds me of another exotic foundation, Eric Young's trust for orchids
in Jersey: there, the scheme worked so well because it brought together a
backer and an expert cultivator, each of whom needed the other. I sense that
the same is about to happen at Wyld Court.
Give it a few months to settle and then visit it this summer when the huge
leaves are open on the Victoria water lily, the children need amusing and
the giant white Arauana fish by the entrance has grown another two feet. In
nature, it likes to win the high jump: already its practice has broken two
panes of glass in its tank, perhaps because it is being kept up by its
millionaire's diet of chicken breast and smoked bacon.
Personally, I find tropical plants sinister and rather too large for life.
At Wyld Court, the Brazilian passion flower has already grown hugely in less
than a year: its flowers are bigger and brighter than any of those which we
grow on south walls in gardens. Old gardening friends such as the
Clerodendorn turn up with names like splendens and make mine look very
pinched. Rare Daphniphyllums appear with elegant green stripes to their
white colouring, house plants grow to inflated sizes, suggesting that they
would take over the drawing room if mist dripped from the ceiling. Shortly
after my visit, Barrie was booked to receive the reptiles: first, the jungle
snakes, and then, on Monday, the rest of the Press.
Where does it all leave you and me? We will be better informed, no doubt,
about that endless worry, the vanishing rain forest. Whenever one of its old
trees is felled and turned into a cocktail cabinet, tens of thousands of
other living creatures lose a home. Among them are medicinal plants and
hundreds of lovely orchids. Barrie is a great orchid-grower and, at Wyld
Court, he has a golden yellow Catleya which I have never seen before, while
vanderas from Brazil grow on mist and water only without any need for soil.
Beside them, wild orchids dangle from the dry skull of an antelope.
Barrie and his team intend to sell orchids and exotics to visitors along
with what rainforesters call 'dry goods'. The provenance of his collection
makes the nursery an important stop for indoor shoppers, travelling down the
M4.
There is also scope for transplanting Barrie himself. Past clients, he tells
me, have turned conservatories into rain forests for their own amusement.
After long, sweaty years on the Pacific Rim, old dealers retire to the south
coast of England and pine for a hint of the tropics on their bleak,
verandahs. For about Pounds 6,000, Barrie can set them up: he has a client
near Portsmouth who has programmed the mist in his conservatory to coincide
with the evening gin and tonic at 6 pm. The wicker chair might be extra, but
the price includes a full tropical planting, computer controls and setting
by a proven expert, leaving you with Barrie's knowledge, even in his
absence.
Somerset Maugham would have loved it: if you are missing Malaysia, Wyld
Court could convert the conservatory and even, I dare say, find a few
piranhas to remind you of your time in the markets.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Property: Major player quits the resort game -
Trafalgar House is pulling out of Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House Europe Resorts (THER) paid Shell Portuguesa Pounds 21m in
1989 for a package which included a tourist village of 180 villas and
apartments on the Quinta do Lago estate in Portugal's Algarve. Also in the
package of 200 acres was a golf course and a building site.
Shell developed the village, Vilar do Golf, in the 1980s for letting to
holidaymakers but tired of it. THER was keen to get into the leisure market
but did not want to spend years building a new resort. It set about
refurbishing the Vilar do Golf units and improving the landscaping at a cost
of more than Pounds 3m.
David Calverley, managing director of Trafalgar House Property, said at the
time: 'This major purchase underlines Trafalgar House's commitment to
leisure as one of its core businesses. It is our intention to remain a major
player in resort development.' But four years is a long time in property.
At noon on Sunday, May 2, THER is auctioning on site more than half the
Vilar do Golf villas and apartments at up to 47 per cent off prices asked
previously. Other units are being offered separately. Minimum reserve prices
range from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 100,000 for the one-bedroom apartments
and villas with two to three bedrooms, all furnished.
The auctioneer is the US-based firm Kennedy-Wilson, which claims to have
sold Pounds 620m worth of property world-wide in 1992. The whole thing is
being planned with the precision of a military exercise.
An on-site information office is open daily and a series of 'how to buy'
seminars is being held in the UK and around Europe so that potential bidders
can see how an auction works. Arrangements are being made with travel
companies to assist people who want to see Vilar do Golf before the auction.
Bidders must register in advance and take a banker's draft for Pounds 10,000
(or the equivalent in escudos ) with them. Postal bids will be accepted but
not telephone ones. Units that do not sell will be put on the ordinary
market.
The resort's facilities now include four nine-hole golf courses (for which
owners get discounted green fees and golf rights), three swimming pools, a
tennis centre with floodlit courts and a restaurant. And there is a letting
programme through which owners can rent their properties when they are not
there.
As well as the 97 units being offered individually at the auction - which
could bring in Pounds 7m if everything goes - a further 47 will be available
beforehand in blocks of three to six units, or as a whole, for investors.
The capital value of these blocks ranges from Pounds 282,000 to Pounds
430,000 and buyers must place the units in the rental pool for three years.
Developers and property companies with their own stocks of unsold leisure
homes will be watching the outcome with keen interest, especially as
Trafalgar House now admits it is pulling out entirely from leisure
development in Portugal.
As well as Vilar do Golf, this means offloading two golf courses elsewhere
and some undeveloped land. There are also another 40 units to build and sell
at THER's Rocha Brava development on the Algarve.
John Low, the chairman, says: 'As of now, Trafalgar House policy is just to
focus on its core business. Resort development is no longer seen as core
business.' But the company stresses that the interests of the owners on its
developments will be safeguarded.

FT  03 APR 93 / International Property: Buyers look inland for homes in
Spain - Audrey Powell finds evidence of a trend away from the coast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Property Misdescriptions Act, which begins to bite this weekend, should
curb the imagination of British estate agents when drafting particulars of
UK houses and flats. But what of properties abroad?
Do not expect any changes in that respect. While British property can no
longer be 'peacefully located' with a busy railway at the bottom of the
garden - unless the agent is willing to chance a heavy fine - it appears
that the Spanish villa advertised in his other window can retain its
'peaceful location' beside the notorious Malaga coast road without any risk
of action.
Still, the recession seems to have gone some way to making agents keep
closer to fact (or perhaps those most economical with the truth are not
around any more). Much overseas property is good value for today's money and
there is no point in agencies pretending people are queueing to buy when
everyone knows how things really are. So, when one says there is 'an element
of movement' in the Spanish market, it is probably fair comment.
There is a movement in choice of location, too. A trend is developing
towards looking for properties away from the coast, although this is not
everyone's ideal.
Naomi Greatbanks, of Hamptons (071-493 8222), says: 'There are really good
deals to be had and I think things have just about bottomed-out now.' The
agency has sold four homes on the El Chaparral golf development in the past
few weeks. This is a project by a Bristol-based British builder at Mijas
Costa, in pine-covered hills between Marbella and Fuengirola.
There is an 18-hole course and a range of properties and prices. You might
get a villa for Pounds 250,000 or Pounds 400,000; apartments at Pounds
80,000 or Pounds 108,000. Density is low, with winding valleys giving all
the properties views of the course and the Mediterranean.
Views of the sea and surrounding mountains are a feature of a villa on a
hill, surrounded by pine woods, east of Marbella. The property is built as a
spiral and integrated into the hillside.
The sitting room has a curved seating area around a central fireplace, which
forms the hub from which ceiling beams stretch out like the spokes of a
wheel. There are four en-suite bedrooms, staff accommodation, gardens,
terraces and a large pool. Price: Pounds 920,000. Details from Sotheby's
(071-408 5196).
North, in the Costa Brava, prices are much lower and are still being slashed
as developers wait for confidence to return. IPI, of Brighton (0273-774
098), has two-bedroom golf penthouse apartments with terrace pool, close to
the beach at Pals, reduced from Pounds 115,000 to Pounds 74,250. Or you can
take your pick of waterfront apartments overlooking the marina at L'Escala
from Pounds 43,250.
Heading inland, Costa Blanca Villas, an agency in Oxfordshire (0235-772
345), says it has discovered that 'there is a huge demand for property in
Spain away from urbanisations.' It has properties in the Cocentaina hills,
near Alcoy, about an hour's drive from Alicante.
The houses, all different, are old and suited for buyers who want the simple
life. Small windows keep them cool and, in many cases, they have been
unchanged internally for 50 years: one visitor described them as like a time
capsule. The attraction is far views of mountains and valleys.
Prices start around Pounds 20,000, while Pounds 45,000 buys a three-bedroom
country house in an acre, with olive and almond trees and a swimming pool.
But the agency warns: 'A basic knowledge of Spanish, and a desire to be away
from it all, are an advantage for those considering investment in this
area.'
The far north of Spain is an area explored only occasionally by
house-hunters. Bradley &amp; Vaughan, in Sussex (0444-412 551), has property in
what it calls a non-tourist region centred on Tremp, south-west of Andorra,
in the Pyrenees.
The scenery is unusual - lakes and valley running through a plain - and
there are plenty of cheap village houses to be had, but the agency
recommends a mill that was converted by a chartered surveyor, with three
bedrooms and a dining/living room. The grinding equipment has been kept as a
feature and there is a barn for conversion. This, in half an acre, is Pounds
73,000.
The local shepherd - who might share his flask of wine with the visitor -
drives his sheep past the property and keeps an eye on it. Allow a day, or
preferably two, to drive down from the Channel coast.
Another area not much publicised in Spain is Galicia, in the north-west
above Portugal. It is quite a wealthy area, with some interesting
properties, says Somerset agent Babet (0460-76 213). The best way to get
there is to fly to Santiago de Compostela airport, which has direct flights
from Heathrow.
Typical of the many properties available to renovate is a 250-year-old
cottage with barn, overlooking a valley and priced around Pounds 22,000.
Rather different is a 90-acre country estate near the yachting centre of
Baiona. There are views across the bay on one side, and of mountains and
forest on the other. Here, there is a private country club and executive
town houses priced from Pounds 138,000.
Back on the better-known Costa del Sol, agent Barbara Wood, at Guadalmina
(95.288.37.10), will do her best to dispose of country idyll ideas. 'People
dream of living in the hills,' she says. 'But you have to speak Spanish. It
is jolly cold in winter. You have to come down to town to buy everything.
It's a lovely thought but a world apart from reality . . .'
Wood says her 'best buy' at the moment, offered in association with Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171), is an unusual hilltop property at Mijas which
was finished last year and is being sold by its German owner.
The circular house is in a walled circular garden amid avocado groves; from
the air, it looks like a bull ring. There are four family suites, staff
quarters and a triple swimming pool. Wood describes it as a house 'for the
guy who is trying to say he has arrived.' Price: Pounds 1.6m.

THE CULTURE OF FLOWERS by Jack Goody Cambridge Pounds 40, 480 pages
AFRICANS DO not grow flowers, do not give flowers. This one observation was
the seed of Jack Goody's book, The Culture of Flowers. Goody is a social
anthropologist famous for studies of literacy and marriage in different
societies. In his retirement, the former Professor of Social Anthropology at
Cambridge University has turned, not to growing roses, but to analysing why
people have ever grown roses.
This is a wide-ranging and readable book, although somewhat repetitive.
Goody compares the different meanings attached to flowers across cultures,
starting with the Garden of Eden (not, it would appear, a flower-garden) and
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and ending with present day. Are Africans
uniquely unappreciative of flowers? What did it mean to 'say it with
flowers' in ancient Egypt or 17th century Holland, and what does it mean
today in India, Russia or China?
Certain subjects, such as the Dutch tulip craze, will already be familiar to
many. But many will be fresh, for Goody gathers an extraordinary mass of
facts - about burial customs, the Chinese New Year, Jesuit theology, the
recent Indian custom of garlanding politicians, and shifts in the symbolic
meaning of individual flowers.
Throughout history, humans have given flowers to their gods. The gift takes
many forms, from the towering temple-offerings of the Balinese to the
English parish flower-rota. Perfume comes from the Latin per fumum, because
people of the ancient world used the smoke of burning petals to waft their
prayers to the nostrils of their gods. The Roman soldiers made Christ a
crown of thorns in mockery of the chaplets adorning their cult idols.
Few flowers bloomed in the gardens of the Pharaohs, whereas Egypt under the
Romans became a paradise for floriculture. (On the whole, this book lacks
the savour which would come from referring to primary sources. However, in a
splendid papyrus we find an Egyptian grower proudly recording the despatch
of 1,000 roses and 4,000 narcissi to be worn as garlands at the wedding of a
Roman dignitary's children.)
The Jews, it seems, share with Africans the distinction of being an unfloral
people. They do not decorate synagogues with flowers and mark graves only by
stones. It seems that only three kinds of flower are mentioned in the Bible,
by which I take Goody to mean the crocus, the Rose of Sharon and the so far
unidentified 'lilies of the field'.
The God of the Jews had no truck with pagan garlands, and neither did Allah.
But although Islam rejected the use of real flowers in worship, images of
flowers were permissible, as we see from the carpets and exquisite tiles of
Ottoman mosques. Islamic art and literature is drenched in the scent of
flowers. Delightful flower-baskets were carved on the gravestones of Ottoman
ladies.
Goody believes that only societies with a reasonably complex economy are
flower-minded. Hence one reason why Africa is unfloral, although its people
also express a moral and spiritual dislike for sacrificing fruit for the
sake of flowers. From this perspective, picking flowers is frivolous, let
alone covering coffins with floral wreaths. In the funeral announcement 'No
Flowers Please', Goody detects the kind of anti-floral puritanism which has
been bad news for flower-sellers in such very different societies.
He traces the impact of two hard frosts of Puritanism in western Europe,
when the goddess Flora was driven out. The first frost to wither the flowers
came with the establishment of Christianity, the second at the Reformation.
However, this is all rather fuzzy, not least since Goody himself admits that
eminent 4th century Christians urged congregations to deck the tombs of
martyrs with flowers. Floriculture on the grand Roman model no doubt did
perish during the barbarian invasions, but I for one am loth to take it on
trust that it was only in the 12th century Renaissance that Flora tiptoed
back into people's lives.
One brief passage suggests what, to my mind, this book lacks: the vivid,
sharp-focus description of communities which one would expect of an
anthropologist. It concerns a French village where it was the custom when
someone died for the villagers to pick all the flowers from that person's
garden. Man's life is as the flower of the field. Surely all cultures, even
in Africa, have seen in flowers the transience of life and beauty? The
Culture of Flowers swamps one with detail and it becomes easy to lose the
thread, yet it succeeds in being a richly stimulating account of a wonderful
subject.

FT  03 APR 93 / Mice with a mission: Medicine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMIE DAVIES and SUSAN DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEART DISEASE is being attacked with a new and powerful scientific weapon -
genetically-engineered 'designer' mice. Animals always have played a leading
role in western medical research, although this has led to ethical debate,
moral outrage and the occasional terrorist bombing. But the deliberate
creation of congenitally-diseased animals by genetic engineering is
something else.
The main cause of heart disease and strokes causing death in the western
world is atherosclerosis, the hardening and narrowing of arteries by fatty
plaques deposited in their walls. These form when the concentration of
cholesterol in the blood exceeds its cholesterol-carrying capacity.
Ideally, a complex biochemical mechanism in cells surrounding blood should
ensure that cholesterol concentration never rises to dangerous levels but,
in humans, the concentration is notoriously variable and often far too high.
Could atherosclerosis be caused by a fault in this mechanism, in the same
way that diabetes arises from a fault in the sugar-regulating mechanism?
Cholesterol is transported in the blood along with protein 'chaperones' that
keep it in solution and also present it to the regulatory mechanism of the
surrounding cells. Many different proteins are involved but one, called
apoE, is known to be abnormal in many humans with atherosclerosis.
To discover if defective apoE causes disease or is merely associated with
it, researchers needed to test the effect of eliminating normal apoE
function in an otherwise perfectly normal animal. Genetic engineering allows
the coding of genes for any protein to be modified.
So, the researchers used genetic engineering to produce a mouse strain
devoid of functional apoE genes - and, therefore, of the apoE protein coded
by them. Even on low-fat diets, the mice showed abnormally high levels of
blood cholesterol.
On high fat, western-type diets, they exhibited greatly elevated blood
cholesterol and quickly developed serious atherosclerosis. Since normal mice
are relatively resistant to fatty diets, the blame for the atherosclerosis
of the engineered animals can be laid right on defective apoE.
This experiment eventually could allow people to be screened for defective
apoE genes at any age, even before birth. The results of such screening may
affect anything from health education strategies to insurance premiums.
The natural resistance of non-human animals to fatty diets has long
intrigued investigators who speculate that, during their evolution, humans
may have lost a protective system - or gained a dangerous one. This
hypothetical loss or gain would explain the fatty plaques which form in
almost everyone.
Careful comparisons between species have revealed that one
cholesterol-handling component, apo(a), is found only in humans and
hedgehogs. Apo(a) can attach both to fatty droplets in blood and to the
walls of arteries, suggesting that it might actually help fatty plaques to
form.
Is human possession of this protein the key to our lethal sensitivity to
fatty food? To test this idea, researchers have used genetic engineering to
create a further strain of mouse which has human apo(a) in addition to its
own mouse proteins.
On low-fat diets the animals are fairly healthy but, if fed on western-type
food, they develop obvious atherosclerosis. Future work will aim to
establish why humans have apo(a) and if its function can be antagonised
usefully by drugs.
The logic behind this work is essentially the same as that underlying the
earliest advances of pathology: guess at the cause of a disease, reproduce
this cause in a healthy animal to see if the disease develops, then try to
cure the disease by antagonising that cause. The innovation is the
application of genetic engineering to this strategy.

FT  03 APR 93 / Fishing: No, Robert, it's not like that
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MUST have heard of A River Runs Through It by now, even if you have not
seen the film. It is Hollywood's loving embrace of fly fishing; the one with
the poster showing an angler with an old-fashioned hat standing on a rock in
a glittering river, with his line irradiated above his head by sunlight
bursting through trees. Very evocative.
Since that sincere, oh-so-serious Robert Redford brought his treatment of
Norman MacLean's piscatorial novella to London, people who have never before
exhibited the smallest interest in my obsession have been asking me: 'Is fly
fishing really like that?'
In considering my reply, I remember the scoffing, the sneering, the
moralistic spoutings, the immense ignorance and prejudice I have had to
endure from the non-believers over the years. I have been acutely aware
that, while golf, gardening, cycling, aerobics, tennis, computer games and a
host of other pointless activities are tolerable to the metropolitan mind,
fishing is not. It is an aberration.
So, I have been moved to sarcasm. Yes, of course - come Saturday I shall be
heading north-west from London on the M40 for the Big Blackfoot where I
shall pull on my inimitable, battered old hat, take my hickory rod in hand,
nod to my similarly-accoutred younger brother and sour-faced dad (taciturn,
as befits a minister, but all heart), wade in comfortable old bags into the
swift,limpid stream and within, five minutes or so, have a brace of wild,
fighting two-pounders on the bank.
But this is immature. So, I try to forget the injuries I have suffered, and
the fact that it took the advent of a smoothie-chops like Redford to stir an
interest in the sport among these backward souls. I say, forcibly: it is
nothing like that. There are no rivers like the Big Blackfoot, no trout like
these trout. No, you do not feel a deep spiritual oneness with Nature as the
water presses against your thighs. Fishing is hard work, full of discomfort
and boredom. It rains a lot. There are brief periods of action during which,
often as not, everything goes wrong and you want to shoot yourself.
For some reason, they find the Redford version more pleasing than the truth
according to Fort. There are murmurs of 'old curmudgeon . . . miserable git
. . . dog in the manger,' and some even more abusive. How can I persuade
them of the gulf which yawns between Arcadian Montana circa 1920 and
overcrowded, polluted England in 1993?
A friend who runs a tackle shop expressed the hope that the film might
inspire in the UK, as it has in the US, an explosion of interest in fly
fishing. Now, times are as hard in the tackle trade as anywhere else, and I
sympathise with his hopes. But I do not share them. There are already more
than enough anglers for our over-stressed waters. The last thing I want is
an influx of hillbilly types asking if I can point them at an accessible
Home Counties equivalent to the Big Blackfoot.
If I sound a trifle irritable, it is because I found the film a trifle
irritating. It is moderately enjoyable, nice to look at, half an hour too
long, overloaded with metaphorical and metaphysical baggage, and takes
itself too seriously.
It did, however, set me thinking about my formative years. At the film's
heart are the relationships between two brothers who learn to fish together,
and their father, who teaches them. Although my father did not fish, two of
my elder brothers did (one still does), and I learned with them.
In the film, the brothers grow up together, fishing; grow apart, and do not
fish; come together, and go fishing. Only when standing together in the
rippling riffles of the Big Blackfoot can they forge again the bond between
them. The symbolism is weighty indeed.
If there was such spirituality in the relationship between myself and my
brothers, it must have been very deep; I was not aware of it then, nor am I
now. We went fishing together. We suffered together. We swore at each other.
We laughed together.
Yes, I still like to go fishing with the brother who still fishes. But I
doubt if there is enough depth or current in the river of our relationship
to encourage the camera to linger.
Amid all the nostalgia-drenched fantasy of A River Runs Through It, there
was one moment of truth which struck an answering chord in me. It comes when
the elder brother, Norman, having caught one good fish, hooks another.
Grinning in a superior fashion, he looks across at brother Paul, who sends
back across the water a grim, desperate smile, suffused with rage and envy.
I recall such a moment when my brother looked at me like that. I need say no
more other than that I had just caught a salmon and he had not. There have
been other times when he has returned from a distant pool with an
insufferable expression on his face and a catch of trout which has made me
queasy with jealousy. The moral, I fear, is that the more ignoble the
emotion, the more real it is. The rest is just Hollywood.

LOOK FOR sports papers in Britain and you look in vain, unless you care only
about horse racing. In France, Spain and Italy there is a plethora of such
publications, and very good they are, too.
Once, sitting in a cafe in the Tuscan town of Gubbio, I noted that
two-thirds of the men in the square were reading La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The rest were studying the Corriere dello Sport. This week, the Gazzetta
published figures which confirmed this anecdotal evidence: it has 3.35m
readers, and its rival 1.9m. They are the second and fourth most widely-read
papers in Italy.
They deal with a range of sports, but both are dominated by football
(Americans, read soccer). The same is only slightly less true of L'Equipe,
the leading French paper. But narrowness could be wise: any attempt to
provide a universal sports paper may be founded on error. One could not
imagine a boxing fan queueing for the Centre Court at Wimbledon.
So, the finest sports paper in the world is Midi Olympique. The title
conveys nothing, but its sub-head is Journal national du rugby. This is an
understatement. It is a national rugby (union) paper in the way the Koran is
an Islamic book; its writers are rugby fans in the way the late Ayatollah
Khomeini was a 'keen Moslem.'
In Britain, many will regard Bill McLaren, the greatest of all sports
commentators, as the epitome of rugby wisdom and enthusiasm. By comparison
with Midi Olympique, he is a mildly interested observer. This account of the
paper might put you off but, remember, you do not have to be a Christian to
admire the Sistine chapel.
The issue of MO which dealt with France's triumph in the Five Nations
Championship a couple of weeks ago reflects its virtues. The French victory
was not an excuse for a triumphalist chorus. Instead reporters, in a
minute-by-minute examination of the game, found 24 occasions where the
French XV had made a mess of things against Wales. Had everyone played his
part, one supposes, France would have won 156-0 instead of 26-10.
MO produces 32 pages on every conceivable aspect of French rugby - even jobs
for players. This issue had an unexpected picture of the victorious French
team in dinner jackets. There was a feature on the team doctor's week, and
details on what happened the previous weekend any time a rugby ball was
kicked anywhere in France.
But one item stood out, and not just because it actually included a picture
with a woman in it. She was Mrs Gustavo Zerbino, who was seen with her
husband and children. Now, Gustavo Zerbino is not well known in Britain,
even in rugby circles. But he must be a household name in Beziers, Toulouse,
Agen, and wherever else French rugby is played.
To explain, one has to go back exactly 20 years before the Five Nations'
final in Paris. Readers may recall the Uruguayan air crash in the Andes in
1973 when many survived by eating dead fellow-passengers. Piers Paul Read
wrote a book called The Survivors, and now a film is on its way.
Among the passengers was a Uruguayan rugby club, Old Christians. Gustavo
Zerbino played in their back row, and he and a colleague 'were the first who
cut a piece from a human thigh.' According to MO, he did so with the words:
'If I should die and you don't eat me, I'll come back to earth and give you
a good kick up the arse.'
Zerbino and three others were invited by Midi Olympique to watch the Paris
game this year to mark the 20th anniversary of the event. The editor, Henri
Nayrou, wrote: 'We can attest they are survivors rather than cannibals,
heroes not curious beasts.'
Nayrou travelled to Uruguay for a four-part feature about Zerbino and how a
rugby player coped with disaster. Asked how the team survived at that
altitude, Zerbino replied, 'Like a rugby club facing death.
'I'll tell you how I saw it: every day I felt I was playing a match, every
day I played the last minutes of a game everyone thought was lost . . . we
felt as if we were down 25-0.'
'Did you talk about rugby up there?'
'No . . . would you talk about girls during a match? You play one game at a
time.'
The editor concluded with the words, 'Next week, we tackle the delicate
problem of the human flesh swallowed by the survivors as well as the
supernatural aspects of the epic.'
I am not quite sure what it is about this story that makes it curiously
French. Maybe it is the relentless logic of the sequence of events, from
cannibalism in the Andes to the Parc des Princes 20 years (to the day)
later. It is the Cartesian tradition, perhaps . . . after all, Descartes was
the first to concern himself with the mind-body problem.

FT  03 APR 93 / Cold relics of the cold war: Andrew Harding visits
Providenia, a Russian outpost looking for a purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH UP on the rusty-coloured mountainside in letters 30 ft tall, the words
'Glory to the Soviet border guards' have been carved carefully into the
rock. Locals say it took the guards two years to complete. Faded versions of
the same slogan are dotted around the steep hills which surround the port of
Providenia.
For 40 years this deep inlet, in the extreme north-east of the former Soviet
Union and cut off from the rest of it by thousands of miles of frozen
tundra, has lain at the heart of the country's cold war defences. It was
given its name in 1848 by an English explorer who thanked Providence for
finding his ship shelter from a fierce Arctic storm.
Providenia is just 30 miles from United States coastal waters. In its
heyday, 80,000 troops were stationed around the town, weapons pointing
across the Bering Strait, poised for war. Not any more. The dirt track which
sweeps around the bay from airport to town passes through what looks like a
military scrapyard. Derelict watch-towers, rusted, tangled aerials and
abandoned barracks litter the shores.
Providenia is more than just a cold war museum, though. Five thousand
civilians and an undisclosed number of troops still live and work there.
They get just three hours of daylight in winter and endure temperatures
which can hit minus 60''C. Given these conditions and the region's declining
strategic importance, more and more people are beginning to ask themselves
why.
Admittedly, the soldiers do not have much of a choice, but civilians used to
have a simple answer. They were there because they were being paid a fortune
 -at least twice what they would be getting in Moscow. Today, that motive no
longer applies. 'Hardship salaries' were an early casualty of the country's
economic crisis while food, almost all of which has to be shipped or flown
in, costs two to three times Moscow prices.
Those who can afford to leave - in other words, the most skilled workers -
have gone already. In the past year, more than 10 per cent of the population
has returned to what everyone refers to as the 'mainland.' But the cost of
shipping a container back to Moscow or Kiev is more than 100,000 roubles -
more money than many workers have ever seen. And most people have neither
new homes nor jobs to which they can go.
Still, there is always television to pass the time - and, in Providenia,
that means US television, picked up from Alaska by the town's satellite
dish. It provides a constant reminder of a very different life just a few
miles away. Everybody watches it. One company had to change its tea break
when a game show called The Price is Right was moved to an earlier time.
Providenia is looking to Alaska for much more than television, however. It
is looking for a purpose. After all, Anchorage is much closer than Moscow.
So, too, is San Francisco.
As an autonomous Russian republic, the Chukutia already has some
independence from central authority. But not as much as it would like. It
still takes an 11-hour flight to Moscow to get a visa to make the 50-minute
trip to Alaska. Most locals try to laugh off the inconvenience. They say
that when Russia sold Alaska to the US in 1867, they wish Chukutia had been
part of the deal.
Since the end of the cold war, there have been plenty of good intentions:
exchange visits, the occasional romance, shopping trips, the twinning of
Providenia with the Alaskan town of Nome. Like television, these contacts
have whetted some appetites, but they done little to improve the living
standards of most locals. Not that Alaska is wholly to blame.
Providenian businessmen have not, for instance, mastered the art of
self-promotion. Take Fargat Talgatovitch. He will show you proudly a typed
document which proves he was the first private businessman in the Chukutian
peninsular. He is even prouder of his latest venture: a derelict warehouse,
built by Americans in 1910, which he plans to turn into Providenia's first
indoor skating rink and disco. All he needs is a foreign partner. A run-down
building, in a run-down town, in the remotest part of Russia. Interest, so
far, has been less than brisk.
Still, as the locals rarely tire of pointing out, Providenia has more to
offer than that. They see it as a gateway to the region's huge reserves of
coal, gold and minerals - reserves which the cost and climate have kept
untouched. Further west in the regional capital, Anadir, mayor Victor Kvan
talks enthusiastically of a possible deal with the Alaskan town of Bethel,
which needs gravel to rebuild its port. But nothing has been signed.
The one industry which does not seem to be taking this chicken-and-egg
approach is tourism. A luxurious cruise ship, Frontier Spirit, arrived in
Providenia's harbour last autumn. Seventy American tourists, on a three-week
trip from Nome to Seoul, filed through the grimy quayside and into town. Don
Grove, a pensioner from Spokane, Washington, took one look at the grey
skyline, pulled a long face and announced that he was there 'for the food.'
Several women shoppers in a grocery store also grimaced when the tourists,
conspicuous in red anoraks, swarmed in to have a look. 'It's not right that
they should see us living like this,' said one middle-aged woman, queueing
for potatoes.
Most were, however, too busy concentrating on selling souvenirs to feel
humiliated. Half the town seemed to have something for sale. One man wanted
Dollars 500 for his walrus tooth, but dropped the price to Dollars 15 on the
advice of a friend. A few hours later, the boat was gone, leaving at least
one local entrepreneur smiling: he had managed to sell three bottles of
vodka for Dollars 15 each - a 1,700 per cent mark-up.
Not that tourism in Providenia is restricted to sightseeing and souvenirs.
Robert Curran has been exploring the region on behalf of a large hunting
firm which has set its sights on the local bear and moose population. 'A lot
of people are still nervous,' he says. 'You're taking quite a chance to move
into a new area with, shall we say, a rudimentary political system and a
certain lack of facilities.'
Apart from selling the odd walrus tooth, though, what is in all this for the
locals? Mikhail Schmickrath, an Alaskan who has been advising Chukutia's
regional administration about tourism, has one answer: 'Any business that we
can jointly create will put Russian people to work,' he says.
Walking around Providenia's muddy, pot-holed streets, flinching at the roar
of the town's coal-powered generator, it is hard to imagine the place as a
bustling tourist town. And while the steady of flow of people back to the
'mainland' continues, it seems only the native population of Eskimos and
Chukchiks is guaranteed to stay on.
In the tiny Eskimo village of Novy Chaplino, an hour's drive away over a
steep mountain pass, the mood is of resignation. A dance group has just
returned from Providenia where it performed for the tourists. Already, one
of the younger girls is too drunk to stand.
Nikolai Kutyl has had his fair share of vodka, too. Sitting on the steps of
his tiny, wooden house, he talks of his relatives in Alaska. An elderly man,
he had taken advantage recently of a new Russian law allowing Eskimos to
visit family members across the Bering Strait without having to get an exit
visa. But, for Nikolai, the trip brought as much frustration as pleasure.
'I'm a sea hunter. I hunt walrus and seal and it's enough for me to live on.
But I saw how people live in Alaska - they don't work as hard as we do, but
they live a hundred times better. Their life is a real life. A great life.
Not like in Russia.'
Another Eskimo, Svetlana Donal, has spent all her life in the village. She
lives in a damp, two-roomed cottage with her husband and two children.
Looking out towards the sea, she gives a long sigh. 'In winter, they often
don't deliver coal here - and we heat with coal,' she says. But there is no
question of leaving now. 'This is our motherland - our houses are cold and
windy but we'll stay here. We have no place to go. Our parents died here, so
this is where we must live.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Old ovens never die, they just cook better -
Giles MacDonogh watches chef Bruno Loubet slave over a museum piece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHEFS ARE notoriously fussy about their equipment
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
their ovens in particular. Bruno Loubet, the acclaimed chef de cuisine of
the Michelin-starred Four Seasons restaurant in London's Inn on the Park
hotel, is no exception.
When I first met him, several years ago, he told me that one of his
ambitions was to own a Molteni oven. Molteni is the Rolls-Royce of ovens,
with 15 out of 19 three-star chefs in France possessing one. In Britain they
are favoured by Raymond Blanc at the Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and top hotels
such as Grosvenor House. Bruno has had his in place for a couple of years
now and he swears by it.
All the more remarkable, then, that Bruno should be so keen to try out a
quite different piece of kitchen equipment: three perfectly preserved, 19th
century baker's ovens which are still in their original position, behind the
Cinnamon Bakery in Cross Street, Islington, north London. The ovens are in
perfect order, and are still used every night to bake the bread served in
the shop. In the 1930s someone had them gas-fired, but apart from this they
are as perfect as you are likely to find.
The baker's oven used to perform a role in society. Until our own century
most poor households had no oven and dishes requiring baking were taken to
the baker's shop to be cooked there. In Gascony, where Bruno's family
originates, the women took their baking to the village oven on their way to
the village lavoir. While they washed the family linen, dinner was cooking
in the communal oven. This method of cooking gave rise to the culinary
description a la boulangere, dishes particularly well suited to slow cooking
and requiring no precise timing. In general they involve fish or meat with
potatoes and onions.
'It's a method of cooking that is as valid as any other,' says Bruno, who
also praised the Aga cooker. 'It is amazingly beautiful and very clever. You
can cook well on it if you organise yourself.' The real oven snobs are
pastry chefs who refuse to work unless they have an ultra-modern batterie de
cuisine: 'Cooking is about talent, and not about fancy equipment,' he says.
Bruno brought three dishes with him to the Cinnamon Bakery: a shoulder of
lamb a la boulangere (see accompanying recipe); a clotted cream tarte with
hazelnuts, the cream flavoured with honey, lemon peel and bound with butter
and an egg yolk; and prune and walnut bread. Bruno had prepared the dishes
earlier; all they had to do was cook in the old baker's oven.
The base of the ovens is clay, which is ideal for giving flavour to bread.
Bruno thought they could be used for just about anything which did not emit
a strongly scented steam, hence the pastry lute on his lamb shoulder stew.
Bruno thought the stew wonderfully well-suited to Britain: 'This is not the
climate for the Mediterranean diet; on a chilly day you want something hot
and substantial.'
The contents of Bruno's cocotte proved just that, and although it was only
5pm when we took it out of the oven, we all dug in with glee. The fresh
bread was particularly good. We were also delighted with the tarte with its
delicate sweet pastry. Which goes to show that great chefs, like great
people in general, are open minded; and if a pastry chef tells you anything
to the contrary, tell him to get lost.
LAMB SHOULDER A LA BOULANGERE (Serves four)
Ingredients: 2lb lean lamb's shoulder; 400g trimmed leeks; 600g peeled
potatoes or even 500g peeled chestnuts; 3 cloves peeled garlic; 1 bunch of
thyme; 1 bay leaf; 2 dls white wines; 1 tbs chopped parsley; salt and
pepper; 200g flour.
Cut the lamb into 4 cm cubes. Slice the potatoes and the leeks. Crush the
garlic and chop the parsley finely. Place all the ingredients in a cast iron
cocotte and cover with  1/2 litre of water or chicken stock. Season. Retain
flour and parsley. Mix the flour with water until sticky. Lute the lid of
the cocotte with the paste and bake in an oven gas mark 5 for 2 hours.
To serve: Cut the crust around the lid, open it and sprinkle the meat with
chopped parsley. Replace lid. Bring the dish to the table and serve with a
green salad.

FT  03 APR 93 / Cookery: An aromatic antidote arrives from Amalfi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THOUGHT of the chocolate excesses that Easter usually brings makes me
feel faintly queasy already. The lovely freshness of lemons provides a
welcome antidote, and the lemons to be found in some parts of Britain this
Easter are cause for special celebration.
In Greece and Spain I have enjoyed lemons as they should be, picked fresh
from the tree when needed, but the pleasure of these pales beside the
magnificent offerings of Amalfi.
The sfusato, or semi-sweet lemon of Amalfi, is unique to that area. It is
big enough to suggest it has swallowed two ordinary lemons. Best of all, it
is supremely aromatic.
The juicy flesh is sharp and refreshing but not mouth-puckeringly acid. The
pith is remarkably tender and lacks the bitterness that spoils so many
lemons. And the zesty, oil-laden rind is scented so gloriously that 'ice and
a slice' has taken on new meaning. Gone is the gin, gone is the tonic. Good
plain water, ice cubes and a slice of Amalfi lemon is all I need.
The Amalfi lemon is grown the traditional way without chemicals to force
growth or sprays to prolong shelf life. You can use it in all the ways of an
ordinary lemon - and many more.
Because it is semi-sweet, you can reduce greatly the amount of sugar needed
normally to make lemon puddings and drinks such as lemon barley water and
lemonade. It makes exceptional lemon curd and the best candied peel I have
tasted. For those on low-sodium and low-fat diets, it is invaluable as an
alternative to salt and butter for seasoning vegetables. The perfumed juice
is the making of elegant avgolemono soups and sauces, and the chopped flesh
adds savour to meat and fish stews.
In its homeland, the Amalfi lemon often is eaten on its own - cut into thin
wedges, peel and all, to dip into sugar or salt. The thought might make you
cringe, but try it. I like, too, the Amalfitana practice of serving salads
of peeled and sliced lemons dressed with good olive oil and sea salt,
scattered perhaps with black olives or celery leaves or rocket. Such salads
make invigorating hors d'oeuvres and complement rich meats such as duck and
oxtail.
Because cultivating Amalfi lemons is difficult and expensive, they were in
danger of dying out unless a new market could be found. They will be on sale
 -on a trial basis - at selected branches of Safeway in the south-east.
The average ordinary lemon, complete with nasty chemical cocktail, costs
nearly 20p. Organic lemons, diminutive compared with the Amalfi variety and
less aromatic by far, cost about 24p. So, the price tag of 59p for an Amalfi
strikes me as very fair.
ITALIAN LEMON CREAMS (serves 6)
Portions here are small, as I find a few spoonfuls of dessert is as much as
most people want at the end of a fine meal. One Amalfi lemon probably will
yield all the juice you need, but it is wise to have a second on hand.
Ingredients:  1/2 pt double cream; 1-1 1/2 Amalfi lemons; amaretti biscuits.
Method: Grate the lemon zest into a small pan and stir in the cream. Place
over low heat until the cream bubbles all round the edges. Cover the scalded
cream and set it aside to infuse until barely tepid. Then stir in 6
tablespoons of lemon juice, one at a time.
Crumble a pair of amaretti biscuits into each of six small glasses. Break up
the biscuits with your fingers; do not reduce them to fine crumbs. Strain
the cool lemon cream over the biscuits: some of the pieces will bob up as
you do so. Cover and chill until ready to serve. The mixture firms as it
cools, reaching syllabub consistency after 2-3 hours and setting softly if
left for 8 hours or overnight.
Eat using teaspoons, dipping the spoon to the depth of the glass so that
each mouthful contains its fair share of soft, intensely lemony cream and of
the sugary, bitter almond crunch of biscuit. Extra amaretti can be served on
the side. Sweet-toothed friends will appreciate the offer of sugar.

<TEXT>
LE MANOIR aux Quat' Saisons, one of England's most sumptuous country house
hotels, is inviting chocaholics to spend the Easter weekend in Great Milton,
just outside Oxford. There, you will be able to eat more chocolate than you
could ever imagine: eclairs with your tea, puddings with your dinner, hot
chocolate in your room, and a light breakfast of pain au chocolat. There
will be an Easter egg hunt, too, with more than 1,000 to find and eat; the
winner gets an over-sized egg.
In the kitchens, there will be a cookery demonstration where you can learn
how to make chef Raymond Blanc's cafe creme. This is a cup and saucer
moulded from chocolate; the cup is filled with coffee ice cream topped with
caramel-flavoured sabayon, rather like a cappuccino. It is served with two
sugar lumps, which are shaped chocolate truffles coated with white praline
powder.
The hotel is as pretty as a picture: a 15th century Cotswold manor house
with 27 acres of grounds full of herbaceous borders and rose beds, water
gardens and woodlands. There are 19 bedrooms, all with views over the
gardens, plus a tennis court and swimming pool.
The weekend is being organised by Blanc and the Chocolate Society. The
three-night stay (from April 9-12) will cost Pounds 445 each for everything.
The Lanesborough hotel in London also is organising an Easter egg hunt for
children on Easter Sunday. It starts at about 1pm and a traditional Sunday
lunch is being served in the dining room. Or you can opt for brunch in the
conservatory, where you are promised eggs with your bagels and dessert
chocolate eggs afterwards. The lunch costs from Pounds 34 (or Pounds 22 for
children).
If you want to clock up your air miles, you could go to Paris for the
weekend, stay at the Hotel de Crillon and combine it with a trip to the
Henri Matisse exhibition, heralded as the art event of the year. The hotel's
package includes a double room, dinner, champagne, gifts and the like - plus
reserved entrance tickets to the exhibition so you can avoid the queues.
The Crillon is the sole grand hotel in Paris to remain in private hands. It
is a wonderful building, a masterpiece of 18th century architecture. Ask for
room 158, 101 or 105 - all are magnificent. The hotel is on the Place de la
Concorde, near enough to go shopping in the famous boutiques and to have tea
at Maxime's. Prices from FFr2,000 (Pounds 250) a person.
Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, 0844-278-881; the Lanesborough, 071-259 5599;
Hotel de Crillon, 010 331-4471 15 00.

FT  03 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Lunch for a Fiver still gives food for thought
 -Nicholas Lander finds restaurateurs more responsive to pricing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Manhattan restaurants which inspired the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' with
their Dollars 19.92 offer last year can easily work out what to do for a
follow-up: add a cent for the year.
But British restaurateurs have had to work harder to capitalise on the
excitement generated by the Weekend FT's promotion in January. Their object
is to attract customers who may have thought that lunching out had become
just too expensive. They have been encouraged by the feeling, albeit still
vague, that business is slowly improving. The end of winter, longer days, a
cheaper pound to attract tourists and a slightly more optimistic local
business community have encouraged restaurateurs to look for new custom in a
variety of ways.
Wheeler's Restaurants seem to be doing the most to establish a more exact
relationship between price and volume. It knows from being a part of the
Forte group just how much the public's eating habits can change. Today,
because of the revolution in British licensing laws, customers will go out
for Sunday lunch earlier and later than the customary time of 1pm - a habit
unthinkable five years ago. But can they be persuaded to do so in the City
of London from Monday to Friday?
To find out, Wheeler's is offering a one hour executive lunch (two courses
at Pounds 7.50, three at Pounds 8.75) from 11.30am-12.45pm to fill the
quietest period in any City restaurant. Restaurants are quiet because City
meetings are fixed for 12 and then, after the normal lunch at 1pm, for
2.30pm. Wheeler's hopes that price - and gentle persuasion  - may induce
some flexibility. The group has had more than 5,000 leaflets printed with
menu details which are being distributed in the mornings to commuters as
they head out of Temple and Fenchurch Street Underground stations so that
they can decide to plan their day around them.
Russel Joffe, managing director of the six Cafe Flo restaurants, decided not
to change a winning formula. As Lunch for a Fiver was generating so much new
custom that it threatened to upset his regular clientele, he plans to
continue his Pounds 5 lunch offer for as long as possible. He has also
introduced it into his gastronomic promotions so that there was a Pounds 5
menu in his recent Alsace festival.
It is still bringing in business and profits. Each restaurant is serving an
average of 60 Pounds 5 lunches a week (with his Kensington branch the
busiest) and he is persuading his suppliers to offer attractive prices to
maintain margins. And he has been encouraged by two other developments.
First, the challenge of producing good food at Pounds 5 has maintained his
kitchen staffs' enthusiasm, which has in turn been reinforced by his
customers' more frequent visits. Those who used to eat out once a week will
come twice for a Pounds 5 lunch.
Out of London, where business has been more difficult for the past year,
Lunch for a Fiver has led to some attractively priced lunch offers and to a
growing realisation among restaurateurs that they have to be working
constantly, not just for two weeks in January, to bring their name to their
customers' attention.
Tim and Sue Cumming, who ply their trade at the Vintners' Rooms in
bargain-conscious Edinburgh, know that their lunch trade is the key to
financial solvency. Consequently, lunch menus are Pounds 7.50 (two courses)
and Pounds 10 (for three), prices below which they cannot afford to dip.
But, in spite of the quality of the food, price is not a strong enough
inducement on its own to draw even more customers from Edinburgh's financial
centre. But the anticipated boost from tourists, festival-goers and a
continuation of a busy evening trade makes them far more optimistic than a
year ago - and keen to participate in the next FT promotion.
These sentiments were echoed by Stephen and Judy Markwick in Bristol.
Situated in the centre of the business community, their revised lunch menus
(Pounds 8.50 for two courses, Pounds 10.50 for three) have generated the
volume if not the profits. Markwick admitted that in percentage terms he was
spending more on his raw materials but that, because he had been so busy, he
had not worked out definitively what this was doing to his bottom line.
In Norfolk, David and Mary Adlard faced a more difficult problem in their
Norwich restaurant. Their Lunch for a Fiver fortnight was fully booked even
before it started but even a memo from a local businessman to his staff to
take advantage of their keenly- priced wines failed to boost takings.
Their new pricing structure, Lunch for a Tenner (Pounds 13 for three
courses) has doubled lunchtime trade. Busier lunches have financially
compensated for the uneven dinner trade of February and March and boosted
morale in the kitchen.
It has also given the Adlards the impetus to look for new business. They
have extended their opening hours to attract post-theatre business from the
nearby Theatre Royale and the first table of three spent Pounds 250 - a
significant amount for a small business.
Back in London, Lunch for a Fiver provided the financial stimulus to the
changes already under way at one of London's oldest restaurants,
Simpsons-in-the-Strand. It has recently been re-decorated and equipped with
espresso machines that even took the Savoy's marketing director by surprise.
Brian Clivaz, its general manager, now realises just how price sensitive his
business is. He has lowered wine prices, introduced Lunch for a Tenner,
which 15 per cent of his customers choose, and charges the same for his
pre-theatre suppers. Business is now back to the level it was two years ago.
Clivaz wants to capitalise on this by turning Simpson's into a 'mecca for
the mind' (it was founded in 1828 as a chess club). The restaurant has been
the venue for Nigel Short and Gary Kasparov to open the bids for their world
chess championship match and, on Sundays, Simpsons will host events that
will stimulate their customers' minds and digestive systems.
Lunch for a Fiver may not have yielded instant profits. But it has
stimulated chefs and restaurateurs and, in its wake, left an increased
number of satisfied customers.

FT  03 APR 93 / How to Spend It: City welcomes a new breed of travelling
salesman - Lucia van der Post meets the entrpreneurs who take their goods to
the customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST

<TEXT>
BACK in the glory days of the 1980s, when Big Bang looked like being one of
the most exciting things ever to have happened to the City of London, I
reported on a host of enterprising (or opportunistic, depending on your
point of view) small businesses that were pouring into the Square Mile and
its environs hoping for pickings from the bonanza.
They were mainly very small but were run by intuitive entrepreneurs who had
seen the future and decided to go out and meet it rather than close their
eyes and hope it never came to pass.
They saw that senior partners and junior analysts, busy lawyers and
over-worked chaps in M &amp; A no longer had the the time to saunter down to the
West End to discuss the jib of a suit or the width of shirt collar.
Yet most of the established city shops had failed to adapt to changing
circumstances. Most still thought that Dickensian charm, a long history and
antiquated service would see them through. A few stayed open an hour or two
longer and some had started opening earlier, but by and large it was left to
an itinerant band of (mainly) youthful entrepreneurs to see that ideas of
service were changing - that what many a busy chap (or girl) with more money
than time really needed was somebody who would come to his home or his desk.
Many were tied to work through the hours when conventional shops opened:
what they needed above all was somebody who would visit them when it suited
them.
But times have changed. Today money is tighter but the hours are no less
long. Those with jobs are anxious to hang on to them, and that means working
at least as hard as in the workaholic '80s. So today the itinerant merchant
has not only to be prepared to to take his wares to wherever they are
wanted, at whatever time it is asked for, but he or she has to work hard to
keep quality up and prices competitive.
Today there is a growing band of thriving little businesses catering to the
specialised needs of those for whom time is money and shopping a chore.
Their overheads are minimal, their shop is a suitcase and their trump card
is their willingness to go wherever and whenever the customer wants. Here,
for those who live or work in the City and its environs, are just some of
the new breed of service-orientated, adaptable little companies which aim,
above all, to please.
Serena Kelsey, 14 Aldebert Terrace, London SW8 IBJ. Tel: 071-820-1616.
Serena Kelsey got a taste for tailoring in the heyday of the 1980s when, so
ran the popular myth, any executive worth his telephone-figure salary could
never knowingly be seen to leave his desk. Tiny, blonde and pretty, her
arrival - complete with measuring tape and choice of fabrics - in City
offices is said to create something of a happy diversion.
She now has about 2,000 clients and goes into City offices, into merchant
banks, to barristers' chambers, to doctors and dentists' consulting rooms -
in fact to anybody who is too busy to shop and who relishes the idea of a
made-to-measure suit.
She has a particularly colourful line in linings though she says now that
the flamboyant eighties are over her customers' tastes on the whole run
along more sober lines.
She now has a team of fitters (all female) who visit the potential customer
with piles of cloth - the made-to-measure suit is then made up in
Northumberland.
She has also recently started doing made-to-measure shirts (Pounds 49 each)
and now has a line of rather classic suits and jackets for women. Though she
is happy to make anything a customer wants, her strengths would seem to lie
in producing the kind of predictable, unremarkable but smart suits that a
certain sort of career woman needs to sport in her working life. Prices for
the made-to-measure women's suits also start at Pounds 350.
Charles Tyrwhitt, Freepost, Saddlers Court, Camberley GU17 7BR. Tel
0252-860940 for mail order brochure, 081-968-0319 for appointments to visit
offices.
Two young men, Nick Wheeler and Peter Higgins, who met at Bain &amp; Co, the
management consultants, decided to change tack and start selling shirts to
the City set or anybody else in need of a proper City shirt.
They quickly realised that the City was not exactly short of excellent
shirts and that the only way to persuade men to buy theirs, as opposed to
anybody else's, was first, to make the buying as effortless and painless as
possible, and second, to offer the best possible quality at the lowest
possible prices.
This they do by selling only through offices, which they will visit on
request with samples of their wares, or by mail order. Any orders placed
before 12 am are dispatched the same afternoon, after 12 and they are sent
out the next day.
Nick and Peter understand the need to dress for the job and they really know
what a proper shirt should look like. Their shirts all sport double cuffs,
are made from two-fold cotton poplin (anybody who knows anything will know
that any shirt aiming for the 'Jermyn Street' look-alike award has to made
from two-fold poplin), have pearl buttons, long tails and removable brass
collar stiffeners.
Most shirts cost Pounds 36.50 (hurry, hurry, they are going up to Pounds
37.50 in a couple of weeks) but if you buy four you get a fifth one free,
which effectively brings the price down to Pounds 29.20.
Norton &amp; Townsend, 71 Bondway, London SW8 ISQ. Tel: 071-735-4701 or No. 7
Milestone Court, Town Street, Stanningley, Leeds, LS28 6HE. Tel:
0532-360781.
Norton &amp; Townsend are itinerant tailors. Originally based in Yorkshire, the
headquarters are now in Vauxhall although their fitters will go almost
anywhere in the UK.
The single most outstanding thing about them, it seems to me, is the extreme
reasonableness of their prices - for between Pounds 275 and Pounds 350
(depending on the cloth) you get a made-to-measure suit without even having
to leave your office.
A fitter will come to your dealing screen or desk, take your measurements,
help you to choose a suitable cloth (there are some 300 different fabrics on
offer) and discuss design details with you. The suits are not entirely
hand-made - mostly they are made in factories in Yorkshire - but some are
hand-finished. For your money, though, you get good cloth, cuff buttonholes
that really unbutton, belt loops, button and tab adjusters and the finished
product delivered to your desk.
Styles veer towards the traditional but if you have a favourite suit the
company will do its best to copy it exactly. It makes sense to order a
second pair of trousers at the same time as it will only cost 30 per cent of
the price of the suit if ordered at the same time.
Also excellent value is the morning coat (one button link, peak lapels and
panel back for Pounds 225), the plus fours (Pounds 99) and the classic cut
blazer (Pounds 195), all of which can be made to measure but come at what
are more usually off-the-peg prices.
Georgiana Grimston, Tel: 071-736-9966.
Georgiana Grimston's suits are more expensive than Norton &amp; Townsend and
Serena Kelsey, but then she offers a full Savile Row bespoke tailoring
service - everything from the initial pattern (which is cut individually for
each customer) to the finished suit is done by hand.
Her partner is Leo Costanzo, a pukka Savile Row tailor who used to work at
Huntsman and Henry Poole where bespoke suits these days start at Pounds
1,750 and Pounds 1,300 respectively. As Georgiana's prices range from Pounds
650 to Pounds 900, depending on the cloth, customers are getting a bargain.
Leo, working long hours, can only make about four suits a week, but every
single part of the suit is made to Savile Row standards: hand-sewn,
hand-finished, hand-stitched throughout.
The process starts with Georgiana coming to home or office at times that
suit the customer ('very often this is after work - I have gone as late as
9.30 and 10pm'). She brings samples of cloth and finds out exactly what the
customer is looking for down to the most minute detail. Leo himself does the
cutting and the fittings.
She has a host of impressive clients - bankers at Lazards, Swiss Bank and
Barings Securities as well as dentists, lawyers, doctors (including one
orthopaedic surgeon who is not only very busy but is also 6 ft 6 in tall).
Most of the suits tend to be quite traditional but sometimes she gets asked
for something a little more dandyish - for instance, she has just done a
turn-of-the-century suit for a client. But she and Leo Costanzo will make
anything that needs tailoring, whether a city suit or a sports jacket.
Madeleine Hamilton Blouses. Tel: 071-278-3111.
Madeleine Hamilton used to be a busy lawyer but these days she sells a range
of hand-made blouses in Italian and English cottons and French silks. While
working as a lawyer she observed that while City Man seemed well-provided
for, sartorially speaking, women had a much harder time tracking down a
suitable professional wardrobe.
Now she not only designs but manufacturers her own range of shirts and
blouses which she sells either by taking the collection round to offices or
by mail order. She has 16 different designs, all distinctive and ranging
from classic silk shirts to crisply collared and cuffed tartan shirts as
well as highly fashionable numbers with frills down the front.
Prices start at Pounds 46 and mostly are around Pounds 50. Her new mail
order brochure will be out next week - telephone for a copy or to ask her to
bring her range to your office.
Cabouchon, 22 Howie Street, London SW11 4 AR Tel: 071-924-3939.
When you spend most of your working hours looking sober, serious and
responsible some good jewellery can do a lot for a girl's morale - and a
chap's, come to that. In offices all round the City the word has got round
that Cabouchon is a name to conjure with.
Started just two years ago by Petra Doring, a German-born entrepreneur, its
turnover in the first year was about Pounds 1m; in its second year it rose,
almost effortlessly, to Pounds 12m. No wonder - what Cabouchon offers is a
range of fashion jewellery and cufflinks that fits perfectly into the life
and working uniform of the serious career person, and all at amazingly low
prices. Many a newscaster and television personality has found that in a
business in which you need to ring the sartorial changes a clutch of
Cabouchon pieces works a treat.
Cabouchon has no shop: its sells entirely through what it decorously calls
'consultants' and these 'consultants' are only too happy - nay eager - to
bring their wares to any office, wherever it may be.
All the jewellery is hand-finished and either 18 carat gold-plated or
rhodium or silver-plated. Most of the range (everything except a few
brooches and cuff-links) is also nickel-free.
Emma Knight, one of Cabouchon's consultants (tel: 071-228-7105), finds that
when she goes into an office almost everybody buys at least two items 'after
all, for Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 you could easily have at least two items.'
On a recent visit to a mostly male-inhabited office a colleague sold Pounds
2,000 worth of cuff-links.
Much of the secret must lie in the pricing ('pearl' and 'sapphire' drop
ear-rings for Pounds 16.50, simple 'gold' ribbed hoops for Pounds 6.50, a
brilliant blue sun, moon and star-embellished brooch for Pounds 14.99, and
classic 'gold' bar cuff-links for Pounds 11.50) but the designs are very
cleverly pitched. Nothing too avant-garde or too quirky, just a selection of
jewellery that could see its wearer through from the school-run in the
morning to a client meeting and on to a drinks or dinner party in the
evening.
Besides the consultant who brings cases full of wares to the office or home
there is also a full-colour catalogue which shows actual-size photographs of
the jewellery.

FT  03 APR 93 / Fashion: Back to the past at Laura Ashley - Jane Mulvagh
reports on the revitalisation of a famous name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY, the UK clothing and home furnishings company, is celebrating
its 40th anniversary this year.
The late Mrs Ashley's vision, bringing the rural idyll to the metropolis,
touched millions of hearts and emptied just as many wallets. From Tokyo to
Paris, my generation remembers the thrill of attending their first party
dressed in a sprig-printed dress, looking like a Thomas Hardy heroine. Her
clothes appealed to the innocent and to women who dressed for other women
and children, not men. They were nurturing rather than predatory creatures.
For homes she proposed nostalgic reinterpretations of the squire's country
seat, be it the maid's quarters or the chatelaine's drawing-room. By
translating these references into updated interior design language, within a
few seasons she offered a sense of gracious country living to the humblest
home.
Her talent was intuitive, anti-scientific and could neither be anticipated
by fashion's vagaries nor quantified by market research because she was
tapping latent romanticism and nourishing a yearning for wholesome and
enduring values. She surrounded herself with genteel girls from the shires
and could disseminate her vision - Botany, Femininity and Nostalgia -
instinctively.
Such feminine instinct attracted big profits. By 1985, with a Pounds 13m
profit on sales of Pounds 96.4m, the company was scheduled to be floated
when Laura Ashley died following a fall at her home.
As there were few British fashion companies with a global market and such
international goodwill, the subsequent troubles in the company were
witnessed by those who had welcomed and respected her look with widespread
concern.
Her death is too simplistic a reason for the company's troubles. It stumbled
at that notoriously difficult hurdle: passing from a family-owned, cottage
industry to a medium-sized, international, vertically integrated, mixed
merchandise designer and retailer.
Even prior to her death the management structure was unable to cope with
global operations. The company had over-expanded, was too highly geared and
over-stocked, and manufacturing standards were falling, especially in sizing
and fit. It had lost sight of its core customer. By 1989 the banks were
threatening to recall loans following losses of Pounds 4.7m on sales of
Pounds 296m.
The appointment of Dr James Maxmin (ex Volvo and Thorn EMI) as chief
executive in 1991 promised a renaissance. Maxmin, reputed to be a risk-taker
who favours aggressive action, has already downsized the American arm of
Laura Ashley and slashed the staff from 8,000 to 5,400. Under a campaign of
'Simplify, Focus, Act' he has put the requisite managerial systems in place
and bolstered morale.
He realises that 'this company is only going to appeal to between 3 and 5
per cent of the world's population and we have got to serve them,' instead
of trying to sell everything to everybody, like a competetively priced high
street brand.
He is seeking instead a higher degree of communality between his worldwide
markets within a particular price bracket - below the top 15 per cent
designer labels and above the lower 60 per cent volume markets.
Maxmin acknowledges that insensitive managerial intrusion into the
designers' domain led the company astray. For many years the marketing
managers, having lost sight of their founder's vision, adopted a Pavlovian
autoreaction to the markets - 'if everyone on the high street was selling
blue and white polka dots at Pounds 4.99, so must we,' ran the thought.
The designers were hobbled by the 'grey suits.' And so, in a symbolic
rejection of the past, Maxmin now eschews the wearing of grey suits in the
company in favour of casuals - he himself favouring a Richard Branson-style
jersey.
Some style-watchers are concerned that Maxmin is too steeped in an American
marketing culture which sits uneasily within a company selling an elusive
notion of the English rural dream. One also wonders why so many of the top
managers are not English - surely, one feels, it is harder for them to tune
into the innate Englishness that they are marketing.
Management aside, a well-run clothing and home furnishings company will go
nowhere without design vision. Nick Hawkins, stores analyst at Kleinwort
Benson, summed up many City analysts' worries by admitting that he 'has been
concerned by the design side, particularly in the garments. It was suffering
from a design vacuum. But I do now feel that progress is being made.'
Progress takes the form of fashion's changing cycle and the appointment of a
new designer. The mode has turned again in Laura Ashley's favour. Besuited,
unfeminine power dressing and vulgar embellishments have been eclipsed by
soft, feminine and natural-looking dress. More designers are interpreting
sentimental notions of environmentalism, ruralism and nostalgia. One only
has to look at the recent interpretations of this mood by Ralph Lauren or
Byblos to see that they are stealing a march on the Laura Ashley tradition.
Though it may seem curmudgeonly to criticise this season's catalogue - 20
per cent hits the mark, the rest is dire - this is certainly a company in
transition. The seeds are in place to flower in the spring-summer 1994
collection because, in a timely appointment last month, Maxmin selected Eric
Bremner, trained at the Royal College of Art and poached from Maxmara, as
chief designer. He has the right credentials. He has a strong affinity with
the brand and has worked for a more upmarket label.
Bremner showed me his preparatory sketches and sources of inspiration.
Swatches of 1930s floral-printed chiffons, voiles and georgettes hung from
scrapbook cuttings of Flower Power Hippies, 19th century rustic maids and
shreds of Victorian wallpapers peeled by Bremner from a crofter's cottage in
the Orkneys. These randomly juxtaposed layers of faded prints at one glance
promised the rebirth of a great label.
Cleverly Bremner, who realises that prints are the essence of the brand,
proposes to introduce fading techniques to the Welsh factories to soften the
new range.
He also intends to concentrate on the dress as 'the vital part of our
selection,' which will surely please many women I have spoken to who found
it so hard during the power-dressing 1980s to find feminine dresses.
Bremner has a keen sense of what the Laura Ashley core customer appreciates.
He talks of femininity, fecundity, comfort and flattering fit and bemoans
the cruelty of fashion in the 1980s when so many women felt over exposed and
unnatural.
As long as Maxmin restores the delicate balance between strong,
forward-thinking design and the desires of the loyal customer base he will
restore the firm's fortunes. Few labels - although Chanel and Dior come to
mind - have survived the death of the original visionary, but so long as the
marketing managers do not lose sight of the fact that women buy unsolicited
dreams, not last year's market research statistics, under Bremner Laura
Ashley has a strong chance of refocusing successfully on its natural market.

FT  03 APR 93 / Fashion: High life, low life, smocks and frocks - Dressing
for the Professions, The Artist / It's a dirty business but there is still
room for that individual touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE world of the cartoonist, all artists wear goatee beards, smocks and
berets and balance a palette on their hands. While the image is readily
applicable to 19th century painters such as Honore Daumier, most of today's
practitioners would consider such a stereotype to be a ludicrous
misrepresentation of their trade.
But allow yourself some artistic license. Adapt this visual metaphor to the
present day and you will find that it is still relevant to many. Oil
painting is a dirty business and people who do it cover up their everyday
clothes so as not to soil them. They may choose denim overalls instead of
smocks but the principle is the same. Similarly, artists tend to express
their individuality through sartorial choices which are often equivalent to
our caricature's facial hair and beret.
Whether dressing for work in their studios or for their latest private view,
artists can usually be divided between 'high lifers' and 'low lifers.' While
dandies such as Cecil Beacon upheld tradition and opted for a lavender smock
and matching paint rag, Francis Bacon threw on any old scruffy clothes for
painting and wiped his hands on the curtains of his room.
Leonardo da Vinci distinguished himself from less creative peers in
Renaissance Italy by growing a very long beard. Arch self-publicist Salvador
Dali opted for the waxed moustache and cape of a circus conjurer. Andy
Warhol's trademarks were his silver wig, Raybans and Levi's 'blue jeans.'
David Hockney wears odd socks and mismatches the colours of his hearing
aids, while Gilbert and George pose as extraterrestrials in badly-fitting
demob suits.
Patrick Procktor serves as an ideal case study of the contemporary artist.
Standing 6 ft 7 in tall with a lived-in face and foppish manner, he
straddles the divide between high and low life types. Like other epicureans
of a certain age, the 1960s loom large in his psyche: he has a penchant for
necklaces, picked up in the Far East, and paints in an Egyptian kaftan.
'I wear either my kaftan or a baggy, striped painting jacket by (British
designer) Paul Smith,' he says. 'They are both loose and comfortable as one
does not want to be straitjacketed. I had a beautiful smock in the sixties
with embroidered violets on the pocket, but its essence was to get paint
on.'
Procktor recalls that, while at The Slade Institute in London, fellow
student Don McCardy, the Californian lifelong friend of Christopher
Isherwood, the British novelist, painted in crisp, white shirts with scarlet
sleeve garters to keep his cuffs up. 'All eyes were out on stalks,' says
Procktor. 'Few of us had washing machines and most of us worked in jeans so
thick with paint they could stand up in the corner.'
On the opening night of his exhibitions at the Redfern Gallery in London ('a
living nightmare'), Procktor wears black tie to greet chums, clients and
critics. 'I have never yet worn tails but it is tempting,' he says, adding:
'I also tell my mother not to wear colour as it detracts from the walls.'
He chose monochrome again for a recent appearance in court on a
drink-driving charge. 'I wore a black pinstripe suit and black shirt, like a
Soho crack dealer,' he says. 'Many artists are frustrated actors. There is a
self portrait by Walter Sickert in the Garrick club in London in which he is
wearing riding breeches and pink frock coat even though he never hunted.
Blurring divisions between formality and informality is a recurring theme in
fashion which amuses me.'
Emily Patrick is another artist with a heightened sense of theatricality.
Born to an eccentric farmer who designed dresses for his wife and two
daughters, Patrick has inherited a love of Bohemian frocks which she makes
herself from curtain chintz bought at Peter Jones' home furnishings
department in the Sloane Square store.
These come out for her private views at Agnews and reveal a stubborn
resistance to modernity akin to that of the traditional Old Bond Street
gallery. A touch stiff and heavy perhaps, they are nevertheless dexterously
cut in pretty styles which merge Thai influences with those of folkish,
eastern European national costume.
'I loathe fashion but adore clothes,' she says. 'Fashion aims to make
everyone look the same. I prefer gentle tones to brash colours and prefer
brocade bodices and full skirts to today's shapeless grunge and awful
executive suits.'
When Patrick was commissioned to paint a portrait of the Princess of Wales,
she was in a quandary about what to have her sitter wear. She scrutinised
photographs of Diana attending functions in a multitude of garish suits and,
after much deliberation, asked her to pose in a delicate, floral shirt by
Laura Ashley and an innocuous skirt. 'Clothes are vital to portraits,' she
says. 'Toulouse Lautrec relied on costumes to form compositions while Pablo
Picasso kept clothes simple to create a timelessness in his figurative
work.'
Patrick wore her usual painting clothes for six one-hour sessions with
Princess Diana at Kensington Palace. She works in mole skin knickerbockers
and country cardigans, chosen for comfort rather than protection; she is a
tidy worker and credits this to the fact she is a woman and a Cambridge
architecture graduate, unused to slopping about in art school studios.
'I wear breeches to sit astride my easel as I like to feel free and nimble,'
she says, adopting the position of a cellist. 'I don't make a mess.'
The strange thing about artists is that, although no two are ever remotely
similar, they are nearly always instantly recogniseable as artists. Pop
artist Jo Tillson attributes this paradox to facial expressions. 'I just
need to look into someone's eyes to know whether or not they are artistic,'
he claims.
The other physical factor uniting the breed has to be public displays of
sartorial individuality and recognition of the need to dress practically for
work. Then again, when asked to comment on Daumier's smock and Procktor's
kaftan, Patrick raised her eyebrows incredulously. 'I wouldn't wear either,'
she said. 'Long, full sleeves would drag on the paint.'

WE EMERGED from our dingy cabin on to the deck to find that our boat had
reached its destination. To the east, the sun was rising over the grey city.
On the quayside, brawny dockers in grubby white vests were heaving crates on
to a trolley. Paint was peeling off the walls of the custom house in great
flakes. The air was clammy. Hanging limp from a rusty pole was a red flag
emblazoned with the five gold stars of the People's Republic of China.
It was 7am. The four of us had three hours to get ourselves and our bicycles
packed in boxes across Guanzhou to the airport for the next stage of our
journey - a flight to Lanzhou.
Three hours later saw us safely seated aboard China Airways. How we managed
to get there in time is another story, but suffice it to say that in doing
so we encountered three types of Chinaman we were to meet again and again
during our sojourn in Cathay: the helpful Chinaman, the greedy Chinaman and
the bureaucrat.
Lanzhou, the start of our cycle ride, was a large, sprawling and polluted
city straddling the Yellow River. We checked into the Lanzhou Hotel - a huge
grey building that looked like the ministry of defence - and there, over two
days, transformed our four-bedroom area into a bicycle workshop.
By the evening of the second day, and much to the amusement of the cleaning
ladies, we had assembled our bikes and packed our panniers. After a final
visit to the night market for a feast of mutton kebabs, noodle soup and
dumplings, we were ready to go.
The first stage of our 1,500-mile, three-month ride took us 700 miles
north-west through the Hexi corridor. For centuries, this natural passageway
served as the only communication link between Han China to the east and the
land of the barbarians to the west. Bound to the south by the Qilian
mountains and to the north by the Mazong range, great caravans of merchants
travelled at a snail's pace along what later became known as the Silk Road.
With their precious merchandise of silk, spices, gold and armaments, they
crossed thousands of miles of searing desert and snowy mountains exposed not
only to the elements but to marauding bandits. We were fortunate enough not
to encounter any brigands, though both the mountains and the desert
presented us with their own challenges as we followed the age-old trade
route.
From Lanzhou we made good progress, cycling 60 miles a day through the lush
Yellow River delta with its watery paddy fields, picturesque villages and
apple orchards. On the third day our road began to rise away from the river
towards a range of snow-capped mountains.
By 2pm we had begun to climb Maoma Shan, a high pass overlooking arid plains
to the west. For four hours we struggled up the switchbacks, groaning with
the weight of our panniers. Sheep and cattle grazed on the sparse upland
pastures and dotted about the hillside were the flapping sheepskin tents of
herders.
We reached Tianshui that night numb with cold. The town clung to the steep
mountainside like moss to a rock below dark and ominous peaks. We found
lodgings in an old caravanserai just as dusk was falling. Our host, a jolly,
ruddy-cheeked Han Chinese with a mischievous smile, told us that the town
was officially closed to foreigners, but he assured us that we were welcome
anyway.
Reaching Wuwei marked the completion of one stage of our journey. Having
dropped down to sea level from Maoma Shan in an exhilarating and rapid
descent, we found ourselves cycling in quite different country. Ahead of us,
for miles, stretched the long straight road. The desert wind blew
relentlessly with only a few brown hills to block it. Soon our progress was
reduced to 6mph, and by the time we reached Wuwei we were tired, thirsty and
covered in dust.
None of us will have fond memories of Wuwei. Famous for its flying bronze
horse discovered in 1969, it will only ever be remembered by us as the place
where we were spat upon by two old men, where we had a pair of gloves
stolen, and where we bought some buns that tasted and smelt of unadulterated
ammonia.
The small, black dot on our map, 1 inch west of Wuwei, was Yuanshanzi, a
collection of flat-roofed huts surrounded by poplars in the middle of the
desert. We had not intended to stay. We had stopped for a cup of sweet green
tea, with the aim of pressing on to Jiuquan, some 40 miles further on. But
it was a cold overcast day and the tempting offer of a bowl of meat and
noodle soup was too good to refuse.
We stayed for lunch . . . and tea . . . and eventually for supper and the
night, too, since we had been told we could sleep in the outhouse if we
wanted to. Before turning in we took a stroll to the end of the village.
Yuanshanzi enjoys a spectacular location. To the south, just 20 miles away,
the huge, black Qilian mountains, their peaks shrouded in cloud, rise out of
the desert. To the north are the boundless wastes of Mongolia. As the sun
began to set, we stood silently in the sagebrush and watched a steam train
chugging across the vast horizon.
Jiayuguan was the symbolic end to the first stage of our expedition, for it
lies on the very edge of China. For hundreds of years, Jiayuguan's fort, the
last along the Great Wall, defended China to the east against Tartary and
its desert hordes to the west. But like the hoped-for end to so many things,
when we reached Jiayuguan and cycled the short distance out of town to the
castle, we were disappointed.
The overcast sky obscured the view north to the Mazong mountains, a squadron
of soldiers in tatty green fatigues was garrisoned in the tourist car park,
and foreigners were being charged an extortionate fee just to walk inside
the fortress gates for a view of the ramparts.
No doubt, on a clear day, the view of the mountains to the north and south
and of the undulating desert to the west is impressive, but what no
guidebook tells you is that if you turn back east, just a mile away, huge
chemical fertiliser, cement and coke factories stand belching out yellow
smoke into the smoggy sky and the air is filled with the smell of bad eggs.
After refusing to pay the entrance fee, we returned to our hotel
disappointed. As we were locking up our bikes, we were approached by a young
man with a badge on his jacket that read 'China Travel Service.' In English
that was impeccable in all but pronunciation, he said: 'I think you have
just returned from visiting the great fart in the desert.'

EASILY the worst flight I have suffered in years was a recent jaunt from
London to Bali aboard Garuda, the hapless Indonesian state airline, writes
Michael Thompson-Noel, Travel Editor.
First we stopped in Paris. Then we landed in Abu Dhabi. Then Singapore. And
then we changed flights in Jakarta for the last leg to Bali. Total flying
time, from take-off at Gatwick to touch-down in Bali: 23 hours, 25 minutes.
Total travelling time, door-to-door, from Notting Hill in London to the
Grand Hyatt resort, Bali: 27 hours, 45 minutes. The return journey to London
was just as painful. As a result, I had to take to my bed for three days
with systemic collapse. I was not greatly pleased by this carry-on, and
vowed in future always to monitor the travel arrangements made on my behalf.
When I spoke to Garuda, the airline said that at present, because of
international agreements, it was prevented from flying more than three times
per week between the UK and Indonesia, and was in any case not permitted to
fly direct to Bali. From the end of June, however, a new agreement ought to
improve its service to Bali. With luck, it will have two flights a week
between London and Bali, stopping only once, at Abu Dhabi.
There is a clear lesson here - always study the fine print of travel
brochures, and quiz travel agents and airlines closely on the nature of
flights offered. Do not be fobbed off. What you want, wherever possible, is
a non-stop flight. If they tell you it is 'direct', interrogate them
relentlessly to find out what they mean.
Bali is an attractive holiday isle. But you would want to get there
speedily. What is the point of spending thousands on a Bali holiday, only to
see large chunks of time gouged from the start and end of it because of
Garuda's magical mystery tours?

FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Marco Polo shopped here - Further along the Silk
Road, Stanley Stewart joins the heaving throng of wheeler-dealers in the
ancient bazaar at Khotan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STANLEY STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 2,000 YEARS the Taklamakan desert was the greatest barrier on the Silk
Road to China. Entire caravans were routinely engulfed by its sands. Marco
Polo described it as a 'country that looks as if it had never been traversed
by man or beast.'
The Silk Road skirted the Taklamakan warily, keeping to the string of oasis
towns around its rim, which were visions of delight to weary travellers.
Marco Polo spoke highly of one of the larger oases, Khotan, famous for its
silks, its jade and its carpets. It was good to be in a part of the world
where Marco Polo's recommendation still meant something, and I set off for
Khotan without delay.
In the pre-dawn the bus station in Kashgar was a scrum of donkey carts,
beggars and passengers dwarfed by baggage. Men lashed sacks the size of
garden sheds on to the roofs of the buses. Wayward camels ate their way
through a bed of geraniums. Beggars patrolled the crowds, chanting the
blessings of Allah, their only competition a Latin tango playing over the
loudspeakers.
My fellow passengers were Uyghurs, the middle men of the Silk Road, a Turkic
people native to the Taklamakan basin. They are Moslems who took their
religion and culture from western traders while offering obeisance to an
eastern government, conveniently distant, 2,000 miles away in Beijing.
The women wore bright headscarves, silk frocks and orthopaedic stockings.
The men wore tall boots, coats with bright silk sashes, pretty embroidered
hats and daggers on their belts. Among them were a sprinkling of Pakistanis,
who come across the Karakorams, the Silk Road's other great barrier, to
trade. They saw me as a natural ally in these god-forsaken parts where the
natives, to their horror, knew nothing of the twin pillars of civilisation:
cricket and the English language.
They dealt in carpets, Thermos flasks, silks, tea sets, cheap jewellery and,
less publicly, in eagles. The birds are caught in the Kunlun mountains and
smuggled back to Pakistan. A protected species, they fetch a high price in
the Gulf where they are used for hunting.
From the bus I watched the desert gradually invade the crops of Kashgaria.
Sand dunes, smooth as whales, marched into the midst of fields. Soon the
road was the only mark of man, and the desert, blowing across its surface,
seemed intent on consuming it as well. Away to the south was a vision of
another world: the snow peaks of the Pamirs, K2 prominent among them.
My neighbour was a dour fellow in a tall astrakhan hat cradling a doctor's
black bag on his lap. The bag contained scraps of newspaper for rolling his
cigarettes. The splendid way he rolled them was rather spoiled by the fact
that they gradually fell apart as he smoked them, showering our laps with
live sparks.
He found me fascinating and never took his eyes off me, as if he could not
imagine what I might do next. Sadly for him, I did very little besides doze
and read, though he did not seem disappointed, judging by his open-mouthed
astonishment. When I took out a book he lifted it silently from my hands and
peered at it, incomprehending, for long minutes. Finally, he tired of me and
fell asleep in my lap.
Towards evening, by the time the desert had begun to seem infinite, we were
suddenly among fields of corn. Water surged through irrigation ditches.
Poplars showered leaves down through the bars of sunlight and shade. The bus
scattered a group of women, seated in the middle of the road eating melon.
The town of Khotan comes in two parts: the new and the old, the Chinese and
the Uyghur. The Chinese population is small but the imprint of Chinese rule
is unmistakable in the wide boulevards, the municipal buildings, the civic
order of the new town.
I descended with relief into the old Uyghur town, crowded, chaotic, lively.
The air smelt of grilling kebabs and the streets were unruly with camels,
donkey carts and errant cyclists. Chief among the latter were the
Pakistanis. Cycling, the primary means of transportation in China, was new
to them, and one of the sights of Khotan was the Pakistanis bumping into
trees.
In the early years of this century Khotan was one of the destinations of a
remarkable archaeological race when Europeans vied with each other to
uncover the lost cities and art treasures of the Silk Road. Crates of booty
were taken across the Karakorams to the museums of Europe.
Presumably it is the fear of further depradations that keeps the small
museum in Khotan closed much of the time. The note on the door - 'Welcome to
your visit', pencilled in English - had a faintly mocking tone. The lobby
walls were decorated with cartoons depicting evil-looking foreigners
extracting antiquities from unwitting peasants. A small crowd gathered to
see if I recognised myself.
Carpets, jade and silk are still part of the local economy. Jade caravans no
longer set off for the imperial court at Beijing but local craftsmen produce
exquisite jewellery and carvings. Khotan has become one of China's chief
centres of silk production, a status befitting a town that proved the key to
carrying the secret of silk to the West.
For centuries the Chinese had guarded the process jealously. In 440 AD a
Chinese princess was betrothed to the ruler of Khotan. Horrified at leaving
sericulture behind, she smuggled silkworm eggs past the border guards by
hiding them in her headdress. A century later Nestorian monks brought
silkworms from Khotan to Byzantium.
Some of today's silk goes into Khotan's carpets which are much sought after
throughout Central Asia. Export is growing rapidly to Japan and Europe, but
in Khotan you can stroll through the bazaar, take tea with a carpet-seller
and bargain over the price while joking with his grandchildren.
The atmosphere of the Silk Road survives in the weekly bazaar where you can
buy anything from a cradle to a camel. By morning the crowds are almost
impenetrable. In Hat Alley bearded patriarchs go from stall to stall,
settling fur-rimmed creations on to their shaven heads for the approval of
friends. Veiled women bargain for pink negligees.
Between the horse-shoe sellers and the inner tube salesmen was the paint
department where a row of old men, their beards stained with colour, spooned
little piles of powdered colour on to squares of newspaper. Harness sellers
displayed horse collars with tall scarlet plumes while carpenters sold
wardrobes that resembled gaudy juke-boxes. Wizened apothecaries presided
over mysterious displays of roots, ground bones and animal horns.
The horse market was a racecourse. Prospective buyers, keen to test-drive
the goods, galloped them round a circuit, swerving their mounts this way and
that to test their responsiveness. A mule of particular unresponsiveness
upset three melon carts and galloped off through the crowd bearing an
elderly gentlemen. Neither was seen again.
The most sought-after goods in the bazaar were among the most worthless. The
Pakistani traders had brought sacks of cheap costume jewellery with them and
the fever among the local women for these baubles was incredible They fought
to get their hands on them. The traders were frequently obliged to flee when
the crush became too great. I found one cowering in the timber-yard, trying
to catch his breath before another onslaught.
'Business is good', I said. He shrugged. 'What is common in one place
becomes a great rarity somewhere else.'
It is what brought Marco Polo to Khotan, and what kept the Silk Road open,
against the toughest geographical odds, for more than 2,000 years.
Daily buses run between Kashgar and Khotan. The run is long, about 12 hours,
and the buses uncomfortable. The journey can be broken at Yarkand. The less
adventuresome may prefer to fly from Aksu (an hour's bus journey from
Kashgar) or from the capital of Sinkiang, Urumchi. The Khotan Hotel is of
international standard, while the No 1 Guesthouse is comfortable but more
spartan. Both have restaurants. The bazaar takes place on Sundays. The China
International Tourist Office in Khotan can supply English-speaking guides.
Stanley Stewart is the author of Old Serpent Nile: A Journey to the Source,
published by John Murray (Pounds 16.95). His book about his journey along
the Silk Road will be published by the same house later this year.

FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Angry Brits, Maltese cross - Justin Wintle bounces
along the bumpy back roads from medieval forts to dusty race tracks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By JUSTIN WINTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I KNOW I should not be here. I am in an hotel overlooking the stark blueness
of Melieha Bay, in the north-eastern corner of Malta. There is no money in
my bank account at home. The only reason I am here is by chance invitation.
I remove my clothes, put on my bathing trunks and swim for 40 minutes. I do
not mess around. I swim lengths - the proper Anglican way to bathe. It must
hurt a little. Then I try lying in the sun. Suddenly, for no good reason,
one of the party I am with tells me that everyone she has ever known has
lost everything at some point in their lives.
Later we sit round a table in one of the hotel's many lounges. Square
pillars and yellow umbrellas abound. So do the British: the blue rinse
brigade and their spouses. Wednesday: I make a supreme effort to relax.
Instead of lengths I try circles. Tomorrow I will hire a car and look at the
island. Lying on my belly I flick through the Air Malta flight magazine. A
waiter who looks like a badly melted Elvis Presley glides up to my sunbed
and asks: 'Can I take your ordure now?' Maltese English, presumably acquired
from airmen 30 years ago, knocks the living daylights out of me.
I request a Bacardi-and-ice and return to the magazine. By coincidence the
first article is about Melieha Bay. The writer, Marie Benoit, waxes lyrical
about the parish church, dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady. 'God,' she
writes, 'is already famous but it does not stop the sacristan from ringing
the church bells at various times of the day.'
The waiter brings a gin-and-tonic. As I fall asleep, I am sure that my
waiter, collecting my empty glass, says to me: 'I need some fresh hair. I
think I'll go for a troll.'
Thursday: No, I will not hire a car today. I will hire one tomorrow. It is
bright and blazey again, I write a postcard to my publisher, then one to my
bank manager. Back to lengths, and far happier for it.
Friday: It is entirely up to you whether, on such dual-carriageways as there
are, you over-take on the inside or outside. The Maltese seem less
interested in travelling than in parading themselves and their cars, a
disproportionate number of which are Humbers and Hillmans (old British
makes). They decide which part of the road they want to occupy, and then do
so. Most accidents are caused by the dazzle of untarnished chrome.
The contraption I hire, from a garage in Melieha village, has all the thrust
of a handmower. Perhaps, for this reason, its owner declines to ask for my
licence, or even whether I have one. Or it might be because he thinks all
male adult Britons are fighter pilots.
Away from Malta's well-hotelled littoral, the landscape bears a tremendous
likeness to a bombing range. The soil is minimal, vegetation non-existent
and the field divisions marked by crooked rows of rubble. One remembers that
Malta is a much fought-over piece of real estate. The stirling defence of
the island in the second world war against the Axis air squadrons was but
the most recent in an endless succession of battles.
The Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Saracens, Normans, Spanish, Italians,
French and British have all come and gone. Most famously in 1565 the Knights
of St John held out against an awesome Ottoman task force that threatened to
convert the Med from a Papal lake into a Moslem lake. Had they succeeded, my
little holiday might have been a trifle different. As it is, the latest
conquerors - the package tour companies - have hoisted their pennants and
invaders are channelled through the immigration desks at Luqa airport.
There is no telling which of the bits of stone that unpredictably enliven
our journey are archaeologically significant. As best I can, I bounce my
party into Valetta, the smack and crack of my friends' heads against the
roof, together with their wailed distress, are becoming wearisome. Sure
enough, when eventually we arrive before the very gates of the citadel,
warfare erupts. My passengers, strongly married to each other, start airing
ancient grievances.
The sites remain unvisited. My party scatters to the four points of the
compass. It takes two hours to round them up and persuade them to sit at the
same table in a pizza parlour. Margeritas momentarily quell the mutiny. Then
the bill arrives, and all hell breaks loose again.
I play my trump card. I have the car keys, so I am the transport manager.
Nobody wants to bus back to Melieha Bay, I tell them. Instead, to restore
morale, I drive everyone westwards across the island to the spectacular
Dingli Cliffs.
Sunday. I hive off by myself. Insisting that the garage in Melieha replace
my vehicle with a proper means of conveyance, I become well acquainted with
the island's signposts. Mdina and Rabat, ancient townships in the centre of
Malta, I come to know especially well. I feel I am at some plein-air
cocktail party. I keep being button-holed by the same forgetful guests.
Little by little, though, I home in on my target: Halfar, pronounced how
far? What goes on there on a Sunday afternoon is 'Off Road Autocross'. There
is not a tourist in sight. Instead, around the perimeter of the track, there
is an unbroken corrall of clapped-out cars full of the young.
From time to time a door opens and a bedraggled teenager tumbles out. If she
(or he) is pretty enough, another door opens instantly and she (or he)
disappears again. In an adjoining field: drive-in bingo.
The photographer in me takes over. I think how nice it would be to create a
portrait of a young woman against the swirling dusty backdrop of the racing
vehicles. Madonna of the Autocross]
At length I find a model. Not the prettiest, but the prettiest are otherwise
engaged. She limbers up with a couple of backward somersaults on a picnic
rug. Then she poses with her children as her wheelchair-bound husband looks
the other way.
As I steady my lens, her sister sneaks up beside me. Madonna, she cackles in
my ear, has only just been released from mental hospital.
Monday. My last chance for the heavy stuff. Again I solo out, before my
married friends can intercept. I do Valetta. I marvel at the fortifications,
and I marvel at the interior of the Grand Master's Palace. Then I scan the
waters of the Grand Harbour. When, in 1565, Fort St Elmo fell, Mustapha
Pasha fastened the decapitated bodies of four Knight Hospitallers on to
wooden crosses and floated them over to Grand Master Jean de Valette.
Valette promptly beheaded some Turkish prisoners, stuffed the proceeds into
the mouths of his canon and returned the favour. I scan in vain. Half a
battered water-melon in an oil slick is a pale substitute for man's
inhumanity to man.
On my way back I drop in on the parish church at Melieha. An ancient passage
running to the vestry is lined with votive offerings: shoes, boots, babies'
garments, crutches, braces, photographs, even the X-ray of a brain tumour,
all presented in respect of miracles performed, or miracles anticipated.
In the vestry itself there is an exhibition of near-sea-disaster paintings
from several centuries. All are the same: a ship foundering amid great waves
in the foreground, the Blessed Virgin shining brightly in a cameo in a top
corner.
The crush of superstition, as dense as in any Chinese temple I have entered
in Asia, is all around. Take away the faith implicit in these paintings and
nothing could be more vulgar. Or, as we would say in Wales, such a
performance of a religion is Catholicism.

FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: The present catches up in Perigord - Michael Wigan
scents change in an idyllic landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a whiff of old cultures, of unchanging lifestyle. There is a
sprinkling of tables outside the bar. Sunlight splashes through the tiny
square's solitary tree on to the wall of the Romanesque church. Three
elderly men are drinking pastis while a small girl complains about the
informal address used by visiting English.
When a battered car squeals to a halt and an elderly woman exhorts one of
the men to come home immediately, the drinkers barely react. The church bell
tolls, but time in this part of France stands still.
This is a little village in the north part of the Perigord, north Dordogne.
Blackening sunflowers decorate sloping fields. Black and white cows
strip-graze the rolling landscape, held in by electric fencing. Woods clothe
the higher ground; lofty poplars mark out the watercourses.
Numerous kestrels, buzzards and a red kite prove the abundance of small
mammals. Standing along the roads are apple trees, damsons, walnuts and
plums. It is a bumper year and fruit strews the ground; some branches have
snapped with the weight. Strips of vegetables - marrows, pumpkins, leeks -
fill corners of fields with stunning luxuriance. The cooing of doves never
stops.
It a landscape of gentle and unspoiled charm. Although new houses do exist,
none looks new - the red-tiled roofs and traditionally-shuttered windows see
to that. And greenery quickly engulfs the nakedness of invading structures.
There is a pronounced peacefulness. It is hard to believe that in a
well-known part of Europe in late summer you can wander down the country
lanes and loop-roads to farms for two hours without seeing a car, but it is
true. The best way to snoop about would be by bicycle, pedalling through the
fruit-scented air.
The odd earthen rump of an Iron Age fort, or statuesquely isolated Roman
ruin proves that this is a land peopled for a long time, sometimes over-run
but never essentially changed. For the inhabitants are ancient
agriculturists who do things in time-tested ways. Because it is in their
nature, and because history has shown the usefulness of it, they are largely
self-sustaining.
In the ramshackle barn behind the cottage a crated sow lay with 13 piglets
in a heap at her teats. A calf was born that morning. Beneath the fruit
trees and vines hens and ducks, sometimes an assortment of sheep and
donkeys, cleaned up the ground.
Every building has the high-up square holes of a dovecot. Fishing is a
public right, and for a nominal fee you can try for trout, perch, carp or
pike. The green, slow, murky waters are alive with aquatic carnivores. The
French here are avid hunters, and the few rabbits are noticeably wary.
I found it fascinating to inspect the careful provisioning in farmers'
backyards. Each house has a woodstack, all cut to the same length,
presumably for the same type of woodstove. Brushwood and kindlings are
stacked alongside, the whole long arrangement roofed with rushes.
Scything, hoeing, weeding, forking hay, cutting wood, puffing along on their
antiquated tractors, countryfolk were always working at something, the men
under the watchful eye of the women working close by. The whole appearance
of the land betokens unceasing toil and husbandry. Buildings which would
otherwise slide to their knees are propped and fastened upright and held
together by any means, if necessary by stacking straw bales high enough to
support the roof.
The newly-fledged EC farm regulations on health, hygiene and worker safety,
which have closed many British smallholders, would, if ever applied in an
area like this, close down this sort of agriculture over hundreds of miles.
Here lies the problem. An officious EC inspector would be tossed into the
slurry-pit if he ever poked his nose into this time-defying part of the
Perigord. But the issue goes further than that.
For the British traveller, or the British emigrant (thousands have moved
there, and billboards for property sales are in English), the old-fashioned
way of life and heart-rendingly pretty countryside are the attraction. It is
what cannot be had any longer in much of England: a slow pace, a pastoral
idyll.
But it is also what EC taxpayers are spending large sums to preserve - a
transmission of funds to the rural economy that protects continental farmers
from the chill wind of macro-economic agriculture in countries such as New
Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US.
The Napoleonic laws of succession which subdivided landholdings equally
between children are being forced into reverse by economic circumstances.
Farms are getting bigger. Country villages have fewer young people. The
revolution in farming structures which Britain so painfully underwent in the
1960s and 1970s is starting here.
For years the co-operative system - and politicians determined to hold on to
their rural votes - held international forces at bay. Now farmers are opting
for early retirement, or set-aside, or are going bankrupt. The sunflower
crop, to take a significant example, is worth a quarter of what it was five
years ago. Farmland, like its crops, is almost valueless.
This goes some way to explain why desperate French farmers incinerate or
spoil food imports from their neighbours which undercut their prices. They
are not just bolshy; they face extinction.
What price picturesqueness?

FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Frankfurt's soft side - FT Guide to Civilised Breaks
/ David Waller takes a walk through the pleasant suburbs beyond 'Mainhattan'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GERMANS have a special word to describe Frankfurt. They call the city a
durchlauferhitzer, a heater where water goes in one side cold and comes out
hot at the other end. What this means is that people come to Frankfurt not
because they like the place, but because they hope to advance their careers.
They spend a couple of years working in a bank before heading back to any
number of more congenial cities several steps up the career ladder.
The image encapsulates a dislike of Frankfurt shared by Germans as much as
by foreign business visitors. The city has negligible charisma and the
casual visitor is likely to come away with memories of little more than the
airport and the drug addicts who - until very recently - used to inject
After 18 months living in the town, I can say that the impression is not
wholly justified, even though I know people who make special trips to the
airport on Sunday afternoons just to look at the departure board to remind
themselves of all the other places they could be, or who drive two hours to
Strasbourg just to go shopping in the nearest Marks &amp; Spencer.
If you ignore the inconvenient shopping hours - shops close at 1pm on most
Saturdays and at 5pm on weekdays - Frankfurt is a highly convenient place to
live and work, mainly because you can live within a five or 10-minute walk
from the office at what, by international standards, are less than
exorbitant rents. Sport, culture, music and food and drink are available in
abundance, on your doorstep.
But the natural surliness of the Hessian people, the abrasiveness of the
city's highly competitive workforce and the ugliness of the town centre
combine to make Frankfurt the sort of place not worth visiting for its own
sake, especially if, for the same money, you could fly to any number of
other European cities.
On the other hand, if you have to come to Frankfurt anyway, it is worth
bolting on a day or two to have a look at what it has to offer. Similarly,
if you are working for any length of time it is worth knowing where to go to
escape the concrete drabness of the city centre, all too hastily rebuilt
after the old mediaeval town was razed by allied bombers in March 1944.
In among the shopping precincts you can find Goethe's House - or rather an
immaculate replica of the house where the great poet was born and spent his
childhood, rebuilt after the original was destroyed by incendiary bombs. The
planks of the floors creak authentically, the nails are in exactly the same
place as they were before - giving a good impression of old Frankfurt.
The Romerplatz, the historical centre of the city where the Romans had their
settlement, where Charlemagne built a fort and where, for hundreds of years,
the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned, should be visited, but only for about
five minutes.
It is overcrowded with tourists gaping at the (replica) mediaeval houses.
Walk away from the square to the nearby St Bartholomaus church, built in the
13th century, and climb to the top of the sandstone spire for excellent
views of the 'Mainhattan' skyline.
For those keen on arts and culture there is almost a superfluity of museums
and concert halls. The south bank of the River Main is known as the
Museumsufer, with seven museums lined up next to one another. Of these, the
most significant is the Stadel which houses one of Germany's finest
collections of oil paintings; the others include a film museum, a museum of
postal services, of ethnographics and arts and crafts.
Across the river is a museum celebrating Frankfurt's Jewish community, which
thrived until the Nazi era and gave the city the nickname Jerusalem am Main.
More haunting is the old Jewish cemetery in the north-east of the city where
one can see the graves of early members of the Rothschild banking family and
capture a sense of this once powerful, wealthy community.
Perhaps it is worth leaving the museums for a rainy afternoon, of which
there are many during Frankfurt's lugubrious winters. But in spring and
summer Frankfurt is best explored on foot. Within minutes you can be in the
Westend, where bankers and advertising executives live and work in elegant
turn-of-the-century villas on calm, tree-lined streets.
Take a turn around the Gruneburg park where on hot summer days bank
employees strip off and sun themselves during their lunch-hours. Across the
autobahn behind the park you catch a glimpse of the Bundesbank, another ugly
building but home to Europe's most powerful institution.
The walking tour should continue eastwards, away from the financial centre
through the elegant Holzhausen district and, if you are feeling energetic,
all the way to the Nordend. This part of town is not touched by big business
and was relatively unscathed by bombs during the war. Accordingly it has a
calm, slightly bohemian and definitely middle-European atmosphere, very
different from the stress and strain of the city centre.
There are kneipen galore, taverns where one can enjoy the best of German
gemutlichkeit. This is untranslatable but you will know what it means
sitting outside a little tavern on a summer's evening eating sausages and
green sauce and drinking the potent apple-wine (Ebbelwei), both local
specialities.
The best place to do this is at the eastern end of the Bergerstrasse in the
east of the city. Sachsenhausen on the south bank of the river is famed for
its Ebbelwei. Although it is highly commercialised, this can be forgotten
after a Bembel of Rauscher (jug of strong apple-wine). Within the city
centre itself, the Fressgasse and the nearby Opernplatz are the only places
where it is pleasant to sit outside and sun.
If you want exercise, hire a bike and cycle along the Main. Better, take you
bike on the train to Hanau and it will not be too long before you are in the
Bavarian countryside.
It is often said, somewhat cruelly, that the best thing about Frankfurt is
that it is so easy to leave. It is certainly true that within an hour to 90
minutes the Rheingau, the Mosel, the Taunus mountains and the Odenwald,
Heidelberg and Wurzburg are all within reach.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: French right to go for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARTHQUAKE hit the French political system last week with the ousting of
the Socialists from parliament.
Will a similar earthquake hit the French market? Economists believe not,
although the election has improved the chances for longer term growth, for
two reasons: Markets try to anticipate events, rather than react to them.
The crushing victory of the Right and Centre Right had been widely predicted
and the market had already risen in consequence - the CAC 40 index stood at
2035 last week, having been 1870 at the beginning of the year.
There was some residual uncertainty about the shape of the government. But
so far, ministerial appointments have been everything the market could have
hoped. Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, was finance minister during
the premiership of Jacques Chirac, when he spearheaded a drive for
privatisation - just is the kind of behaviour the market was waiting for.
Policy, rather than people, moves markets. The key policy for the French is
the 'franc fort' (the strong franc). Mitterrand and Beregovoy had tied their
government's credibility to maintaining the franc's high parity with the
Deutschmark. That meant keeping interest rates high, even though inflation
had come under control at around 2 per cent.
The Right have already shown themselves to be as closely wedded to the franc
fort as the Socialists. As far as the markets are concerned, therefore,
there is no need to alter prices. If the policy is the same, it hardly
matters who administers it.
France's policy dilemma has a familiar ring for the British, who faced a
similar problem last September. This was resolved on 'Black Wednesday' when
sterling was withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism.
That stark change of policy led to sharp recoveries by both the equity and
bond markets, as interest rates came down from 10 per cent to 6 per cent.
The fact that Norman Lamont remained chancellor was less important to the
markets than the new policy which he implemented.
This suggests that in France both bonds and equities should perform
strongly, once interest rates fall. French benchmark bonds have offered a
yield one percentage point above German bonds consistently for the last two
years, and now yield slightly more than 7 per cent. This yield should come
down once German rates fall, delivering capital growth. Meanwhile, French
industry is desperate for cheaper credit.
How can British investors take advantage? Collective investments, such as
unit and investment trusts, are easier to invest in than French shares and
bonds.
Only two unit trusts, INVESCO French Growth and Providence Capitol Le Fond
Francais, invest exclusively in French equities. The INVESCO fund's
performance is impressive, with growth over five years of 117.45 per cent,
placing it third out of 92 in the European sector, according to Micropal.
Jean-Baptiste De Franssu, of Invesco, believes that there are other reasons
to be positive about French equities. The new government can only accelerate
progress towards reform of the French pension system. This would introduce
tax incentives similar to British personal pensions, bringing new capital
into the market.
Privatisation, at generous prices for private investors, should provide the
same stimulus to share prices which the privatisations of the Thatcher era
produced for the UK, he believes.
These views are echoed by Talal Shakerchi, European fund manager with
Providence Capitol, whose small stock-picking fund has also done well in
recent months. He believes French interest rates must come down, either via
a French Black Wednesday - which he does not rule out - or following cuts in
German interest rates. He is investing in companies which will benefit most
from cheaper credit: consumer credit companies, and companies with high
gearing.
A similar strategy is followed by Schroders, which now has a positive view
on France. Its only note of alarm concerns corporate earnings, which may be
disappointing this year.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Top annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUITY rates rose slightly last month. According to the Annuity Bureau
(11-12 Hanover Square, London, W1R 9BD, tel: 071-495 1495), which produces
the table, Generali has raised its rates by 1 per cent and Royal Life by 2
per cent in the past week. This follows an increase in long gilt yields.
Life expectancy is the other determinant of annuity rates, and a few
companies will 'underwrite' an annuity if medical evidence shows that your
life expectancy is reduced. According to Billy Burrows, of Annuity Direct,
two companies, Sun Life and Providence Capitol, lead the market, while
Prudential and Norwich Union will underwrite an annuity on request. This is
done by adding notionally to the number of years - usually up to a maximum
of 10 - you have lived already and giving an annuity on this basis.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Funds act over pensions - After
Maxwell, many are making reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETA HODGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU belong to an occupational pension scheme, you could have cause to be
grateful to the dead tycoon Robert Maxwell. Because of the way he raided the
pension funds of his various companies, the UK government set up a
wide-ranging review of the sector. Legislation, aimed at making pensions
more secure and providing some kind of compensation should the safeguards
fail, is expected in the 1994/95 parliamentary session.
There is evidence, however, that pension schemes are prepared to put their
own houses in order. A survey of 170 by Pensions Management magazine shows
many have reviewed their procedures and about one-third have made changes.
Most of these are concerned with tightening security procedures when money
is moved; for example, when assets are bought and sold. It was laxity in
this area which allowed Maxwell to siphon off huge sums from his companies'
pension schemes.
The way Maxwell dominated the trustees of his schemes also was central to
the thefts, and a significant number of the funds surveyed have reviewed
their arrangements. Some have removed senior directors as trustees; others
have appointed new trustees from the work force, or have employed a
professional, independent trustee.
If you belong to a pension scheme, you might not know that changes of this
kind have been made. As John Cunliffe, a pension lawyer with McKenna &amp; Co,
explains: 'Although schemes will usually want to publicise the fact that
they have made improvements, there is a contrary view which says, 'If we
have a well-run scheme, we don't want to alarm members by telling them we
have found it necessary to tighten our procedures'.'
Most schemes, however, do want everyone to know what is going on. The
Pensions Management survey shows that, after the Maxwell scandal, almost 90
per cent have made efforts to re-assure members that their money is safe.
But what should you do if you belong to one of the others?
When you join an occupational pension scheme, you have an automatic right to
details of its operation. This includes conditions of membership, how
contributions are calculated, the benefits payable, the trustees' annual
report, the trust deed and rules, and the latest actuarial valuation. A
contact address for further information must also be given.
The problem is that much of this information is not written with the average
scheme member in mind. So, once you have it, you probably will not know what
to do with it. And while there is no neat solution, Don Hall, of the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS), says there are some warning
signs for which members can look out.
One is the failure of a scheme to provide information. Hall says disclosure
problems have figured in most of the serious cases with which OPAS has
dealt.
Many workers are concerned because their employers are taking contribution
'holidays.' This in itself should not be a problem, but check your trustees'
annual report if you are worried. This must tell you if there is a
discrepancy between the contributions paid to the scheme and the amount
recommended by the actuary. If there is, you could have cause for anxiety.
The annual report also will show if your pension fund invests in your
employing company. You might have grounds for worry if the level of
self-investment has increased greatly since the last report.
Hall says the best advice he can give scheme members is to take an active
interest and ask lots of questions. How is the scheme invested? Who are the
actuaries? Are benefits paid promptly?
If you are concerned about some aspect of your scheme, your queries should
go first to the trustees. In most cases, they should be able to put your
mind at rest. If they cannot, you should contact OPAS; it has no statutory
power but its experienced advisers will be able to assess your complaint and
suggest ways to pursue it.
Ultimately, the only course of action could be for the member to leave the
scheme and transfer his benefits. 'It is very sad if it should come to this
because most schemes give their members a very good deal,' says Cunliffe.
'But, with hindsight, Maxwell pensioners would have done well to transfer
out of their schemes.'

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Three cheers for the end of Taurus -
Diary of a Private Investor / But will its successor be worse?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOORAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taurus is dead] Ya, boo, I told you so. That was my first reaction on
hearing the stock exchange had abandoned its computerised settlement system,
partly because it still does not work.
I have been questioning the nature of Taurus since 1988, pointing out its
inadequacies and wondering if it could ever be made to function efficiently
and cheaply. My concerns were heightened when, some years ago, I was elected
chairman of the Stock Exchange Investors' Club and met some of the Taurus
'experts' and exchange officials.
I remember one such meeting in 1990 when even a few simple questions stumped
one of the experts. For example, how would Taurus cope with a husband
transferring shares to his wife, or deal with institutions engaging in
similar 'off-market' deals? How would it cope with people buying shares in a
company if those purchases were not matched immediately by sales?
Under the existing arrangements, a market-maker might agree to sell shares
to an investor, even if it did not have those shares on its books, because
it would hope to have acquired them by settlement day. But could Taurus cope
with 'negative stock' - or would everything have to be done on a matched
bargain basis? I felt that this sort of questioning was unusual, as many
stock exchange officials appeared to believe the experts were experts and
let them get on with it.
It did not help that, as Taurus 'progressed,' the operating manuals grew
ever more complex and unreadable. I can imagine exchange officials picking
up these weighty tomes, looking at such gibberish and then nodding wisely,
unwilling to admit they did not understand it but hoping the experts did.
Were the experts themselves briefed properly, though? Several times, I
noticed some of them wearing a 'nobody ever told me it was supposed to be
able to do that' expression, followed by a resigned 'back to the drawing
board' look.
Over the years, in a number of FT articles, I have pointed out that Taurus
supposedly was being introduced to reduce costs and 'get the paper out of
the system.' Yet, it appeared to me likely that costs would increase and
there would be even more paperwork.
One piece of paper (the share certificate) sent via a broker would, under
Taurus, be replaced by perhaps four or more pieces of paper sent every year
to an investor detailing the shares held on his behalf by a nominee. There
would be still be contract notes for each transaction. I also questioned the
safety of the system against fraudulent abuse - or even the potential risk
of a broker's employee inputting wrong information.
In a letter of March 16 1989, circulated to a number of stock exchange
officials I questioned the whole basis on which Taurus had been established.
The system was supposed to be a 'necessary tool' to speed up share
transactions and cut costs. I pointed out that many of the delays and costs
incurred under the existing system seemed to be caused by a few slow company
registrars, and by market makers selling shares they could not get, rather
than by non-market making brokers.
As an example, I gave my purchase of 1,250 shares in a small quoted company,
G&amp; G. Kynock, in January 1988 which had resulted in two certificates (one
for 665 shares and the other for 585) being sent to me separately more than
one year afterwards. There were quicker, cheaper and safer ways to remove
such delays from the system than by using Taurus, I argued.
I suggested that the existing share settlement system used in the US could
be adapated for Britain. A depository company - vetted and monitored by the
Bank of England - could be established to hold share and bond certificates
on behalf of the beneficial holders - a difference being that, unlike the US
system, the shares would not be registered in a marking name but in the
actual names of the investors concerned.
Because the depository company would 'hold' share certificates for millions
of investors, it would be likely that many purchases and sales could be
matched within the company without the need for investors to handle share
certificates - although those who did want one could have it at no extra
charge.
I suggested that each investor might be allocated a code number (or even a
bar code) which could be attached electronically to each of his
shareholdings. There would only be one code per person, so making it much
easier to get printouts of his investments. I also made other, more
detailed, proposals.
I was concerned to ensure that the private investor was treated no less
favourably than an institutional one. Perhaps my suggestions might have had
more impact had I called my system Scorpio (Share Clearance Organisation for
Private Investors and Others) - the 'others' being the institutions - and
charged Pounds 10m in consultancy fees rather than providing free ideas.
I am now very concerned that the stock exchange could repeat the mistakes of
the past, this time aided and abetted by the Bank of England. The government
says it is a firm believer in 'wider share ownership.' It needs to be if it
wants to raise much-needed funds from private investors for privatisation
issues. Yet, so far as I am aware, the Bank's task force, established to
find a Taurus replacement, does not include ordinary private investors. I am
sure that a number of these could provide many useable suggestions at much
less cost than some experts.
There is also talk of a 'two-tier' settlement system, which could well have
a detrimental effect on the share prices offered to the private investor.
Also, if one system can produce the mess of Taurus, think what two could do
. . .

FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bed and breakfast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE A holding in Jardine Matheson which I am considering 'bed and
breakfasting.' My mother has a similarly-valued holding in North West Water,
for which she is considering doing likewise. Could we avoid the cost of
these deals by swapping the shares via the completion of stock transfer
forms? How would a value then be determined for CGT purposes (in the absence
of contract notes)?
If (as we assume) you are hoping to establish allowable losses, then you
would be frustrated by section 18(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992: '(1) This section shall apply where a person acquires an asset and the
person making the disposal is connected with him.'
(3)' . . . If, on the disposal, a loss accrues to the person making the
disposal, it shall not be deductible except from a chargeable gain accruing
to him on some other disposal of an asset to the person acquiring the asset
mentioned in sub-section 1 . . .'
By virtue of section 286 (2&amp;8) of the act, you and your mother are connected
with each other.
The market value of listed shares is (generally speaking) determined on the
quarter-up basis, by virtue of section 272(3) of the act.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I own our house with no outstanding mortgage. I left the home
about 18 months ago and have lived in rented accommodation ever since. The
house is on the market but, in present circumstances, it might well be some
time before a sale is completed. When this is done, will this house be
counted as my 'main' home for CGT purposes? I have not notified the
inspector of taxes of my change of address, but have arrangements to ensure
that all mail addressed to that house is forwarded to me.
The problem is significant in that we bought the house in 1976. The sale
price should be about five times our purchase cost, and the capital gain in
excess of Pounds 100,000. All the proceeds will be needed to establish my
wife and I in two separate homes. Presumably, the cost can be indexed, but
how does one establish the value in March 1982?
When I fill in my tax return this year, is it mandatory that I complete the
'change of address' panel, where the wording is: 'If you no longer live at
the address shown on the front of this form, give your current address'?
You must not conceal your separation from your tax inspector - you would be
risking civil and possibly criminal penalties. Ask him for the free pamphlet
CGT4 (Owner-occupied house): you will see from this that there should be no
CGT for you to pay on the sale of the house, provided that the sale contract
is made by the third anniversary of the day you moved out of it in 1991.
If it does prove necessary to establish the market value of the house as at
March 31 1982 (if the sale contract is not made until more then three years
after you moved out, for example), your estate agent and solicitor will be
able to assist in negotiations with the district valuer. The cost of
ascertaining the March 31 1982 value would be deductible in calculating the
chargeable gain (by virtue of section 38(2)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992).

FT  03 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Neighbour wants my shed moved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME YEARS ago, I replaced a broken-down fence, as required by my property
deeds. I also moved my garden shed (originally erected there in 1968) a few
inches nearer to my boundary but on a new, level, concrete base. My present
neighbour now wants me to move the fence end-post and re-position the shed,
claiming both are on his land.
The original fence end-post (erected in 1957) abutted my neighbour's garden
wall. My replacement fence end-post is embedded in about one ton of concrete
5 inches from my neighbour's wall. The shed was re-positioned abutting my
neighbour's boundary wall.
If I am on my neighbour's land, the fence end-posts and shed have been there
a long time. Do I really have to dig out all that concrete and dismantle a
shed to re-erect it a few inches away?
If your end-post and part of the shed are, in fact, on land which belonged
originally to your neighbour, you will almost certainly have acquired a
title by more than 12 years' adverse possession (ie, the occupation by these
features of their actual sites for some 15 years or more).
Moreover, it seems likely that your fencing used to enclose an even greater
area of your neighbour's land before you re-erected the end-post (from 1957
to the date when you replaced the fence). Thus, the neighbour might have
lost land by 1970, but regained part of it when you re-sited the end-post.
You are in a position to resist your neighbour's request if you wish.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bigger bills for some but most will
pay less - The Council Tax / Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains the ins and
outs of the new levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNPOPULAR community charge, or poll tax, was replaced by the new council
tax this week and millions of people should now know how much they will have
to pay for the year.
The council tax is based on property values, unlike the community charge
which was people-based. Most households will pay less under the council tax:
the average bill will be down by just over 6 per cent in England and
Scotland and 0.5 per cent in Wales, according to a survey by Public Finance
and Accountancy, the journal of the Institute of Public Finance.
But some will pay more, especially those with homes at the higher end of the
market. The survey showed the average bill for a dwelling in the south-east
has risen by 3 per cent while those in greater London go up by 17 per cent.
The transitional
reduction scheme
In some areas of London, household bills will have increased from Pounds 300
under the poll tax to Pounds 1,200. For those hit hardest, the government
has made Pounds 340m available through a transitional reduction scheme
(TRS). This is applied automatically to those eligible and will be deducted
from their total bill.
For those who have to pay more tax, the increase will be limited to a
maximum depending on their valuation band. The maximums vary from Pounds 91
a year for homes in band A to Pounds 182 for those in band H in England and
Scotland, although the bands differ in each country. The TRS was felt not to
be needed in Wales.
The amount of the 'initial increase' determines homeowners' eligibility for
the scheme. The initial increase is the difference between the poll tax for
1992/93, based on the number of people in the house at the end of March
1993, and the council tax for the property after taking into account any
reductions for either tax. The relief given will be the amount by which the
initial increase for the property exceeds the maximum amount for its
valuation band.
Take a couple who paid Pounds 200 each in poll tax and are in band E for the
new council tax. They find that their council tax bill is Pounds 600, so the
'initial increase' is Pounds 200 (the new Pounds 600 charge minus the Pounds
400 paid in poll tax).
But the maximum amount of increase set for band E is Pounds 143 a year. The
transitional reduction will, therefore, be Pounds 57: the difference between
the 'initial increase' (Pounds 200) and the maximum increase for the band
(Pounds 143). This amount is deducted from the council tax so that the
couple's council tax bill for the year will be Pounds 543 instead of Pounds
600.
The situation is complicated because the figure which the government assumes
for the council tax is based on its estimate of how much the local authority
needs to raise - and also assumes a 98 per cent collection rate.
If your local authority has decided it needs to raise more than the
government estimate, or expects its collection rate to be lower than 98 per
cent, your actual council tax bill could be higher than the figure used by
the government on which to base transitional relief.
Take the previous example again, but assume the couple's council tax bill is
Pounds 630. If the Pounds 30 difference is due to the local authority
assuming a different collection rate from the government, or is due to what
the government regards as excessive spending, transitional reduction will be
based on Pounds 630 minus Pounds 30. So, the couple would end up paying
Pounds 573. in council tax.
If you think your transitional reduction has been calculated wrongly, you
should write first to your local authority, which will send you details of
how the calculation was made.
If you remain unhappy and wish to appeal, write again to the council and, if
you disagree with the outcome, to its local review board. The government
says the TRS will last at least two years and that arrangements for the
financial year after that will be announced in due course.
Valuation band
Another group of people who may be unhappy with the council tax are those
who disagree with their valuation band. The value of homes is based on what
the property would have fetched on April 1 1991 but, at the same time, the
government says the figures should not be regarded as precise.
Colin Farrington, director of the Institute of Revenue, Rating and
Valuation, says: 'The idea was to establish relative values for property
based on a rough and ready evaluation for distributing the tax. People
should feel they are paying a relatively fair burden of tax compared to
other people. It was assumed that the council tax would be introduced at a
time of rising house prices and that people would regard the bandings as
academic.
'But house prices have not followed their usual cycle. Now, some people who
are in a low band fear this means they will not be able to sell their house
for the amount they paid for it, while others think their property has been
over-valued.'
The government has said it will not regard the fall in the property market
as a ground for appeal against the valuation banding. But if your property
obviously has been put in a wrong band, you have until November 1 to appeal
by writing to the listing officer at the local office of the Valuation
Office Agency.
If your appeal is about discounts and personal liability, write to your
local council. You can then appeal to a valuation tribunal if you disagree
with the outcome.
There are a number of free pamphlets on the council tax. These include:
Valuation and Banding; How to Appeal; Liability, Discounts and Exemptions;
the Transitional Reduction Scheme; and a Guide to the New Tax for Local
Government. These are available from Council Tax Publicity Material, PO Box
506, London SE99 7UY. Pamphlets on the council tax in Scotland can be
obtained from Citizens Advice Bureaux and regional or island councils.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A quiet period directors appear again to be busy buying shares in
their companies. Selling still outweighs buying, but by a smaller ratio than
has recently been the case.
The largest buy of the week was in Granada Group. Charles Allen, who is in
charge of the leisure division, bought 100,000 shares at 350p, more than
doubling his holding. He and Gerry Robinson, the chief executive, previously
bought stock in the autumn of 1992 at prices between 235p and 247p.
Casket, the bicycles and clothing concern, announced strong interim results
at the end of last year but has not been out-performing the market.
Nevertheless Joe Smith, chief executive, and Ian Butcher, finance director,
purchased a total of 236,825 shares at prices around 33p, increasing their
share holdings sizeably.
In November 1991 directors of ISA International, the information technology
stationery company, bought a large amount of stock at prices between 52p and
64p. Almost 18 months later three directors, including John Heap, deputy
chairman, and Richard Lindley, finance director, have sold approximately the
same amount of stock for 105.5p. Each member of the board still owns a
considerable number of shares.
The Black family still has 30 per cent of Peter Black Holdings, the consumer
product group. The recent sales by Thomas and Gordon Black, the joint
chairmen, of a total of 4,600,000 shares at 170p were made on behalf of
family trusts. At the time of the transactions Gordon Black announced that
the family had no intention of disposing of any more shares in the near
future.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Picking stocks by the sector - Neil
Moore wonders if this is the best way for private investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a perennial debate among investment practitioners on the relative
importance of strategic decisions, and whether it is better to adopt a
'top-down' or 'bottom-up' approach. The former involves taking the major
decisions first: choosing the strongest economies, currencies and markets,
then looking at the various industrial sectors, and finally selecting the
most promising shares within those sectors and geographical areas. The
latter, on the other hand, gives priority to share selection.
The 'top-down' approach has much to commend it logically but does present
some practical problems, not least that the big decisions are the most
difficult - and the most dangerous. If you take a view on a currency or
market and it proves wrong, it can cause serious damage to your results,
your client base - and, perhaps, your job prospects.
I have some sympathy with the 'bottom-up' school, concentrating on the
grass-roots decisions which should be more straightforward and remain
crucial. But the approaches are not mutually exclusive. For the private
investor, the question is whether the higher-level decisions can help inform
the lower-level ones - meaning, in the context of the UK equity market,
whether looking initially at sectors enables one to make better
stock-picking decisions.
The most convenient definition of sector is by industry. The problem here is
that although some sectors are quite homogeneous, allowing generalised
observations and fairly reliable comparisons of individual companies within
the sector (such as clearing banks, supermarket chains, major oil
companies), others (like engineering) are very diverse. Moreover, even for
well-defined sectors, past performance vis-a-vis the overall market does not
suggest the type of cyclical pattern that would enable one confidently to
identify areas of likely relative advantage.
For example, the building materials sector should be a fairly obvious
cyclical performer; but you could have bought the sector a year ago, at the
lowest point relative to the market for a decade, and then experienced
further significant relative decline. At the other extreme, the health and
household sector, mainly pharmaceutical companies, has outperformed the
market over the past decade, although with intervals of underperformance as
has occurred recently; of itself, this tells us nothing of future
performance.
While categorisation by industrial sector enables use to be made of economic
data and does help to identify short-term shifts in market sentiment, it
does not seem to be a particularly helpful basis for longer-term stock
selection.
Of course, there are other ways of defining sectors and other headings under
which stocks can be grouped. Companies can, say, be defined as interest
rate-sensitive, early cycle, late cycle, established growth, emerging
growth, recovery candidates and so on. Some of these headings are more
useful than others. Some define ends rather than suggest means. Some raise
further questions.
Take a company, the profitability of which is sensitive to interest-rate
fluctuations, either for industrial reasons or because of its own financial
characteristics. It should benefit from falling interest rates - but only if
it has not been weakened fatally by the previous period of high interest
rates.
There are, though, two ways of defining stocks which have, in the past,
given some pointers to the chances of superior performance - dividend yield
and size of company. Even these, however, have proved unreliable in the face
of the length and depth of the recession.
Traditionally, higher-yielding portfolios have tended to perform better than
lower-yielding ones, despite being rated more lowly and, therefore,
considered more staid and slower-growing. This presumably is because more
highly-rated shares carry greater potential for disappointment while those
rated more lowly have a greater chance of pleasant surprises. It is really a
form of value investing, buying assets and earnings more cheaply in
less-favoured stocks.
For most of 1991 and 1992, however, the average UK equity income unit trust
underperformed the average UK growth trust. Moreover, despite recent
recovery, the Kleinwort Benson Topsi index of higher-yielding shares has
underperformed the FTSE-100 index substantially since the beginning of 1991.
Companies particularly sensitive to the economic climate (such as building
and engineering) tend to be well represented in the higher-yielding groups.
The old maxim, 'the higher the yield, the higher the risk,' applies to
shares as well as deposit accounts.
So what about size? The smaller the company, the greater its room for
growth. The Dimson-Marsh research (commissioned by Hoare Govett) shows that,
between 1955 and 1988, the average smaller company (as defined by the HG
Smaller Companies index) outperformed the market average (All-Share index)
by 6 per cent a year, displaying superior performance in four years out of
five. Since then, though, there has been an unprecedented four successive
years of underperformance. Even so, the long-term record of the smaller
companies sector should comfortably remain superior.
Recently, there have been signs of a return to favour of medium-sized and
smaller companies. If this is not another false dawn - and there have been
several as the recession has dragged on - then a prudently-constructed
smaller companies portfolio could produce above-average returns for
investors whose nerves have not been shredded by the depredations of the
recent years.

WOULD-BE tax-shelterers have reached the last chance saloon. Record sums
have flowed into the business expansion scheme this year on the back of
now-outlawed, loan-backed schemes; thus, the end of the tax year is quieter
than usual.
Total investment in the scheme so far this year is almost Pounds 900m,
compared with around Pounds 370m during 1991-92. But there will still be
many people who want to dive into a tax shelter at the last moment.
All the big sponsors, plus the most important intermediaries such as the
Allenbridge Group (071-409 1111) and BESt Investment (071-936 2037) will be
open during the weekend for those who have left it late.
Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge, estimates that the very last moment for
investing will be 5.55 pm on Monday when it would still be possible to fax
applications to a sponsor, or deliver them to a locally-designated
solicitor.
Deals over five years are now more generous than they were while loan-backs
were on offer, and there is plenty of interest in schemes which underwrite a
certain uplift and then allow the possibility of extra 'upside' if the
residential housing market performs better than expected.
But the best advice at the end of the tax year, as ever, is to play safe
and, if in doubt, do nothing at all. It is still possible to invest another
Pounds 40,000 by the end of December, and those who do not use up their BES
allowance this year can carry back some relief from the next tax year.
Enterprise zone trusts have operated over the past few years as a twin
market to the BES. This year, however, they are more like poor cousins. Very
little property is on the market, and this appears not to be selling
quickly.
EZ investment is as tax-efficient as the BES, with the added virtues that
there is no maximum annual limit and tax relief is available on loans taken
out to fund EZ investment.
But the underlying investment, commercial property, is much less flexible
because it, too, is afflicted by terrible market conditions.
Ian Pugh, of Allenbridge, points out that the yields available on EZ trusts
are running at around 7 per cent while commercial yields outside zones are
around 10.
Given that enterprise zones are unlikely to be in desirable areas, the
premium paid for tax relief is hard to justify. So, for the moment, there is
little case for a hasty EZ investment,

TESCO, the UK's second-largest grocery retailer, will be hoping to reassure
the City with a healthy rise in full-year profits on Tuesday. Its shares
have been under pressure on the stock market amid fears that its sales
growth is lagging behind that of rivals J Sainsbury and Argyll, owners of
Safeway. Most forecasts are clustered around the Pounds 580m mark, compared
with Pounds 545m last year, although some are as high as Pounds 585m.
Full year figures on Monday for 1992 from MB-Caradon, the building products
and security printing group, are expected in the region of Pounds 120m to
Pounds 125m, against Pounds 106.4m in 1991. Lower interest charges and a
solid performance from the managed businesses are behind the expected rise.
The main point of interest is how the group will reinvest the Pounds 473m
proceeds of the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox,
announced last Friday.
TIP Europe, the trailer rental company, is expected to announce
disappointing interim results on Tuesday. The company's Mobiel subsidiary,
which supplies temporary buildings in continental Europe, is understood to
have run into management and planning problems.
Analysts have downgraded forecast full year forecasts from Pounds 8.8m to
Pounds 6m while interim profits are likely to be about Pounds 2.4m from
Pounds 3m last time. The dividend is also in danger of being cut for the
third year running.
Sun Alliance Group, the composite insurer, is expected on Thursday to report
a loss for 1992 of around Pounds 150m, a recovery from a loss of Pounds 466m
a year earlier. However, it is likely to maintain the dividend.
Mirror Group Newspapers, buffeted by board room upheavals including the
recent departure of Lord Hollick, is forecast to produce on Monday pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 27m and Pounds 33m (Pounds 47.3m) for 1992.
Any comments by the management on editorial direction will be closely
scrutinised, particularly by the Labour party, which is worried that the
Daily Mirror might drift to the right politically.
First-half pre-tax profits on Monday from Highland Distilleries, maker of
Famous Grouse scotch whisky, will be boosted by the company's decision to
equity account its 35.4 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky
blender. However, analysts expect the underlying pre-tax figure to reflect
pressures on volume sales and prices of new and mature whisky. Forecasts
suggest the outcome will be between Pounds 13.5m and Pounds 14m, 5 per cent
to 8 per cent below last year's Pounds 14.7m.

FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Guarantees - are they worthless? /
Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at building society 'promises'
</HEADLINE>

WHEN the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society launched its Best 90
account in February, it gave a guarantee that it would pay the highest
90-day rate of any of the top 10 societies or Abbey National. The guarantee
lasts until at least May 1994.
But since none of them has yet taken up the challenge, C&amp;G has not had to
change the rates offered on Best 90's four tiers, ranging from 7.5 per cent
gross to 8.55 per cent.
Despite the lack of challenge, at least investors have a guarantee that is
worth something. In the building society deposit market, the word
'guarantee' appears to be, in too many cases, either worthless or
meaningless.
'Guaranteed differentials became fashionable in 1990 when the building
societies started to launch variable bonds,' says Christine Bayliss, of
Moneyfacts. 'Depending on what account they are linked to, they may be good
or not worth much.'
Many guarantees, for example, promise to pay a certain amount above the rate
for a selected account (chosen usually because the account does not pay a
competitive rate in the first place).
Alliance &amp; Leicester's tax-exempt special savings account pledges to pay 4
per cent above the society's ordinary gross share rate, now 0.5 per cent.
The society admits the latter is 'just about the lowest rate of interest you
can get on any account.'
The rate on the Tessa itself is 7.25 per cent, or 6.75 percentage points
above the ordinary share rate. Competitive pressure means that rates have to
be considerably higher than the guaranteed differential, effectively
rendering the guarantee meaningless.
Abbey National's first-issue Tessa also had a guaranteed differential, but
for a greater amount - 5.5 per cent - above the bank's Instant Saver
account, now paying 0.5 per cent gross.
Just when this was looking as if it might become useful, Abbey launched a
second-issue Tessa which pays 6.3 per cent on its lowest tier. Abbey has
abandoned the guarantee.
Woolwich launched a two-year investment bond in December which also
guaranteed to pay 'at least 4 per cent' above the society's ordinary share
rate of 1 per cent gross. The bond is tiered and its lowest rate is 7.5 per
cent gross.
So what is the point of the guarantee? 'It simply means that, whatever
happens, the rate will always be what we promise. It is a safety net,' says
the Woolwich.
Similarly, Bradford &amp; Bingley's two-year bond, launched last month, offers a
guaranteed 4.5 per cent gross differential over the rate on its basic
Timesaver savings account, which pays 0.5 per cent gross. Interest paid on
the minimum tier, starting with a Pounds 5,000 deposit is 7.25 per cent
gross.
Some accounts promise to hold a rate until a certain date. Yorkshire
building society today is launching a postal account paying competitive
rates of interest. The society guarantees to hold these until July 1.
Northern Rock's Go Direct postal rates were guaranteed to April 1 when the
account was re-launched at the beginning of January with 8.05 per cent gross
on the Pounds 2,000-Pounds 10,000 band. It was closed to new customers on
February 10.
'After the subsequent base rate cut and rumours of more to come, it was
reassuring to know that these rates would stay,' says Bayliss. 'However, if
the account was still open, people would still need to be mindful that these
rates were issued before the last base rate cut and could, therefore, be in
line for a sharp drop at the end of the guarantee period.'
Unfortunately, some guarantees are only as secure as the company that
provides them. Investors with Birmingham Capital Trust's 12 per cent
fixed-rate Tessa were transferred to a lower rate with another provider when
the loss-making account was closed at the end of last year.
