FT  24 JUN 93 / It's a matter of doing the splits: Reshaping Japanese party
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democratic Party has governed Japan for 38 years by hanging
together while its opposition fragmented.
During the 1960s the social change unleashed by Japan's rapid economic
growth gave birth to minor opposition parties - the Democratic Socialist
party and the Komeito (the Clean Government party) - which competed with the
well established socialist and communist parties.
Now the same process of fragmentation is affecting the ruling party.
The current breakaway moves, notably the launching yesterday of the
44-strong Rejuvenation party by Mr Tsutomu Hata, are a far more serious
threat to the LDP than the New Liberal Club, the only previous splinter
group. It was set up in 1976 with just six members who returned to the LDP,
tails between their legs, 10 years later.
The LDP is very different from what it was in the 1970s, when it was
governed by powerful patrons such as Mr Kakuei Tanaka who maintained party
discipline. Now the LDP's leadership is weak and unpopular. The split in its
ranks reflects deeper seated social change - the growth of a cosmopolitan,
urban electorate which the old LDP finds difficult to represent.
Yet there is little prospect of the Hata group becoming a leading party in
its own right. It lacks the funds to become a large party. The LDP plans to
borrow Y20bn (Pounds 125m) from banks for the election campaign. The Hata
group's members are busy arranging second mortgages.
Mr Kazuo Aichi, one of the group's leading members, said it would field only
60-70 candidates. He estimates 100 are needed to launch a major party.
Many Hata group members are young politicians with weak local organisations
thatcould be vulnerable to a concerted LDP attack.
Nor will it be easy for the Hata group to get across a clear message amid
the confusion of proliferating reform groups in and outside the LDP.
The risk for the reformers is clear - the welter of new parties could simply
split the opposition vote. The biggest loser in the election may not be the
LDP but the socialists as their more independent supporters may prefer to
vote for one of the new reformist parties.
The rebels recognise the risks, according to Mr Aichi, but they are united
by their determination to defeat the LDP and enact political reforms.
For all their determination, the opposition parties will need three further
developments to form a coalition to defeat the LDP.
First, they need an electoral pact to limit competition between themselves
and to maximise their joint chances of defeating the LDP.
Second, to create a coalition government, splits may be required in the
socialist ranks, to divide the hard-line leftists from the modernising
centrists. A hard-line minority in the Social Democratic party, which
opposes the Japanese security treaty with the US, would not accept a
coalition with the Hata group, which includes vociferous supporters of US
policy.
Third, the LDP must fail to attract away potential components of the
coalition. The LDP will respond to the challenge with a change of leadership
and perhaps ideas on reform, although not before the election.
The prospect of the socialists gaining power is likely to drive people back
towards the LDP. An LDP-led coalition, perhaps with the Komeito, may become
attractive to cautious voters who nevertheless want some change.
It is widely expected that whichever group emerges in power after the July
18 election first will have to assemble a coalition and then introduce plans
for political reform. Then another election probably would be called under
the new rules.
The main message of all this: Japanese politics will be unstable and
unpredictable for weeks to come.

FT  24 JUN 93 / US deplores 'outrageous' decision
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and the US yesterday deplored the Nigerian regime's annulment of the
elections earlier this month and both said they were reassessing relations
with the country.
In Washington, the State Department said all aspects of bilateral relations,
including US aid and the presence of an ambassador in Lagos, were under
review. Using unusually strong language, a spokesman read a prepared
statement describing the annulment as 'outrageous', given the elections were
considered by independent observers to be 'orderly, fair and free from any
serious irregularities'.
'We remain concerned about the continuing repression of the press and of
democratic forces,' the statement said. 'The failure of the military regime
to respect the will of the Nigerian people will have serious implications
for US-Nigerian relations.'
The spokesman said that bilateral aid - currently about Dollars 22m a year -
was at the top of subjects for review, as might be the Dollars 12m the US is
currently providing to finance the Nigerian-led peacekeeping effort in
Liberia. US pressure on the international lending institutions may also be
expected.
Last week Nigeria expelled a US diplomat from Lagos, inducing the US to
consider cancelling some exchange programmes.
The voiding of the elections in Africa's most populous country casts a cloud
over the Clinton administration's efforts to give a higher profile to the
continent's problems. This week Mr George Moose, the State Department's
divisional chief, has been in Angola, among other countries, seeking to
convey the message of greater US engagement.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said the UK would have no option but to
reassess relations with Nigeria. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to say
whether Britain might withdraw diplomats from Nigeria or downgrade
diplomatic relations in some other way. Mr Hurd said the general's decision
would increase tensions in the west African state and he urged all parties
to 'respond peacefully'.

election date

SOUTH AFRICA'S two most important black leaders, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, met yesterday for a long-awaited summit, but failed to
agree on the crucial issue of setting a date for the country's first
multi-racial elections.
After 10 hours of talks, Mr Mandela, leader of the African National
Congress, emerged grim-faced to say that the two men had not been able to
agree on an election date. The setting of a date, and the installation of a
transitional executive to oversee government before elections, are
preconditions for the lifting of international economic sanctions against
South Africa.
Mr Mandela had hoped to announce an election date when he visits the US next
week with Mr F W de Klerk, the president. He said he believed a breakthrough
on this issue could still be achieved in the 26-party constitutional talks,
but this seemed unlikely without the agreement of Chief Buthelezi.
Mr Mandela said the two men had made 'a great deal of progress' towards
ending political violence between supporters of the ANC and of Chief
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. They said they would address joint peace
rallies to persuade their supporters to cease fighting which has left over
15,000 people dead since 1984. In Natal province alone, 45 people died in
the three days before the talks. Both also committed themselves to banning
dangerous weapons at political rallies, a leading demand of the ANC.
The trial of three right-wing whites accused of murdering South African
Communist party leader Chris Hani was delayed yesterday to October 4, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg. Mr Hani was shot outside his suburban
Johannesburg home in April.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Nigeria suffers 'deficit of honour': The annulment of an
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE words of one of Nigeria's elder statesmen took on a prophetic note
yesterday as the country's soldiers postponed yet again the advent of
civilian rule.
'We have an administration in deficit: deficit budgeting, deficit financing,
deficit in honesty, honour and truth,' declared retired General Olusegun
Obasanjo, Nigeria's influential former chief of state, last April.
The transition programme, which envisaged a handover to a civilian
government next August, was 'a charade and a caricature of democracy',
continued the man who led Nigeria from 1976 until handing over to an elected
civilian government in 1979.
Some Nigerians may have de-murred at this scathing assessment of Gen Ibrahim
Babangida, the country's military leader since 1985. Events since the
presidential poll on June 14 appear to bear Gen Obasanjo out.
Gen Babangida's decision to annul the exercise leads most observers to one
conclusion: he had no intention of handing over power in the first place -
or at least not in this way, at this time.
For the fourth time the Babangida regime postponed the transition to
democracy and with each successive delay the Nigerian public and the
international community have grown more sceptical.
Nigerians had continued to tolerate falling living standards and deep-rooted
corruption in government in the hope that if they waited patiently until
August 27, the Babangida regime might keep its promise to make way for an
elected civilian government. That promise now seems to have been broken. Few
observers believe it is now possible to keep to the timetable.
Why he should wish to stay on is unclear - unless it is simply because he
has developed a taste for power. The economy, burdened by a Dollars 30bn
external debt, is in severe difficulties and the president's popularity has
plummeted.
Gen Babangida has yet to disclose his next move. Most observers however rule
out an indefinite extension of military rule. Aside from domestic
opposition, the climate of international opinion is heavily against it.
Since the superpower rapprochement, a democratically elected government is
seen as fundamental to good relations between donors and recipients.
Sympathetic treatment of Nigeria's debt problem is vital to the its
development. If key western governments, notably Britain and the US, do not
offer support at World Bank and International Monetary Fund board meetings,
further rescheduling of Nigeria's debt is unlikely.
Yet Gen Babangida, as shrewd a politician as he is, knows full well that
western governments will think carefully before applying too hard a squeeze.
Nigeria's stability is fragile. A further decline in the economy could well
exacerbate the tensions between the predominantly Moslem north and the
largely Christian south and the prospect of serious unrest in Africa's most
populous nation is alarming.
If Gen Babangida wishes to stay in office, opponents face a formidable task.
A veteran of past coups, as well as masterminding his own takeover in 1985,
he has gone to great lengths to protect himself. The army has been
restructured and key divisions relocated, including the shift of the army HQ
to the president's home town of Minna, within easy reach of the capital
Abuja.
At the same time the army's energies have been depleted or diverted. Last
year a military aircraft carrying more than 160 officers crashed near Lagos
and all perished. Meanwhile in Liberia, Nigerian armed forces are playing a
leading role in an attempt to bring peace to a country racked by civil war.
But the unsuccessful and enervating exercise has left the army 'bruised,
weakened and diminished', according to Gen Obasanjo.
One way out for Gen Babangida lies in the civilian-led transitional council,
chaired by Chief Ernest Shonekan.
Appointed last December, it was at first seen as a caretaker administration
whose main objective was to put the country's lapsed economic recovery
programme back on track and secure an early agreement with the IMF. So far
it has been an exercise in responsibility without power, with the military
obstructing vital reforms.
Were Gen Babangida to raise the profile of the transitional council and give
it effective power, reduce the number of soldiers in government, and lower
his profile by spending more time at his retirement estate at Minna, he
might defuse tensions.
But in the end he has to accept that the only way out is through the ballot
box. It may well be that Gen Babangida would like to emulate Jerry Rawlings,
the Ghanaian military leader who won the country's presidential election
last December. If annulling this month's presidential poll means there will
be a second campaign in a year or two, the general could be among the
contenders.
But until he shows his cards, his intentions are unfathomable. As Gen
Obasanjo put it: 'We have had President Babangida manoeuvring, manipulating,
playing the game his own way. . . When you talk of a transition programme I
will only believe it when I see it. . . The only programme in town is
Babangida's programme as he conceives it.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it was cutting the minimum lending rate
for banks by one percentage point to 16 per cent from today, Reuter reports
from Bombay.
Bankers said the central bank had apparently moved to reduce interest rates
and further stimulate the economy following the arrival on schedule of
monsoon rains and the reduction of inflation to less than 6 per cent.
Inflation as measured by the wholesale price index has come down to a
year-on-year 5.8 per cent from 13 per cent a year ago.
Business leaders said the interest rate cut appeared designed to refocus
attention on the economy at a time when Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao was
embroiled in allegations that he received an improper campaign donation from
a stock broker involved in the country's biggest financial scandal.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA IS likely to be given until the beginning of October to reach
agreement with Britain about Hong Kong's political development or face a
termination of the talks.
Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, flies to London next week for a
meeting of the British cabinet's Hong Kong committee on Wednesday which will
discuss a range of policy options, including the immediate cessation of
talks. The cabinet is, however, expected to allow them to continue until the
autumn.
Mr Patten will address the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's
law-making body, on October 5. At this time he wants either to unveil a
Sino-British agreement, or in the absence of an agreement, announce that
LegCo will be given the task of debating his proposals for wider democracy.
The tougher British stance comes amid a marked deterioration in bilateral
relations. Talks with the Chinese over the past three days in the Joint
Liaison Group (JLG), which is charged with negotiating the fine detail of
Hong Kong's reversion to China, were yesterday described by Mr Anthony
Galsworthy, Britain's chief JLG representative, as 'dismal'.
Mr Galsworthy said the Chinese may have thought that by 'going slow they can
put pressure on the UK in the wider context'. This would be a
'miscalculation,' he said.
He warned that China was damaging Hong Kong's future prosperity by its
refusal to take the JLG seriously. Britain had hoped China would approve the
expansion of the colony's container port, but China said it needed more time
to study the project and criticised Britain for not providing enough
information.
Negotiations in Beijing about the arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95
elections also appear to be getting nowhere. In these talks, the sixth round
of which began yesterday, Britain has made a number of proposals which the
pro-Beijing press in Hong Kong has described as 'deceitful demands'.
Britain has sought Hong Kong government participation in a 1996 committee
China plans to establish to prepare for Hong Kong's first post-colonial
government and legislature. This committee will vet the fitness for office
of senior Hong Kong government officials and those elected to LegCo in 1995.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador at Beijing and the head of the
negotiating team, has told the Chinese that if Beijing is serious about the
compatibility of the colony's pre-1997 political system with its post-1997
system then it has to discuss its plans for Hong Kong with the UK.
Meanwhile, in a move which indicates Beijing's pessimism about the talks,
China has announced the creation of a panel which will consider preliminary
preparations for China's resumption of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997.
The panel, headed by Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, consists of
27 mainland officials and 30 Hong Kong citizens, including property tycoon
Mr Li Ka-shing and Mr David Li, head of Bank of East Asia. It was widely
criticised by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong yesterday as being
unrepresentative of opinion in the colony.

However, it seems unlikely that the meeting will lead to an early cessation

likely to increase, notably in volatile Natal.
Chief Buthelezi said the meeting would have great symbolic significance. He
had, however, opened the talks with a lengthy memorandum listing personal
grievances against Mr Mandela and the ANC. He said they had assassinated his
character.

with huge public subsidies, dumping or other practices,' they said in a
formal statement.
'Before one condemns the US action, consider that it is a reaction to the
obscene level of subsidies in Europe, and the cartelisation of steel which
has led to massive dumping,' said Mr Alan Wolff, the leading lawyer for the
industry.
After its preliminary findings in January, the Commerce Department partially
rewarded British Steel's privatisation by dropping the initial 19.1 per cent
countervailing duty to 9.3 per cent in its final determination announced on
Tuesday.
This is more significant than the 109 per cent dumping duty on British Steel
products, which can be evaded if British Steel raises its export prices or
lowers its domestic prices. A countervailing duty to offset domestic
subsidies cannot be escaped unless the subsidies are reimbursed.
US steel prices will rise by next month, according to Dr Hans Mueller, a
private steel consultant. He said he expected the price for hot-rolled to
jump from Dollars 350 to Dollars 400-Dollars 410 per short tonne in July;
cold-rolled steel will jump from Dollars 390-Dollars 400 a short tonne now
to Dollars 480-Dollars 490 next month.
If the International Trade Commission finds that the US steel industry has
been injured by imports, then foreign imports will be almost totally
eliminated from the US market, Dr Mueller said.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, insisted that the findings had been
conducted 'in a fair and transparent manner' and that all information used
in making the decisions had been verified.

THE European Community steel industry accused US steelmakers yesterday of
launching a full-scale trade war with apparent government support and urged
the EC to use all legal and political ways to combat it, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The industry lobby group Eurofer said a co-ordinated protest should be made
against US trade practices at the G7 summit in Tokyo next month, in the
light of final anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed this week
against steel imports from a score of countries including seven states in
the European Community.
Eurofer said all legal and political means must be used by the European
Commission and EC national governments to confront the situation, which it
said risked severely prejudicing the outcome of the Gatt Uruguay Round and
of negotiations for a Multilateral Steel Agreement.
It said the duties announced by the Commerce Department on Tuesday were
unfair and resulted from 'largely arbitrary calculations which have no basis
in economic logic and are of a political nature'.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of BHP, the Australian steel and resources group, said yesterday
the company would continue vigorously to defend its markets following the
imposition of dumping duties on its steel products in the US, writes Bruce
Jacques in Sydney.
The action, announced by the US Department of Commerce on Tuesday, has
imposed a tariff of almost 25 per cent on certain BHP steel products.
'BHP supplies unique corrosion-resistant steel products to US markets which
it has developed and to markets which have not traditionally been attractive
to US steel makers. The tonnages involved cannot have caused injury to the
US domestic market.'
The BHP statement said the dumping margin announced affected only
corrosion-resistant products which accounted for annual exports of about
135,000 tonnes. This amount would not significantly affect BHP's total
annual steel exports, around 2.4m tonnes.
The Australian minister for trade, Mr Peter Cook, said the company had not
acted improperly and had a strong case to overturn the imposition of a
dumping margin.

FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: A restructuring in danger of being for
nought - The Slovak steel industry up against EC barriers / Trade Across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE official of the East Slovakia Iron and Steel works (VSZ) at Kosice was
pleased: 'If you know anyone who wants to buy a complete slabbing mill in
good condition, let us know, because from next year we won't need ours any
more.'
During the past three years, VSZ has invested more than Sk6bn (Pounds 143m)
to modernise production which by the end of 1994 will be fully based on
continuous casting. Restructuring has made the plant the most modern in
eastern Europe. Some western consultants believe it is one of the most
efficient in Europe.
However, quotas and restrictions on imports into the European Community
threaten to undo the achievements of three years of restructuring. Decisions
made 900 miles away in Brussels are causing problems for the company which
must pay back money borrowed for its modernisation and which will need to
borrow yet more - from foreign banks - to complete its restructuring
programme after its privatisation last year.
Managers say it is ironic that restructuring the plant was done partly to
meet western concerns about over-production. 'When we signed the (EC)
association agreement we guaranteed we would reduce (raw steel) production,
and introduce new technology to improve efficiency and quality, and raise
environmental protection,' says Mr Milan Uhliar, commercial director.
Raw steel production has dropped from 4.4m tonnes three years ago to 3.6m.
The workforce has been reduced with most cuts taking place in the steel
division which employs 11,000 compared with 15,000 in 1991.
Restructuring was done with the help of western consultants, contractors and
equipment. 'It's been good business for western companies,' says Mr Stefan
Link, head of the chairman's office.
But last year the company had to pull out of several hard-won contracts
because of EC restrictions. 'We had contracts, production was planned, but
then we got notice in August we would have to cut back to meet (EC import)
limits. We had to cancel the contracts, and of course it hurt,' says Mr Adam
Gasko, general manager of VSZ Inziniering, the engineering arm of the VSZ
group.
The fear in Kosice is that the Community will give in to growing political
demands for protection. The company says the collapse of traditional markets
in the former Comecon trade bloc, and a sharp decline of 20-30 per cent in
domestic consumption caused by recession and reduced demand from the weapons
industry - once a big customer - have left it with no alternative other than
to sell in the west.
Managers hope EC restrictions will be eased, but they are not optimistic.
Yet freer access to European markets is important for the company as well as
for the regional and national economy - making it a test of the Community's
stated commitment to encourage the development of market economies and
democracy in the former communist states.
VSZ accounts for more than 20 per cent of Slovakia's hard currency earnings;
it has 29,000 employees of which 24,000 work in Kosice where it provides
directly and indirectly a living for a large proportion of the regional
capital's 250,000 inhabitants.
The problem is that western Europe is in recession, which has encouraged
moves to protect domestic industries and jobs against non-EC producers.
Already, the former Czechoslovakia which split into separate Czech and
Slovak republics on January 1 this year, has faced tough EC import
restrictions. Yet in volume terms, Czech and Slovak steel imports into the
Community represent only a small proportion of EC imports.
'What Slovakia sells (to the EC) represents less than 1 per cent of the EC's
total consumption of flat (steel) products,' says Mr Uhliar.
EC quotas for this year will allow Czech and Slovak imports into the
Community to rise by about 36 per cent compared with 1991, but this is a
brutal cut on 1992 imports. Czech and Slovak imports of steel products into
the EC were 434,000 tonnes in 1991, rising to 798,000 tonnes in 1992. This
year's quota is 589,000 tonnes - a 26 per cent cut on 1992, though imports
will be allowed to grow in 1994, to 655,000 tonnes, and 1995, to 745,000
tonnes.
Last year, about 75 per cent of VSZ's production of flat steel products was
exported, nearly a third to the EC. German, French and Italian companies
complain they face unfair competition from low costs and subsidised east
European producers, but that accusation only brings a smile of derision from
Mr Uhliar. 'The position is exactly the reverse. Unlike in Germany where the
government gives money to (steel) companies, we don't receive anything. If
the state subsidised us as it is claimed, we wouldn't have any financial
problems.'

<TEXT>
A FRESH wave of 'ethnic cleansing' has created a refugee problem of huge
proportions in central Bosnia, local authorities said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Vares, Sarajevo and Zenica.
United Nations officials said it was due to a rush by Croats and Moslems to
consolidate their holds on disputed areas of central Bosnia as peace talks
got under way in Geneva.
The small Croat-held industrial town of Vares, 30 miles north of Sarajevo,
has been flooded with 15,000 Croat refugees who fled on foot from the
Moslem-besieged Kakanj area. The town's normal population is 12,000.
Simultaneously Bosnian Croat forces pushed Moslems out of villages they held
around Vares, and from the town of Kiseljak, just west of the besieged
Bosnian capital.
Bosnian radio reported 11 killed and 57 wounded in the fighting in the last
24 hours, although most front lines were quiet. The town of Zenica suffered
renewed shelling which killed nine people.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Brussels gurus raise old taboos to find mystery of job
creation: The search for radical and acceptable solutions to Europe's
growing levels of unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIDDLE-RANKING manager in a Belgian company on a gross salary of
BFr100,000 (Pounds 1,953) a month will cost his or her employer about
BFr250,000 a month and will receive in take-home pay only about BFr50,000.
To dismiss the same manager will cost the employer about three times the
employee's annual salary.
The European Commission's post-Copenhagen investigation of competitiveness
and job creation - due to generate several reports by the end of the year -
will not shy away from examining whether such high payroll taxes and high
costs of sacking personnel have contributed to Europe's high unemployment
levels.
But it is already clear that the Commission's brain-storming will not
conclude that the Social Chapter is a bad idea or that European countries
should slash their welfare states and adopt the 'hire and fire' policies of
the US labour market, where two-thirds of all employees can be fired at
will.
That does not disturb Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European
employers' body. He says: 'It is a gross over-simplification to place all
the blame for competitiveness problems on the Social Chapter and labour
market rigidities. It may not even be the most important part of the
problem.' He does, however, believe that radical questions should be asked
of all the institutions that help or hinder employment creation.
That means not only the familiar questions about whether employment agencies
are matching supply and demand and whether the unemployed have the required
skills. It also means, he believes, looking at the price of labour, in
particular minimum wage legislation and payroll taxes; the costs and
inflexibilities imposed by labour legislation; and the disincentive to seek
lower-paid work created by some welfare regimes.
The Commission's own agenda is not identical with Unice's but Mr Tyszkiewicz
does believe that 'people are now starting the ask questions that have in
the past been taboo'. The intellectual challenge for the EC's labour market
experts is to come up with a strategy which creates sufficient labour market
flexibility to make the unemployed 'outsiders' more attractive to employ
without undermining the rights of the already securely employed 'insiders'.
The EC has very little direct authority over labour markets, except through
its own minimum standard employment directives, but it can analyse best
practice across the Community and act as a clearing house for good ideas on
job-creation.
The Commission is unlikely to start advising member states to start
dismantling minimum wage legislation, but it will be examining some parts of
the 'deregulatory' agenda, especially in relation to why the European
service sector is not more labour intensive.
Two particularly important areas of inquiry are likely to be the scope for
reducing or shifting payroll taxes and the room for increasing 'atypical'
work (part-time, fixed contract and temporary work), especially in the
southern European countries.
In many of these areas the Commission will be pushing on an open door. The
Spanish government is deeply concerned about the high cost of firing and the
Belgian government is currently considering a large reduction in payroll
social security contributions in exchange for higher energy taxes.
Indeed, throughout the 1980s there has been a slow movement towards greater
flexibility across almost all EC countries. In the UK that has been
accompanied by a reduction in employment rights, through, for example, a
significant increase in the qualifying period for employment protection.
Such deregulation in the UK has been associated with a large increase in
'atypical' jobs, usually taken by women - but in fact many more such jobs
were created in Britain in the more regulated 1970s than the deregulated
1980s and 1990s. Other EC countries have also seen a big increase in
'atypical' jobs in the 1980s, but usually without the accompanying
reductions in employment rights. In the 1980s, both Germany and Spain
significantly relaxed the rules surrounding fixed contract and temporary
work.
In other areas, too, there has been movement towards Euro-flexibility. Italy
has abandoned indexation of wages and several countries have increased
flexibility on working hours, including Spain, France and Italy. Even in
countries with relatively tight regulation of working time, such as Belgium
and Germany, there has been a trade-off between reduced hours and more
flexible use of machinery.
One area where the Commission could now make a reforming gesture at little
political cost would be to speed up moves to allow the operation of private
employment agencies - which are still banned or severely restricted in
Greece, Italy, Spain and Germany.
The International Confederation of Temporary Businesses has made a formal
complaint to the Commission about the restrictions in Italy, Spain and
Germany, but has had little response.
In view of the new unemployment initiative, the organisation is stepping up
its campaign. It claims, for example, that 25 per cent of temporary workers
get permanent jobs and that the restrictions on agencies is costing 800,000
jobs.
Whatever the validity of such figures it seems certain that the
confederation's complaint will attract new interest over the coming months
as the Commission strives to shape the jobs debate.

FT  24 JUN 93 / US admits defeat on Dollars 4bn fund for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has been forced to concede that the promised Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) fund to assist Russian privatisation will get off to a far more
modest start.
Officials said yesterday that the best the G7 summit nations were likely to
agree in Tokyo next month was about Dollars 500m from themselves and a
further Dollars 500m from the international financial institutions.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, characterised the scaling
back as 'a phase one, a very substantial start'.
He said that at least the 'principle and importance' of the privatisation
fund would be established.
But his spokesman, Mr Mike McCurry, frankly conceded that the 'severe
financial constraints' of the other G7 nations had been a determining
factor.
The Dollars 4bn fund, to be financed equally by the G7 and the international
financial institutions, had been promised to President Boris Yeltsin by
President Bill Clinton at their Vancouver summit early in April on the
assumption that all participants agreed on its desirability and size.
But subsequent G7 negotiations - and sharp differences of opinion between
the US administration and the International Monetary Fund over the rate of
disbursement of aid to Russia - had called into doubt the ambitious goals.
On Tuesday, Mr Kaban Muto, the Japanese foreign minister, was quoted as
saying that a Dollars 4bn fund was 'preposterous' because Russians did not
understand the mechanisms of a market economy. Mr McCurry said the US was
seeking clarification from Tokyo of Mr Muto's remarks, as may Mr Yeltsin,
who is due to attend the Tokyo summit.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former Russian prime minister now visiting the US, said
in Washington yesterday that the privatisation fund was the most important
type of aid the West could provide.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Bundesbank accuses politicians: Bonn urged to show more
willing to push through spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday stepped up the pressure on the government and
opposition in Bonn to summon the political will to cut spending.
By damping inflationary expectations, and helping slow wage inflation, the
central bank had won an important battle, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the
bank directorate, claimed.
But the government's fiscal position had so far not improved, he said in
Cologne. The total public borrowing requirement this year would reach about
7.5 per cent of gross national product, equivalent to 90 per cent of
domestic savings, he said.
Although he appreciated the scale of the problems, he urged acceptance of
the Finance Ministry's proposals for cuts in all areas, including reductions
in the social welfare and unemployment budgets, so far resisted by the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
Final proposals, due within the next few days, 'can only be implemented if
the political will and readiness to co-operate are great enough', Mr Issing
said. Social cuts must be approved in the SPD-controlled Bundesrat (upper
house). The force of the arguments for deep cuts was underlined in the
Bundesbank's latest monthly report which showed how greatly government
borrowing had influenced growth in money supply. In the last two months for
which figures are available, the M3 measure, the most important factor in
formulating interest rate policy, has exceeded the target range.
According to the report, in the first four months of this year, total state
borrowing accounted for 50 per cent of all lending to non-banks. In the same
period last year, when M3 was already above target, the proportion was 20
per cent.
Meanwhile, growth in direct credit to the private sector had slowed from an
annual rate of 8 per cent in the first quarter of 1992 to 5.5 per cent in
the comparable period this year. Business and industry's bank borrowing had
grown 2.5 per cent. The Bundesbank appears increasingly anxious to resume
the cautious but consistent programme of small cuts in short-term discount
and Lombard lending rates which stopped last month after the scale of the
public-sector financing difficulties became known.
In a modest further move yesterday, the bank reduced the rate at which it
supplies funds to the money markets from 7.60 to 7.59 per cent. Although it
could not have been smaller, the cut was considered important by Frankfurt
economists in the light of the fact that it was the first change since May
12.
Although this hyper-cautious approach has been much criticised inside and
outside Germany, Mr Issing said some people tended to overlook that 'the
downwards direction had been unaltered throughout'.

FT  24 JUN 93 / German court rules on Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S constitutional court last night upheld the government's right to
keep German troops in Somalia, provided parliament agrees to it.
The court's decision, a victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), could pave the way for Germany gradually playing a
greater role outside the Nato area. It could also strengthen Germany's
position in its attempts to gain a seat in an expanded United Nations
Security Council.
Opposition to the court's ruling is unlikely since the three-party coalition
government agreed last month to send the troops.
The opposition Social Democrats last week asked the court for an injunction
against Germany's involvement on the grounds that the fighting had changed
the operation from a humanitarian to a combat mission. It argued that this
change of role violated the constitution, which limits any military
activities by the German military to Nato territory.
The government insisted the mission remained humanitarian. Germany has
deployed 300 troops in Belet Huen, north of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
An extra 1,400 troops are to be sent in mid-August.
The court's decision follows a similar injunction aimed at preventing German
pilots from flying air surveillance missions in Nato Awacs aircraft over the
former Yugoslavia, which eight judges overruled.
Earlier in the day, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, said the
UN would be undermined as a body if Germany decided to withdraw its troops.
Speaking in Bonn, he said: 'I hope the German soldiers will stay in Somalia
so that they will be able to continue their humanitarian action there in
favour of peace and security. Our success in Somalia is not a success for
peace as such, but a success for the actions of the UN as a whole.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE said yesterday it would send 1,200-1,300 more troops to the Sarajevo
region in Bosnia to back up the European Community's Copenhagen summit
pledge to protect Moslems there.
The EC pledge of men and money for United Nations peacekeeping in Bosnia had
been made at France's initiative, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur,
told parliament yesterday, and it was therefore up to France to set an
example. 'France believes that a significant (military) presence on the
ground, coupled with the maintenance of sanctions, is the only way to reach
a settlement of this painful problem,' he said.
The statement came as the French Defence Ministry announced that General
Philippe Morillon was about to be replaced as commander of UN troops in
Bosnia and would be given another prominent post.
Another senior French officer, General Jean Cot, would be assuming overall
command of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, replacing Sweden's General
Lars-Eric Wahlgren, the statement added.
France has the largest contingent of soldiers in the area, with some 5,000
serving in the 23,000-strong UN force.
The French reinforcements in Sarajevo will consist of 800 more troops to be
flown from France, and another 400-500 drawn from Zagreb and the
Serb-populated Krajina region in Croatia and from the north-west corner of
Bosnia around Bihac. They will join the 2,500 French troops already in
Bosnia. Mr Francois Leotard, France's defence minister, said the
reinforcements would be in place within two weeks, and would allow the UN to
redeploy Ukrainian forces from Sarajevo to other Moslem enclaves like
Gorazde.
President Francois Mitterrand seems to have taken his ministers and
officials slightly aback with his strong intervention in Copenhagen in
favour of EC states doing more in Bosnia. But the conservative government
has rallied swiftly around the Socialist president, with Mr Balladur saying
that 'cohabitation', far from weakening France, had strengthened its
international position.
French officials said that the Moslem community in Bosnia had to have some
military security if it was to be able to negotiate and sign any settlement
with the Serbs and Croats.
Mr Balladur yesterday again rejected the idea, canvassed by Germany in
Copenhagen, of selectively arming the Moslems to defend themselves. 'This
would put an end to any hopes of a peaceful settlement,' he told parliament.
In recent weeks, France had said it would not send any more troops to
ex-Yugoslavia, though it had also said it might redeploy troops from Croatia
to Bosnia.

MILAN'S new mayor, Mr Marco Formentini, has threat ened to expel illegal
immigrants from the city if national immigration rules are not tightened.
Milan, which has a severe housing shortage, is a magnet for illegal
immigrants, mainly from north Africa.
The recently-elected Mr Formentini is a leading member of the populist
Lombard League. He said that, in the interim, Milan could apply special
rules for companies wanting to employ immigrants. Those would require
workers from outside the European Community to have formal employment
contracts and would require employers to take responsibility for housing
them for up to six months.
Mr Formentini, a member of the lower house of the Italian parliament, has
recently appeared more moderate on sensitive issues, such as immigration,
than Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader.
However, his remarks, in his first newspaper interview since becoming mayor,
suggest immigration will be at the top of the agenda for League mayors, who
scored a string of victories across northern Italy in last weekend's second
round of local elections.
He dismissed claims by Ms Margherita Boniver, a former immigration minister,
that enforcing tough entry rules for non-EC citizens was virtually
impossible because of Italy's long coastline and proximity to north Africa.
'The problem isn't the long coast but short brains,' he said.
On the economy, Mr Formentini accused previous local administrations of
contributing to the current weakness of Italian industry.
Corporate competitiveness had been eroded by the existence of a 'perfect
oligopoly' among companies making rigged bids for big infrastructure
contracts which had 'degraded the whole system'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German industry federation (DBI) yesterday issued an outraged warning
against government plans to raise the tax on oil products following an
agreement by leaders of the country's coalition parties.
The BDI said a heavier tax burden on car drivers would be 'absolutely
counter-productive'. It warned that the move 'will sharpen the downturn in
the motor industry and will have negative consequences for the whole
economy'.
But the government, in desperate need of extra revenues, seems determined to
go ahead. Coalition leaders meeting representatives of their parliamentary
groups yesterday agreed to increase petrol tax by 16 pfennigs, from the
current 92pf per litre, starting on January 1. The diesel tax is to go up by
7pf from its current 54pf.
The government coalition is expected to ratify the planned increases
formally today, after which legislation will be introduced for parliamentary
approval.
It will also discuss a controversial plan to have motorists pay for using
the German motorway network through the use of a vignette (tax sticker)
which motorists would have to display.
The oil tax increases will raise DM8.5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) a year - funds to be
used for restructuring the loss-making railways and improving motorways.
Long-distance road hauliers are also up in arms against the planned increase
in the diesel tax, warning that 'it would destroy any positive effect' from
the deregulation of the EC road haulage market. The cabinet yesterday
approved a bill to extend health insurance to the 1.1m elderly and
chronically sick who need residential care and who are not covered by the
social welfare system.
The bill, which will go to parliament at the end of July, has encountered
fierce criticism from business and the trade unions.

'The problem isn't the long coast but short brains,' he said.
Citing his own experience in north African countries, he said: 'In front of
the consulates of other EC countries there were no queues. But there was a
queue in front of the Italian consulate. Visas were issued because Italian
politicians had private business dealings with the local authorities, in
exchange for offering the chance to emigrate.'
On the economy, Mr Formentini accused previous local administrations of
contributing to the current weakness of Italian industry.
Corporate competitiveness had been eroded by the existence of a 'perfect
oligopoly' among companies making rigged bids for big infrastructure
contracts which had 'degraded the whole system', he said.
Mr Formentini gave as examples recent tenders for foreign contracts by the
city's metro authority which had been about twice as expensive as those of
competitors.
The reason was that 'half the money was due to go in bribes'.
The election of Mr Formentini, sworn in as mayor yesterday, ended six months
of urban administration by a special interior ministry commissioner after
the collapse of the previous council.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Foreign holdings may cause burden on German bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are grounds for concern that 'massive' foreign holdings may one day
become a burden on the German bond market, the Bundesbank has warned, writes
Christopher Parkes.
In the four months to the end of April, non-German buyers accumulated a net
DM94bn (Pounds 37.7bn) of German paper, including DM65bn in public issues.
Public bonds were especially favoured by large institutional investors
interested less in long-term holdings than in the highest possible
short-term yields, the bank said in its latest monthly report.
In the light of their tendency to make the most of capital and foreign
exchange market movements, 'it is all the more important to maintain
confidence in the internal and external value of the D-Mark,' the bank
noted.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Soros resumes D-Mark attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Soros, the widely-followed financial speculator, has again talked
down the D-Mark with a declaration yesterday that Bundesbank resistance to
an early and substantial fall in German interest rates was futile, writes
Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
'I think they (the Bundesbank) are trying to accomplish the impossible and
they are now beginning to fail,' Mr Soros said in a speech to the US chamber
of commerce in Budapest. The Bundesbank, contending with a weak economy and
an overvalued currency, was like an emperor without clothes, he said.
The Hungarian-American financier judged that the Bundesbank 'refuses to
move' on interest rates in order to force the German government to tackle
the fiscal deficit and to maintain the external value of the D-Mark.
Mr Soros forecast, however, that the differential between US and German
interest rates would decline and said it was 'only a matter of time before
the markets begin to discount it'. Yesterday's comments on the D-Mark are
the strongest since Mr Soros argued earlier this month in an open letter
that German currency and bonds 'need to be sold'.
Mr Soros's investment announcements have moved markets in foreign exchange,
gold and UK property, and his earlier statement on the D-Mark turned
sentiment and prompted the currency to fall sharply.

<TEXT>
United Nations officials reported a new wave of 'ethnic cleansing' yesterday
in an apparent rush by Croats and Moslems to consolidate their holds on
disputed areas of central Bosnia as peace talks got under way in Geneva,
Reuter reports from Sarajevo and Zenica.
Although the front lines were mainly quiet, Bosnian Croat forces were
pushing Moslems out of villages they held around Vares, 30 miles north of
Sarajevo, and from the town of Kiseljak, just west of the besieged Bosnia
capital.
Moslem forces were simultaneously clearing Croats from recently captured
territory further west at Novi Travnik.
The town of Zenica suffered renewed shelling which killed nine people.
This was the second worst incident the town has suffered since the beginning
of the war over a year ago.
Residents of the housing estate where the shells fell said three shells were
fired from the Croat-held town of Vitez, seven miles to the south.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday accused the Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF), Bulgaria's main opposition group, of deliberately trying to stir up
social tension in the country.
'The UDF leadership is exporting its internal problems and attempting to
present them as problems of society at large,' the president said in
reference to anti-government rallies the UDF has organised in recent weeks.
But the president said the UDF, a loose alliance of 17 anti-communist
parties, was losing ground to the Socialist party (ex-communist) in the
latest opinion polls and had been unable to increase support in the country.
The UDF, whose one-year-old government fell last October after losing a vote
of confidence, has claimed that hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians have
attended its rallies during which the coalition has demanded that the
president resign and call new elections.
Independent sources say that only a few thousand people have attended the
UDF demonstrations and that many supporters have been bused into Sofia from
the countryside by the party.

FT  24 JUN 93 / Russians set for takeover battle: History is in making at
Vladimir tractor plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly privatised Vladimir tractor plant is likely to go down in history
today as the site of modern Russia's first corporate takeover battle.
At the company's first general assembly, Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, a Russian
graduate of Harvard Business School, will ask shareholders to elect him as
chief executive officer to replace its old-style manager.
Mr Bakaleinnik is one of the first private investors to want to invest in
Russian industry at a time when most Russian entrepreneurs and foreign
companies are frightened off by the risks and difficulties involved. He is
trying to increase his 8 per cent stake, saying he wants to overhaul the
company with fresh capital and know-how so that it can withstand the new
challenges of a market economy.
But Mr Anatoly Grishin, who has run the plant for 18 years, claims that his
rival, who was his deputy before he went to Harvard on a government
scholarship, has neither the 'moral right nor the qualifications to run the
company'. Fearing pressure from Mr Grishin on the workers, who own 51 per
cent of the shares, Mr Bakaleinnik will be asking for a secret ballot.
The government's chief aim in privatising 6,000 companies this year is to
improve their performance by freeing them from the heavy hand of the state,
exposing their management to market forces, and providing a vehicle for
badly-needed new funds.
So far, however, the main participants in the ambitious privatisation
programme have been existing management and workers, investment funds, and
citizens who have each received a voucher entitling them to Rbs10,000 worth
of state property.
Another exception to this rule is Mr Kakha Bendukidze, one of Russia's
wealthiest men, who last week revealed that he had bought 18.5 per cent of
Uralmash, a flagship of Soviet heavy industry.
Unlike most of his peers, Mr Viktor Korovin, Uralmash's very able manager,
has welcomed his new investors, saying that he looks forward to a 'mutually
enriching relationship'.
Mr Bendukidze, who made his fortune exporting oil products, chemicals and
other semi-finished goods, has met resistance from directors of other plants
in which he has bought shares. As a close associate, Mr Leonid Skoptsov, put
it: 'Under socialism factories were the property of the directors and they
don't want privatisation to change that.'

THE German cabinet yesterday approved a bill to extend health insurance to
the 1.1m elderly and chronically sick who need residential care and who are
not covered by the social welfare system.
The bill, which will go to parliament at the end of July, has encountered
fierce criticism from business and the trade unions.
The statutory scheme would be financed through increased national insurance
contributions from workers and employers. The financial burden on industry
is to be offset by making the first two days of sick leave unpaid. Up to six
unpaid days a year would be allowed.
The main business lobbies, including the German industry federation and the
employers' federation, have attacked the plan as an unwelcome burden in the
depths of a recession. Unions are also infuriated by the move on sick pay
and have warned they will protest against it.

A BITTER ROW over tariff protection for the US textiles industry yesterday
is threatening hopes that a big trade liberalisation package could be
presented for approval at the summit next month of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations.
The disagreements among trade ministers from industrialised countries
meeting in Tokyo also damped expectations that the long-delayed Uruguay
Round of talks on worldwide tariff cuts could be completed this year.
In the last 'quad' talks - involving the US, the European Community, Japan
and Canada - before the G7 summit, top trade negotiators maintained official
silence about progress. Talks continue today, with no formal statement
expected until this afternoon in Tokyo.
However, participants admitted privately last night there had been a
setback. 'The US and the EC have been unable to find a fit,' one said.
'There's a perception on everyone's part that the proposed package of tariff
cuts is unbalanced against them, and they are unable to go further.
'It is difficult to believe that anything can be salvaged, and that throws
into jeopardy the entire Uruguay Round,' he added.
Difficulties in the quad talks have cast a further shadow over the G7
summit, following the Japanese political crisis prompted by the government's
defeat last week in a vote of confidence.
Hopes of a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round talks, which have faltered for
two years, were raised at a ministerial meeting this month of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, when Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, noted: 'We are at last in striking distance
of the largest market access package in history.'
Sir Leon Brittan, his EC counterpart, said at the same time a 'ray of hope'
was emerging, and that a big market access package was a 'realistic aim'.
But in Tokyo yesterday, one participant said Sir Leon had effectively pulled
back earlier concessions, arguing they had originally been made on the
assumption of big cuts from the US on its high textile tariffs. These range
from 20 to 40 per cent. There had been hopes these would be halved on
average.
When the US textile proposal was received by the EC last Friday, it averaged
cuts of about a third, with many exclusions. 'The offer is simply
unsellable,' one participant noted yesterday. 'I don't think we will get any
further here. Mr Kantor has to go back to Washington and say there is a
failure in prospect if he does not get any more authority than he has now.'
Differences remain over Europe's refusal to eliminate tariffs on non-ferrous
metals, electronics goods, wood products and aluminium. Japan has been
praised for proposing deeper liberalisation of its financial services
sector, but is criticised for blocking elimination of tariffs on spirits and
wood products.
In an effort to act as peacemaker, Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister,
called on negotiators to aim for 'a realistic agreement, rather than 100 per
cent'.
One participant added: 'There is a significant danger that the G7 countries
will not have a concrete package either in services or in goods.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / Late Rosyth bid for Trident refit expected to fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO-YEAR battle over the future of Britain's naval dockyards reaches a
climax today with a growing assumption among politicians and defence
officials that Rosyth's eleventh-hour bid to win the Trident refit work will
fail.
There was widespread expectation that the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth
would be chosen to refit the new submarines.
MPs and ministers yesterday appeared resigned that the surprise cut-price
scheme submitted by Rosyth on Tuesday, which slashed more than Pounds 70m
off its previous investment plan of around Pounds 130m, would not succeed.
The ministerial committee, chaired by Mr John Major and involving a dozen
cabinet members, which is dealing with the issue spent almost two hours
discussing it yesterday. The feeling that Rosyth's new Pounds 60m plan had
arrived too late was reinforced by news that the committee will meet again
this morning.
However, Babcock Thorn, which manages the Rosyth yard, said last night it
had received no indication that its late bid had been rejected.
Downing Street signalled that the aim was for the cabinet to take the final
decision today about which yard should become the sole UK site for refitting
and refuelling nuclear submarines. On that basis, an announcement would be
made to the House of Commons this afternoon.
Rosyth's last-minute bid to swing the verdict involves only half the
investment cost foreseen in Devonport's latest plan.
But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, was believed to be reluctant to
consider such a bid at this stage. Defence officials indicated it could not
be accepted without asking Devonport to submit a bid on the same basis,
using an emergency dock to carry out part of the refit work. This would
entail further delay.
'We want to get on with this decision,' one Whitehall official said.
'There's an overwhelming desire to get it done.'
Scottish Tory MPs met the prime minister on Tuesday, after his return from
Copenhagen, to re-emphasise the case for Rosyth. Some of the MPs who have
been lobbying for Rosyth have been angered by the yard's tactic in making
the new offer, which is seen as weakening the earlier submissions.
Rosyth now has three proposals on the table: a fixed-price Pounds 267m plan
for completing a new twin-dock facility on a partly constructed site next to
the current dockyard; a Pounds 120m-Pounds 130m plan for upgrading existing
docks; and its latest Pounds 60m scheme.

THE RUSSIAN government is desperately trying to raise cash by pledging as
collateral metals in its strategic stockpiles. A central bank official said
yesterday the government was offering foreign traders 'everything including
rare earths and aluminium'.
A western metals trader said his company had been asked to advance Dollars
45m (Pounds 30m) by tomorrow against cobalt and nickel from the country's
strategic stocks. 'We are ready to do this but we want to make sure what we
get is not devalued by similar deals with other traders,' he said. Rare
earths are used by the petroleum, glass, ceramics and metals industries.
The move follows a Luxembourg court decision last week to freeze more than
Dollars 250m held in foreign bank accounts by Russian ministries, trading
associations and the central bank itself.
The accounts were frozen at the request of Switzerland's privately owned
Compagnie Noga d'Importation et d'Exportation, which went to court to
recover Dollars 250m in debts, plus damages, from the Russian government.
Mr Nessim Gaon, Noga's chief executive officer, said yesterday: 'We cannot
get any sense from anybody. I've wasted six months on Moscow and I was
forced to take action by banks (I owe money to) . . . They've got to
understand we are not a government but a private company.'
He said the debts included Dollars 250m for veterinary goods and soya meal
supplied in contracts concluded from 1991 to 1993. The goods were being paid
for with oil until Russia stopped the shipments. Mr Gaon said negotiations
had been dragging on since December. Russian offers of a settlement had not
materialised.
These even included a proposal to sell Noga debt owed to the former Soviet
Union by Nigeria. The deal fell through after Moscow failed to get the
consent of the Nigerian authorities.
The Luxembourg court is due to sit on July 5 to hear Russia's appeal against
the judgment. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign
economic relations, has claimed that Noga owed Russia damages for breaking
off unspecified obligations. Mr Gaon, however, said the accusations against
his company were 'just an afterthought'.
Although Russia has accumulated arrears with a number of creditors and
assets such as ships have been seized in retaliation, this is the first time
a creditor has managed to win a freezing of bank accounts.
This example of Russian debt difficulties combined with administrative chaos
comes as the country is poised to gain a new Dollars 1.5bn loan from the
International Monetary Fund and to negotiate billions of dollars in fresh
western aid at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo.
Only last week, the Russian government claimed it had Dollars 1bn from its
first IMF credit deposited with the Russian-owned Eurobank in Paris.
One cabinet member, who said he had been trying to find out whether that
money was being used, said: 'It's not quite clear who is responsible for
what these days.'

FT  24 JUN 93 / OFT to probe main tour operators: Inquiry into choice of
holidays offered by travel agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into whether the
three largest UK tour operators use their links with four of the country's
biggest travel agents to restrict the choice of holidays offered to
consumers.
The OFT said last night it would investigate the incentives offered by
operators Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad to travel agency employees to
sell their holidays.
It will also look at:
Agreements between tour operators and travel agents that restrict the sale
of other companies' products;
Whether independent tour operators are being prevented from selling their
holidays through the large travel agents' chains.
The inquiry is a challenge to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, who only four months ago rejected an OFT recommendation that the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigate the proposed takeover of
Owners Abroad by Airtours. The bid failed last March, allowing Owners Abroad
to link up instead with Thomas Cook, the travel agent.
The OFT said last night that although the Airtours takeover of Owners Abroad
did not go ahead, information received at the time had prompted it to look
at the industry as a whole. It said the current investigation - expected to
take several months - would be broader than the previous inquiry. 'That was
only one merger. This is an inquiry into the whole industry,' the OFT said.
Thomson, the biggest operator, owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel agents'
chain. Airtours owns Pickfords Travel and recently announced the purchase of
the Hogg Robinson chain.
At the time of the proposed takeover of Owners Abroad, small companies
opposing the bid said the five largest travel agents' chains - Lunn Poly,
Pickfords, Thomas Cook, Hogg Robinson and AT Mays - handled more than half
the holidays sold by travel agents, despite having only 26 per cent of
shops.
AT Mays is now the only one of the five not linked to a large UK tour
operator.
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators, last night welcomed the OFT's inquiry. He said small tour
operators were often asked for 15 per cent commissions from the large travel
agents' chains, compared with 10 per cent or less paid by large operators.
He said independent operators could either accept lower profit margins or
raise prices - making their holidays less attractive.
Mr Josephides said that, at the very least, the large agents should be
required to tell customers they were part of the same organisation as the
big tour operators and preferred to sell their holidays.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, questioned the need for a new
inquiry. He said: 'This was fairly well canvassed by the OFT at the time of
the bid. They made a recommendation to Michael Heseltine, who rejected it.
'The only thing that has changed . . . is that Airtours has acquired Hogg
Robinson, which was fairly well flagged.'

<TEXT>
FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services company, has started detailed
talks on taking a 'significant' stake in the Belgian state-owned savings
bank ASLK-CGER, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
ASLK-CGER has granted Fortis an exclusive but temporary right to negotiate a
deal, in preference to Belgium's largest bank, Generale de Banque, which had
also submitted an indicative, non-binding offer for the bank in May.
The Belgian government has said that it might be prepared to sell a majority
stake in ASLK-CGER. However, Belgian law would have to be amended to allow
this.
A 49 per cent stake in the Belgian savings bank could be worth up to
BFr33bn.
Fortis and ASLK-CGER said: 'Both parties are convinced that a possible
agreement between them would bring considerable opportunities, and open the
way for them to play a leading role in Europe while preserving the identity
and the operational autonomy of each company.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (12): Ambition and
motivation / Profile of Argentaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled banking corporation, issued 25 per cent of
its shares on the international and domestic markets in mid-May and as far
as investors are concerned it has become another big Spanish banking group
to be put alongside BBV, Santander and the other players in the domestic
system.
The track record by Argentaria shares since its Dollars 1bn placement has
been impressive. But now that is fully exposed to international fund manager
scrutiny, questions have already been asked about how much more can be
reasonably expected from an investment in Argentaria.
On its the first day of trading Argentaria's share value rose briskly from
its opening price of Pta3,800 to Pta4,305 before easing to Pta4,230 - a rise
of more than 11 per cent which indicated that the banking group had set an
intelligent premium. A month after the issue, in mid-June, Argentaria's
share price stood at Pta4,670.
The securities house James Capel has been one of the earliest to sound a
note of caution over the group's future progress. Its bottom line conclusion
is that Argentaria's share price has gone as far as can be reasonably
expected for quite some time.
The reasoning by Capel, and by other analysts, is that investors are not
doing themselves a favour if they begin to view Argentaria on exactly the
same terms as they might the big private sector banks.
Argentaria certainly looks like its rivals. At the end of last year it was
the third-ranked banking group in terms of total assets, behind BBV and BCH;
the third, behind BBV and Santander in terms of net income; the fourth,
behind BBV, Santander and BCH in terms of market capitalisation; and after
the May share issue, it was the third, behind BCH and BBV, in terms of
shareholder funds.
But such figures are deceptive for Argentaria is not like the other big
banking groups. It is essentially a corporation that was bundled together in
1991 by the Economy Ministry out of a series of state-owned financial
institutions.
Argentaria is the sum of Banco Exterior, the former export credit bank; of
Caja Postal, the savings bank linked to the Spanish Post Office; and of
three specialist banks that have established niches in the mortgage market,
in providing financial services to local governments and to the agriculture
sector.
The corporation's management is wholly market-orientated and it measures
itself constantly against its private sector rivals. Mr Francisco Luzon,
chairman, was the rising star of Banco Vizcaya and he moved, initially to
Exterior before the formation of the corporation, in the wake of Vizcaya's
1988 merger with Banco Bilbao.
Mr Luzon, widely considered to be the most professional domestic banker of
his generation, has attracted some 70 former Vizcaya colleagues over to
Argentaria to create one of the most dynamic senior executive teams in
Spanish banking.
The path ahead for Mr Luzon, as he moves to position Argentaria alongside
the private sector in terms of business mix and underlying profitability,
may be perfectly clear in the charts that he and his colleagues have
prepared but in practise it could come up against confusing signals.
Present profitability is not in doubt. Argentaria lifted its first-quarter
net profits by 14 per cent to Pta21.2bn. In 1992, its first full financial
year, it posted net profits of Pta67.4bn. What analysts are looking at is
where those profits are coming from and they are asking themselves whether
they are sustainable.
A close look at Argentaria's balance sheet suggests that Mr Luzon and his
team are delivering profitability through spectacular success in their
recovery of loans that had been written off by an apparently slack former
management. Last year such recoveries accounted for 31 per cent of the
group's pre-tax profits and a further 28 per cent of the profits came from
recoveries of overdue interest.
What has happened so far is, essentially, that a group of highly skilled and
motivated market professionals has been put to work on a number of state
enterprises that were underperforming if not virtually dormant.
Capel's contention is that very substantial input to the group's income from
loan loss recoveries will inevitably decline as the Mr Luzon's aggressive
'recoveries team' works its way through the backlog of neglected claims.
Mr Luzon and his team are nevertheless confident. They set great store by
the cross-selling possibilities afforded by the group and already they have
successfully combined the strong network of Caja Postal retail outlets with
the large home-buying client base of the group's Banco Hipotecario mortgage
unit.
They also see growth in the group's securities house, Argentaria Bolsa,
which posted a 40 per cent increase in its trading volume last year, and in
the mutual funds managed by the group's insurance unit. Argentaria ranked
only fifth last year in terms of funds under management and it plans to
raise these this year by 40-45 per cent from their current level of
Pta330bn.
Argentaria's management cannot be faulted on ambition and motivation. Mr
Luzon and his colleagues have to score highly on both because they view last
month's successful share issue as only the first step in a continuing
privatisation process.
When Argentaria comes round to placing more of its equity, it will be the
markets, not the analysts, who will be judging the group's soundness.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (4): Equities buzz
phrase - Blue Chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUZZ phrase for those who intend to stay in the Spanish equities market
is to go for the interest rate-sensitive sectors. They stand to make gains,
always presuming that the cuts do occur, well before the industrial cycle
recovers.
This means banks - and particularly Santander, Popular and Bankinter, a trio
that can represent up to 30 per cent of any Bolsa strategy model. These are
the high yielding equities in which every investor who was able to took up
positions as far back as anyone can remember.
Those seeking to spread the banking group representation have begun to
include Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) mostly on the basis of its improving
results, and Argentaria, the newcomer this year to the Bolsa which issued 25
per cent of its equity in May.
Although not a significant beneficiary of lower interest rates, Argentaria
is living a honeymoon period with the market and there has been a
considerable post-issue net flow from domestic retailers, who were favoured
by the placement, towards foreign institutions. This is not surprising for
foreign interest was very high during the public issue with international
investors subscribing 10.6 times the shares on offer.
It is believed that international investors may now hold between 14m and 15m
ordinary shares in Argentaria up from the 11.7m that were offered in the
global tranche. This would represent close to 50 per cent of the equity that
was issued and, according to Morgan Stanley who acted as Argentaria's global
co-ordinators, the proportion could rise to 60 per cent.
The Autopistas, the Spanish toll motorways, have consistently been
investor-friendly stocks. They are obvious interest rate cut winners and
they should benefit too, through an influx of tourism, from the peseta
devaluations of the past months.
Meanwhile there is a mix of feelings about the three staple ingredients of
all Spain portfolios: Telefonica, the telecommunications group; Tabacalera,
the state-controlled tobacco company; and the energy conglomerate Repsol.
Telefonica posted a healthy 5.9 per cent net profit rise in the
first-quarter result but there are market misgivings about the potential
impact of European Community deregulation on the government-controlled
telecommunications monopoly. Investors were not reassured by the
government's approval of telephone tariffs which fell short of what
Telefonica had hoped for.
Tabacalera faces just as many imponderables. The market has already
discounted the possible sale of its food division Royal Brands and it sees a
less-than-clear strategic direction in the months ahead in spite of a lot of
talk about returning to its core tobacco business.
In theory, Tabacalera is a candidate for partial privatisation but its
first-quarter results were as disappointing as those of 1992. Cigarette
sales dropped by 15 per cent in the first three months. This was not because
Spaniards have cut back on smoking but because a January tax increase has
prompted a massive increase in cigarette smuggling.
Repsol, in contrast, delivers sustained good feelings. The most
high-profiled of all Spanish equities, Repsol was able to waive a discount
when it raised nearly Dollars 1bn in an April global offering to
institutional investors.
The offering reduced the government's holding in the energy group by 13.3
per cent to 41.1 per cent and it raised to 33 per cent the equity held by
foreign investors. The good news that shareholders received at Reposl's
annual general meeting this month, apart from the forecast of improved
results, was that the 1992 payout will be raised to 43 per cent - it was 42
per cent in 1991 - and that it will be gradually increased to 50 per cent.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond find 'world
class'
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia-Met Minerals, have
moved one step closer to building North America's first diamond mine in the
Lac de Gras area of the Northwest Territories.
The two companies said that they planned to erect a pilot recovery plant in
the area early next year to analyse a bulk sample of between 5,000 and
10,000 tonnes of ore. Depending on the results, these tests would be
followed by a full feasibility study for a mine. Lac de Gras is just below
the Arctic Circle, about 320 km (200 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the
territories' capital.
The decision to go ahead with such a large sampling programme is based on
the results of drilling last winter which appear to confirm a sizeable
diamond deposit. Analysts at Pacific International Securities in Vancouver
said yesterday that the grade of ore recovered from one of four kimberlite
pipes at Lac de Gras 'puts it into the league of world-class diamond pipes'.
Despite such enthusiasm, Dia-Met's shares tumbled by CDollars 9 to CDollars
57 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The share price
had tripled in the past year in anticipation of positive results from Lac de
Gras.
According to BHP and Dia-Met, a total of 206 carats were recovered from just
over 400 tonnes of ore extracted from the four pipes. The results include
only stones with a diameter of more than half a millimetre.
The companies said that they had found several gem diamonds in the one to
three carat range.
The proportion of gem diamonds ranged from a low of 6 per cent in pipe
number two to 31 per cent in pipe four and 33 per cent in pipe three.
Pipe four contains a grade of 17.5 gem carats per 100 tonnes. Pacific
International estimates that this is nearly double the grade indicated by a
sample recovered from the nearby Point Lake property in late 1991 which set
off the diamond stampede in the Northwest Territories.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government has announced changes in income tax rules
to encourage diamond exploration. Developers of diamond mines will in future
be entitled to accelerated depreciation of capital costs, while exploration
companies will be able to finance their work by means of 'flow-through'
shares which offer substantial tax benefits to investors.

controlled by Mr James Ting, who is also chairman and chief executive of
Hong Kong-listed Semi-Tech, and Singer, which is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Semi-Tech said it would use the proceeds of the sale to develop G M Pfaff of
Germany, Europe's leading sewing machine manufacturer, in which it has a 51
per cent interest, and Sansui, a Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer.
ISTM is paying USDollars 33.50 a share, compared with Singer's closing price
in New York on Monday of Dollars 35 1/8 .
Semi-Tech said the sale was not outside the group and that current business
relationships between Singer, Sansui and Pfaff would not be affected by the
deal.
Mr Ting said yesterday that the sale of Singer represented a logical
development for Semi-Tech which he described as 'in-house investment bank'
to the group which invests in sound businesses requiring restructuring.
'We want to re-create another Singer in Sansui and Pfaff. In addition, we
will attempt to refocus our near-term investment and acquisition strategy on
the high-growth Asia-Pacific region, including China.'
Last week in the US, Semi-Tech reached a HKDollars 730m out-of-court
agreement with Bicoastal Corp, the former owner of Singer, for settlement of
certain disputes between the two arising from Bicoastal's 1989 sale of
Singer.
The purchase by ISTM of Semi-Tech's interest in Singer will be funded by
USDollars 300m of borrowings and the issue to Semi-Tech of 'A' shares in
ISTM to the value of USDollars 55m.
The issue of these shares will be underwritten by a group led by Dominion
Securities.

NIPPON Steel is to take a 10 per cent stake in the Bulga mine, a New South
Wales coal operation within the Oakbridge coal mining group, AP-DJ reports
from Sydney.
Oakbridge said Nippon Steel would bring 'obvious financial strengths' to the
venture and is expected to commit to 'significant coal purchases' from the
Saxonvale-Bulga mine in the Hunter Valley region.
The Australian company said it was holding negotiations with the hope of
securing a third equity partner for the Bulga venture.
Oakbridge said it is proceeding with an expansion plan at the
Saxonvale-Bulga mine aimed at doubling annual coal production to 6m tonnes a
year by 1996.
Oakbridge is 40 per cent-owned by McIlwraith McEarcharn. Cyprus Minerals of
the US took control of McIlwraith earlier this year in a takeover bid which
valued McIlwraith at ADollars 82m (USDollars 56m).
The price Nippon Steel is paying for its Bulga stake was not disclosed.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Packard Bell and ZDS to form
alliance

<TEXT>
ZENITH Data Systems, the microcomputer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and
Packard Bell, a leading US manufacturer of low-cost personal computers, are
forming a strategic alliance to improve the competitiveness of both
companies in desktop and notebook computer markets.
Groupe Bull said yesterday it was taking a 19.9 per cent stake in the US
company to mark its commitment to the deal. It refused to disclose the value
of the stake.
Under the terms of the alliance ZDS and Packard will jointly design and
manufacture desktop PCs, giving both companies the benefit of their combined
engineering expertise and the high-volume, high efficiency manufacturing
techniques used by Packard Bell.
The US company is an acknowledged expert in mass marketing through direct
channels.
ZDS will supply Packard Bell with private label versions of the French
company's well-regarded notebook and subnotebook computers.
The US company already has an agreement with IBM for the supply of
badge-labelled notebooks but Mr Jacques Noel, ZDS chief executive, said the
deal with Packard Bell would not affect it, nor Groupe Bull's equity
relationship with IBM. The agreement with Packard Bell would enable it to
find economies through greater manufacturing volumes.
ZDS, at that time a US-owned company, was a pioneer in low cost PCs but has
been losing market share to Compaq and Apple in recent months. Its market
share at present is about 8 to 10 per cent. Mr Noel thought it could be at
least double that figure.
Mr Beny Alagem, Packard Bell president and chief executive, said the
company, with sales of Dollars 930m last year, had less than a 5 per cent
share of the portable market and it was important it increase its share. The
Bull deal would lead to an expansion of its assembly and test operations in
The Netherlands.
The company is a leading supplier of low-priced 'clones' of IBM's market
leading PC designs. It is the third-largest US supplier in unit terms of
PCs, according to market research organisation International Data
Corporation.

CELSIUS Industries, Sweden's newly-privatised defence group, yesterday
unveiled profits after financial items of SKr205m (Dollars 27.13m) for the
first four months, up SKr10m from the same period in 1992.
The company, whose shares will be traded on the Stockholm stock exchange for
the first time today, benefited from cost-cutting and disposal of the
lossmaking piping installation company Calor Vanadis.
It said the figures increased its confidence it would at least equal last
year's profit of SKr545m.
Considerable streamlining before privatisation largely explains a 17 per
cent drop in sales to SKr3.34bn. The group sold Calor Vanadis and Calor VVS
at the end of last year and acquired the defence electronics activities of
Nobel Industries - now known as Celsius Tech - in February.
The most disappointing performance came from arms maker Bofors, where sales
fell to SKr1.12bn from SKr1.48bn and profits dropped to SKr56m from SKr87m.
Celsius said the fall was 'temporary' and partly because series production
of a new combat vehicle, the CV 90, was about to get under way.
The high-technology units FFV Aerotech and Telub produced a combined profit
of SKr89m, up from SKr68m, helping to offset the drop in Bofors profit.
Submarine company Kockums saw profits weaken to SKr80m from SKr88m.
The Celsius share offer, Sweden's biggest privatisation, was heavily
oversubscribed. The group has 56,000 shareholders, but the state remains the
largest with a 25 per cent stake.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Citicorp, Chase apply to open
Russian operations
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP and Chase Manhattan, two of the largest US banks, have applied for
banking licences to operate in Russia as part of a strategy to strengthen
their east European presence.
The licences would be the first granted in Russia to US banks, and would
follow one given last August to Credit Lyonnais to open a full subsidiary,
and to Bank Austria to open a branch. Both Citicorp and Chase have
representative offices in Moscow.
Chase Manhattan said it had obtained internal approval to set up the
subsidiaries, while Citicorp is understood to be going through the process
to obtain board approval.
Mr Mikhail Pomazkov, head of foreign banking operations at Russia's central
bank, said it had signed letters of intent with the banks. He forecast that
the licences might be granted by the end of 1993.
The banks would be capitalised at Dollars 5m each, the minimum required for
foreign banks to operate in Russia. Unlike representative offices, they
would be able to provide local banking services, such as granting letters of
credit, settle payments, and take deposits.
Mr Richard Lowry, senior vice-president at Chase in London, said the
subsidiary would initially serve European and US customers, with a number
already interested in Russia's oil, metals and mining industries. Chase's
representative office, in Moscow for more than 20 years, has up to now
mainly helped Russia in dealings with international financial markets.
Mr Lowry believed Russia was likely to limit the number of foreign banks
able to operate in the country, and the decision to seek a licence was 'a
tactical move to get to the front of the queue'. Chase intended to open one
subsidiary concentrating on corporate finance, and was 'highly unlikely' to
open a retail bank.
Citicorp was likely to follow a similar strategy, said an official.
Citicorp has branches or subsidiaries in Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Poland, believing that the market opening of eastern Europe offers
profitable opportunities in corporate banking. It has no immediate plans for
a retail bank.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kmart warns of sharp fall in
profits

<TEXT>
SHARES in Kmart slumped to a new 52-week low yesterday after the US discount
store and specialty chain retailer warned that second-quarter earnings would
be 'significantly' below the 37 cents a share earned a year ago.
And Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said it was now 'probable' that earnings
for the full year, to the end of January 1994, would fall below last time's
Dollars 2.06 a share.
He blamed the late arrival of summer weather in the US, plus cautious
consumer spending, for disappointing clothing sales in the second quarter.
With a greater share of Kmart's sales coming from lower margin 'hardline'
goods, and further losses at the PACE warehouse club division, he said
second-quarter profits would fall year-on-year.
Thereafter, he predicted a pick-up in profits, topping the results seen in
the second half of 1992-93. However, the improvement in the second six
months would be unlikely to compensate for the profits shortfall suffered
during the first half of the year.
This is the second successive quarter Kmart has fallen short of analysts'
expectations and been obliged to warn the stock market ahead of its results.
It warned of a shortfall in first-quarter results in April, again blaming
the weather, and eventually reported earnings per share of 11 cents (before
extraordinary and accounting-related items). This compared with 26 cents in
the first quarter of 1992-93. Analysts had been hoping for about 40 cents a
share in the second quarter, a modest increase on last time.
Kmart is engaged in a costly revamp of its core discount store chain. The
company maintains the results from overhauled stores have been good, but
Wall Street is waiting to see concrete evidence of the benefits.
Kmart shares, meanwhile, have gone nowhere for the past 18 months. At the
close in New York yesterday they were Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 20 1/8.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aegis pays Pounds 3.62m compensation to
former directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE FORMER directors of Aegis, the media-buying and planning group,
received total compensation of Pounds 3.62m for their loss of jobs a year
ago.
The two biggest beneficiaries were Mr Charles Scott, former chairman, who
received Pounds 2.25m and Mr David Reich, who got Pounds 1m. Mr Charles
Stern, former finance director, received Pounds 370,000.
Accounts for the 1992 year showed that directors' emoluments ballooned,
reaching Pounds 2.3m against Pounds 1.64m, largely a result of pay increases
but also because of boardroom upheavals which saw Mr Scott ousted in June
1992.
As a result of his departure the board swelled to 15 for part of 1992. It is
now back down to 12, half of those being non-executive positions.
The wages bill also mushroomed in 1992, totalling Pounds 68.3m (Pounds
49.1m).
Companies within the Aegis group have notched up two significant account
wins in the last week. On Monday BBJ UK won Premier Brands. Last week HMS
Carat, Aegis' operating company in Germany, captured Volkswagen's German
media-buying account. The VAG group - of which Volkswagen is a part - spent
DM160m (Pounds 64m) on advertising in Germany in 1992. Aegis could receive
Dollars 3m (Pounds 2.6m) in gross revenues.

<TEXT>
PROFITS at Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest bank, grew at 'a
double-digit rate' in the first five months of the year, the bank's chief
executive said yesterday, writes David Waller.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen did not go into details, but said that the growth  -
which follows an increase in operating profits of more than a quarter in the
first three months of the year - was more due to strong trading gains than
an increase in interest income.
The comment shows the continuing prosperity of the German banking sector in
terms of total operating profits, which include gains from own account
securities dealing. But the figure takes no account of provisions against
bad and doubtful debts.
Commerzbank's shares have risen against the market in recent weeks. Although
the bank, almost alone among big German financial institutions, could be
vulnerable to a takeover, Mr Kohlhaussen said yesterday there were was no
evidence that a third party was accumulating shares.

factory 'copying'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN has failed to convince General Motors that its plans for a
revolutionary car plant in Spain are not a copy of a project drafted
previously by the US group.
'We have a right to be sceptical,' Mr David Herman, chairman of GM's German
subsidiary Adam Opel, said yesterday. 'It would be a real tour de force' if
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief who is now
at VW, had managed to develop a new concept between mid-March, when he left
the US, and mid-June when he announced VW's plans.
Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said the German company did not have any
confidential plans or documents about GM's ultra-low-cost factory project.
Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez's
announcement, suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW's
project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez's direction.
At the time Mr Herman wrote, German state prosecutors were investigating the
US group's complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents
with them when they absconded to VW. The German company has consistently
rebutted the charges.
It will be extremely difficult for Adam Opel to show a profit this year, Mr
Gail Gunderson, finance director, said yesterday. Confirming a slump in net
earnings to DM202m (Dollars 119m) last year compared with DM1bn in 1991, he
said he expected 1993 turnover to fall 18 per cent to about DM24bn.
The company had been profitable in the first five months, Mr Gunderson
added.
According to Mr Herman, German registrations of new Opel brand vehicles had
fallen 21 per cent to 244,000 in the first six months. Production in the
German concern had dropped 15.6 per cent to around 500,000, while deliveries
fell from 670,000 to 568,000.
He could not see any grounds for optimism in the second half. 'On the
contrary, we will have to adjust production in our works to further falls in
demand,' he said.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Threat to aid may complete Sierra Leone's misery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODORE LIASI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIERRA LEONE, though rich in diamonds and other minerals, is ranked second
last by the United Nations in its latest human development index, with a
worse quality of life for its citizens than anywhere in the world except
neighbouring Guinea.
Endemic diamond smuggling, four military coups, a festering civil war and a
withdrawal of some western aid following human rights abuses have left the
populace dependent in large measure on non-governmental aid agencies.
Even this may be in jeopardy. The finance ministry has threatened to
introduce a levy on all imports, including relief aid. The Red Cross has
warned that it would be forced to withdraw from the country if aid was not
exempted.
As the number of refugees fleeing fighting in the eastern and southern
districts increases - it is put at 1m - huge camps have appeared, each
housing up to 20,000 people in makeshift huts and disused buildings across
the country. With the onset of the rainy season aid agencies fear the
temporary housing - usually constructed out of grass reeds - will be washed
away.
As Mr Joseph Quam, eastern co-ordinator for Unicef, which plays an integral
role in the distribution of food, medicine and clothing, explains, the
relief programme should be making way for the next phase of rehabilitation.
'We keep pushing back the relief phase. We thought that by now we would have
finished with relief and moved to rehabilitation, of which there is a lot to
be done.'
Consequently, the relief programme will have to continue at least until the
end of this year, and the relief agencies are concerned that they will not
be able to guarantee resources for the duration.
Sierra Leone, a former British colony of 4.7m in a country the size of
Scotland, has entered its second year under a new government following the
overthrow of President Joseph Momoh in a bloodless military coup in April
1992.
The National Provisional Ruling Council, led by 27-year-old Captain
Valentine Strasser - known as 'the Redeemer' - on seizing power vowed to
eradicate corruption and nepotism. But there is still little to cheer about.
Smuggling of diamonds remains commonplace, and recent incursions by rebel
forces into mining areas have also interrupted operations.
Last Christmas saw the summary executions of 26 alleged rebels. This
resulted in Britain suspending economic aid. The EC has also been reviewing
its position. The government says human rights abuses under the old regime
were ignored by the west.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Germany's hauliers condemn EC plan

LONG-DISTANCE road hauliers in Germany yesterday issued an angry
condemnation of the move to deregulate the European Community road haulage
market, and warned that it would unleash 'ruinous price competition'.
In a statement issued three days after the agreement reached by EC transport
ministers in Luxembourg, the German national federation of road hauliers
said much cheaper road transport charges would lead to a big switch in goods
from rail to road transport, with serious environmental consequences.
The hauliers are concerned that the agreement will lead to intense price
competition in Germany, where the market is dominated by small and
medium-sized businesses which could be undercut by larger and more efficient
European operators.
The long-distance road hauliers said that the tax burden on German operators
would almost certainly be aggravated.
The Luxembourg agreement aims at the effective deregulation of the EC road
haulage market by 1998, with any EC operator allowed to tender for business
in other member states.
In exchange, Germany, the Benelux countries and Denmark have agreed to
introduce a regional vignette (tax disc) for cross-border lorries, to help
equalise the tax burden between them.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi owes foreign banks Dollars 4.25bn, minister says
</HEADLINE>

FERRUZZI, Italy's troubled industrial group, owes foreign banks about
L6,500bn (Dollars 4.25bn) Mr Piero Barucci, Treasury minister, told a
parliamentary committee in Rome yesterday. The group said last month its
total borrowings approached L31,000bn.
Mr Barucci warned of the dangers to Italy's credibility in international
financial markets if the crisis at the company were allowed to reach the
proportions of last summer's collapse of the Efim state holding company,
which has total debts of more than L15,000bn.
He said about 110 foreign banks had lent to Ferruzzi, but did not name them.
The fact that Ferruzzi is one of Italy's most international companies,
especially on the agro-industrial side, explains the large number of foreign
banks involved.
Bankers in Milan suggested the biggest exposure could be among French
institutions, given Ferruzzi's traditional interests in that country. The
group controls Eridania Beghin Say, the agro-industrial concern formed in
1991-92 from the merger of Italy's Eridania with Beghin Say, the diversified
French sugar company which is indirectly controlled by Ferruzzi.
The spread of Ferruzzi's operations and its voracious financing needs
implies many other leading international banks might have been big lenders.
Mr Barucci sought to calm fears in parliament that the problems at Ferruzzi
implied a collapse. 'Ferruzzi is Italy's second biggest conglomerate and its
activities touch on strategic areas for the country', he said.
It is therefore urgent to intervene, not just in the group's own interest
but especially to avoid any risk to the credibility of Italy as a whole'.
He emphasised the group was still trading actively and was 'industrially
healthy'. Bankers said Mr Barucci's stress on acting quickly to solve
Ferruzzi's debt problems was coloured by his experiences during the Efim
affair, and the previous year's collapse of the Federconsorzi farm service
group.
Both episodes triggered a bruising battle of wills between foreign bank
creditors and the Italian authorities.
The Efim debacle in particular, marked by confusing messages from the
government and indications that the Treasury would not fully honour group
debts, tarnished Italy's reputation just as the lira was coming under
mounting pressure before last September's currency crisis.
The share price of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company fell by more
than 12 per cent to L559 yesterday. Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director
of Credito Italiano said his bank's exposure was about L1,300bn, AP-DJ
reports from New York. Despite the scale of Ferruzzi's difficulties he said
he was optimistic about the outcome of the situation.
He said although the Ferruzzi family hoped to keep control of Eridinia
Beghin-Say, 'everything else is up for sale'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (15): Tasteful
attractions for visitors - Stewart Dalby inspects hotels in the north-west
region, samples the cuisine in the city's restaurants and looks in at the
theatres / Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE prospect of Greater Manchester and the north-west region hosting the
2000 Olympic Games is dominating discussion in the local tourism industry.
What are the attractions of the area when there are no sporting events to
watch? What are the entertainments in the evenings? What is there to do at
weekends? Are there enough quality hotel rooms? Are there good restaurants?
Manchester has been developing its tourism assets and attractions for some
years. As with other old manufacturing cities, like Glasgow, it has realised
tourism can become an important services sector, a good revenue-earner and a
large employer.
Manchester is well endowed with restaurants. The city claims it is possible
to eat in a restaurant offering different national cuisine every evening for
a month. Every taste and style is catered for - Mexican, Indonesian,
Armenian, Korean, Japanese, Turkish, Nepalese, Persian, Indian, Chinese,
Greek, French and Italian. Chinese cooking is dominant, because Manchester
has an extensive Chinatown, which is colourful and bustles at night. The
area has 60 restaurants.
As an indicator of quality, the city has 14 restaurants listed on the Good
Food Guide, a leading UK restaurant monitor.
There are Victorian public houses, numerous wine bars and some famous
breweries.
For entertainment, Manchester has more theatres than any other regional
centre, and more than any UK city outside London. There are five repertory
theatres, including the internationally-recognised Royal Exchange Theatre
and Contact, a theatre for young people.
The Palace Theatre (2,000 seats) and Opera House (2,000 seats), two of the
most commercially successful theatres outside London, are principal
destinations for touring opera, ballet and theatre companies.
For 1994, Manchester has been designated the UK's City of Drama which will
mean a celebration of international music and drama over 12 months.
For classical music lovers Manchester has two world renowned orchestras, the
Halle and the BBC Philharmonic, plus several chamber orchestras.
Both main orchestras are embarking on new, innovative programmes under their
musical directors Kent Nagano (the Halle) and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (the
BBC Philharmonic). An international concert hall with a capacity of 2,400 is
under construction and will provide a high quality home for the Halle.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Manchester developed as a main centre for popular
music. The Hacienda club became nationally renowned. Well known bands such
as Simply Red, New Order, Take That and the Stone Roses came from
Manchester. The G-Mex exhibition centre, a converted railway station stages
large concerts.
There are a number of museums and art galleries and a higher than average
number of libraries. These include the Central Library and the John Rylands
Museum, home of a superb collection of manuscripts, incunabula and rare
first editions.
In sport, Greater Manchester has eight football league clubs, one of which,
Manchester United, recently won the premier league. Rugby league is also
popular in the region with Salford and Wigan among the most successful
clubs. Old Trafford is the home of the Lancashire Cricket Club.
To these attractions Manchester has added, in recent years, two specific
tourism 'products'. Visitors to Granada Studios Tours enjoy guided tours of
film and TV sets and walk along the Coronation Street set. Opposite the
studios is Granada's Victoria and Albert Hotel, a television themed hotel.
Around 750,000 people visit the studios annually. The Museum of Science and
Industry is, like Granada's studios, in Castlefield, an old part of
Manchester which went into decline but is now being restored.
In all, Greater Manchester attracts 3.5m staying visitors a year, of which
more than 40 per cent are overseas visitors. These visitors spend around
Pounds 238m a year. There are 6m day visitors who spend Pounds 41m on the
main attractions.
In Greater Manchester there are more than 200,000 hotel beds in more than
300 hotels. Greater Manchester is well placed for first class hotels. There
are 20 hotels of international standard in the city including the Midland,
one of Holiday Inn's Crowne Plaza brand, the Portland Thistle, and the
Ramada Renaissance Hotel. There is a another group around the airport
including a Hilton, Forte Crest and a Four Seasons.
The key question is: How would a successful Olympics bid affect the tourism
infrastructure? Could it cope? Are there enough hotel rooms for the influx
of visitors? An impact study undertaken by KPMG Management Consulting
estimates that over the 17 days of the Olympics there could be 5.65m visits.
The total spend generated by the Olympics would be about Pounds 250m.
The point to be made here is that it is not just Manchester that is bidding
for the Games but the north-west region as a whole. Some of the events will
be taking place in Liverpool, others in north Wales.
Ms Elizabeth Jeffries, chief executive of the Greater Manchester Visitor and
Convention Bureau, says: 'There would be no problem at all with hotel rooms.
Manchester is surrounded by country house hotels, and there is Liverpool and
Blackpool, not to mention Leeds. These places are all on the rail network.'
The fact that it is a regional bid within a national bid should enhance its
prospects. Mr John Glester, a member of the bid committee and chief
executive of the Central Manchester Development Corporation, says that while
Manchester itself might be unglamourous, Britain, as a whole, is not.
Some of the most attractive parts of the country are in the north-west. The
Peak National Park, the Yorkshire Dales, the Lake District are all within
two hours' drive of Manchester on good roads.
Ms Jeffries is hoping that win or lose, the publicity surrounding the bid
will help increase the number of tourists.
She says: 'We have a target to uplift business visitors by 5 per cent a year
for the next three years, and to increase staying visitors to the region by
10 per cent a year. We have done well, but we still have a number of hidden
assets that we should use.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (14): A kiss of life
revives derelict areas - Greater Manchester already has several
inter-related urban renewal schemes under way, with substantial government
funding / Development Corporations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY

<TEXT>
THE FOCUS of urban regeneration is on the eastern part of the city because
of its 2000 Olympic Games bid, but Manchester also has two government-funded
development corporations charged with revitalising other parts of the city.
The Central Manchester Development Corporation (CMDC)covers 470 acres of the
city centre. It is an area of faded and sometimes derelict textile
warehouses gathered around the Rochdale canal.
The difference made by the CMDC since it was set up in 1988 is immediately
apparent. Canal walkways have been renewed, some 36 historic buildings
revitalised and 21 buildings cleaned.
But the CMDC has more substantial achievements. It has built 1,100 homes,
some of these in listed buildings and others, such as Piccadilly Village,
built from scratch.
These developments have helped bring the centre back to life since the
city's population decline of the 1970s.
The CMDC has aided the Palace Theatre in Oxford Street and the Opera house.
Combined with grants to help expand the Granada studio tours and the Museum
of Science and Industry, this has given Manchester real tourism products -
Granada and the science museum attract 1m visitors a year.
The CMDC claims that 1m sq ft of office space has been built as a result of
its development work. These include the new British Council headquarters at
the southern end of the city centre, and the planned Pounds 40m concert
hall, the Bridgewater initiative, which the developers hope will be
surrounded by 290,000 sq ft of new office space.
The recession has put on hold two other CMDC flagship projects, a World
Trade Centre and the conversion of the Northern warehouse into a festival
market place.
The CMDC has met its investment targets. It has spent Pounds 80m and levered
Pounds 292m out of the private sector. But the government has cut its budget
for the past year.
Mr John Glester, the chief executive, believes, however, the original
private sector investment goal of Pounds 500m could be met by 1994, when the
CMDC is due to be wound up.
There are plans to build the Olympic village and a media centre on the
border of the city centre and east Manchester on sites within the CMDC's
area. The village would be within walking distance of the Olympic stadium.
Mr Glester, also a member of Manchester's Olympics bid committee, says: 'The
important thing in all the Olympic developments is that the facilities
should have a use after the Olympics. Whether we win or not, and, of course,
I believe we will win, the Olympic village could be used for students. 'We
have 40,000 students in Manchester. The media centre could be used for
conferences and conventions.'
The Trafford Park Development Corporation is a different animal to the CMDC.
The urban development area was set up in 1987 in an attempt to arrest the
decline of the Trafford Park, the world's first industrial estate, in
response to complaints from the local council and companies. The estate once
employed 75,000 people - today's figure is 36,000.
Mr Michael Shields, chief executive of the TPDC, says: 'The real job we had
to tackle was to improve the infrastructure and the environment so that
companies would want to be in the park.'
Trafford Park consists of 3,000 acres and there is a non-contiguous 260
acres at Irlam, the old steel works.
Mr Shields says the TPDC has been successful. A total of 10,510 new jobs
have been created. Around 550 new companies have been set up.
The UDC has spent Pounds 121.5m, much of it on infrastructure. The main
development bis a spine road through TraffordPark linking the M62 in the
north with the M56 and M6 to the south. Around Pounds 664m of private sector
investment has been generated.
One coup was to win the a rail freight distribution centre which could
eventually create up to 4,000 jobs.
The industrial park proper has been a success but there are question marks
over office developments. In particular, fears that Exchange Quay, a 500,000
sq ft development, would not find tenants have led Trafford Park to be
compared to London's Docklands.
Mr Shields dismisses such comparisons. He says: 'They are not similar at
all. Office developments, not just Exchange Quay, but also others, cover
only 20 acres, a fraction of our total area. There is not a huge overhang of
office space. Exchange Quay was hurriedly built to benefit from the
enterprise zone status of the land and the tax breaks.
'This came to an end in 1991 so the building became available at the worst
time of the recession. But the offices are being let. I understand that
Exchange Quay is now one third let.'
News that Exchange Quay is finding tenants will please Mr Ted Hagan. He is
the private developer largely responsible for the development of Salford
Quays, opposite Trafford Park, on the other side of the Manchester Ship
Canal.
When Salford district council were looking to develop 160 acres they
acquired from the Manchester Ship Canal Company, they offered Mr Hagan 30
acres at a peppercorn price provided he could attract other private sector
investment.
Mr Hagan managed to persuade the Copthorne group to build a 160-room hotel
on his land, which is also home to a Cannon Cinema complex. He has also
built hundreds of houses on the land.
The revival of the Quays is not yet complete. Mr Hagan still has 3.5 acres
on the Trafford Road. He wants to build three floors of retail space.
He hopes that a Metrolink station will be built on the ground floor, for
which he has planning permission. He wants to see the offices in Exchange
Quay filling up, and thus provide him with shoppers.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (13): Just the tonic
for Eastlands - Stewart Dalby describes why the Games will provide east
Manchester with a way back from dereliction, disuse and the legacies of the
industrial revolution / Urban Regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URBAN regeneration is one of the criteria the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) will use in choosing which city should host the 2000 Olympic
Games. One of Manchester's aims is to use the bid - and the Games, if it is
successful - to regenerate a section of eastern Manchester.
The government regards Manchester's bid as a national one, and has promised
to find the Pounds 1.5bn for the facilities if the bid succeeds in
September. The government has already committed Pounds 75m in seed money for
facilities, plus a further Pounds 40m for environmental improvements.
The government's decision to find this finance from urban aid programmes and
put it down as a kind of deposit on the bid is significant.
Although technically the city council must make the bid, it does not have
the ability to raise the necessary funds. Some cities in the US and in
continental Europe have the ability to raise taxes for special projects,
such as the Olympics.
The government's commitment, therefore, means that win or lose in September,
east Manchester will gain new sporting facilities and an area which appears
to have defied regeneration in the past will be upgraded.
East Manchester was once the manufacturing heartland of the city but since
the second world war it has been in decline. After the recession of the
early 1980s traditional industries such as engineering and textiles have had
little opportunity to revive. Although there are several large companies and
there are 80,000 residents, large stretches are derelict. The area is dotted
with empty factories, abandoned cotton mills and boarded-up shops.
One barrier to development has been the poor infrastructure. But an inner
ring-road now locks the area into the motorway network surrounding
Manchester and this eases access.
Another problem has been lack of finance. Manchester has two development
corporations which concentrate on other parts of the city and which have
been well funded by the government. Apart from a few housing projects
financed under the urban programme, very little money has been diverted to
east Manchester.
The lack of finance for reclamation, clearance and improving infrastructure
has deterred the private sector.
Mr Terry Thomas, managing director of the Co-operative Bank and director of
the East Manchester Partnership, says: 'East Manchester might seem ripe for
property development. But I do not feel that regeneration would have taken
place without some kind of catalyst. The money put up by the government is
just the tonic the area needs.'
East Manchester is appropriate for the bid because it abuts on Manchester
city centre. If the main stadium is built on the proposed site then,
together with the velodrome and another arena which are already being
constructed, it will mean that 10 of the 25 Olympic events will be within
walking distance of the Olympic village in the city centre. Some 15 sporting
disciplines will be within the motorway ring and another 21 within 20
minutes' driving time.
By contrast, in its abortive 1996 bid Manchester planned to build the
stadium on an out-of-town greenfield site.
A distinction should perhaps be made between east Manchester and the
Eastlands regeneration project. East Manchester is an area of around 26 sq
miles which stretches from Victoria and Piccadilly stations. It covers about
one quarter of the area administered by the Manchester city council and
houses about a third of the city's population. Within this area is a site of
140 acres which is the Eastlands regeneration project.
The East Manchester Partnership is a grouping of more than 200 private
concerns which hopes to attract private sector investment on the back of
government spending.
It is involved in the developments around Victoria station. Of the Pounds
75m of government money so far committed, some Pounds 37m is being spent on
the Victoria Arena, a 16,500-seater covered venue for basketball and
gymnastics.
It is part of a larger development which could cost Pounds 140m and include
offices, a five-star hotel, a cinema complex and retail developments.
Further east, is the Eastlands project. Janet Heron, the Eastlands Project
Co-ordinator, who has been seconded from the city council, says: 'Less than
20 years ago, on this site, there used to be a gas works, an electricity
generator, a colliery and a large wireworks. It is now largely derelict.'
So far, Pounds 10m of the Pounds 75m has been committed to the project with
a further Pounds 20m to come. Much of this has been spent on assembling the
land from various owners and arranging for relocations of companies to other
parts of east Manchester. But work has started on the velodrome which will
seat 5,000 and cost Pounds 6m.
The showpiece of the Olympics is the new national stadium which is proposed
for Eastlands. It will seat 80,000 people, cost up to Pounds 150m and host
the opening and closing ceremonies. Like the arena, it would be the centre
point for other developments. One estimate suggests there could be 500,000
sq ft of office space, retail outlets and other leisure facilities.
Mr Thomas feels that even if Manchester's bid is unsuccessful, the stadium
will still be built. He says: 'The country needs a new national stadium. The
last one was built in Wembley in London in 1923. We need one in this part of
the world.'
He concedes that if the bid is unsuccessful, it might take a little longer
for the project to get going.
'I think the private sector will grasp the nettle and build the stadium, but
it could take around five years to get off the ground.'
He says that even if the bid fails, east Manchester will receive Pounds 300m
of investment arising from the Pounds 75m injected by the government.
He says: 'I doubt very much whether the area would have received that kind
of investment without the stimulus of the Games bid.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (12): Counting the
cost / Analysis of the draft accounts for a billion-dollar sporting occasion
 -Funds

THE DECISION about whether Manchester's Olympics will make a profit or a
loss will have as much to do with politics as the decision the IOC's
decision in Septem
The projected operating budget, drawn up with the help of Arthur Andersen,
examined in detail by government officials and discussed with the IOC, shows
a projected surplus of Dollars 92m, with Dollars 1,451m income and Dollars
1,359m expenditure.
Included is a Dollars 249m allowance for contribution to capital budget,
reflecting the agreement with the government that the company operating the
Games will bear the cost of temporary facilities or the adaptation of
permanent ones.
This means Manchester will bear the full cost of the 5,000-seater judo hall
to be built at Old Trafford and removed after the Games. Manchester
University's sports hall will be extended to accommodate table tennis for
the Games. The operating company for the Games will pay.
The strategy of having new facilties built either, like the velodrome, for
the government, or, like the main stadium, on a long-term design, build,
operate and maintain basis with a significant private sector contribution,
is designed to prevent the operating company being loaded with enormous
capital costs.
As the Olympic village is designed as student accommodation, the company's
only contribution to its Dollars 380m-plus cost would be to pay for adapting
student rooms for the Olympics.
Although communications and IT shows up as the second biggest expenditure at
Dollars 239m, a lot of it will come as benefits in kind from the Dollars
478m projected sponsorship. Companies with state-of-the art technology,
often developed for the Olympics, are expected to offer to provide
equipment, to show off to the world in general and the huge Olympic media
circus in particular - for example, a telecoms company might install the
press centre, or a car manufacturer provide courtesy cars.
The security budget of Dollars 129m is a government estimate, including
10,000 police.
The huge Dollars 402m other expenditure budget covers the volunteer
programme (Dollars 45m), the Paralympics, staged immediately after the Games
(Dollars 42m), a support structure for the seven years leading up to the
Games (Dollars 100m) and insurance (Dollars 30m).
The biggest income figure is for media rights. The IOC negotiates the
rights, and estimates that a Manchester Olympics would earn Dollars 1bn, of
which the operating company would keep Dollars 600m. The IOC estimate for
Sydney is a net Dollars 488m, because a September Games would compete with
other sports events.
The Dollars 478m estimated sponsorship includes Dollars 100m share of
international sponsorship negotiated by the IOC and Dollars 378m national
sponsorsip and licensing, based on bringing in 10 leading players at up to
Pounds 10m apiece from sectors such as banking, insurance,
telecommunications, water, computer hardware, office equipment, fast food,
cars, media information systems and publication systems.
The estimate includes 10 medium players who would have lesser rights and a
number of other suppliers whose products would be used.
A measure of the sophistication in sports merchandising in the region can be
gauged at Manchester United's club superstore, expected to turn over up to
Pounds 5m this year, selling traditional products such as programmes,
T-shirts, pens, sportswear, and even wallpaper and bed linen.
The Dollars 188m estimated ticket income is gauged on a complex grid,
estimating the likely attendance for every session of the Games, with a
total estimated attendace of 4.8m. Mr Bill Enevoldson, finance director,
says the tickets have to be affordable by local people.
Ordinary athletics sessions are estimated at an average of Pounds 40 in 2000
prices (assumed equivalent of about Pounds 26 currently), with basketball at
Pounds 35 and football at Pounds 15. The opening and closing ceremonies are
likely to be a little less affordable, at an average of Pounds 250 in 2,000
prices.
Of the Dollars 165m 'other revenue,' Dollars 70m is estimated for ancilliary
media rights - TV crews turning up on the day wanting to film a particular
aspect of the Games - with other income from interest (cash flow is
positive, as sponsorship, ticket and television money is up front) and sale
of assets after the Games.
If Manchester wins the bid, a detailed budget will be thrashed out with the
IOC.
Much of the Games' financial success or otherwise will depend on deals done
with the government and the private sector on the capital expenditure
programme. Much may also depend on treasury management - the event gets much
of its income in US dollars, while most of its expenditure is in pounds
sterling.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (11): Protecting the
Games - Security
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER'S bid organisers have been tackling security head-on in their
presentations to the IOC. They are planning for 10,000 police to be deployed
for the Games but their greatest asset is that Britain is fundamentally a
law-abiding country.
Indeed, although Britain gets bad publicity from IRA terrorism, its problems
are light compared with other countries.
Inevitably, attention has focused on crime in Manchester's Moss Side because
of the Olympic bid. However, Greater Manchester police say: 'It is a myth
that Moss Side is more violent than other urban areas.' It had eight murders
in l992, nine attempted ones and 157 woundings. 'Many of the murders were
domestic ones. They were not all drug-related. There is simply no comparison
with major US cities,' police say.
Greater Manchester averages 42 murders a year. Mr Howard Bernstein, deputy
chief executive of Manchester city council, says: 'Violence accounts for
just 3 per cent of all crime in Greater Manchester. There is a 76 per cent
detection rate. For murders it is 97 per cent. Crime in Britain increased by
10 per cent last year. For Manchester it grew by 5.8 per cent.'
As for the IRA, Mr Berstein says: 'Terrorism is a world-wide phenomenon
which any global event must deal with. Good security is the answer and our
chief constable together with the Whitehall authorities are satisfied they
can protect the Games if they are held in Manchester.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (10): A century of
athletic achievement - The background to the north-west's depth of feeling
and passion for endeavour and glory on the playing fields of England /
Sporting Tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPORT has always been an important ingredient of professional, social and
cultural life in north-west England, but just how far it has developed from
a pastime for hard-pressed workers on Saturday afternoons more than 100
years ago is nowhere better typified than at Manchester United.
Sport in the north may still, for some, conjure up an image of the baggy
shorts of the railway workers' kickabout, which is what Manchester United
was in 1878 when it was founded as the Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway Football Club.
The reality now is a quoted company turning over more than Pounds 20m
annually, with distributed profits for its last financial year of Pounds 5m.
When alterations are complete, its home ground of Old Trafford will be a
45,000 all-seater superstadium, of which 3,000 will be high-priced executive
seating in boxes or attached to lounges.
The team, which once included world-class players such as Bobby Charlton and
George Best, has just won the English premier league championship and is one
of Europe's best. Its fame gives it big foreign support, with a 6,000-strong
Scandinavian fan club and 1,000 registered followers in Malta.
Mr Martin Edwards, the chairman, is not sure whether the Olympics will
enhance the club's reputation directly, but the stadium would certainly play
an important part. It would be involved directly in the football tournament,
while the judo competition would be in a specially-built indoor arena
adjoining it.
The important point, however, is that Manchester United typifies a
north-western tradition not only in athletic achievement, but in managing
and administering sport too. The stadium is now the most important 'neutral'
ground for big rugby league matches outside Wembley. Important rugby union
matches are also played there and there are plans for more matches.
On Merseyside, Liverpool Football Club has achieved even more in recent
years than Manchester United, winning the European Cup four times and
winning the English league championship a record number of times. Though
apparently in Liverpool's shadow, Everton - Merseyside's other big team -
has also excelled.
Old Trafford and Goodison Park - home of Everton and the larger of the two
big Liverpool football stadiums - would be used in the soccer tournament,
with the final at the Manchester United ground.
Sport is played and watched seriously at all levels. The big spectator
sports are football, rugby league and cricket - Lancashire county cricket is
played at another Old Trafford ground near the football stadium. They do not
all figure in the Olympic lists, but, again, they are well organised, with
big events well managed.
Out of this sporting tradition have come many heroes, such as Bobby Charlton
and George Best. Charlton, now a Manchester United director, is also an
active figure in the Olympic Bid. So is Chris Boardman, cycling pursuit
champion at Barcelona, who comes from Merseyside and will be an enthusiastic
user of the new velodrome and national cycling centre, already under
construction on the Olympic site.
The region - and Merseyside, in particular - has produced many boxers,
including Alan Rudkin, but the most famous is John Conteh, who rose through
the amateur ranks to become world light-heavyweight champion.
Fittingly, if Manchester's bid succeeds on behalf of the north-west, the
boxing tournament would be in Liverpool in a new arena near the Albert Dock.
More important than high profile sporting heroes and venues, however, is the
strength in depth of numbers of ordinary, amateur players in nearly all
Olympic sports. Athletics, basketball, badminton, cycling, canoeing,
equestrianism, fencing, football and the rest all have strong club
structures.
Wigan, the venue for swimming, has one of the strongest amateur swimming
clubs in Britain and the Merseyside suburbs are home to several of the
country's top field hockey clubs. In addition, most of those involved in
non-Olympic sports such as rugby union, cricket or rugby league - both as
players or administrators - have an interest and commitment to sport in
general.
The importance of this body of thousands of amateur sports players and
supporters is the corps of volunteers who would almost certainly answer any
call made upon them by the Olympic Games' organisers. They already toil
unpaid to make their own sports work and have proved themselves many times
in helping to ensure big events - in their own sports or others - have
worked well.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (9): Airport makes a
winning case - Ease of access is a significant factor in the bid /
Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW the board of Manchester airport meets to endorse and submit a
formal planning application for its second runway. If the airport wins a
public inquiry next year, the runway should open in 1998, allowing the
airport to achieve its target capacity of 30m passengers a year by 2005.
The issue will not be straightforward, as Liverpool has staked a claim for
its airport to become effectively the second runway for north-west England.
But the airport, its confidence in the future symbolised in its Pounds 265m
second terminal, opened earlier this year, believes the next phase in its
expansion would be hard to turn down.
If Manchester wins the Games, the ease of access to the city provided by the
airport - the 18th biggest in the world in international passengers carried
 -is likely to be a significant factor. A new rail link to the city centre
and beyond opened last month and the Metrolink supertram system is due to
serve the airport by the time the Olympics begin.
Sir Gil Thompson, the airport's chief executive, believes that the rail link
'is going to make a significant contribution to the growth of Manchester'.
There is talk of a southern spur to connect the airport to the main line
rail network at Crewe, and in spite of minimal advertising, the response to
the new rail service has been encouraging, with some passengers on the
hourly service from Leeds pressing for a check-in facility at Leeds, just as
passengers from London Gatwick can check in at London's Victoria station.
The link from the airport plugs into a strong railway network, a relic of
the industrial revolution. Manchester - which had several railway termini
dating from the last century - now has much easier cross-city communications
as a result of Metrolink and has been able to develop more through routes.
Merseyside, where some Olympic events would be held, has a comprehensive
rail system, linked by an underground loop in Liverpool.
Manchester's most important innovation has been the Metrolink supertram,
which travels on railway lines and on tracks through the city streets. The
first two cross-conurbation routes opened last year. The network is being
extended to Salford Quays and Trafford Park in the west, and will reach the
proposed Olympic sites in east Manchester well before 2000. A station is
planned beside the Olympic stadium, and another beside the new velodrome,
already under construction.
The the north-west's motorway network is crucial to rapid communication
between Olympic sites, and between the region and the rest of the UK, The
network is almost fully in place, ensuring that Greater Manchester,
Merseyside, Chester and Preston are linked directly or with minimal
interchanging.
The network is based on the M6, the main north-south road artery west of the
Pennines, and the the east-west M62 which links the rivers Humber and Mersey
and is a fast developing land bridge for European trade.
The motorways cross at Warrington, which has become an important
distribution node for consumer industries because of its position near the
'time-centre' of Britain.
Manchester Airport is 15 minutes from the crossover point and much of its
recent growth stems from the fact that 20m people live within two hours'
drive.
The M62 also links Liverpool and north and west Manchester, and the M6 binds
Cheshire and Lancashire together. Regional motorways link Chester and North
Wales with Manchester (M56), and Preston with Manchester (M61). Shorter
motorways - the M53, M58 and M57 - feed traffic into the network from
Wirral, north Liverpool and Bootle respectively, while the M66 joins
north-east Lancashire with the M62 and north Manchester.
The regional network comprises more than 200 miles and enables the
north-west to be traversed in well under an hour, whatever the starting
point. Short stretches of motorway are being added to the network
continuously, increasing the choice of routes for local travel and limiting
the opportunities for congestion.
The one serious missing link will be completed within the next five years,
joining the M66 and M63 through the eastern suburbs of the Greater
Manchester conurbation and giving the city its version of the M25 London
orbital motorway. This will comprise the M63 - which arcs round Greater
Manchester's western boroughs - and parts of the M66 and M62.
Like the bid organisers, the airport claims a strong environmental record,
with initiatives on noise control, air pollution, and water pollution. This
Sir Gil decribes as 'good commercial practice - an airport can only grow
through the willing consent of your neighbours'.
Manchester handles more night flights than Heathrow and Gatwick put
together, with numbers negotiated through local councils - the airport is
owned by 10 local authorities - aided by a computerised noise control system
which tracks aircraft to ensure they stay on the least disruptive routes,
backed by fines for pilots who break the rules.
The airport is run on business lines, with a turnover of more than Pounds
144m last year, and a pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 28m. A healthy
margin is needed to help finance expansion.
The airport has been a significant contributor to the Olympic bid. The
immediate benefits to it of the games would be limited to 100,000
passengers, but the advantages of the higher profile could be significant to
an airport which still needs to persuade people booking flights to the UK
from abroad that London is not the automatic starting point for every visit
to Britain.
The bid logo is on prominent display at the airport, and the new terminal
has been called the Olympic terminal. Another module is planned to be added
to it, in what Sir Gil refers to as 'Toblerone expansion,' to take its
capacity to 12-14m passengers a year.
Sir Gil hopes that, by the time the Olympics arrive, the UK and US will have
sorted out bilateral aviation agreements to allow airlines to fly to more
destinations direct from Manchester. Those in the queue include American
Airlines, which wants to fly to Miami and Dallas, Delta (Cincinnati,
Orlando, New York Kennedy), United (Washington). USAir (Pittsburgh) and
Continental (Newark).
It is hardly surprising that the airport is a supporter of liberalisation.
Anyone in the UK should be able to fly from their own local airport to a
destination if there is an airline willing to carry them, says Sir Gil.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (8): Heart of a
powerful economic force - Greater Manchester has emerged as the capital of
the north / The Region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the results of the 1991 British census were published this year, they
were something of a shock for the city of Manchester. Its population was
down to 397,400, a drop of 11 per cent on the 1981 number of 449,200.
Technically, this may well make it one of the smallest cities to bid for a
summer Olympic Games, but the Games have to be awarded to an individual
city. In fact, Manchester is bidding on behalf of north-west England, the
second biggest economic region in Britain with a population of 6.12m. Only
south-east England, dominated by London, is bigger, with 16.71m people. This
means the north-west is bigger than Scotland, which has 4.96m people, and
Wales, with 2.79m.
The north-west's size is comparable with that of Greater London, where 6.38m
live. It is made up of Greater Manchester - a conurbation of 2.45m people
surrounding Manchester city centre - Merseyside, where 1.38m people live,
and Lancashire and Cheshire, counties with populations of 1.36m and nearly
1m respectively.
The size of the Greater Manchester conurbation and the development of its
airport has seen its emergence as the capital, not only of north-west
England, but of northern England as a whole.
Although Leeds is always disputing this because it is bigger than Manchester
as a single city, it is the sheer critical mass of continuous conurbation
that counts - and Greater Manchester is three-and-a-half times bigger than
Leeds and more than twice as large as Leeds and its neighbour Bradford
combined.
Greater Manchester's strength is its location in the middle of an
economically powerful belt running from Liverpool to Leeds. The M62 has put
either city about 45 minutes away from Manchester.
The economic strength in depth of this transpennine belt can be judged when
Yorkshire and Humberside's statistics are added to the north-west's. The
combined population of the two regions is 10.9m and between them they
contribute more than 18 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product.
Apart from numbers of people who live in the north-west, the region is
economically Britain's second biggest. It contributes more than 10 per cent
of UK gross domestic product on its own, which makes it economically bigger
than several individual European countries, such as Greece, Portugal,
Denmark, and Ireland.
There is therefore no local shortage of economic clout. Manchester itself is
a self-standing city, with a complete range of financial and professional
services to offer the region, which is no longer dependent on going to
London for them, as in the past.
Merseyside, in spite of a decades-long struggle to reconstruct its local
economy following changing patterns of world trade and the development of
the EC, remains the UK's principal west coast deep sea port. New industries
are slowly emerging and financial and professional service providers are
being sent back from Manchester - where several had retreated in 1970s and
1980s - to provide local access to advice.
Lancashire, which is heavily dependent on defence industries, is worried by
the end of the cold war, but has an enviable depth of redeployable skilled
labour as a result of high-technology defence work.
Cheshire, in spite of large concentrations of oil and chemicals industry,
mainly alongside the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal, remains the nearest
county in the north to the south, not only physically, but in the character
of its terrain and villages. Chester, the county seat, is its tourism jewel.
The north-west's main problem over the years, however, has been internal
rivalry. Liverpool and Manchester supported different sides in the US civil
war; Manchester cotton workers were praised by Abraham Lincoln for their
fortitude when raw material supplies were cut off, while Merseyside
shipwrights built the blockade-running ship, the Alabama.
A century ago, Manchester traders built their own Ship Canal so that
ocean-going vessels could sail into the heart of the conurbation and bypass
Liverpool docks and shippers, who were using a monopoly position to
overcharge.
This rivalry still shows itself on the football field, but Greater
Manchester's growing economic hegemony and bigger size has eventually told.
Merseyside would prefer to have Liverpool airport developed as an
alternative to a second runway at Manchester's, but, in the main, the four
north-west counties now have a coherent view of how they develop together as
a region.
The Olympic bid has been a considerable unifying force and, if it succeeds,
the Games will be spread around to bring fair shares in benefits throughout
the region.
This growing coherence is nowhere so important as in the private sector.
Four years ago, leaders of some of the biggest companies in the region set a
regional business leadership team, the only one of its kind in Britain,
where such teams are usually much more localised.
The originator was Mr John Ashcroft, whose company Coloroll was one of the
more spectacular casualties of the recession. But his idea was big enough to
assume a life of its own. The Duke of Westminster - a key figure in the
Olympic bid - took over as chairman and has welded together a team drawn
from some of the most influential businesses in Britain.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which has its headquarters in Cheshire,
says: 'Most of us felt that unless it was regional in scale, there was no
point. Its scale had to be consistent with the level of input we could
provide. Time was the main thing we were all going to give, so everything
had to be big enough to match this.
'You have to have a vision of what this region can become. That vision is
shared now by many people. The team is a group of good people pulling
together. We always meet in the evening. At a personal level, it's amazing
what opportunities and business flow from just knowing what we each do. Most
of us had never met before.'
When unifying projects which might produce economic synergy were first
discussed, a national stadium based in the north-west was an early
objective. The Olympic bid fitted the vision. The existence of the business
leadership team as a peer group of very senior industrialists has ensured
private sector support for it flows from the top.
Moreover, their personal contacts and networks go to the top of British life
and politics and have played their part in getting the bid for the Games
taken seriously by national leaders.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (7): An ideal climate
for records - 'Being an unglamorous candidate, we have to become desirable,
we have to prove ourselves,' the bid director told international news
correspondents / The selling of a city - Image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A SUNNY, humid early summer day in Salford, the Manchester Olympic bid
campaigners are talking to a group of London-based correspondents from
foreign news organisations on a two-day trip designed to show them that the
Manchester bid is a serious runner.
Correspondents from Pravda, Stuttgarter Zeiting, Business Times of Tanzania,
Die Zeit, Xinhua News Agency of China, Channel Nine Australia, Fulha do Sao
Paolo and El Sol do Mexico listen to the bid organisers setting out their
stall.
Mr Bob Scott, the bid director, tells them Manchester is the only city
bidding for a second time, with a greatly improved bid. Channel Nine of
Australia wants to know how Manchester will cope with the 'stigma' of being
'the only loser, bidding this time'.
Mr Scott remarks that Britain does not change it's bidding cities 'like we
change our underwear', a barb aimed at previous bids from Brisbane and
Melbourne. In any case, he says, Barcelona started bidding in 1924.
But, he acknowledges that Manchester has to deal with its unglamorous image,
in a competition where its main rival has a famous harbour, opera house and
bridge. In a picture postcard competition, the Free Trade Hall would not be
in the running.
'Being an unglamorous candidate, we have to become desirable, we have to
prove ourselves,' he says.
Within the UK, and especially in the south-east corner of England,
Manchester's traditional image is of a damp post-industrial city where it
rains much of the time and there is a lot of crime.
The optimists argue that the Manchester rain would not have much affect on
the games - 80 per cent of Olympic sports take place indoors.
The pessimists say it is the track and field events which people remember
and which are the big pull for television and ticket sales.
The rain argument is being conducted with some ferocity, with the bid's
supporters producing rainfall figures to show that the July/August period is
no rainier in Manchester than anywhere else and arguing that the city's
climate makes it the ideal place for records to be broken in the millennium
games.
Mr Tony Blenman, sports officer (Olympics) of the British Council, says the
image can be turned round - Manchester has a temperate climate, and its
post-industrial condition means there is a mature and thriving business
community that can fund a new city, and the infrastructure to support it.
The British Council, relocated last year from London to a gleaming new
building beside the city centre, has been active in the diplomatic offensive
to persuade people in the nearly 100 countries in which it operates that
there is another side to Manchester.
Bobby Charlton, former Manchester United and England captain and one of
Manchester's sporting ambassadors, attended this year's centenary
celebration for Argentina's football league and the opening of its football
season. He was mobilised to take part in a scratch embassy football team
which played an Argentine government team, led by President Menem.
In another goodwill gesture, the council helped Malaysia develop expertise
in lawn bowls and water sports for its successful Commonwealth Games bid.
Mr Blenman has tried to ensure that anyone walking into a British Council
office will see something about Manchester 2000, but there are difficulties.
The council has no budget for this kind of activity, and is suffering staff
and budget cuts. The Manchester bid does not have the resources to help out.
He and others concerned with Manchester's image know that many Britons who
travel abroad, and who may be discussing the Manchester bid, have never
visited the city and have an impression based on historic perceptions, and
Coronation Street.
Mr Bob Scott, the bid director, points out that people's concerns about
Manchester vary. A Londoner may be concerned about dirt, smoke and rain, a
Francophone African may be more concerned about its being cold, and about
people not speaking French. It is concerns such as these that the bid
committee addresses when IOC delegates are visiting.
He insists that the job is to destroy misconceptions rather than to improve
the image. He says the IOC members who visited in 1989/90 to assess the
abortive bid for the 1996 Games were pleasantly surprised. When they
returned this year, they saw that a lot had been done - the new airport
terminal built, the Metrolink integrated rail system built, Salford Quays
re-developed, the Victoria Arena, velodrome, and a concert hall under
construction. By September, when the bid decision is made, 71 of the 91 IOC
members will have visited Manchester.
He admits that there is always going to be a question mark about terrorism
in Britain - the IRA's high-profile mainland campaign has included attacks
in the Manchester area.
Manchester beat London in the contest to become Britain's bid city, partly
because the capital's infrastructure appeared unlikely to cope with the
strain of the Games. Mr David Baker, a retired Bank of England official who
is chief executive of Manchester Financial and Professional Forum, admits,
nevertheless, that 'In the south, it's still, 'How's your Olympic bid
coming?'. It's never 'our' Olympics.'
Some people with strong links in the capital say the feeling is changing. Mr
Nigel Pye and Mr Bernard Whewell, Manchester managing partners of Arthur
Andersen and Ernst &amp; Young respectively, say the attitude among people they
speak to has changed from dismissal of Manchester's chance to a real desire
to discuss Manchester's chances.
For Mr Anthony Goldstone, chairman of the North West Tourist Board, this is
not enough.
'I would like to see more business people, chairmen and chief executives of
companies, talking the way I do,' he says. It would be a boost to the
region's confidence if company chairmen and bank directors joined in
promoting the bid.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (6): Going for gold -
Sponsorship

BY INTERNATIONAL standards, the Pounds 4.8m raised to promote Manchester's
Olympic bid - Pounds 2.3m from the private sector, and Pounds 2.5m from the
public sector - is not a well-stocked war chest.
Mr Bob Scott admits the bid is underfunded, but puts a brave face on it,
claiming that it proves Manchester to be 'the most Olympic of the bidding
cities'.
On top of the money, the private sector has provided support worth at least
Pounds 2.5m in kind, including supplying the principal bid staff on
secondment. The private sector has also provided consultancy expertise and
there have been other significant contributions, such as Rank Xerox's
high-tech production of the bid document.
Locally, the airport is the main sponsor, with more than Pounds 400,000.
Other include Kelloggs, National Westminster Bank, the Duke of Westminster,
Norweb, British Gas, BT and the Guardian-Manchester Evening News.
For Boddington's, the Manchester subsidiary of Whitbread, the decision to
contribute a Pounds 150,000 was a matter of enhancing its image and
defending its patch.
Mr Patrick Langan, brands manager for Boddington's beers, believes the
company's support will in the short term help to encourage loyalty to its
brands, and the pubs which stock them. The pubs themselves are festooned
with flags advertising the company's Go for Gold promotion, with the
Manchester bid logo prominent.
In the longer term, he aims to win new business - for example, a contract to
supply the new Victoria Arena: 'Whether the bid is successful or not a great
deal of beer will be drunk.'
The company is putting the bid logo on 12m cans of draught beer, to be sold
nationwide, and on the last frame of its new television commercial. This
will be shown on Channel 4 nationally, and on Granada and Yorkshire ITV.
Pubs are being encouraged to support the Go for Gold promotion, by selling
bid merchandise. The funds raised will support the Sports Aid Foundation in
training athletes in the region. The names of the 150 participating
publicans will go into a prize draw for a trip to Monte Carlo in September
for the bid decision.
Mr Trevor Adamson, NatWest's regional executive director, justifies the
bank's Pounds 100,000 for Manchester's previous bid and the Pounds 150,000
it is spending on the present one in simple terms. 'We are as strong as our
customers are. Anything that can improve the prosperity of the region is
good for us.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (5): Touche - a
telling riposte to rivals - To match the subsidies offered by Beijing and
Sydney, Manchester has come up with a way of helping athletes from the
poorer nations / Manchester Millennium Foundation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Beijing and Sydney each decided to offset the high costs of travelling
to them by offering to pay for all competitors and officials, the other
bidders for the 2000 Olympics had a problem.
High travel costs had been a potentially telling argument against Beijing
and Sydney - particularly for the developing countries. But paying for the
substantial travel costs would make it difficult to produce a profit from
hosting the Games.
Moreover, the developed nations do not need financial assistance to
transport their competitors and officials to the Games, wherever they are
held. This even applies to Britain, where part of the funding for the team
has to be raised by public appeal.
What Beijing and Sydney have both offered is a subsidy to each national
Olympic committee (NOC) - countries such as the US, which usually sends the
largest team and always has the largest number of qualifiers, will therefore
be the greatest potential beneficiaries.
But later today, Manchester will deliver a telling riposte by announcing a
means-tested subsidy for nations needing help. It is called the Manchester
Millennium Foundation and would support sport in poorer nations to ensure
that more of their athletes were able to compete at the Olympics.
The plan covers not only transport to the Games, but training and welfare of
potential competitors in the four years leading up to them. Sports equipment
would also be provided where needed, eliminating the richer nations'
advantage in preparing for top-level competition.
The cost of travel and access to training and competition facilities in
Britain would also be met. This would include pre-Olympic competitions where
the Games facilities are tested - and where the most promising athletes and
teams get the feel of Olympic venues.
All of these facilities are readily available to competitors from developed
nations with Olympic medal potential. What the Millennium Foundation will
aim to achieve is a level playing field for athletes from the third world.
Manchester's organising committee has promised to guarantee the foundation
Dollars 25m from 1996 if the city stages the Games. It has also proposed
that the foundation would be an independent body to ensure fairness. It
would be run by a board comprising members of the IOC, NOCs, the British
Olympic Association and the Manchester organisers of the 2000 Olympics.
The foundation would be at its busiest in the 12 months before the Games, as
competitors build up their performances to peak in July 2000. What is being
offered, in fact, are equal opportunities for all athletes to peak and to be
able to compete at the Games.
Competitors eligible for funding by the foundation would be nominated by
their own national Olympic committee. NOCs would determine whether training
costs, travel grants or equipment - or whichever combination of the three -
were most appropriate. Support would also be provided for sports science and
sports medicine.
The principles of operation are not dissimilar to those at the United
Nations. Most of its work takes place in developing countries, but is funded
by developed member states, which can generally afford to fend for
themselves.
However, the Millennium Foundation would be less political, as a result of
its independent control by the Olympic movement, which would ensure due
regard for Olympic ideals.
Bob Scott will tell the IOC in Lausanne today: 'Britain's Olympic history is
long and unbroken and its commitment to the ideals of the movement are deep.
'The creation of this foundation has been based on the ideals of the
Olympics and will fully promote equal opportunities for all competitors and
nations of the world.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (4): North-west aims
for compact Games - The venue strategy puts most sports within an hour of
the city, with easy access to the others / Venues and facilities
</HEADLINE>

FROM THE air, Eastlands, the site of the proposed showpiece athletics
stadium and Olympic village, near the city centre, looks like a cricket
field, a huge patch of green with a gasometer in the corner.
At ground level, the site is a scene of urban dereliction, 110 acres scarred
by old mineworkings and half-abandoned railways, poisoned by industrial
gases and heavy metals. To the north is Phillips Park, which is showing its
age as Britain's oldest municipal park; to the south is the semi-derelict
Rochdale Canal.
It is a measure of the scale of the dereliction that the plan to build an
Olympic village to house 15,000 athletes, officials and support staff will
not displace a single local resident: there are no local residents.
The model of the stadium, designed by a team including Sir Norman Foster and
Partners, Ove Arup and Arup Associates, and on display at the Royal Academy
in London, shows an arena seating 82,000 spectators. The team is part of
design-build-operate-maintain consortium, headed by Amec, that also includes
HOK INternational, a Chicago stadium management specialist.
The design uses a structure based on discrete wedges, so that requirements
such as the segregation of athletes and officials can be met. Athletes will
be able to move through all stages up to and including their events in a
logical manner, with everything from warm-up track to dope testing unit
included in the proper sequence.
Split horizontally as well as vertically for maximum flexibility, it is
designed to be cleared in eight minutes. The wedge structure will allow much
of it to be pre-built offsite.
The stadium is part of what Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which will
build the stadium, describes as a total solution for the Eastlands site.
'This proposal is a catalyst for change. The absolute certainty is that a
lot is going to be done, win lose or draw.'
Mr Peter Knowles, sports liaison director, says bid officials insisted that
the worst case in assessing a venue should be that the environmental impact
would be neutral.
Emphasis has been placed on building facilities which will be used after the
Games are over. Amec insists that it can become a national stadium after the
Games.
The stadium will be served by a mainline railway station and by a new line
of the city's Metrolink light rail system, which will also have a station
beside the new 5,000-seat velodrome, already under construction on the
Eastlands site.
A renovated canal running through the Olympic village will provide transport
for some athletes, and 10 venues are in comfortable walking distance of the
village.
The road layout around the stadium is planned as a spiral, rather than radii
running straight up to the stadium wall, a system which the Amec team
believes will avoid bottlenecks.
The company says much has been learned from the Americans on design. It
will, for example, be built in such a way that people will want to visit it
as part of a whole day out. In the US, spectators arrive on average two
hours before the start of sporting fixtures.
A total of Pounds 30m has been or is being spent to assemble and clean the
site, and another Pounds 115m is needed, according to Bob Scott, to build
the stadium. Mr Bill Enevoldson, finance director, is more cautious about
the Pounds 115m figure, insisting that a lot of negotiation remains to be
done but bid officials say the stadium may still be built even if
Manchester's bid failed.
The stadium hopes to attract large-scale sports events after the Games are
over, and it has even been suggested that one day one or both of the
Manchester football clubs might want to play there. It also hopes to attract
exhibitions and rock concerts.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec chairman, insists: 'We are going to have life around
this complex the whole time. The stadium won't be in use at all times, but
people will be attracted to it all year round.' The area will have
restaurants, hotels and shops,
The Olympic village, which during the Games will hold 15,000 athletes,
officials and support staff, will also come in for further use later.
Manchester University, Umist, the Manchester Business School and the
Metropolitan University of Manchester together comprise what is claimed to
be the biggest university campus in Europe, and will need 40,000 student
beds by the turn of the century. The Olympic village would be used for
student accommodation, and could as a result be built well before the Games.
Apart from the stadium, other facilities planned for the Games are:
Cycling. The Pounds 6m 5,000-seat velodrome - which will be owned and
operated by the sports council as a national facility - is the first in the
UK in modern times.
Gymnastics. A 6,000-seat arena is planned for the Eastlands site, next to
the athletics stadium. it
Already under construction in the city centre is the Victoria Arena, using
part of the railway station, which will hold up to 16,400 people, in what
will be Britain's biggest indoor arena. both arena will be used for Olympic
gymnastic events
Badminton. Badminton will also be held in the Eastlands arena
Basketball. Accommodation for 19,330 will be provided in the Victoria Arena,
and in the GMex conference and exhibition centre, which will be extended for
the games to give it a total capacity of 15,000 for basketball. Also at
GMex, up to 11,000 people would be able to watch handball, a sport which
would also be played in a 6,000-capacity hall at Salford University.
Wrestling. The GMex centre will a capacity of 6,000 for wrestling.
Fencing. Will be held in the Air and Space Museum, accommodating 3,000.
Baseball. Old Trafford Cricket ground in Manchester will be modified to
provide a 20,000-seater baseball stadium, a sport which will also be played
at the city's Wythenshawe Park, which has a capacity of 10,000.
Football. Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, would be the main
football venue, with other matches being played in Liverpool, Leeds,
Sheffield, Birmingham, Nottingham, Sunderland and Newcastle.
Hockey. Oldham Athletic's 20,000-capacity football stadium would stage the
hockey tournament.
Judo. An 8,000-seater judo hall will be created next to Old Trafford, the
only purely temporary facility for the Games.
Swimming. Swimming events would be held in a new facility at the Olympic
country park, west of the city, which would accommodate 21,500 spectators
and have six pools for swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water
polo as well as training and warm-up.
Rowing. Alongside the swimming centre is Pennington Flash, a lake which
would be modified for rowing and which can accommodate 30,000 spectators.
Canoeing. North of the Olympic Country Park is Rivington, where the canoeing
events would be held, in front of up to 25,000 spectators.
Equestrian events. The equestrian events are intended for Haydock Park, an
established racecourse where 30,000 could watch, and at Tatton Park, in
Cheshire, where the organisers estimate up to 100,000 could see the events.
Shooting. Also in Cheshire, shooting would be at the 2,500-capacity Carden
Park.
Tennis. The Matchpoint centre holding up to 16,000 spectators, in the
southern suburbs of Manchester would be extended for the tennis competitions
Table tennis. Table tennis would be in a new hall at Manchester University,
holding 8,000.
Weightlifting. Stretford Leisure centre in Manchester would be extended to
allow 5,000 to watch the weightlifting.
Archery. Archery would be held in the city at Hough End, a parkland venue
accommodating 4,000.
Boxing. Liverpool's boxing tradition is recognised by the proposal to hold
contests there in a new, 10,000-seat boxing hall at King's Dock.
Volleyball. The King's Dock arena would also stage the volleyball matches,
which would also include a new 6,000-seat exhibition hall.
Yachting. At Pwllheli, in north Wales, a new yachting village will be
developed beside the marina. Spectator capacity is estimated at 30,000.
Mr Knowles says that 16 of the Olympic venues exist or are under
construction, and two have development contracts awarded - only five depend
on the awarding of the games.
A crucial element of the venue strategy, however, is to have most sports
well within an hour of the centre of Manchester, which the north-west's
compactness and infrastructure allows.
Bid officials refuse to discuss the projected public sector/private sector
split of the investment in the various projects, but Mr Trevor Adamson,
regional executive director of NatWest, said the plans for the Manchester
Olympics appeared to be sensible, and he did not envisage that there would
be any difficulty in raising the finance. The plans would be looked at on a
project-by-project basis and the British banks had a good record in project
finance and risk management.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (15): Solid and serious
/ Profile of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE healthiest thing that has happened to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) is that
it has stopped worrying about being the number one domestic bank. It has
settled down to being a very solid, serious and indisputably large, banking
group.
BBV was the first of the large domestic banking groups to emerge as a result
of a merger process and it is the first to come out the other side, intact
and with the traumas of union behind it.
When Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, the arch-rivals of Basque banking
savvy, merged at the end of the 1980s to form BBV, the numero uno ideal was
something close to an obsession. It was also a short-lived ambition for the
Basque alliance begat others.
A couple of years after Bilbao and Vizcaya had walked down the aisle
together in 1988, two Barcelona-based savings banks, the Caja de Pensiones
and the Caja de Ahorros de Barcelona, linked up to form La Caixa, Spain's
biggest financial institution. A year later, in 1991, a second wave of
mergers was in process that was to definitively alter the profile of the
domestic financial institutions.
BBV was finally knocked off its top perch when the state-controlled banks
linked up to form Argentaria and when Banco Central joined forces with Banco
Hispano Americano to create Banco Central Hispano (BCH). Argentaria posted
larger average assets for 1992 and BCH's net interest income, although down
on its 1991 figure, was above that of BBV.
The downgrading in the banking system's ratings does not appeared to have
wounded BBV's pride overmuch. Nor, for that matter, was it too upset about
the fact that its net profits had dropped by nearly 20 per cent in 1992 to
Pta81bn. The reason for the lowered profits was that the banking group had
posted a fall not in its day-to-day business but in extraordinary profits
through disposals.
Non-banking business income last year was, at Pta40.2bn, 42 per cent down on
what had been earned in 1991 when the banking group had sold off two of its
subsidiary networks.
The extraordinary income of the previous years - when BBV rationalised all
the duplication that had resulted from the merger - had, however, been put
to good use. It had used the cash flow to improve its products and its fee
business and to reduce its costs and pick its clients.
BBV's real bottom line at the end of last year was that it had improved its
margins where they mattered. It was this that pointed to the banking group's
exit from the merger traumas.
The key points in BBV's 1992 figures were that its operating profit grew by
11.1 per cent to Pta136bn; its ordinary profit was up by 8.6 per cent to
Pta74.2bn; and its share of the banking sector's deposits and other borrowed
funds increased by 1.25 per cent to represent 14.29 per cent of the total.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, argued with disarming logic that 'today's
clients are tomorrow's profits.'
Analysts, who gave the balance sheet high points, noted that BBV's bad debts
grew by just 15.7 per cent against an average 50 per cent increase in bad
loans for the domestic financial sector as a whole and that its operating
expenses declined by 2.3 per cent.
Mr Ybarra, hailing 'a tremendous improvement' in the bank's profitability
profile, announced that the dividend would be increased by Pta6 to Pta169
per share.
By the first-quarter milestone of this year, BBV seemed to be clearly on the
right track. It reported a 4.4 per cent rise in net income to Pta17bn over
the first three months of 1992, an operating profit rise of 7.3 per cent to
Pta36.7bn and a 10.4 per cent rise in ordinary profits to Pta21.8bn.
By comparison with net first-quarter profit rises of 8.1 per cent and of 6.1
per cent that were reported by Banco de Santander and by Banco Popular
respectively, BBV's three-month figure looked more modest.
But once more BBV appeared to be gaining advantage on account of its size
over its smaller rivals. The 1992 trend which had BBV increasing its share
of the sector's deposits and borrowed funds appeared to be still very much
in force. The banking group said its first-quarter customer deposits stood
at Pta6,200bn; 10 per cent up on the volume at the end of the first three
months of last year.
What was quite clear from the first-quarter balance sheet was that the
quality of BBV results was consistently improving. If the operating profit
continues to grow this year then the 1992 net income drop will prove to have
been an isolated hiccup and Mr Ybarra's upbeat remarks to the group's AGM
will have been fully justified.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (14): Last economic
castle collapses - The Peseta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING back, it is hard to even conceive of how the Spanish government  -
on deciding to take the peseta into the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System just before hosting the country's first European
Community summit in June 1989 - decided to make Pta65 worth DM1.
Was it arrogance? Was the government simply trying to make voters believe
the country really had arrived at the European pinnacle? Or did Madrid
really think its currency was worth that much money?
There have been lots of theories, most of them emanating from the Finance
Ministry, about why a strong peseta was necessary. First, it was a weapon in
the fight against inflation - by making imports cheap during a time of
rising consumer spending, you were importing low, German, inflation and at
the same time forcing local industry to re-tool and become competitive.
As high real interest rates quickly drove the currency close to Pta62 for
DM1, government officials would happily suggest that their problem was not
that the currency was growing too strong but that it still might not be
strong enough.
Then, when inflation did not fall, but rose, the strong peseta became
necessary simply because it was vital to have a stable currency. There never
seemed to be much debate about what level it ought to be stable at.
The peseta was the last of the economic castles created during 11 years of
unchallengeable rule by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, to collapse. In
three devaluations in nine months - the last on May 13, in the middle of a
general election campaign - it crumbled to Pta79.1 to DM1 and many foreign
exchange market analysts expect it to fall further as the economy weakens.
An economy which in 1989 created 1,000 jobs a day was destroying nearly
3,000 a day in January, February and March this year. Inflation, considered
to be doing well at an annual 4.6 per cent, is in fact no better than what
it was at the end of 1987. In between, inflated company profits fuelled high
wage rises and took inflation up to nearly 7 per cent. No-one bothered to
warn employers or unions.
Mr Gonzalez won his third general election in 1989 because Spaniards were
still enjoying themselves and the post-fiesta rot had not yet set in.
After the devaluations and the creeping collapse of the peseta against the
D-Mark earlier last summer, however, Spaniards are now more than 20 per cent
poorer - in European terms - than they were a year ago. Mr Gonzalez' boast
that Spaniards were earning nearly 80 per cent of average EC income has also
been badly set back. He never mentioned it in his recent campaign.
But with the socialist victory on June 6 - albeit without a parliamentary
majority - the peseta has firmed a little, to about Pta76 to DM1. This is
mainly because the socialists are less likely than their conservative
opponents, the Peoples Party (PP), to cut interest rates rapidly and
analysts agree there is some room for a fall to below the current Pta79.1
parity against the German currency.
Much will depend on how quickly Mr Gonzalez is able to put in place a stable
administration, committed to fiscal discipline and strong enough to push
labour market reform past certain union opposition. Government-building has
already begun and should soon be complete.
For the moment, the Bank of Spain is using the peseta's relative strength to
build its reserves up should the speculators return. Foreign exchange
reserves are part of a tiny mystery in Spain at the moment. The Bank is
believed to have tried to stave off the last devaluation by selling pesetas
forward and thus its real reserves may be lower than the official count of
about Dollars 44bn.
The Bank has vigorously denied that it tried to stave off the last
devaluation by selling peseta options, but the accusation and the denial
were very tightly focused on options and the true state of the reserves has
not been settled by either.
One way to find out would be for the markets to test the peseta again
although the Bank (supported by the government), despite its nominal
interest rate cuts, is holding real rates high in order to capture foreign
savings necessary to finance the country's public deficits. Some things do
not change. If the country sinks any deeper into recession, those real rates
will become untenable and Mr Gonzalez must hope that, as he readjusts his
economic sights downwards a little, he is given time to prepare his
defences.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (16): Spartan bill of
fare - Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CYNIC would say that the biggest loser of this month's general election
was not Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the conservative leader who will remain in
opposition, but the investment banking community which was expecting a
defeat of the socialist government and a consequent rush of privatisations
similar to the ones that have been outlined in neighbouring France.
Mr Aznar, who believes that private is better, was prepared to sell off
'everything that could be bought'. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, returned to power for
a fourth term, is not explicitly doctrinaire on the subject but in practice
he has only sanctioned partial privatisations - and then only when he was
pressed into them by budgetary constraints.
The growing deficit burden has pushed Mr Gonzalez's government into the
disposal of 13.3 per cent of Repsol, the energy group, and of 25 per cent of
Argentaria, the state-owned banking corporation this year. Between them they
realised some Dollars 2bn which was comfortably over the Dollars 1.3bn that
the government expected to net through partial privatisation according to
the 1993 budget.
The issue now is whether Mr Gonzalez, heeding pragmatism rather than
doctrine, will travel further down the disposal road. This of course begs
the question of what exactly the budget deficit might be. The point is that
although more has already been raised to ease the burden than was initially
anticipated, it may not be enough.
The government hopes to rein-in the deficit at 4.5 per cent of GDP, which is
a repeat on last year and overshoots the Convergence targets for Monetary
Union, but it could be anything up to a full point higher according to
independent estimates. If that is the true situation then a renewed bout of
disposals is on the cards - and the question then is which companies.
Unlike France which has a very rich menu of public sector companies to whet
market appetites, Spain has a spartan bill of fare. It is extremely
unlikely, for example, that even the wealthiest and most patriotically
motivated of Iberia's highly-paid pilots would buy shares in the loss-making
national airline.
What the Spanish government can credibly offer to the international markets,
as Mr Aznar would no doubt have discovered had he been elected into office,
is Repsol and Argentaria, the electricity utility, Endesa, Telefonica, the
telecommunications group, and the tobacco company Tabacalera. All five are
already publicly quoted, the first three of them as a result of the partial
privatisations undertaken under Mr Gonzalez's previous governments.
Repsol and Argentaria, having gone to the markets in the first half of this
year, are not due to do so again until next year at the earliest. Only a
real budgetary emergency would justify their imminent return to the
international investor roadshow circuit. Their equity would nevertheless be
no doubt welcomed for both their public issues earlier this year were
heavily oversubscribed.
Endesa and Telefonica are surer bets. A public share issue of just 10 per
cent of Endesa, which is 67 per cent owned by the state-holding conglomerate
Instituto Nacional de Industria, could realise something close to Dollars
900m. Telefonica, which has a huge market capitalisation and high liquidity,
could raise a similar amount if the Finance Ministry, which owns about a
third of it, were to reduce its stake in the company by just some 3 per
cent.
The telecommunications group would almost certainly be the first to go the
market. Endesa has a number of question marks over it from the market point
of view because it is currently involved in asset swap negotiations with its
private sector rival Iberdrola and, in any case, the entire domestic
electric utility sector is still awaiting a new legal framework that will
adapt it to EC deregulation directives.
Should the INI conglomerate, Endesa's main shareholder, find itself severely
affected by cutbacks in the subsidies it receives from the state budgets it
may nevertheless be hurried into seeking capital gains from its
money-spinning utility. INI has traditionally been held in check by its lame
ducks and its cyclically-based companies are likely to punish horribly its
consolidated balance sheet this year.
Tabacalera, which is 54 per cent state-owned, would raise a far more modest
sum, perhaps Dollars 175m, were it to publicly issue 20 per cent of its
equity. It is not, from the investor point of view, at its most appetising
at present for its results are sagging and it is, for good measure, in the
middle of selling off its food division. In all likelihood a partial
privatisation of Tabacalera would involve direct equity sale to one or more
big tobacco groups and bypass the markets.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (9): Caution and
consolidation - Domestic Banks
</HEADLINE>

SPAIN'S private banks association, the AEB, forecast this month that 1993
profits for the sector as a whole would be similar to the Pta529bn that it
posted last year. The estimate suggests, on the one hand, that bank results
are now stabilising and, on the other, that a division between the more and
the less profitable institutions that emerged decisively in 1992 is likely
to remain in place.
The bankers will be pleased to see no further losses in 1993. Nobody in the
sector cares to recall 1992, a year that was characterised by most bank
chairmen as the most difficult in a decade and which saw the overall profit
of the domestic banks fall by 15 per cent.
The fall was not, however, evenly spread. A breakdown of the 1992 results
showed tumbling profits for Banesto, for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and for
Banco Central Hispano (BCH), but improved income, albeit by less than in the
past, at Banco Santander and at the always extremely profitable Banco
Popular. Argentaria, which was reporting its first full financial year,
showed a healthy profit.
The wide gulf that can exist in Spain's banking sector is illustrated by
comparing the extreme cases of Banesto and Popular. Banesto's average assets
last year were more than double those of Popular but Popular's market
capitalisation this month was nearly twice that of Banesto; Popular's ROA in
1992 was staggering 2.12 per cent, while Banesto's was 0.26 per cent.
The losers last year blamed their poor results on a sharp decrease in
extraordinary income through disposals. This will no longer be necessarily
the case for profits from non-banking business for the sector as a whole was
up to Pta20bn in the first quarter of this year against the Pta12bn total in
the first three months of last year.
Since January, Banesto and BCH, who were both notably below the fault line
that separated the profitable from the less profitable, have disposed of a
national branch network and three regional networks respectively.
But the chief reason that the losses may have bottomed out is that the
alarming increase of non-performing loans that set in last year appears to
have peaked. On the strength of the first-quarter figures, the AEB estimated
that the non-performing loans this year will rise to Pta300bn against the
1992 total of Pta500bn.
First-quarter provisions by the sector as a whole this year were up by 40
per cent against the first three months of 1992. At Pta80bn, the
first-quarter total was similar to the average volume of three-month
provisioning in 1992, when bad debts, and provisions, escalated sharply in
the second half of the year.
Caution and consolidation are now the watchwords and the banks have
considerably tightened their loan policies. They are also dragging their
feet over cheapening their credits and passing on to their clients the
lowered rates that the monetary authorities introduced following the
peseta's May devaluation.
The tardiness over the rate cuts underlined a clear policy difference
between the private banks and the state-controlled Argentaria group which
brought its prime lending rate in mid-June down to 11.50 per cent, just 25
basis points above the benchmark rate set by the Bank of Spain.
Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, said the move anticipated general
cuts throughout Europe and that it represented his banking group's
contribution to economic recovery. The rival banks in the private sector
believed however that Argentaria had acted in response to the pleas by the
Economy Ministry, which is, after all, its master, for cheaper money.
The AEB said it would be 'very difficult' for the sector to shadow the
official cuts in the short term. This was in part because the interest
rate-sensitive interbank market provides only 10 per cent of the funds
raised by the private banks. It was also because margins are already very
squeezed; the average current account was delivering an interest of 8.7 per
cent at the end of March against 8.34 per cent at the begining of the year.
In their different ways all the banks are presently very active: Banesto,
the weakest of the big banks, is undergoing a remarkable capital increase
with the aid of J. P. Morgan of the US; BBV is demonstrably improving its
operating profits; BCH is determinedly tackling its merger traumas; and
Santander, ever the domestic sector's pacemaker, is out in front with an
attempt to break into the mortgage market.
The heightened competition will no doubt be a factor against any swing
towards greater profitability for the sector as a whole. Gone are the cosy
quasi-cartel days that existed until the late 1980s when domestic banks
respected each other's business and were tightly regulated.
The competition will also ensure that the division between the more and the
less profitable big banks remains very much in place. The present slump for
the banks is not unlike the one at the start of the 1980s when the economy
also ground to a halt and there was a dramatic increase in bad loans. But
there is one key difference.
'In the early 1980s, we all came out of the banking crisis in step. Now our
starting positions are quite different,' says Mr Luis Valls, co-chairman of
Banco Popular.
Investors are going to have to chose between those who are starting well
behind and offer very attractive prices and the expensive front-line
favourites. Across the field, however, none is likely to fare worse than in
1992.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (13): An irresistible
opportunity / Profile of Banesto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHAT, analysts wanted to know, did J. P. Morgan, the US investment bank, see
in Banesto?
Most people looked at Spain's fourth-ranked bank in terms of assets, and saw
the sharpest growth of non-performing loans in the sector and an exposure to
industry that barely met the capital adequacy ratios set by the bank of
Spain. At the end of last year Banesto posted a 23 per cent fall in net
profits.
J. P. Morgan, however, looked at Banesto and liked what it saw. It liked it
so much that in May it co-ordinated a three-stage plan that aims to raise up
to Pta130bn in fresh funds for the bank, a sum that represents the biggest
capital increase ever recorded in Spain.
The US investment bank put the full weight of its prestige behind Banesto's
future fortunes and it put its money - and that of its clients - where its
mouth was. J. P. Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund will invest Dollars 200m
in a three-for-one rights issue, the first stage of the capital increase,
and the fund will end up owning some 10 per cent of Banesto.
J. P. Morgan spent seven months last year researching Banesto. Behind the
bank's poor balance sheet it saw in Banesto a potential that others had
failed to value.
Simply put, the J. P. Morgan team that burrowed into the heart of Banesto
discovered an irresistible investor opportunity. They found a bank that had
a country-wide retail outlet; that had invested strongly in information
systems; that had a strong management; and that was very undervalued by the
market .
Banesto, J. P. Morgan perceived, lacked specialised banking knowledge and
was strapped for capital. These shortcomings were exactly what the US
investment bank could provide. J. P. Morgan believes there is great room for
improvement in Banesto's treasury department and that new approaches, on
swaps and other trading skills, could raise the margins of the bank's core
financial business.
In the short term, however, Banesto requires more funds rather than more
know-how. The US investment bank, which has set up its Corsair portfolio to
invest in the sort of opportunities afforded by the Banestos of this world,
has the funds readily available.
The all-important feature of the arrival of fresh funds to Banesto is that
it will strengthen the bank's capital base at a very crucial time. Banesto
is the dominant shareholder in a spread of domestic enterprises which come
under the umbrella of its conglomerate, Corporacion Industrial. It is this
corporate involvement that has prompted the Bank of Spain to take a long and
critical look at the bank's capital adequacy ratio.
An injection of funds does two things: it deflects the Bank of Spain's
spotlight and it gives Banesto time to avoid a fire sale. The bank will now
be able to dispose of its industrial assets to the best bidder and without
pressure from Bank of Spain authorities.
Banesto clearly gains breathing space through a capital increase but J. P.
Morgan, which is masterminding the arrival of fresh cash, stands to make
important deals as it advises the Spanish bank in the sale of its assets.
In the mid-term, Banesto is due to sell off Acerinox, Spain's leading
stainless steel producer and Union Carburos, its industrial gases group. The
bank is also understood to be open to possible buyers for Tudor, Europe's
third-ranked battery producer, Agroman, the big domestic building group and
Asturiana de Zinc, a highly profitable mining business when the cycle is
right.
Banesto's weak capital base has consistently dragged down the bank's
profitability and the rights issue is expected to raise Banesto's Bank for
International Settlements ratio from 9.3 to 12 per cent even with all the
Corporacion Industrial assets in place. As disposals are realised, Banesto
will emerge with a very sound balance sheet and fully prepared to reap the
profits of its core banking business.
Among the aspects of Banesto that J. P. Morgan very much liked was its big
investment in the past years in new information systems. These, which are
reckoned to be the most advanced in the domestic banking sector, are now
poised to deliver significantly-increased efficiency and lowered costs to
Banesto's banking operations.
The US bank also approved of the leadership exerted by the mercurial Mr
Mario Conde, Banesto's chairman, a self-made millionaire who took over the
bank in 1987 at the age of 38. At the end of last year, Mr Conde reshuffled
his top management and, to J. P. Morgan's delight, promoted Mr Enrique
Lasarte, a highly regarded and experienced financier, to become chief
executive of Banesto's core banking business.
What J. P. Morgan expects is that Mr Conde will give Mr Lasarte all the
support he requires to severely cut back Banesto's overweighted staff and to
rationalise the existing spread of its banking network.
J. P. Morgan sees profitability for itself through the disposal of Banesto's
assets and also profitability for its Corsair funds as the bank turns around
its business. It also senses that it would be impossible to buy into
Banesto, a big bank by any standards, at a cheaper price.
The new shares that J. P. Morgan will acquire in the rights issue will be
priced at Pta1,500 with an extra Pta400 offered for subscription rights. At
the time of agreement, Banesto shares stood at about Pta2.645 - they have
since fallen off - and broking houses reckon that equity in Mr Conde's bank
is a clear buy below Pta3,000.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (11): Post-merger
difficulties / Profile of Banco Central Hispano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), the biggest domestic private bank in terms of
assets, is unlucky. Banking mergers are always expensive and never easy;
when they occur in a recessionary climate they become very difficult.
The union between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano that brought BCH
into being was announced midway through 1991 just as the economy was
beginning to slide. Last month, Mr Jose Mara Almusategui, the BCH chairman,
gave a very a strong 'I am in charge' message that only served to underline
the post-merger difficulties.
Analysts note that BCH was the sole domestic banking group to post a drop in
its net interest income last year and that its cost-to-income ratio was, at
72.3 per cent, substantially higher that that of other institutions. In its
1992 balance sheet, BCH was forced to put aside Pta67bn for bad debt
provisions and a further Pta3.2bn to cover depreciations in its portfolio.
Mr Almusategui, former chairman of Hispano Americano, the smaller of the two
units, became president of BCH last October, succeeding Mr Alfonso Escamez,
the veteran Central chairman who is something of a living legend in the
domestic banking sector. Within six months Mr Almusategui had stamped an
aggressively personal style on the group.
The Almusategui revolution essentially consists in cutting out senior
executive levels - the managing director slot has disappeared - and
concentrating all reporting on the chairman's office. This applies both to
the core banking business and to the network of industrial interests that
involve the BCH group.
Mr Almusategui toyed with the idea of pooling BCH's industrial interests
into a single holding, much as Banesto has done with its Corporacion
Banesto. With a background in public sector industrial conglomerates - he
has held top jobs in both INI, the state holding company, and in INH, the
chief shareholder of the Repsol energy group - Mr Almusategui is a firm
believer in corporate umbrellas.
In the event he has stopped short of travelling all the way down the Banesto
road but he has considerably tightened head office control over the bank's
industrial assets.
Under his newly imposed system, Mr Almusategui will personally review the
budgets and business plans set by each BCH-controlled company and he will
likewise pass judgment on how targets have been met.
The system must be unsettling for the companies which have grown used to
minimum interference from what used to be a mostly hands-off shareholder.
'From now on I have told every chairman of the industrial group that I am on
the end of the phone line. It would be an error therefore if they failed to
ring me when necessary,' Mr Almusategui said recently.
BCH's chairman says that what he is seeking is unified management criteria
for the group. He has set in place centralised teams at head office which
will shadow the different companies within the BCH group in four specific
areas: financial relations with the parent bank; strategic planning;
budgets; and market performance.
The revolution also involves creating a specific BCH image. Modelling itself
on campaigns launched by BBV and Banco Santander, BCH has recently produced
a bouncing pink kangaroo that leaps around TV commercials calling on all
comers to sign up for a new savings account.
The marketing hype is quite foreign to BCH's constituent parts because Banco
Central, a familiar institution on every high street corner, never needed to
sell itself over much while Hispano Americano, which appealed to a somewhat
higher income bracket, was essentially just as relaxed.
Mr Almusategui's team feels that the new sales aggression is exactly what
the banking group needed. By just flexing its muscles with the kangaroo
campaign, BCH claims it has attracted Pta200bn in new customer deposits
within a month.
BCH believes that it will be back on the road of steady profitability just
as soon as it overcomes its merger difficulties. For the time being it must
be patient; BBV, which was created in 1988, three years before BCH, only
claimed that it was properly back on the profitable path this year.
There is little doubt that BCH is tackling the difficulties. In the past 18
months it has reduced the number of its branches from 3,500 to 2,810,
shedding some 4,000 jobs in the process, and it has spent Pta6.7bn in a new
information system for the network.
Mr Almusategui is also anxious to realise as much as possible through
disposals. Three regionally-based subsidiary banks have been sold off this
year and a fourth subsidiary, Banco de Fomento which has a 165-branch
national network, is also up for sale.
In March, France's BNP withdrew from negotiations to acquire Fomento,
allegedly because of the Pta47.8bn price that BCH had placed on its
subsidiary.
BCH's chairman claims that for the duration of this decade, the banking
group could raise profits of Pta30bn-40bn annually through disposals of the
group's varied interests. The estimate is a very reasonable one for BCH has
valuable stakes in a broad spectrum of Spanish blue chips. The bank is also
the leading shareholder of Cepsa, the petrol refiner and distributor, the
construction company Dragados, the property group Vallehermoso and the
sugar-based food group Azucarera.
Mr Almusategui told an interviewer that he had no intention of selling off
such crown jewels unless 'situations of real necessity' were to take place.
With a merger process underway at an unfavourable moment, it is more than
useful for BCH to have such a safety net.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (10): Foreign cushion
eases journey / Profile of Banco de Santander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S bank chairmen this year told their shareholders a fair amount of bad
news. One after another they warned about worrying loans portfolios and
sluggish credit demand. Banco de Santander's Mr Emilio Botin told his annual
general meeting about a growth strategy that had nothing to do with the
recessionary domestic climate.
Together with Banco Popular, a smaller bank that is just as tightly managed
and is even more profitable, Santander is a domestic banking success story.
Its ROA last year stood at 1.10 per cent and its bad debt coverage at 96.6
per cent. Popular, in comparison, had an ROA of 2.12 per cent and bad debt
coverage of 84.3 per cent while the figures for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV)
were 0.86 per cent and 70.2 per cent.
Mr Botin was able to talk growth to his shareholders because Santander is
solidly based outside Spain. Popular, which is about 50 per cent owned by
foreign institutions and individuals, makes a lot of money because over the
years it has selectively drawn top domestic clients into its fold.
Santander, a bigger banking group with consequently larger ambitions, has
looked abroad for business.
International business contributed Dollars 205m to the bank's consolidated
1992 net profits of Dollars 577.1m. 'The time will come when half our assets
and profits will be abroad. That is our objective and that is where we are
going,' Mr Botin said.
Santander's business outside Spain has three principal legs. In Europe,
where it is a significant shareholder of the Royal Bank of Scotland and of
Portugal's BCI, it has pioneered the Interbanking On Line System, IBOS,
which hooks together its British and Portuguese partners as well as Credit
Comercial de France and in North America it is the main shareholder of the
fast-growing New Jersey bank, First Fidelity Bancorporation.
The third leg is Santander's growing involvement in the emerging markets of
Latin America where it has built up a strong corporate finance business. One
of the group's latest successes has been co-lead with Colombia's Corfivalle
investment bank, of a Dollars 130m Eurobond issued by the Republic of
Venezuela.
Santander's foreign cushion has allowed it to ride out the hard bumps of the
domestic ride. In the second half of May the bank announced a Dollars 195m
preferential share issue in the US. This was the fourth such issue in 18
months and it completed a programme which has raised a total of Dollars 750m
for the group.
The foreign-earned income that flows into the bank, as well as the
expectation of more to come, has a very clear function; it has allowed
Santander to take singular initiatives that have the dual purpose of raising
the bank's profile and of undermining the domestic competition.
At a time when rival banks in Spain are battling to rein in their
non-performing loans, Santander is using its liquidity to further squeeze
margins in the domestic market. In advance of last month's preferential
share issue, it rocked its rivals with a bid to capture a slice of the
mortgage market by offering sharp rate cuts to home buyers.
The 'lending war' provoked by the cuts was vintage Santander aggression. The
banking group had already showed its mettle when it unleashed a 'deposit
war' at the end of the 1980s by launching high interest-bearing current
accounts.
The current account assault on the domestic banking system forced rival, and
less liquid, banks to produce similar expensive products. And as margins
narrowed across the board, Santander comfortably increased its client base.
Santander's quota of the domestic mortgage market quota stands at less than
4 per cent and loans to homebuyers represent only 8 per cent of its total
lending. The bank aims to raise its mortgage activity to represent between
25 and 30 per cent of its lending, a level considered normal among European
banks.
Unlike the 'deposit war' initiative which took Santander's rivals so much by
surprise that it was months before they were able to offer similar high
interest current account products, the bid for the home-buying public has
met with a fast response. With the notable exception of Banesto, banking
institutions have also significantly brought down their rates.
The difference between Santander and its rivals in what looks like becoming
an increasingly competitive domestic battle is that Mr Botin's bank has its
well-focused foreign dimension. With growing assets and profits abroad,
Santander has a built in advantage on the home front.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (3): A golden prize
worth having - Ian Hamilton Fazey examines the pros and cons of bidding for
the Olympics and analyses the experience of other cities - Economic Impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IS IT worth it? An analysis by Tim Johnson of KPMG Peat Marwick says it
would be, with more than Pounds 4bn of extra spending power injected into
the regional economy and more than 11,000 jobs created if Manchester's bid
for the Games succeeds.
But is it worth it to bid and fail?
'Manchester's bid is already bringing significant economic benefit to the
north-west region,' says Mr Johnson, an accountant specialising in urban
regeneration and partnership between public and private sectors.
'The international image of Manchester and north-west England was improved
during the 1996 bid. It has been enhanced by the 2000 bid, which is seen as
even stronger and more exciting,' he says.
He estimates that about Pounds 200m of expenditure, supporting 480 jobs,
will be created in the region as a result of the capital investment in new
facilities - such as the velodrome and arena - which support the bid.
Bidding is therefore already adding value to the regional economy.
The real prizes, however, come with the Games themselves, and this is proved
by the 1984 Los Angeles Games. A study by Economic Research Associates
revealed substantial benefits to the local economy. This was estimated at
Dollars 2.4bn of spending at 1984 values and 7,560 jobs. The payroll was
worth Dollars 1.3bn, most of it going to local people.
Less than half of the spending was associated with the primary impact of the
Games - about Dollars 1.5bn and 5,000 jobs arose from the effect of the
Games on the more general economy around them. About 90 per cent of all
added value was estimated to have occurred in the local economy.
Los Angeles, however, did not need to build many facilities. Seoul, which
followed in 1988, did. The Korea Development Institute claims 33,600 jobs
were created by the Games, nearly two-thirds of them in the five years from
1982, when stadiums, arenas and other facilities were being built. It
estimates about Dollars 3.6bn of spending which South Korea would not
otherwise have had.
Barcelona's actual figures have not yet been finalised but Mr Johnson quotes
figures from the Ajuntament de Barcelona's report on the economic impact of
the 1992 Games.
These suggest about Dollars 6.7bn of investment to stage them, but more than
half of this went on infrastructure improvements to roads, hotels, the
airport and telecommunications.
However, the Olympics appear to have been responsible for generating more
than Dollars 8bn of total spending, with 128,000 jobs created in the Spanish
economy as a whole between 1987 and 1992. Total expenditure during these
years was equivalent to about 0.9 per cent of annual gross domestic product.
There was also a stream of less tangible but nevertheless important effects.
The Games stimulated technological innovation. Improvements to the
infrastructure will help the Catalan economy for decades to come: new
sporting facilities were built in more than a dozen towns in the region;
depressed areas of Barcelona were regenerated and its waterfront
transformed; and the airport improved its international capability.
KPMG Peat Marwick and the University of Georgia have carried out an initial
study on the likely economic impact. As with Los Angeles, there is already a
range of pre-existing facilities. A total impact of about Dollars 3.5bn is
expected from Games-related and Games-induced spending. Mr Johnson says
about Dollars 1.1bn of earnings should be generated, supporting nearly
84,000 full-time and part-time jobs.
Atlanta will also try to maximise the impact through monitoring,
measurement, control and management. At other Games it was assumed there
would be benefits - and they did flow. The accountancy firm and the
university are now assisting in a long-term programme to develop a
co-ordinated strategy to identify and monitor accurately the channels of
impact of the Games upon the local economy. The aim will be to make them as
beneficial as possible.
It is against this background that Manchester is searching for its own
bonanza. Mr Johnson's study suggests capital investment for the Games,
coupled with operating and visitor spending, would support about Pounds
4.1bn of regional spending, generating 111,450 person-years of employment,
which by convention equates to 11,145 full-time equivalent jobs.
This converts to about Dollars 6.4bn for comparative purposes with Atlanta's
Dollars 3.5bn, Barcelona's Dollars 8.3bn, Seoul's Dollars 3.6bn and Dollars
2.4bn in Los Angeles.
Manchester and the north-west would have to build a main stadium and several
other significant facilities - some of which are already under construction
 -but what is already in place is the north-west's outstanding
infrastructure. Its network of motorways allows most of the region to be
traversed in well under an hour from whatever starting point; the railway
network is almost complete, Metrolink, Manchester's super tram system, will
be comprehensive by 2000, running to Trafford Park and the main Olympic
sites; and its airport - already a thriving hub - will probably by then be
about the 12th largest in the world league table.
The KPMG Peat Marwick study suggests the cumulative impact of the Games, if
Manchester wins, would be worth about 10 per cent of north-west England's
present annual gross domestic product. The direct capital investment
programme needed - mainly for facilities - would be Pounds 1.5bn.
Although this sounds a lot of money, however, it should be put in a wider
context. It is about equal to the aggregate investment of north-west
manufacturing industry in a non-recession year and is about one-third of
total annual investment within the region by all industries and the public
sector.
Longer-term benefits could be confidently expected from new inward
investment and investment retained in the region. The latter is important:
holding on to what you already have is crucial in economic development,
especially with other areas in Britain and the rest of Europe offering
various temptations to persuade businesses to relocate to seemingly greener
pastures.
The Games' legacy would also be an infrastructure of world-class facilities
and associated commercial developments. These would have to be positively
managed to prevent their becoming white elephants. The Olympic village,
however, would be needed anyway: Manchester's network of universities and
colleges have already turned the city into the largest campus in Europe and
accommodation is a perpetual problem.
A less tangible benefit would be the effect on morale. The Games would
greatly enhance north-west England's image and self-belief. Mr Johnson
reckons there would be much economic development from new opportunities for
partnership between private, public and voluntary sectors and a great deal
of additional, but permanent, economic activity. This could generate more
than Pounds 400m of additional tax revenue for government.
There are, of course, risks. In Montreal, Olympic-induced debt has
outweighed the benefits of the 1976 Games. Japan's capital investment in the
1964 Tokyo Olympiad was a burden on the whole economy and adversely affected
the balance of trade during the years of run-up.
However, lessons have been learned, most notably from Los Angeles in 1984,
when the Games were saved by good management, television revenues, and the
combined efforts of public and private sectors. With UK government support
and the north-west public and private sectors in concert, Manchester is
hoping to come out well ahead financially, whatever happens in Monte Carlo
in September.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (7): Locals were
winners - The broking houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was hard, during the first half of this year, not to bump into a group of
globe-trotting merchant bankers in the lobby of any one of Madrid's top
half-dozen hotels. The billion-dollar issues of Repsol and of Argentaria had
teams of them arriving every other day from New York and London.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the US banks who acted as global
co-ordinators in the Repsol and Argentaria offerings respectively, were out
in force - as was S. G. Warburg which was co-lead manager for the UK tranche
in both issues. There were smaller teams from a clutch of other
international houses who had secured minor roles in the placements.
All the merchant bankers gained something, some more than others, through
their involvement in the offerings. But arguably the real winners were not
the top global firms but the domestic institutions who for the first time
played a part in important deal-making.
The two huge issues represented a big step forward for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV) which was co-global co-ordinator with Goldman Sachs in the Repsol
issue, and also for Argentaria whose broking unit was likewise teamed up
with Morgan Stanley in the issue of the parent bank.
In particular the two offerings represented a breakthrough for Banco
Santander de Negocios (BSN), the premier domestic merchant bank, which
joined forces with S. G. Warburg as co-lead manager in the large UK
placements of both issues.
The Repsol offering underlined the strong role that Goldman Sachs has
consolidated in big Spanish deals. The US bank established its reputation in
Spain by guiding Telefonica shares on to the international markets in the
mid-1980s and this led it to secure the co-ordination of 26 per cent of
Repsol shares in 1989. Goldman Sachs then went on to lead the subsequent
flotation of Endesa, the state-controlled electrical utility.
The Argentaria issue was highly important to Morgan Stanley because the US
bank has its eyes on forthcoming privatisations in France and in Italy.
Morgan Stanley discovered that it was able to tap a very rich vein of
American investors who were extremely interested in European banks.
S. G. Warburg had wanted to lead a European placement for Argentaria and
received a minor setback when the banking group gave it responsibility only
for the UK and awarded a continental Europe tranche to Union of Bank of
Switzerland. The London-based bank - which already had Repsol's UK offering
under its belt - has, however, established a strong link between British
investors and Spanish securities.
All the three global firms which were most involved in the issues were
'shadowed' by Spanish institutions. The experience was at first unsettling
for none wanted to share its expertise in international book-building but by
the end there was a fair amount of praise.
'If we do another issue we will be much more confident about Spanish
institutions,' said an executive of one of the US bank's involved in the
placements. The general view, somewhat to S. G. Warburg's chagrin, was that
BSN had 'been learning a lot' and gained 'very useful exposure' as the
co-leader in the UK for the two placements.
BSN certainly revelled in its opportunity. 'Goldman got its break when it
placed Telefonica and then it got mandates everywhere and all the way to
Mexico,' said a senior executive at the Madrid-based bank. 'The key to
getting a deal is to have done one before and that is what we have
achieved.'
BSN - a subsidiary of Banco de Santander and headed by Ms Ana Patricia Botin
whose father is chairman of Santander - has already built up considerable
international experience in Latin America and particularly in Mexico where
it has managed the Emerging Mexico Fund, matador bond issues and equity
placements.
Flushed with its involvement in the Repsol and Argentaria issues, BSN now
casts itself as a potential 'Latin' Goldman, a specialist in big 'southern'
deals stretching from Italy to Chile.
Goldman and J. P. Morgan are role models for BSN. Its executives, all young
and invariably foreign-trained, admire the deal-orientated motivation and
the team spirit of the two US banks. Ms Botin was herself employed for
several years by J. P. Morgan.
Whether BSN secures big mandates in the Hispanic world and elsewhere remains
to be seen. But the bank is likely to play increasingly important roles in
future Spanish privatisations.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (6): A sign of
confidence - Foreign banks in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest sign of confidence so far this year in Spain and in its
financial sector has been neither the rush to buy shares in the Argentaria
state banking corporation nor J. P. Morgan's involvement in an important
rights issue by the under-capitalised Banesto group. It has been Deutsche
Bank's decision to spend Dollars 350m on the acquisition of a medium-sized
Spanish bank.
The purchase followed a period of familiarisation with the domestic market
which apparently convinced the German bank that there was good business to
be done in Spain.
Deutsche Bank first moved into the Spanish retail market in 1989 when it
bought outright the 100-branch Barcelona-based Banco Comercial
Transatlantico (Bancotrans), a bank that it had founded early in the century
and which it forfeited after the Second World War. At Bancotrans, Deutsche
Bank began to develop mortgages and also niche products such as car loans
which were novel to Spain.
The second acquisition involved Banco de Madrid, a subsidiary of Banesto.
Banco de Madrid's 300-branch network in the Spanish capital and central
Spain compliments the Bancotrans presence in the north-east of the country
and together the two units make Deutsche Bank the biggest foreign bank
operating in the domestic retail sector.
Deutsche Bank is now bigger in Spain than Credit Lyonnais which bought two
bank networks, each with about 150 branches, in 1990 and 1991 and it is
nearly double the size of NatWest and of Barclays who both began building up
Spanish networks in the 1980s.
The German bank's move is by any standards a long-term investment. It now
faces the testing task of welding together its two branch networks and
moulding them to Deutsche Bank's own corporate culture.
Complex in-house information systems which were installed in Bancotrans now
have to be extended to Banco de Madrid and it will take at least eight years
before employees extract optimum benefits from the technology.
What Deutsche Bank has done is to buy a market quota. The strategy has been
similar to that of Credit Lyonnais whose purchases of Banca Jover in
Barcelona and of Banco Comercial, based in Madrid, both subsidiaries of
Banco de Santander, also aimed to establish a solid presence in the centre
of Spain and in the north-east.
This is a quick route into Spain and it contrasts with the step-by-step
approach developed by Barclays over the past 10 years following its purchase
of a small, and bankrupt, domestic bank.
The market quota strategy has an in-built advantage because Spain is a
thoroughly overbanked country that has more bank branches per head of
population than anywhere else in the European Community bar Luxembourg.
Setting up a banking office in an optimum location, as Barclays has done,
requires a lot of money and an equivalent amount of patience.
The obvious positive elements in the step-by-step strategy are that the
institution is able build up its staff gradually and according to its own
standards and that it can likewise choose exactly where it wants to open for
business.
Foreign banks who would follow Deutsche Bank and others into Spain have both
models to choose from.
A market quota is readily at hand in the shape of Banco de Fomento, a
subsidiary of Banco Central Hispano (BCH), with a nationwide network of 165
branches.
BCH was in negotiations to sell its unit earlier in the year to Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), but the talks broke down allegedly because the
price was too steep.
At the begining of this month, BCH paved the way for Fomento's future
disposal by paying the equivalent of Dollars 82m for the 32 per cent of the
bank that it did not already own.
The outright takeover was in the form of an offer of one BCH share for every
two of Fomento and it was accompanied by a commitment from BCH to put aside
Fomento's cash flow, which stood at Dollars 47.5m last year, for pension
funds and reserves.
BCH's move has put a clearer valuation on Fomento and its decision over the
cash flow will serve to make the unit more attractive to potential buyers.
Fomento's coverage of non-performing loans stood at 70.5 per cent last year,
down from 84.4 per cent in 1991.
The step-by-step strategy into Spain has in the meantime been made easier by
the continuing process of network rationalisation that is being conducted by
all the big Spanish banks, and particularly by BBV and BCH which have an
oversupply of branches as a result of the respective mergers.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (8): Shivers down the
spines - Spanish banks in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Mario Conde, president of Banesto, Spain's biggest banking group,
suggested at a recent annual general meeting that his institution could
merge with Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's leading private bank, he
sent a shiver down the spine of many Portuguese bankers.
Portuguese newspapers have for long been talking about the invasion of
Portugal by Spanish banks and other businesses. But bankers paled at the
idea of the takeover of one of the country's big four banks.
But when the uproar died down, people were faced with another of Mr Conde's
statements made at the same meeting: that directly or indirectly he owned
more than 40 per cent of BTA.
'In fact Mr Conde probably controls about 50.5 per cent of BTA. There is
simply no doubt that he owns the bank,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, an
analyst with independent brokers Midas Investimento in Lisbon. The legal
limit on direct foreign ownership of BTA is 10 per cent, soon to be raised
to 40 per cent.
According to senior officials at BTA, there is little likelihood of a direct
merger between the two banks. A more probable scenario is that J. P. Morgan,
the US investment bank which is expected to take a stake in Banesto, may
form a holding company that will control the shares of the two banks.
Banesto led the Spanish invasion by buying into BTA in a privatisation
operation. Other Spanish banks have taken a variety of other routes and
there are now at least six Spanish banks operating in Portugal today. But to
some the word 'invasion' to describe this process remains over-inflated.
'Spanish banks have at the most a 10 to 15 per cent share of the Portuguese
market at the moment,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist with
Banco Comercial Portuguese, a leading private bank. 'Over the next 50 years
this may expand to 30 per cent of the market. But what is going on is a
natural process of regional expansion between two closely connected
economies rather than an invasion.' This year, a Spanish bank became the
biggest single shareholder in BCP in a share swap under which Banco Central
Hispanoamericano acquired 10 per cent of BCP in exchange for 2 per cent of
its own shares and 50 per cent in Spain's leading private banking
institution, Banco Banif de Gestion Privada.
BCP intends to protect itself from any expansionist ambitions by changing
its statutes so that any institution acquiring more that 10 per cent of the
bank has a maximum of only 10 per cent of voting rights.
BTA and BCP both remain Portuguese banks with large Spanish shareholdings.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) decided to establish itself in its own right when
in 1991 it paid Pounds 110m to buy out Lloyds Bank Portugal which was then a
small corporate bank with 12 branches.
Since then the bank has grown to 57 branches as BBV pursues a strategy of
building a universal bank with enough critical mass to compete alongside the
big operators. The bank has introduced its own culture, investing in some
15,000 hours of training a year and despite its big expansion has only
increased the number of its staff by two.
In this time, the number of customers has increased four-fold. BBV has
invested Es300bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in information technology and increased the
number of its large corporate customers to 387 and its small- and
medium-sized company clients to 100,200. The number of staff working in the
head office has fallen from 46 per cent of the total to 27 per cent as BBV
has created a series of para-banking companies from leasing to brokerage.
'Portugal is a priority area for BBV along with Morocco and Latin America,'
says Mr Jose Luis Jolo Marin, managing director of the bank's Portuguese
operations. 'We currently have about 1.5 per cent of the Portuguese market.
Our aim is to build this up into a critical mass of about 5-7 per cent over
the next three years.'
Mr Jolo Marin is aware that this cannot be achieved by organic growth alone.
'We are on the look-out to buy into another Portuguese bank or perhaps reach
agreement on swapping networks or simply buying branches from an existing
Portuguese bank,' he says.
In four or five years, when it has reached the required critical mass, BBV
will seek a Portuguese partner, who will be offered 20-40 per cent of the
bank.
Spain's Banco Santander followed yet another route by buying a substantial
share of Banco Comercio e Industria, for which it has now requested
permission to make a 100-per-cent takeover with its partner the Royal Bank
of Scotland.
Santander is Spain's second-most-successful bank in Portugal after Banesto,
but it only has a 2 per cent share of the market. 'That is not enough to
talk about an invasion,' says Mr Gomes, 'In my view, Banesto is the only
Spanish bank that has made it big so far.'
What has Spanish banking given Portugal? 'We have introduced successful new
products but I think Portuguese banks are just as imaginative as we are in
that respect,' says Mr Jolo Marin. 'What we are doing is bringing new life,
new competition and new business to the market. When a bank moves it is
because it sees a fast-growing economy with good opportunities and that is
why Spanish banks are moving into Portugal.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (2): The metamorphosis
of Manchester - Britain's bid for the Games is about much more than sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER'S bid for the 2000 Olympic Games symbolises important changes
which have been taking place in Britain in the past 15 years. The bid - by
Manchester on behalf of north-west England and Britain as a whole - is
confirmation that Britain's regions are increasingly able to stand on their
own feet.
Britain remains a highly centralised country, with main roads and rail lines
leading to London, where political power is at its most concentrated. But
the dependence of the regions on London has been changing, particularly
since the recession of 1980-82.
Indeed, over the past three to four years, while the south-east has borne
the brunt of the most recent economic downturn, the impact in Britain's
regions has been less serious.
Unemployment has risen less rapidly; average house prices in Greater
Manchester have held steady and the prices of some types have risen. In the
south-east by contrast, prices have fallen sharply.
There appear to be three main reasons for these trends. First, London priced
itself out of regional markets, for many financial and professional services
in the 1980s, encouraging growth in these sectors in the regions, especially
in Manchester and Leeds.
This, in turn, has created tens of thousands of professional and
white-collar jobs, and helped to turn Manchester into an important financial
and professional centre in its own right.
The second reason is infrastructure. The completion of the M62 between
Liverpool and Hull has meant that not all main roads now lead south. An
intra-regional trading economy has developed along the length of the M62 -
directed through the Humber, which now matches the Thames in total cargoes.
The Humber faces good northern European regional markets across the North
Sea.
The other infrastructure element is Manchester Airport, which - since its
designation as an international gateway and Britain's official northern hub
in the mid-1980s - has trebled in size to become the 18th largest in the
world and plans to leapfrog five places up the world league table by 2005.
The third force driving change has been economic and physical
reconstruction. City centre dereliction has been tackled by creating new
uses for old buildings, such as museums. A disused Manchester railway
station has been turned into an exhibition hall and arena, and ship canal
docklands have been transformed into a mixed residential-commercial quarter,
Salford Quays. In Liverpool, the north west's other great city, the Albert
Dock, a huge brick Victorian dockside warehouse built in the age of sail,
now houses the northern branch of the Tate Gallery.
Mr Anthony Goldstone, chairman of the North West Tourist Board, says: 'All
this has started to change the image of smoking mill chimneys, dereliction
and pollution. More than 5,000 mill chimneys have been knocked down.
Tourists spend Pounds 1bn a year in the region.'
At the same time, small and medium-sized business development - the seed
corn of economic revival - has been fostered by the UK's most comprehensive
regional network of enterprise agencies. Manchester's venture capital and
corporate finance communities are strong, with power to syndicate their own
deals, without the need to go to London.
All these factors have enabled Manchester to mount a credible bid for the
Olympic Games, even though many in southern England still believe only
London is capable of winning such a prize.
The bid is being driven by four people: Mr Bob Scott, whose vision it was;
Mr Craig Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic Association and an
unwavering supporter; Mr Howard Bernstein, deputy chief executive of
Manchester city council, who fulfils the functions of finance director and
general manager; and Mr John Glester, chief executive of Central Manchester
Development Corporation, the government regeneration agency for the centre
of the city. This makes him Whitehall's proxy in the team.
Supporting them are the politicians. They start with Mr Graham Stringer, the
pragmatic and widely-respected Labour leader of Manchester city council, and
they finish with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who has been
active publicly and privately lobbying IOC members.
The prime minister wants Manchester to succeed, and has made the most
decisive contribution so far by guaranteeing funding, and by committing more
than Pounds 75m of public money to clearing sites and building facilities.
Amec, the construction group, is already building a velodrome and Bovis an
arena.
Manchester has as a result secured approval from the IOC's 12-member
technical delegation, enabling the city to concentrate on selling itself, as
a gateway to a Britain which can be easily reached via a transportation
infrastructure already largely in place. As a further bonus, London is
easily accessible to visitors.
When Atlanta won the 1996 Games, it followed the securing of similar
technical approval. Its final campaign was able to sell Dixie and the
romantic US south.
Manchester made a bid for the 1996 Games and lost - but it learned from the
experience. If it wins this time, it will be because it won its heats at
home, not only knocking London out of the running but persuading the
government that staging the Games made serious economic sense and deserved
some up-front spending.
This is not just because of the Pounds 4bn of added value which the Games
would be likely to generate, with more than 11,000 jobs created, but because
holding the events in the north west would speed the regeneration of a
difficult part of east Manchester blighted by a former coal mine, a gasworks
and canalside dereliction which is a legacy of the industrial revolution.
Long term, these problems would have had to be tackled anyway, as would
Manchester's growing problem over student accommodation, which subsequent
use of the Olympic athlete's village will partly solve.
The Olympic bid has, therefore, provided a focus. Winning the Games will
give Manchester a chance of emerging as one of Europe's most important
cities in the 21st century.
Manchester is already capital of the north. Economically, the north-west
alone is bigger than Greece or Portugal. Mr Stringer thinks Europe will have
room for only about a dozen big regional centres in the next few decades and
Greater Manchester, a conurbation of 2.5m people in a north of England
populated by 14m, is already well on the way to becoming one of them. Mr
Stringer says it should be compared with Lyons, Barcleona, Milan, Stuttgart
or Munich to appreciate its European potential.
The Games would therefore help change the structure of Britain and the
balance of economic power between north and south. They are concerned with
much more than 17 days of sport in seven years' time.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (1): Going into the
last lap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's the last lap of the race for the 2000 Olympic Games, and, as the bell
sounds, it's Sydney surging to the front with Beijing pressing on the
leader's shoulder.
Manchester has now moved clearly into third place, with Berlin a metre or
two behind and Istanbul gathering for a final effort. Brasilia is the length
of the straight behind.  Inside the track, Tashkent and Milan, the two who
dropped out of this oh-so-high-pressure race, watch their dreams fade as the
leaders accelerate towards the back straight.
And it's Sydney for Australia, holding on.  They had to make their effort
early, and show what they are made of months ago, because they are at their
best in their summer, which is in the northern hemisphere's winter.  Have
they succeeded in burning off the opposition? Perhaps.  Beijing is showing
definite signs of stress.  Their supporters are reacting with another of
their famous spontaneous displays of disciplined solidarity but looking into
the VIP box I can see this has not impressed several members of the IOC.
There's a bit of bumping and boring going on, as they approach the last 200
metres.  Berlin clearly could not hear Istanbul closing because of the noise
from the German spectators.  That may well have shot their chances.
The leaders are on the final bend ..and Bob Scott of Manchester and Great
Britain - a tall, bespectacled theatrical impresario in his other life - has
kicked.  AND-HE'S-GOING-FOR-GOLD.  That will please Apollo Leisure, his
employer and personal sponsor.  They've given him four years off work for
this and he's paying them back handsomely - win, lose or draw.
And 'Ive just been told by my headphones that Manchester's bid has been
passed summa-cumlaude by the IOC technical delegation - and that means the
IOC believes Manchester can noy only do it, but guarantee the world a good
Games in the year 2000.  When that happened last time to Atlanta, it cleared
them to stop arguing about whether they could do it, and steal up on the
technically-suspect Athens to take the prize.
Scott clearly knew this was coming - and what strength it has given
Manchester]  Beijing is faltering.  They're in the final straight. Sydney
has just realised how serious a threat Manchester is, and just looked round
anxiously.  The Australians know they're in the wrong time zone for the
American TV networks.  The underdog is neck-and-neck with the favourites.
They're almost abreast, rushing for the line and Olympic glory.  Can
Manchester and Bob Scott do it?
In the VIP box John Major is on his feet.  The Princess Royal, Britain's IOC
member, is cheering]  They're nearly there]  It's Manchester] It's Sydney]
Beijing are dipping for the line.  It's going to be a photo-finish]  How on
earth are the 91 members of the International Olympic Committee going to
sort this out?
And now we hear they are going to give their verdict on who has won the 2000
Olympics at a meeting in Monte Carlo on September 23.  The suspense is going
to be absolutely killing.  So now over to Ian Hamilton Fazey, Northern
Correspondent of the Financial Times, who will explain the background to
Manchester's part in this remarkable race.'

Argentaria last month was similar in size and public impact to that of
Repsol, the energy group, in 1989.
The difference was that a rumpus followed the allocation of the energy
group's oversubscribed equity four years ago - but all was ostensibly peace
and quiet in the equally demand-driven allocation of Argentaria shares.
The Repsol issue brought the Madrid Bolsa's watchdog, the Comision Nacional
del Mercado de Valores, CNMV, into the centre stage for the first time.
Then recently formed and modelled on the SEC, the CNMV took a very critical
look at the manner in which a limited number of Madrid security houses had
bent and broken rules in order to obtain extra volumes of Repsol paper for
their clients.
Some houses were fined by the CNMV in the wake of the energy group's share
offering and one was ordered to cease operating.
There was no need for any such disciplinary action last month when
Argentaria came to the market.
The banking group, with the benefit of hindsight and also with the
experience of public issues in the UK, took a series of steps, such as the
creation of a shareholder register in advance of the offering, that the
trail-blazing Repsol placement had failed to undertake.
The absence of controversy was a backhanded compliment to the CNMV. 'It is
not that we have learnt our job better,' says Mr Luis Carlos Croissier, the
commission's chairman, 'It is the market that has learnt that it cannot act
with impunity. Anyone who wants to commit an irregularity should think three
times.'
But it would be quite wrong to assume that all is now transparency and
ethical behaviour. There are malpractices on the Bolsa as there are on every
other market.
One who in the past year apparently failed to think three times about
committing an irregularity - or, rather, a series of them - was a former
chairman of the Bolsa and the former chairman of the now defunct Ibercorp
bank.
Mr Manuel de la Concha came under CNMV scrutiny for failing to properly
identify shareholders, among them a former governor of the Bank of Spain,
who had invested in one of his funds and for giving a select group of them
who were his personal friends preferential treatment.
Mr Croissier says the collapse of Ibercorp and the subsequent investigation
of its directors was 'a positive catharsis' for the financial sector. What
he regrets is that the public may have come to expect too much from the
commission. It is not its job to assess bad debt risks and to ward off
bankruptcies.
It is proving considerably harder for the CNMV, however, to unravel the the
extremely complex web of interests that were built up in Spain by the Kuwait
Investment Office through Grupo Torras, the investment arm that the KIO set
up in the 1980s and which went into receivership six months ago.
Potentially the investigation is politically sensitive. This is because
opposition parties claim that Grupo Torras investments should have been
approved by the cabinet because the KIO is an agency of a sovereign nation.
The government says that approval was unnecessary because the purchases of
Spanish assets were made by companies which although owned by the KIO were
based in the Netherlands and therefore they were treated as investments from
the EC.
To a great extent the CNMV, which is still a young institution with a small
staff, is learning the regulatory business as it goes along. This was
illustrated at the end of last year when a bitter fight to control a small
property group prompted allegations that the CNMV was favouring one of the
parties, the powerful Banco Bilbao Vizcaya banking group.
The row erupted when BBV's property unit failed to submit a written counter
bid for the target company and ran instead a series of press advertisements
in which it urged shareholders to reject what they were being offered
because it intended to improve the first bid. Under the terms of takeover
rules published in 1991, the BBV's unit should have registered its competing
bid with the CNMV together with a pricing prospectus.
The CNMV took the view that there was nothing in the takeover code that
explicitly prohibited successive informal bids. Critics said such an
attitude severely comprised its position as a regulator.
Mr Croissier stands by his interpretation of the rule book. Ultimately, what
the CNMV seeks is the best deal possible for minority shareholders. In the
row over the property company his judgment was vindicated because the
original bid was first improved and the final price to minority shareholders
was higher still when the two competing parties eventually presented a joint
bid.
As with the Repso share issue, the market has taken another lesson on board.
An important precedent was established and it will apply to future takeover
battles.

sword - The Bank of Spain

THE story about the meeting between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime
minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister, and Prof Luis Angel
Rojo, Governor of the Bank of Spain, late in the afternoon on May 12, says a
lot for the de facto independence of the Spanish central bank.
Three weeks ahead of a general election, the men had met in the prime
ministerial compound outside Madrid to discuss the collapse of the
government's four-year effort to hold the peseta among the leading
currencies of the European Monetary System. The next day, they would have to
devalue.
The Bank of Spain is not yet officially independent so it was up to Mr
Solchaga to tell the prime minister the bad news. The decision was taken
quickly, whereupon Prof Rojo is understood to have said the Bank would be
prepared to accompany the devaluation with an sharp interest rate cut.
'That,' Mr Gonzalez is reported to have replied, 'is entirely up to you.'
The peseta was devalued 8 per cent in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS
the next day and the Bank of Spain cut its benchmark intervention rate by
150 basis points to 11.5 per cent. Three weeks later, his political luck
having, incredibly, survived, Mr Gonzalez was re-elected.
Parliament was already discussing draft legislation to make the Bank of
Spain independent of the Finance Ministry when Mr Gonzalez called an early
election. The draft law was withdrawn and, later, Mr Gonzalez lost his
overall majority in parliament, making the main parties in the country's
leading autonomous regions, Catalonia and the Basque Country, power brokers
in the new parliament.
It seems likely, then, that while a new coalition or minority government
headed by Mr Gonzalez will try to revive the Bank of Spain statute as
rapidly as possible, it may have to be rewritten.
The main opposition, the conservative Peoples Party (PP), had already made
its position clear before the election campaign; that it was unhappy with
the way the independence statute automatically appointed the present
governor and deputy governor to the same jobs in an independent bank.
The PP did not have much against Prof Rojo but made clear it wanted some
consultation to take place over the appointment of the people who run the
new bank.
Most importantly, though, Mr Gonzalez may come under pressure to allow
regional representation on the board of the independent bank; something not
provided for in the pre-election draft law but which the regions want - and
have the political muscle to achieve.
Regional representation on the central bank board could take many forms  -
permanent Catalan and Basque seats, perhaps, with two or three others
rotating.
At present, the Bank is captive to the Finance Ministry and Treasury on
exchange rate policy and, in theory although less and less in practice, on
interest rates. Once control over the peseta passes to the Bank, with the
regions represented, the fight to narrow stark economic differences between
rich regions such as Catalonia and poor ones such as Extremadura could come
to play a very strong role in Bank decision-making.
Independence is, anyway, a double-edged sword. Prof Rojo sometimes wonders
whether the way EC governments are approaching central bank independence may
not be just a little lacking in courage. Central bankers like himself may
soon find themselves not only the masters of their exchange rates but also
responsible for the fights their countries are waging against inflation.
In theory, inflation would have to have been beaten in order for European
Monetary Union to occur in the first place but the statute drawn up for the
Spanish Bank, possibly because it is broadly modelled on the Bundesbank,
places a considerable anti-inflationary burden on its shoulders.
The problem with this is that in Germany the Bundesbank is much aided by the
fact that it was established long ago in the public consciousness that
inflation is a bad thing. This is not the case with Spain, where such a
consensus does not exist and where Mr Gonzalez' governments for the past 11
years have failed to make any effort to tell people about the evils of
inflation for fear of bursting the growth-and-spending bubble which
Spaniards have lived and voted in for so long.
The next few months will be an interesting illustration of how Spain works
as the new government - still to be formed at the time of writing - goes
about redrafting a statute of independence for the Bank.
Mr Solchaga had always wanted to rush a statute through parliament because
he maintained that doing it in a coalition government - which he correctly
predicted 18 months ago would be the result of the June 6 election - would
be difficult. He is not likely to be in the next cabinet and the problem
will be his successor's.
The previous government had promised to have the law in place during 1994 so
there is not much time left. Prof Rojo, in the meantime, can relax. He has
more freedom than most of his counterparts and the hard part has not yet
been thrust on his shoulders.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (3): Focus is on rate
trend - The Stock Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Madrid's Bolsa index is hovering around the 260 mark which means that the
market has already put on the 20 per cent in value that at the begining of
the year had been forecast for all of 1993. Spain, according to whichever
securities house last offered its opinion, is ready for underweighting or
ripe for a considered speculative buying.
The first opinion requires little by way of explanation. Spain is in
recession - the first quarter recorded a negative 0.5 per cent growth
following one of 0.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 - and that is
reason enough to give it a rest.
The second option has the analysts mostly sidelining fundamentals and
focusing on politics, or more exactly, on what the politicians, whoever they
made be, will do about interest rates. Discussion on this will continue
right through to mid-July and the investiture debate to elect a new prime
minister.
Such is the level of debate on government and on policies that the security
houses seem to be employing more political pundits than business analysts
and economic gurus.
It is only after the debate next month that the markets will gain a clear
notion of what government policies can be expected following the qualified
victory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's socialist party in the general elections on
June 6.
And what they will be looking for is the all-important interest rate trend.
The central point is that the Madrid market appears to be driven more by
interest rate movements than by industrial cycles.
A recent report by Lehman Brothers on Bolsa strategy has been the latest to
underline this and it notes that such a driving force is less surprising
when the market constituents - chiefly banks and electrical utilities - are
considered.
Spain has not had what the UK, for example, would consider a proper
recession for 30 years but it has had periods of slowdown of which the
present period is arguably the most severe.
The market has, however, tended to react more to rates and less to the
slowdowns.
This occured in 1975 in the 12 months that followed the bottoming-out of
industrial production; interest rates rose and the market fell by 16.3 per
cent.
Midway through 1982, which was when the previous big slowdown reached a
snail's pace, long rates remained broadly unchanged for 12 months and the
market put on just 7.2 per cent.
There was, true to form, a stampede to sell in the 48 hours that followed Mr
Gonzalez's electoral win.
A lot of market players had clearly betted on a triumph by the conservative
opposition which is perceived to be much softer about defending the peseta.
Later the Bolsa rallied and this was because it formed the opinion that Mr
Gonzalez, who is short of an overall majority and in need of parliamentary
allies, cannot in practice be as supportive over the currency as he would
like.
It is not that Mr Gonzalez does not want to cut rates. It is that he is not
willing to risk any attacks on the peseta as a result of doing so.
The prime minister's potential coalition partners will nevertheless press
him to bump-start the economy whatever the feared consequences might be.
Fuelling the rally is the market's perception that the prime minister's
dilemma will be resolved for him by the Bundesbank.
The consensus opinion is that Spanish rates will track the German ones and
could lose between 150 and 200 basis points by early autumn.
More bullish analysts suggest that this timing could be perfect for the
Bolsa.
The thinking is that the cuts will coincide with a series of social pacts,
bringing together the government.
This sanguine scenario, which naturally strengthens the lowered rate lobby,
leans strongly on the prime minister's perceived leadership qualities.
It depends on Mr Gonzalez putting together first, well before the summer
break, a strong coalition government with clear, market-orientated ideas on
the economic problems - from inflationary wage settlements to excessive
government spending - that have been building up for far too many months.
The speculative buying opinion thus sees a new rally in the final months of
the year that could take the Bolsa index beyond the 270 level.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (1): Time to grasp the
nettle - Mr Gonzalez must soon decide whether or not to take the peseta out
of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.  Peter Bruce
examines the alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, found earlier this month that winning
Spain's closest-ever election was difficult, then winning the battle he now
faces against recession may be the end of him. It is time to make some
awkward choices.
The one that matters most is whether or not to take the peseta out of the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Getting out would
take some of the pressure off him to make very rapid economic and political
decisions in order to anchor his government - now short of parliamentary
majority - in place. But it also means throwing out of the window the
European dream for which Mr Gonzalez has struggled hard for most of his 11
years in office.
To remain in the ERM carries with it an air of determination and confidence
but, claim many analysts, also an air of unreality. Can Spain really begin
economic recovery with its real interest rates still among the highest in
the EC and adopt a promised programme of labour market reform - to make it
easier to sack people - while unemployment is rising, and still stay inside
the ERM?
The peseta may have been devalued three times in the past nine months, but
it still makes Spanish industry relatively uncompetitive.
If Mr Gonzalez does not take it out of the ERM, then he may find the markets
will try to do it for him.
One way this might be avoided is by quickly forming a credibly stable
coalition government which immediately announces sharp spending cuts in the
1994 budget, and instituting negotiations with unions and employers on a
wages pact and on removing hiring and firing barriers in the labour market.
But even forming a government is fraught with booby traps. Mr Gonzalez'
socialists have 159 seats in the 350-seat parliament, giving him four broad
options:
A minority government which would make deals with whatever forces were
necessary to pass specific legislation;
A minority government in which he would try to make a four-year deal with
the Catalan CiU (17 seats) and possibly the Basque PNV (six seats) to
support him but not actually to join the government;
A formal coalition with the CiU, which would give him a parliamentary
majority and, perhaps, with the PNV, whose seats would make the team
unassailable;
A formal coalition with the communist-led United Left (IU), whose 19 seats
would also guarantee a parliamentary majority.
The two minority options could not in any way be guaranteed to hold for
long. Mr Gonzalez is a superb political manipulator but he is not a magician
and the degree of fiscal brutality required of this new government will not
allow him to skip happily from party to party for support. And there is no
reason to believe that even if the CiU were to make a long-term pact to
support the socialists (in return, no doubt, for the transfer to Catalonia
of more political power) that they could stick to it. The CiU is a divided,
opportunist party.
Any union with the IU would have to be seen as a radical shift to the left
by a socialist prime minister who has spent 11 years in government trying to
do exactly the opposite.
There may be people in the socialist party who would be comfortable with the
IU but Mr Gonzalez is not one of them. He has said he will only do business
with parties committed to the terms of the Maastricht treaty on European
economic and political unity, which the IU opposes.
He has to find someone willing to assume the risks of government with him -
and the Catalans entering government would be the most secure and credible
of all the possible permutations. Mr Gonzalez would also be more comfortable
with the CiU than any other party.
But the CiU is a merger of two parties and a dozen political ideas. From his
perch as Catalonia's premier, Mr Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader, regularly
shrieks at Madrid for its policy failures. But does he have the vision to
help run the country and not just his own backyard?
The world may be about to find out that, while the Catalans deserve their
reputation as model small businessmen - careful with their money and serious
about debt - they can also be politically provincial and small-minded.
Spain's bankers, their balance sheets battered by bad loans provisions as
the recession takes its toll, pray for Mr Pujol to sign up. He, however, has
one small problem. What if he joins a national government and it fails to
stem job losses and corporate failures? He would pay for it at the next
regional election in Catalonia.
He quite reasonably suspects that the left wing of the socialist party will
try everything in its power to prevent Mr Gonzalez implementing the serious
labour market reforms and budget cuts necessary to help the country out of
recession.
The socialist left has successfully paralysed fiscal restraint in the past
four years and Mr Gonzalez has yet to demonstrate he is both willing and
able to force his will upon his own party. What needs to be done once a
government is formed is also more or less clear.
First, wage inflation (wages are rising at about 7 per cent this year) must
be brought under control. To do this, Mr Gonzalez needs a social pact - a
glorified wages agreement - between government, unions and employers. Each
act in this drama will be costly.
To get the unions to the table, he has to get a strike law through the new
parliament or at least defend it in the form it was before the election was
called. Employers hate this draft law because it gives pickets wide powers
of molestation, the socialist party having dramatically watered down an
earlier tough version drafted by the government.
But employers are chasing bigger fish - the right to hire and fire more
cheaply and more rapidly - and the prospect of landing them will also bring
the bosses to the negotiating table. Unions might consider such reform if
employers and government pump more money into training.
Analysts say they want these talks to begin soon and that they will be
watching for fudges. Without a profound reform of the labour market, it is
assumed Spain cannot begin growing again soon.
Second, the 1994 budget will have to cut back sharply on public spending.
Until now the government has identified its central fiscal problem as a lack
of control over budget deficits. This time, with GDP having fallen by 0.5
per cent in the first quarter and unemployment at a record 21.7 per cent,
the planned deficits in nominal and real terms will come under pressure.
Also, the budget will have to be brought in on time, at the end of
September, giving the government no prospect of a quiet August holiday.
Punishment for delay or failure on any of these fronts is possible expulsion
of the peseta from the ERM as speculators bet again on the economy not being
as strong as the currency. Mr Gonzalez may be forced to anticipate such an
outcome by taking the peseta out of the ERM. He would need to rationalise
such a move as being in the best interests of his country - the same reasons
as he gave for entering the system in the first place.
The peseta would probably drift gently down to around Pta85 to the D-Mark
(its central parity is Pta79.1 to the German currency now) and stabilise if
reasonably strict fiscal policies were put in place, although the time
pressure would not be so telling. Interest rates could fall again.
Leaving the ERM need not change Spain and it would only slow, not alter, Mr
Gonzalez' s European ambitions. It would be far worse for him if the markets
removed the peseta from the system. But lower interest rates would encourage
investment and it would be easier to sell labour market reform to the unions
in a climate in which employers were hiring again.
The danger of leaving the ERM is that Spain, with the pressure to perform
off, would go to sleep. With the currency competitive, businesses might not
put off measures needed to improve overall competitiveness. With low
interest rates, Spaniards might feel less incentive to save.
But Mr Gonzalez does not change his mind easily. The betting must be that he
will try to hold the peseta inside the ERM and that he will genuinely try to
put together the policies to help keep it there. But this time he needs Mr
Pujol on the barricades with him.

<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a 21-point range as bouts of profit-taking
signalled a pause for breath after the recent advance, writes Joel Kibazo.
Hopes of a base rate cut that have underpinned the recent rise appeared to
fade yesterday and the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which opened at
2,941, drifted gently down on sporadic selling.
Lingering hopes of a cut remain, however, and yesterday's economic data was
taken to signify a reduction may still be possible.
The day's low was reached just ahead of a poor opening on Wall Street. The
premium to cash was gradually eroded throughout the session.
September finished at 2,920, down 7 from its previous close and just three
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume just
exceeded 9,000 contracts.
In traded options, heavy dealing in the stock options led to a large total
turnover of 39,122 contracts.
BT saw 6,264 lots traded, with the November 460 calls particularly busy. It
was followed by GEC with 3,409 contracts dealt. Kleinwort Benson was the
main player in J. Sainsbury options, which were the third most actively
traded with a total of 2,625. British Airways and Zeneca were also active.
Just over 11,000 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 Index option, but a mere
1,974 contracts were traded in the Euro Footsie option.

FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: C and W peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market demonstrated approval of much better than expected results from
Cable and Wireless, accompanied by a proposed one-for-one scrip issue, by
marking the shares up to an all-time high of 780p.
The stock eased marginally late in the session, finishing a net 23 higher at
777p. Turnover was a hefty 3.2m shares. Marketmakers said C and W had
benefited from sustained switching into the shares from BT, which held at
432p.
C and W's pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 824m, well above the most
optimistic analysts' estimates, which were around the Pounds 800m mark. The
12 per cent increase in the dividend was in line with expectations.
The results, plus some encouraging remarks by the company at the
post-figures meeting with institutions and analysts, led to a series of
profits upgrades by telecoms specialists. Current-year forecasts were being
shifted above the Pounds 1bn mark.
Mr Jim Ross, telecoms analyst at Hoare Govett, said he was looking for
profits of Pounds 1.05bn in the current year and pinpointed two
significantly favourable points in the results. He highlighted excellent
cash flow numbers and noted evidence of the economic upturn in the UK in
Mercury's sharply improved performance. 'The level of new line orders at
Mercury is twice that of a year ago,' he said.
Royal Insurance came in for strong support in a generally firm composite
insurance sector, with Robert Fleming Securities and Credit Lyonnais Laing
said to have been keen supporters of the shares, which closed 6 up at 295p.
Bank of Scotland extended its recent good showing, the shares settling 4 1/2
higher at 153 1/2 p on above-average turnover of 5.5m.
Shares in Spring Ram, the troubled building materials group, came under
sustained pressure, sliding 8 to 61p. Talk of a broker's recommendation to
switch out of RMC and into Redland saw the latter move up 11 to 456p and the
former retreat 11 to 750p.
After the fillip of last week's presentations from Guinness and LVMH - the
French luxury goods company with whom Guinness has a cross-shareholding -
the brewer saw some investors waving goodbye and the shares shed 7 to 478p.
This time it was Grand Metropolitan's turn to woo the analysts with upbeat
talk which saw the company bullish on its expectations for a growing role in
the world vodka market. It also boasted of its performance with Burger King.
But heads were not turned completely and GrandMet lost a penny to 425p.
Allied-Lyons added 2 at 541p in a volume of 2m after Hoare Govett issued a
buy note.
A batch of shares traded below quote price helped to push down the level of
Campari by 18 to a close of 315p. The sporting clothes company, which
recently surprised the market with two profits warnings in as many months,
suffered from buyers 'anxious to exit the stock', said one analyst.
The confidence of investors and the City had been knocked by the warnings.
They fear that after two, a third could be on the way, added the analyst.
Another analyst said the brewery sector was held back by a general lack of
enthusiasm and absence of international opportunity as Europe grapples with
a deepening recesssion. Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 3 at 462p and Whitbread
'A' a penny at 497p.
Allied Textiles had better fortune, moving forward 10 to close at 485p in an
otherwise quiet sector.
Reuters climbed a further 36 to 1383p after news of the success of its
Dealing 2002 forex dealing system. Telerate is the sales and marketing agent
for the Minex dealing system, controlled by a consortium of Japanese banks,
and has no connection with the EBS system as incorrectly reported here
yesterday.
A weak day in the stores sector saw Boots decline 3 to 439p, GUS 'A' shed 12
to 1717p and Marks and Spencer lose 2 to 338p. Kingfisher bucked the trend
to gain 5 at 600p after its announced acquisition of the Unipart chain. But
the store and retail sector was generally subdued as hopes for an early cut
in UK base rates were returned to the back burner following a somewhat cool
comment on interest rate prospects from a senior executive of the
Bundesbank.
With rumours of a bid for United Biscuits losing steam, the share price fell
back 5 1/2 to 402 1/2 p in moderate volume. While United gave ground,
Cadbury-Schweppes, long tipped as the possible bidder, moved up 6 to 458p.
Budgens, the grocery chain, was one of the foods sector's star performers,
with speculation of a bid from REWE, Germany's largest grocery retailer and
holder of a 26 per cent stake in the UK company, taking up the price 4 to
45p. J. Sainsbury managed an increase of 4 to 489p while seeing active
trading on traded options with the equivalent of 2.6m shares dealt.
Profit-takers moved in on Ratners Group, which had rallied on Friday on talk
of banking negotiations. With rumours of an announcement by the indebted
company on fresh banking facilities still prevalent, the shares slipped 3
1/2 to 32 1/2 p with 6m traded.
A move into the bingo leisure business by way of the Pounds 19.9m
acquisition of Nudge Leisure, and a 4.6 per cent rise in first-half profits,
sent the share price of First Leisure up 9 in early trading before it fell
back to end a penny off on the day at 364p. Thorn EMI, recently buoyed by
its decision to sell its lighting division, receded 2 to 918p.
Dunhill Holdings soared 62 to a 405p close, albeit in thin trading volume,
although the stock is not usually heavily traded.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no surprise among marketmakers at the relative success of Zeneca's
Pounds 1.3bn rights issue; marketmakers had been confident of a substantial
take-up of the rights issue. In the event, it was disclosed yesterday that
shareholders had taken up 86.15 per cent of the issue.
The brokers to the issue, SG Warburg and BZW, were said to have easily
placed the 'rump' of the issue, 13.85 per cent or around 26m shares, at a
price of 612p.
Zeneca shares made good progress following the success of the issue, ending
a net 8 higher at 626p after reaching 629p at one point. Turnover was a
heavy 9.6m shares.

FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US bank hits Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs, the leading US investment bank, was the driving force behind
the underperformance of Glaxo, after the broking firm's pharmaceuticals team
reduced its current-year profits estimate for the drugs group.
The broker said the downgrade was partly because of the recent decline in
the performance of the dollar, but declined to give any further details.
Goldman's team also lowered its forecast for following years, resulting in a
cut in its five-year average earnings per share growth rate forecast from 13
per cent to 11 per cent.
For the current year to June, Goldman pared its profits forecast from Pounds
1.705bn to Pounds 1.65bn, giving earnings per share of 39.1p against a
previous prediction of 40.4p. Goldman expects the dividend to be increased
by 15 per cent to 19.5p.
Goldman said it maintained its stance on Glaxo, expecting market performance
during the next six months but underperformance over the longer term. Glaxo
closed 10 1/2 lower at 587 1/2 p following good turnover of 2.7m shares.

FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rothmans plan surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET was enlivened minutes before the close by an announcement from
tobacco group Rothmans International which sent the company's shares racing
forward in hectic trading.
Rothmans is in talks with Richemont Securities and Dunhill Holdings about a
reorganisation of assets to create two new quoted groups to focus separately
on tobacco and luxury goods.
The announcement took dealers by surprise. Rothmans shares forged ahead 55
to 720p in frantic trading which caused a backwardation - a brief period
when the bid and offer prices are temporarily reversed - in the process.
Volume in the tightly held stock jumped to 3.6m, with more business done
after the official close.

FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains melt away by the close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY attempt by UK equities to push on towards the all-time peaks
reached in March soon faded away yesterday behind a less aggressive stock
index futures sector. Base rate hopes were reined in by cautious comment on
German rate prospects from the deputy president of the Bundesbank, and a
calmer dollar took the bounce out of the international blue chips.
After being nearly 14 points ahead in the first hour of trading, the FT-SE
100 Index relinquished almost all of the rise later in the session. Shares
in Rothmans, the South African based tobacco group, rose sharply in late
dealings, giving a final hoist to the FT-SE 100, which closed 4.2 up at
2,907.6. The index is now 49.7 points, or 1.7 per cent, beneath its March
peak.
The more cautious tone across the range of the market was reflected in the
first fall in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index for several sessions; at 3,217.9, the
Mid 250 was finally 0.6 off, having lost an earlier gain of nearly 7 points.
Restraining share prices towards the close were the prospects for the
impending auction of UK government bonds, details of which came late in the
session.
London paid little heed, however, to a downward drift in the Dow during
early dealings on Wall Street, which was 13 points off when the UK market
closed for the day.
London traders remained hopeful that German interest rates may be cut soon,
thus opening the way for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, to deliver what is expected to be the final reduction in UK rates
in this cycle. But hopes of a move by the Bundesbank this week were damped
down by yesterday's comments from the deputy president of the German central
bank.
On the domestic front, there was little immediate response to UK gross
domestic product figures for the first quarter of the year, while a modest
widening of the current account deficit was read as strengthening the
arguments for a base rate cut.
The market was in good heart in the first half of the session, with Zeneca
shares triumphant on the news that the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, which
formed the cornerstone of its demerger from ICI, had found 86 per cent
acceptances; the remainder was sold in the market at a comfortable premium
to the rights price, providing a further boost to underlying investment
confidence.
The premium on the September future contract on the FT-SE 100 Index remained
solid but was half that of the previous day, and there was no repetition of
the arbitraging deals which lifted the blue chips on Monday.
Helped by good trade in Zeneca, Seaq volume edged up to 588.1m shares from
Monday's 570.4m which came to Pounds 1.05bn in retail business worth.
Non-Footsie shares made up around 60 per cent of yesterday's total turnover,
in line with daily averages this year. The persistently good levels of
retail business have been seen as perhaps a more reliable indicator of
market confidence than the erratic path traced by the Footsie since the
beginning of the year.
Store and consumer issues showed mild disappointment with the lack of
encouragement for base rate optimism but losses were small. There was little
doing in the leading oil shares.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh round of profits
warnings flatten Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A FRESH round of profits warnings from major corporations left US stock
prices easier yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.29 at 3,497.53.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, lost only 0.29 at 445.93, while the
Nasdaq composite was off 1.97 at 686.77. Trading volume on the New York SE
came to 258m shares.
In recent weeks a string of big companies have issued warnings unexpectedly
about their immediate earnings prospects, many of them the result of
disappointing sales. Additionally, some have said they believe future
business conditions will be less favourable than originally expected.
Taken with recent data which has shown a struggling economy, the spate of
corporate profits warnings suggests that the outlook for stock prices may
not be as bright as it appeared at the start of the year, when economic
growth was accelerating sharply and profits improving substantially.
Consequently, investors fear that equities may have to give back some of the
gains of this year before valuations return to more justifiable levels.
Among the latest companies to issue downbeat earnings prospects were Kmart
and Chemical Waste Management. Kmart, the country's second largest retailer,
fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 1/8 (a new 52-week low) in volume of 5.1m
shares after the company's management warned that, because of poor recent
retail sales, its second-quarter earnings would come in significantly below
the 37 cents a share reported a year earlier.
The news from Kmart hit other retail shares. JC Penney tumbled Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 44 1/4 , Gap Stores Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 , The Limited
Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 7/8 and Federated Department Stores Dollars 1 to
Dollars 21 1/4 .
WMX, parent of Chemical Waste Management, which announced on Monday that it
expects to report second-quarter earnings well below those achieved in 1992,
dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 after stating that its own
second-quarter earnings would also come in below the previous year's level.
Chemical Waste fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 1/8 in volume of 2.06m
shares.
Tambrands was initially buoyed by hopes that management will find a buyer
for the company, but after rising Dollars 1 the stock finally ran into
profit-taking and fell back to end Dollars  3/4 off on balance at Dollars 45
1/2 .
News of a fresh round of price cuts in the long-running air fares war
depressed airline issues. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 60 1/2 , UAL Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 118, USAir Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 15 3/4 and Delta Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47.
On the Nasdaq market, technology shares continued to decline, Novell
shedding Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 and Adobe Systems Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 61 1/2.
Canada
THE real estate sector led the Toronto market into higher ground yesterday
in heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended a further 13.3 ahead at 3,935.7
and rises outscored declines by 392 to 360 after volume of 78.8m shares
valued at some CDollars 836m.
Eleven of the 14 stock groups rose, with the real estate index gaining 2.06
per cent. Golds were modestly firmer.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar, interest rate hopes
lift bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHER dollar and interest rate hopes gave bourses a modicum of lift,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT retained the late gains it saw on Monday, the DAX index closing
8.16 higher at 1,698.08 in turnover up from DM6.3bn to DM7.2bn.
The stronger dollar was advanced as one reason, the other being hopes of a
key interest rate cut in nine days' time. As on Monday, share prices seemed
to be prepared to act on the first theory, but not on the second.
Banks were subdued, but the export-sensitive automotive industry stayed
strong. BMW rose another DM6.50 to DM501.50, the tyremaker, Continental,
rose DM8.50 to DM218 and the truckmaker and engineer, MAN, was DM8.80 better
at DM283.
Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner in Frankfurt said that MAN had been depressed,
that there had been news of improved tax treatment for the haulage industry,
and that the latest figures for truck production and sales showed minor
indications that the sector was improving. There were stories that another
bank had recommended Conti.
In chemicals, Hoechst outperformed with a gain of DM5.80 at DM253.80. The
market thought that Rhone Poulenc's sale of 35 per cent in Roussel Uclaf
would give Hoechst more effect control of the pharmaceuticals and bioscience
company.
PARIS posted its third consecutive gain ahead of today's end of the June
account, the CAC 40 index closing 6.11 higher at 1,935.28. Turnover was
active at FFr3.6bn, up from FFr2.65bn on Monday.
The gains followed Monday's quarter-point interest rate cut by the Bank of
France. Interest rate-sensitive stocks responded with Suez up FFr5.50 to
FFr307.90 and Paribas FFr8.50 better at FFr404.50.
Meanwhile, the rise in the dollar continued to lift cyclicals with Saint
Gobain FFr8.70 higher at FFr491, and Peugeot FFr10 higher at FFr540 in
advance of today's agm.
MILAN made a positive start before investors were given pause by news that
the government had called a confidence vote for later in the week.
Trading quickly picked up again on the view that Prime Minister Carlo
Azeglion Ciampi's two month old administration was not at risk. The strength
of the lira, together with hopes of lower rates in Europe, provided some
impetus as the Comit index rose 2.28 to 527.98.
Fiat stayed at the centre of attention, on renewed speculation about an
international accord or asset sale. The shares shed L99 to fix at L6,091
before picking up to L6,200 on the kerb as Mr Umberto Agnelli, the vice
chairman, denied that negotiations were under way to sell Toro
Assicurazioni, or La Rinascente.
Ferruzzi continued under pressure, losing L49.40 or 8.2 per cent to L551.60.
Montedison, seen by analysts as better placed to ride out the debt crisis,
slipped L20 to fix at L874, before L855 after hours.
ZURICH finished ahead, but off the day's highs, with prices supported by a
lack of sellers, firmer bonds and the positive trend in other European
bourses. The SMI index rose 5.6 to a second consecutive all-time high of
2,335.0.
In a firmer chemicals sector, Sandoz bearers rose SFr35 to SFr3,350n on news
that a US study had concluded that one of the group's schizophrenia drugs
significantly cut the time that chronically ill patients needed to remain in
hospital.
AMSTERDAM overcame technical problems which halted trading for more than two
hours and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.80 to 111.00 in response to the
firmer dollar and the outlook for lower interest rates.
Unilever added Fl 3.00 to Fl 204.50 in continued response to a series of
upbeat investor presentations last week.
MADRID talked of interest rate cuts as the general index rose 1.26 to
264.92. Utilities gained most from the speculation, Sevillana rising Pta11
to Pta501.
STOCKHOLM was enlivened by strong foreign-led demand for Ericcson although
the Affarsvarlden general index closed unchanged at 1,075.8.
Ericcson B shares rose SKr10 to a record SKr332 as the group continued its
series of new order announcements with news of a mobile network for Japan.
ATHENS extended this month's gains, the general index rising 6.85 to 776.03.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Well-heeled Palestinians boost equities
in Amman - Share price growth in Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Although Jordan has one of the smallest economies in the Arab world (GDP
last year was Dollars 4.8bn at current producer prices), its stock market is
one of the most developed and profitable.
Buoyed by real GDP growth of 11 per cent last year and the arrival of around
300,000, mostly well-heeled, Palestinians from the Gulf, the Amman Financial
Market (AFM) climbed by nearly 30 per cent in 1992, making it one of the
fastest growing emerging markets in the world.
With 120 listed companies, the AFM's equity market capitalisation stands at
around JD3bn. This year, its general share price index had risen by a
further 26 per cent to 164.34 by yesterday, making a gain of nearly
two-thirds since it was based at 100 in December 1991.
Stock market turnover, since January 1, had risen to JD460.5m by mid-June,
up 26 per cent from JD370.9m in the same period last year. And, on the basis
of earnings so far in 1993, the market is selling on a price/earnings ratio
(p/e) of 20.
Trading has been prolific this year, with daily volumes running well above
levels previously seen. In May the share price index advanced by 9.7 per
cent, and on certain days in June the value of trade peaked at as much as
JD16m compared with a daily average of JD6m in May.
Last week the central bank was forced to reduce credit to speculators in an
attempt to cool down the bullish bourse. But this has done little to
diminish growing enthusiasm in the market.
Although the government and its agencies own substantial stakes in many
Jordanian companies, particularly in tourism and the minerals sector, the
Amman market still has a relatively large float. Approximately one-half of
the total market is available for trading, and it is estimated that more
than 100,000 Jordanians are active in the stock market, a higher number than
in any other Arab country.
Non-Arab foreign investors have to obtain appproval from the government
before trading (a formality which should normally take no more than a few
days through a local broker). Then their only restriction, at the moment, is
that foreigners are not allowed to own more than 49 per cent of most
businesses. Capital and dividends can be repatriated through a bank as long
as foreign currency brought in was declared for the original investment.
The market's success is a flattering reflection of the country's economic
fortunes. In spite of the cataclysmic events in 1989, when the Jordanian
dinar was forced to devalue by 45 per cent, and in 1990 at the initial
stages of an International Monetary Fund adjustment programme when Iraq
invaded Kuwait, the kingdom's economy has bounced back to achieve record
growth rates.
The Gulf returnees brought with them an estimated Dollars 1.5bn which
fuelled a major construction boom in the kingdom and increased liquidity.
Fat corporate profits in many sectors last year, particularly banking,
buoyed confidence in the market. And stockbrokers say optimism over the
Middle East peace talks is also encouraging investment.
In light of the recent spate of market activity, however, there are fears in
some quarters that certain shares are overvalued. Mr Saed Nabulsi, Jordan's
central bank governor, says he is worried about the level of equity
appreciation, especially with shares in the services and industry sector.
And there is concern that the market euphoria is currently driven by short
term investors with hit-and-run tactics. But Mr Umayya Toukan, the AFM's
director general, claims he is happy with the overall p/e of 20 in
comparison with other markets worldwide.
A daily price ceiling of plus or minus 5 per cent currently operates on
individual shares as a market stabiliser.
Whatever the outcome of the market's present apparent overheating, the AFM
does seem to have a bright future.
The Jordanian dinar has been stable at its present level for the past 30
months or more (Dollars 1:JD0.689); GDP is predicted to grow steadily by
around 5 per cent for the next few years; and as business confidence becomes
the norm, Jordan can expect to see the steady trickle of repatriations
increase. Estimates of funds held by Jor-danians overseas range from Dollars
5bn to Dollars 10bn.
Moreover, given a peace settlement with Israel or a lifting of sanctions on
Iraq, then Jordan could become another Singapore in the desert.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand helps
Nikkei recoup losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC fund and arbitrage related buying supported share prices and the
Nikkei average recouped a part of Monday's fall, as an expected rush of
selling by investors failed to materialise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei, which lost 3 per cent on Monday on political uncertainty,
recovered 325.87, or 1.7 per cent, to 19,538.30. It weakened to the day's
low of 19,141.05 at the beginning of the session, but rose steadily during
the rest of the session, hitting a high of 19,619.52 some 15 minutes before
the close.
Volume remained almost flat, at 350m shares against 351.1m. Advances led
falls by 787 to 237, with 108 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose for the first time in seven trading days, gaining 24.10
at 1,555.38. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.97 firmer at 1,193.91.
Traders said investors had recovered from the initial shock of the split
within the ruling Liberal Democratic party. 'It is an uncertainty, but not a
threat to the market,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Foreigners were
seen buying stock futures on the Singapore market, triggering arbitrage
related buying.
However, Baring Securities said activity was not expected to pick up
substantially ahead of the parliamentary elections on July 18.
Meanwhile, the yen continued to weaken against the dollar. Bond yields rose
by 0.06 percentage points to 4.465 per cent, as the fall in the Japanese
currency undermined hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate.
Stocks which lost ground on Monday on margin related selling recovered.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rallied Y24,000 to Y855,000 and NEC rose Y24
to Y931.
Semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers gained ground on hopes,
prompted by newspaper forecasts, of an earnings recovery. Nikon advanced Y35
to Y948 and Tokyo Electron Y60 to Y2,700. Large-capital issues were higher
on short-covering. Nippon Steel put on Y4 at Y366 while Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries rose Y20 to Y648.
The real estate sector posted the strongest performance, climbing 4.3 per
cent on reports of a 78.7 per cent rise in individual applications for
Housing Loan Corporation loans for May. Mitsui Fudosan added Y50 at Y1,230
and Mitsubishi Estate Y52 at Y1,040.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 341.69 ahead at 21,509.23 in volume of 30.6m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets turned in mixed performances.
HONG KONG benefited from better than expected results of a government land
auction and improved perceptions of talks at the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group. The Hang Seng index advanced 43.15 to 7,046.73.
Hong Kong Worsted Mills, target of a takeover bid by a state-owned Chinese
company, jumped HKDollars 5.60, or 59 per cent, to HKDollars 15.10 as trade
resumed after its suspension on June 17.
Miramar, the hotel group, was unchanged at HKDollars 16.20. Cheung Kong,
which has joined Citic Pacific in a bid for Miramar, fell 30 cents to
HKDollars 26.50, while Citic was up 10 cents to HKDollars 16.90.
SINGAPORE fell across the board on institutional selling and the Straits
Times Industrial index dipped 31.81, or 1.75 per cent, to 1,787.68.
AUSTRALIA saw profit-taking in blue chips, which left the All Ordinaries
index 9.9 lower at 1,716.7 in lacklustre trading ahead of the end of the
financial year on June 30.
BHP fell 20 cents to ADollars 13.90 and dragged the market lower, following
reports that it plans to expand its mineral division.
KUALA LUMPUR lost part of an early gain on profit-taking, with investors
cautious about the market's direction after last week's downward correction.
The composite index ended a net 10.29 higher at 724.96.
TAIWAN reversed small early advances to close easier as turnover sank to its
lowest level since January. The weighted index, which was up about 14 points
in early trade, finished 11.88 down at 4,062.49.
SEOUL saw demand by individual investors for large capitalisation shares and
the composite index moved forward 4.56 to 770.62.
Market rumours of a scrip issue helped Daewoo Heavy Industries to gain
Won700 but an immediate denial by the company pared the advance to Won300
and the shares closed at Won18,400.
BANGKOK found demand from individual and institutional investors, which took
the SET index 15.59, or 1.76 per cent, higher to 903.53, its first close
above the 900 level for two months.
COLOMBO continued to rise, the CSE all-share index adding 4.25 at 619.14 in
turnover which swelled to Rp135.7m from Monday's Rp68.2m. KARACHI finished
higher on heavy foreign buying of financials, polyesters and chemicals, and
the KSE index rose 9.45 to 1,235.51.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Money Markets: More speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS about a reduction in UK interest rates failed to disappear
yesterday, in spite of better than expected data about the state of the
economy in the first quarter, writes Peter Marsh.
The speculation about a cut in bank base rates, now at 6 per cent, has been
fuelled partly by the fragile economic conditions in much of Europe. It has
been aided by the easing this week in borrowing rates elsewhere on the
Continent.
The signs of weakening demand, especially in Germany, has led to worries
that any UK recovery may be held back by reduced activity on export markets.
On the UK money market, the three-month interbank rate was quoted last night
at about 5 13/16 per cent, slightly down from the 5 7/8 per cent figure the
previous evening.
Signs that investors were looking for a cut in base rates were confirmed by
changes in the sterling futures market, where buying of the December
contract lifted it to 94.32.
The figures for gross domestic product published yesterday by the UK
government had little effect on investor sentiment. This was on the grounds
that they related to the first quarter. Since then, economic conditions in
the rest of Europe have deteriorated, underlining the view that a further
cut in UK interest rates may be needed to consolidate any upturn.
The Irish central bank cut its key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points,
reducing its short-term facility rate to 7.75 per cent and the overnight
deposit rate to 4.5 per cent. The move followed Monday's rate cuts in
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal.
In Germany, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, held out the
prospect of further cuts in German interest rates. He said the bank would
cautiously review further possibilities for easing borrowing conditions, but
would continue to be guided by developments in M3 money supply.
Spanish interest rates might come down soon, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of
the Bank of Spain, signalled yesterday. But he warned that the pace of any
movement would be conditioned by success in reducing inflation. In London
the Bank of England provided the UK money market with around Pounds 500m of
late unspecified assistance, bringing total help for the day to Pounds
1.39bn.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollars rises to just below DM1.70
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDEEP DEOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY BUYING of the dollar by big US investment funds helped the currency
rise to just below DM1.70 as favourable sentiment towards the dollar gained
momentum, writes Sandeep Deol.
After a subdued morning session, the US currency hit a high of DM1.6990
before light profit-taking pulled it back to DM1.6970 by the close of
European trading, to show a gain of 0.8 pfennig on the day. In New York it
finished at DM1.6960.
A breach of DM1.70 is the next target many dealers have in mind. The
catalyst for this could be an easing today in the Bundesbank's securities
repurchase tender - known as the repo - or the release of US May durable
goods data.
The announcement by the German central bank that the repo would be at a
variable rate dashed hopes of a sizeable rate cut. Even so, the market is
still looking for an easing in the order of 5 to 10 basis points from 7.60
per cent.
Whatever happens, Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS,
suggested that over the next few months the D-Mark will weaken against most
major currencies on the grounds that German interest rates will almost
certainly decline. Mr Persaud expects the US currency to continue to climb
in the near term, hitting DM1.72 in the next few weeks.
Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, disagrees. He
expects the dollar to pause and consolidate at around DM1.67 before resuming
its climb. Mr Callow believes that until the US Federal Reserve gives more
tangible signs of a monetary tightening, the US currency could find a move
to levels above DM1.70 difficult to sustain.
The dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, ending at Y111.35, up from
Monday's close of Y111.10. Near-term gains are seen limited in spite of the
political uncertainty in Japan. The US unit eased back in New York to end at
Y110.92.
The weakness of the D-Mark yesterday allowed the Irish central bank to trim
its short-term facility rate by  1/4 percentage point to 7.75 per cent and
its overnight lending rate to 4.50 per cent. The punt held steady after the
cut, trading at DM2.4427 in late European trade.
The French franc, which had softened a touch on Monday following the Bank of
France's easing of official interest rates, finished little changed
yesterday at FFr3.364 against the D-Mark from FFr3.360 the day before.
Sterling saw a quiet session and ended down  1/2 pfennig at DM2.5075.
Against the dollar it lost nearly a cent, finishing at Dollars 1.4780.
Better than expected first-quarter GDP data for the UK showing a revised
quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.4 per cent against an initial estimate of
0.3 per cent had little effect on the market.
The current account deficit widened to Pounds 4.01bn in the first quarter of
this year from Pounds 3.88bn in the fourth quarter of 1992.

A general wave of long liquidation brought base metals prices down from
earlier highs at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Three months COPPER
rebounded from well-signposted resistance at Dollars 1,900 as another rise
in exchange warehouse stocks was announced, and ended Dollars 7 down at
Dollars 1,878 a tonne. ALUMINIUM'S retreat gathered pace after support at
Dollars 1,200 for three months metal was breached and final business was at
Dollars 1,187 a tonne, down Dollars 18.50 on the day. NICKEL stocks
registered another substantial fall, the fourth in succession, but that did
not prevent the three months price surrendering most of Monday's advance.
And the ZINC market lost most of the modest gains that had been encouraged
by Monday's news of a European producer plan for co-ordinated output cuts.
At the London bullion market precious metals continued Monday's drift.
Dealers blamed GOLD'S failure to attract sufficient speculative interest for
its Dollars 1.35 fall to Dollars 368.15 a troy ounce. But they did not
expect a significant retreat to ensue. London COFFEE and COCOA futures
prices ended the day higher in relatively quiet trading.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central Americans to discuss
coffee cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSED coffee producers' cartel is the main item on the agenda of a
meeting of Central American officials today and tomorrow in Managua,
Nicaragua. Producer countries have been debating the idea ever since the
collapse earlier this year of talks aimed at revitalising the International
Coffee Agreement between producers and consumers.
The concept of a producers' association to regulate stocks and try to boost
international prices is supported by Brazil, the world's leading coffee
exporter, responsible for about 30 per cent of total exports. It also has
the backing of the other big Latin American and African producers, says Mr
Gilson Ximenes, director of the national coffee department of the Brazilian
ministry of industry and commerce.
Brazil has decided not to attend today's gathering. Instead, Mr Jose Andrade
Eduardo Vieira, industry and commerce minister, will attend a meeting of
Latin American producers in early July, also to be held in a Central
American country, possibly Costa Rica.
Mr Ximenes says it would be premature to outline details of how the proposed
association would try to control stocks. However, the Brazilian private
sector is defending a sliding scale scheme under which producers would
automatically withhold more coffee as prices dropped.
Under the scheme, all producer countries would withhold 25 per cent of
output when the international price hit 60 US cents a lb. The amount
retained would gradually decrease as the price increased to 80 cents a lb,
when controls would be lifted. At present the price is hovering just above
the 60 cents-a-lb mark.
Mr Ximenes says he does not 'discard' the Brazilian private sector proposal.
Given the present low prices, most countries are already reducing exports,
according to Mr Manoel Vicente Fernandes Bertone, president of the National
Coffee Council, a private Brazilian producers association.
'All countries have reached the maximum limit of exhaustion,' he says,
adding that only Vietnam, Indonesia and India are maintaining previous
levels of production.
Brazil, for instance, shipped just 4.6m bags (60 kg each) during the first
five months of this year, compared with 7.6m bags in the corresponding
period of 1992. May shipments were stalled by a strike of federal tax
inspectors, but exports had been down in each of the first four months.

cotton industry finance

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NETHERLANDS, which has financed Tanzania's cotton industry over the past
11 years, will stop funding next month, an official of the Tanzania Cotton
Marketing Board said, reports Reuter from Dar es Salaam.
'They are pulling out. They have not been too happy with us,' said TCMB
economist Mr Ali Ngongolo.
Under the Dutch Cotton Assistance Programme, the Netherlands pumped
USDollars 100m into Tanzania's cotton industry in the form of equipment and
spare parts for ginneries, trucks, a new ginnery, technical assistance and
training.
Marketing board officials say the Dutch wanted rapid liberalisation of the
cotton sector, including the removal of price controls and privatisation of
the state-run marketing body.
'We agreed with the concept, but it had to be gradual,' Mr Ngongolo said.
Agriculture ministry officials said that new proposals to liberalise cotton
trading might be rushed through parliament in the current debate on the
budget. These included new legislation to allow the private sector into the
ginning business and individual investors to be allowed to buy and export
cotton.
In 11 years of Dutch assistance, the capacity of the country's 58 ginneries
has soared from 200,000 bales. Some 462,000 bales were ginned in the 1991-92
season in the Lake Victoria cotton belt, marketing board officials said.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox goes back to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange is celebrating its return to the
black by killing off the much ridiculed acronym of London Fox with which it
has been saddled for the last six years.
Next week Mr Robin Woodhead, Fox chief executive, will announce 'a small
surplus' after five years of operating losses. 'We have been successful at
turning the unpleasant loss-making tide,' says Mr Woodhead, who took up his
post in October last year.
The exchange will revert to being called the London Commodity Exchange from
July 1. But there will be no Pounds 30,000 daytime firework display to
herald the name change, as there was in June 1987.
Then the exchange was using US-style razzamatazz in a bid to attract
attention and win business away from the booming US exchanges. Ironically,
one of the main reasons the name is being changed again is that few people
in the US know what London Fox is.
Mr Woodhead and Mr Michael Jenkins, chairman of Fox and former chief
executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, are
determined to leave Fox's unhappy history behind. The exchange, which has
had to close several contracts including raw sugar, last year made a loss of
Pounds 691,000 on revenue of Pounds 10m, mainly because of exceptional costs
of nearly Pounds 1m following the debacle over its property futures contract
in September 1991.
First steps towards setting the exchange on a new course have included
cutting staff to 83 from 120 and operating costs to Pounds 6.3m from Pounds
10m two years ago. Mr Woodhead says the exchange now needs to trade 9,600
lots a day to cover costs, compared with nearly 21,000 in 1991-92 and the
present average of about 11,500.
In the longer term the exchange aims to concentrate on its core contracts of
cocoa, coffee and white sugar, plus their traded options. Mr Woodhead says
it will work to improve its image and to make sure its trading practices are
impeccable.
A review of the contracts that came with the take-over of the Baltic Futures
Exchange - including grain and freight rate futures - will be discussed by
the board in August.
The exchange is keen to attract more of the Dollars 25bn trade controlled by
managed futures funds. 'The US funds have primarily been interested in the
US markets - but many are looking to diversify internationally,' says Mr
Jenkins.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market may struggle to digest
Peru's mining giant - The problems of scale and complexity surrounding the
sale of Centromin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHASE MANHATTAN, in conjunction with Coopers and Lybrand, took on earlier
this month probably the most challenging of all Peru's coming
privatisations. Together, they are promoting the sale of Centromin, Peru's
state-owned mining and refining giant.
Given the complexity of the task - Centromin consists of seven separate
mines and a huge metallurgical complex with annual sales topping Dollars
400m - the sale strategy is to 'listen to the market'. While the Peruvian
government would prefer to dispose of the giant as a single unit, it may
prove impossible to find one buyer, or even one consortium, ready to take it
on.
A detailed information memorandum was available from the co-promoters as
from last week. Over a hundred mining companies have been contacted
worldwide and requested to fill in a questionnaire detailing their
particular interest. Pre-qualification of potential purchasers will commence
in late July and it is hoped the sale will be completed by December.
All Centromin's properties are in the high central Andes. Six of the mines -
Andaychagua, Casapalca, Cerro de Pasco, Morococha, San Cristobal and
Yauricocha - are polymetallic, while Cobriza is exclusively a copper
deposit. Each mine has its own concentrator plant; Cerro has two.
Centromin produces 40 per cent of all Peru's zinc, and more than half of it
comes from the Cerro de Pasco mine - the 'jewel in the crown', which mining
experts agree is the most attractive single property. Cerro is also
responsible for around 25 per cent of Peru's annual lead output and some 8
per cent of its silver.
The metallurgical complex of La Oroya, 3,700 metres above sea level, was
built by the US-owned Cerro de Pasco Corporation in the second decade of the
century. The copper smelter was inaugurated in 1922, followed by a lead
smelter and, in 1952, a zinc plant. The smelters process concentrates both
from Centromin's own mines and from other privately-owned companies in the
northern and central Andes.
Close by the smelters are the Huaymanta refineries which produce copper
cathodes and wire bars, refined lead and refined zinc. In all, Centromin
produces five principal metals and seventeen by-products such as sulphuric
acid, arsenic, copper and zinc sulphates and antimony.
Although the company could be split into individual production units, the
fear is that no buyers will emerge for the less attractive mines. Cobriza,
for example, is very isolated and projected output has never been reached.
Casapalca is tired and run-down, while Morococha never recovered from a 1989
attack by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas that devastated its infrastructure.
Only Andaychagua and Cerro de Pasco have immediately obvious potential.
It will be a bold buyer who will take on the entire operation. Aside from
the seven mines hundreds of kilometres apart, Centromin operates four
hydro-electric plants (with a combined capacity of 183 Mw), 212 km (130
miles) of railroad, eight hospitals and 75 primary and secondary schools.
Camps provide housing for a total of 100,000.
'It's too big and complex an animal, and its environmental liabilities are
too great to sell as one whole,' says one international mining expert. He
puts the value of the company as 'anywhere between Dollars 300m and Dollars
500m', the value of assets and mineral in the ground heavily being
discounted in view of the 'necessary clearing-up operations'. Peru's mines
ministry appears, however, to recognise the environmental cost element and
the government is studying possible use of debt paper to facilitate the
sale.
A less daunting prospect for the mining investor is state-owned Tintaya,
also rapidly being prepared for sale. It is one of Peru's highest-grade
copper deposits, located some 250 km south-east of Cuzco, 4,100 metres above
sea level on the high Andean plateau.
Last year, Tintaya's output of copper concentrates topped 157,000 tonnes,
making it Peru's third largest copper mine after Southern Peru's Cuajone and
Toquepala. Operations at Tintaya commenced in 1985, with development costs
estimated at Dollars 330m.
Tintaya's principal drawback is that its sulphide ores reserves, now down to
13m tonnes, will run out in three to four years. So the purchaser will have
to start exploitation of as yet untouched nearby deposits - the main three
have more than 56m tonnes of proven reserves between them, with a copper
content of more than 2 per cent. Studies suggest development costs could be
in the region of Dollars 85m.
Still to be determined is whether the 'Bambas' deposits - part of the same
copper belt as Tintaya but some 150 km away - will be included in the
Tintaya privatisation or held over for a later, separate sale. Together they
have some 40m tonnes of copper-bearing ore.
Mr Francisco Fernandez, head of Tintaya's privatisation committee, believes
that the existing Tintaya installations - including a modern, largely
Canadian-equipped concentrator plant, which has the benefit of good water
and energy supply - could form the nucleus of a future metallurgical
complex, perhaps concentrating on ecologically-sound leaching operations.
'In all these sales,' he says, 'the prime consideration is new investment
rather than cash down. The state simply doesn't have the resources to
develop these promising deposits.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmentalists win in BC
mine battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWING TO strong pressure from North American environmentalists, the British
Columbia government has barred further development of the Windy Craggy
copper and gold deposit in the scenic north-west corner of the province.
The area, in the watershed of the Tatshenshini River 60 km east of the
Alaska panhandle, will be set aside for an 8.5m hectare wilderness park,
straddling the US-Canada border.
The government said yesterday that it will 'fairly' compensate Geddes
Resources, which has so far spent CDollars 50m on exploration and
development, and holders of other mineral claims in the area.
Windy Craggy, widely thought to contain North America's richest undeveloped
copper reserves, has become a focal point of the clash between resource
industries and environmentalists. Development of the site, which is
estimated to contain about 2.7m tonnes of copper, has been stalled for four
years by environmental disputes.
The chief executives of five Vancouver-based mining companies warned last
week that a decision to turn the area into park land would have a negative
impact on investor confidence in the province. Besides the rich metal
content of the deposit, the mining industry has pointed to the job-creation
potential of a new mine.
Environmentalists on the other hand, have argued that a mine would do
incalculable damage to rivers and wildlife in one of the most pristine parts
of the continent. The Clinton administration has suggested creating a
protected wildlife area straddling BC and Alaska.
Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver this year bought a 39 per cent stake in Geddes,
reasoning that its CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.3m) investment would be more than
covered by compensation if the project was blocked.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish prices jump on hopes of lower
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH bonds jumped by more than a point yesterday as increasing confidence
in the new government and a spate of European interest rate cuts led to
hopes of an easing in Spain today.
In the futures market, the September contract was 1.15 points higher at its
peak. Then, profit-takers took the contract down to close at 93.25, a gain
of 0.90 on the day. Also, the yield spread against German bunds moved under
a historic support level of 350 basis points to 347 basis points.
Rate cuts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Ireland, as well as the
significant easing in the French intervention rate, have encouraged the
belief that European central banks have no problem in easing independently
of the Bundesbank.
AN ANNOUNCEMENT that today's German repo would be variable appeared to set
the seal on any hopes of a significant rate cut and sent German bond prices
lower. Bund futures for September delivery fell 12 basis points to 95.18.
The repo rate has been stuck at 7.6 per cent since early May and there were
expectations that the Bundesbank might cut by as much as a quarter-point
following the French cut on Monday.
However, those hopes were eroded by high money supply growth figures and
were dealt a further blow by the continuing strength of the US dollar
against the D-Mark. The dollar touched DM1.70 in intra-day dealing in London
yesterday.
FRENCH government bonds paused for breath yesterday following their recent
surge, as some investors wondered if the yield spread against bunds had
narrowed far enough.
The spread for April 2003 benchmark bunds and OATs widened slightly to 12
basis points.
THE GILTS market started brightly, but an early quarter-point gain was
eroded on the latest auction announcement, with September UK gilt futures
easing  1/8 point to 106 1/32 . The Bank of England is to auction Pounds
3.25bn of 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003 on June 30.
There was little surprise at the auction details but they gave an
opportunity to take profits after a solid rise prompted by the announcement
of sharply lower UK inflation and helped by the French rate cut.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing 2008
fell  3/32 to 107 13/32 , although at the shorter end the five-year dated
March 1998 gained  5/32 points to 101 5/32 .
IN THE remaining high yielding European markets, Italian government bonds
were volatile. They rose in early trading on the prospect of a half
percentage point interest rate cut, but prices slipped later in the day on
concerns over a vote of confidence called by Mr Carlo Ciampi, the prime
minister, and closed 0.27 point lower at 102.08.
Portuguese bonds were strong, buoyed by investor confidence that the escudo
will remain stable and local money rates will continue falling. Two state
banks followed up Monday's quarter point cut in the Bank of Portugal's key
money market rates by announcing a further cut of up to half a point in the
prime rate.
US TREASURY prices firmed slightly at both ends of the maturity range
yesterday after a modestly successful auction of two-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 104
1/2 , yielding 6.768 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
1/32 at 100, to yield 4.107 per cent.
Trading was relatively subdued throughout the morning, especially at the
short end of the market, as investors and dealers prepared for the afternoon
sale of Dollars 16bn of two-year notes and today's auction of Dollars 11bn
of five-year notes.
Comments from Mr Wayne Angell, a Federal Reserve governor, had little impact
on sentiment. He said the Fed was ready to tighten monetary policy if
inflation revived.
In his testimony before Republican members of the Congressional joint
economic committee, he reiterated the importance that the Fed should
'continue to focus in all circumstances on price level stability,' but also
expressed optimism on the prospects for low wage price inflation. Mr
Angell's comments came just a week after May data revealed that inflation
was not as threatening as investors and dealers had originally feared.
In the afternoon, the auction, which met solid investor demand, passed
uneventfully, although short-covering lifted prices across the board. The
only economic news - the report of a 0.1 per cent rise in store sales for
the third week of May - left prices unmoved.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Fed says derivatives growth
understated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of the derivatives market may be exceeding estimates by trade
associations, according to Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve.
The Fed puts the total notional value of derivative instruments in the US
banking system at Dollars 7,000bn in the first quarter of the year, much
higher than estimates by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, whose end-1991 figures, still widely cited, put the value of
derivatives globally at under Dollars 4,000bn. (Fed figures include foreign
exchange forward contracts and forward rate agreements.)
Mr Mullins added that notional value is not an accurate measure of exposure.
He said credit exposure for the same period, based on replacement value, was
just Dollars 140bn.
But increasing concern about creditworthiness and tougher competition has
concentrated that business among a much smaller group of players. Mr Mullins
says 90 per cent was conducted by just six US banks.
Although this concentration is of some concern, 'the institutions know who
they are and we should be able to supervise them,' he said. The US banks
most active in the derivatives market are Citibank, Chemical, JP Morgan,
Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, and Chase.
Meanwhile, the pace of research into derivatives shows no sign of abating.
The Group of 30 study on derivatives chaired by Sir Dennis Weatherstone is
expected to be published in July, while the technical committee of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions will start a
derivatives working party in September.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria launches record
Swiss franc offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC of Austria yesterday launched the largest offering to date in
the normally tranquil Swiss franc bond market
The SFr1bn seven-year deal, launched by Swiss Bank Corporation, is part of a
broader effort to improve the liquidity of the Swiss franc market by
creating trading benchmarks.
The aim is to attract more overseas institutional investors, who have
usually avoided the market because of its poor liquidity record.
'The deal prompted international interest,' said one banker. 'The prospect
for liquidity is good compared with the Swiss government bond market, which
remains underdeveloped.'
An official at SBC said that the deal might be reopened, to provide extra
liquidity, if Austria needed further funds. The deal was unswapped.
In the Eurolira bond market, which has expanded rapidly in the last few
months and is benefiting from the efforts of Italian banks to trade the
market more actively, the European Investment Bank added a further L300bn to
its L700bn of five-year bonds launched earlier this month, bringing the
total size of the deal, ahead of the settlement date, to L1,000bn. It is the
first deal to reach that size since the EIB and other supranational and
Italian borrowers lost their tax-exempt status last year.
Although interest in the Eurolira market is developing swiftly, and the
availability of large liquid deals is likely to draw the attention of both
borrowers and investors, the market may find it difficult to attract many
borrowers able to issue in large size, due to a lack of arbitrage
opportunities. The EIB has a natural demand for lira, because it will onlend
the unswapped lira funds raised through the L1,000 bn Eurobond.
Although the initial L700bn issue has rallied nearly 1 1/2 points since its
launch earlier this month, on the back of renewed interest in lira bonds,
the deal suffered somewhat when the market fell due to renewed political
uncertainty yesterday.
At the end of the day's trading, the deal was quoted at 101.20, just inside
full fees of 1 3/4 points.
Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered the ratings of the Province of Quebec and
Hydro-Quebec to A+ from AA - , revising the outlook from negative to stable.
The province's growing debt burden was cited as a key factor.
S&amp;P has assigned an investment grade rating of BBB - to the Republic of
Colombia's recent Dollars 125m Eurobond issue due 1998. Colombia is the only
Latin American country except Chile to be awarded an investment grade rating
by S&amp;P.
The rating reflects the country's 'long-standing record of prudent economic
and financial management, economic growth and uninterrupted servicing of
foreign debt.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Euroclear study aims to cut
the cost of settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH aimed at tackling the huge international investment losses caused
by time delays and national regulatory inconsistencies in securities
settlement has been published by Euroclear, the international clearing
house.
Euroclear's two-year study concentrates on the costs and risks of
cross-border securities trading and was backed by market research carried
out by Price Waterhouse. Its recommendations are:
To ensure that holders of securities have title at each stage of the
transfer and update ownership and transfer laws;
To streamline the system which enables international investors to avoid
paying taxes in both countries;
To cut back on regulations surrounding wholesale investors;
To allow for two settlement periods each day at each central securities
depository to smooth over the delays created by international time
differences;
To enable investors to settle before the settlement deadline;
To set up an international information system covering the corporate
announcements in each country;
It is lobbying for the recommendations to be taken up within five to seven
years and believes that their adoption by national regulators could save
billions of dollars.
Mr John Olds, general manager of Euroclear in Brussels, would not quantify
the potential savings for the group's 2,700 members and shareholders who,
with clients of Cedel, its rival clearing house, made cross-border
transactions in domestic and international securities worth Dollars 15,000bn
in 1992. 'We took as a benchmark an active broker/dealer clearing Dollars
500m a day. We estimate that firm would save Dollars 25m a year,' he said.
The in-depth analysis of cross-border securities dealing seeks to push
forward the impact of a 1989 report by the Group of 30, a Washington-based
'think-tank'. That report established the principle of three-day settlement
but was mainly influential in domestic markets.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: HK's superman finds warmer winds
from China - Simon Holberton examines Li Ka-shing's developing business
relationships with the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a scene that summed up just how far Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong
property tycoon and much else besides, has come since 1989.
This April, the man whom Hong Kong's citizenry likes to call 'superman', was
on hand to lend his lustre and support at the launch of New China Hong Kong,
an investment company that marries impeccable mainland connections and Hong
Kong money and which is fronted by Mr T. T. Tsui, another local tycoon.
On the dais at Hong Kong's Hilton Hotel, Mr Li rubbed shoulders and joked
with Mr Zhou Nan, head of the New China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial
'embassy' in the colony, and Mr Guo Fengming, China's top negotiator in
talks with the UK about Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty in 1997.
In 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, Mr Li was openly hostile to
the Beijing regime. He talked of diversifying his assets away from Hong
Kong, and he was also critical of local businessmen who publicly justified
Beijing's suppression of the demonstrators.
'If you bend with the political wind, if you have no principles, probably
you'll have an easier time doing business around here,' he told the Asian
Wall Street Journal in November 1989. 'I would much rather keep my mouth
shut than say what I don't believe to be true.'
Mr Li is still keeping his mouth shut, but since China re-embraced economic
reform more than a year ago he has judged the political wind to be warming.
He is now spending most of his time on the China-related business ventures
in which his two main listed companies - Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa -
are engaged, and in the task of developing contacts with Beijing's power
brokers.
Mr Li has forged links with a son and a son-in-law of Mr Deng Xiaoping,
China's frail senior leader, and with Shougang Corporation, the
third-largest Chinese steelmaker headquartered in Beijing and backed by
Deng. His latest foray into the Hong Kong stock market - the attempted
takeover of Miramar Hotel and Investment - is with Mr Larry Yung, the son of
Mr Rong Yiren, China's vice-president, and the head of Citic Pacific,
Beijing's premiere investment company in Hong Kong.
As befits a cautious man, Mr Li has not placed all his eggs in the same
basket. Although he has spent most of his time cultivating the children of
Mr Deng, he has also given assistance to the children of Mr Chen Yun, Mr
Deng's ideological opponent and chief rival for supreme power. Last
December, he helped China Venturetech, a company controlled by Ms Chen
Weili, to acquire a Hong Kong listing. His Cheung Kong joined with
Venturetech to take over Public International, an investment company which
is China Venturetech's listed vehicle in the colony.
Mr Li's cultivation of China's top leaders and their offspring, is simply
the conventional Chinese approach to business. As Mr Li and other Hong Kong
tycoons know, in China the way to get deals done is through personal
connections with powerful people. Says Miss Pauline Loong, China analyst at
brokers Jardine Fleming: 'The fact is that Deng's children are all important
people. They know other important people, and their power will survive the
death of their father.'
But there is also a pattern emerging in the deals Mr Li is doing. Shougang,
in addition to being an important steel producer in China, also has a large
construction business. Last week, Mr Li strengthened his connections with
China's metals industry when he joined with China National Non-ferrous
Metals Corp (CNNC), the vice-president of which is Mr Wu Jianchang, a
son-in-law of Mr Deng.
Last month, Mr Li joined with Mr Deng Zhifang, Mr Deng's son, and Shougang
to take over Kadar Investment, a local Hong Kong property company. The Kadar
takeover appears to be more akin to Mr Li's tilt at Miramar which, in an
unusual development for Hong Kong, has run in to problems with a
counterbidder. But the mainland tie-ups seem to serve an important strategic
interest in China.
'I think that one of the important lessons Mr Li has learned from his 30
years in business is the importance of control of the market you operate
in,' says Mr Archie Hart, director of research at brokers Crosby Securities.
'He has made a lot of money in Hong Kong by controlling the property market
and the container port. He wants to apply that principle to his business
interests in China.'
In China, Mr Li is involved in projects worth HKDollars 129.2bn (USDollars
16.7bn), of which his attributable interest is HKDollars 19.7bn. Investments
are wide ranging and include ports development and power station
construction, but most of his investments are in property.
'He knows he can not exercise the same control over land in China as he does
in Hong Kong so he has opted for tie-ups with companies that are important
to the construction process,' says Mr Hart.
With building materials' prices in southern China rising by more than 50 per
cent in the first three months of this year compared with a year earlier,
access to materials has become a priority for developers. Mr Li's new found
friends in Beijing just might be able to help.

SHARES in the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), the first of Poland's nine
main state banks to be privatised, rose steeply yesterday when the bank's
shares began trading on the Warsaw stock exchange, writes Christopher
Bobinski in Warsaw.
A public offer of the bank's shares in April saw 1.7m shares, or 27.2 per
cent, sold at a price of 115,000 zlotys each (Dollars 6.5). According to
traders, some 175,529 WBK shares yesterday changed hands at 350,000 zlotys,
reflecting the general rise in share prices on the Warsaw stock market in
the past two months.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development owns 28.5 per cent of
the WBK for which it paid 210bn zlotys when the bank was privatised.
Bank Slaski, the next Hungarian state owned bank to be privatised, is to be
offered to investors this autumn.

Indonesian group

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA Motor Corporation has taken an 8 per cent stake in Astra
International, the Indonesian automotive conglomerate, in a deal worth
Rp200bn (Dollars 95.9m).
Analysts see the deal as a vote of confidence in Astra, which has more than
Dollars 800m in foreign debt and last year saw net profits fall 61 per cent
to Rp81.5bn. Dismal sales also coincided with a financial crisis for the
Soeryadjaya family, Astra's founders, when their privately-owned Bank Summa
was closed at the end of 1992 owing more than Rp1,600bn.
According to analysts, the Soeryadjayas now own less than 10 per cent of
Astra, compared to 73 per cent last year. Ownership is principally split
between public investors (16 per cent), state-owned financial institutions
(27 per cent), and a 17-member consortium of private investors which took a
33 per cent stake in January.
Astra's share price has recovered from a low of Rp8,500 last December to
Rp13,250, although Toyota paid just Rp10,000 a share for its stake.
Toyota said Astra has also asked Toyota representatives to join its board,
although there may be problems taking up the invitation under Indonesian
law.
Brokers were quick to warn that yesterday's purchase does not mean Astra is
free of its troubles.
Sales for the first four months of the year totalled just 28,495 units (of
which 48 per cent were Toyota vehicles), down 12.5 per cent on the same
period last year and 42 per cent down on 1991.
However, Astra may be able to improve profit margins following tax increases
on imported completely built-up cars and reduced tax on imported components
for vehicles assembled in Indonesia.

SUNKYONG Group, Korea's sixth-biggest business group, plans a package of
mergers and a share sale reducing the number of the group's subsidiaries to
24 from 32, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
Sunkyong is to sell two subsidiaries and merge seven others. It will sever
its subsidiary relations with Yukong Fuchs and Sunkyong Cleantech by selling
stakes of 50 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.
Yukong Fuchs is a joint-venture with Fuchs Group of Switzerland. 'Fuchs has
nearly agreed to our plan to sell our stake in the company,' said Sunkyong.
Included in the merger plan are Sunkyong Pharmaceuticals and Sunkyong
Information System which will merge respectively into Sunkyong Industries
and YC&amp;C Co.
The moves reflect Sunkyong's attempts to streamline its organisation.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price not to pay
quarterly dividend
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABITIBI-PRICE, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, has
suspended its quarterly dividend, blaming sluggish newsprint prices and a
need for capital to modernise its mills.
Abitibi has been controlled for the past three months by a group of
international banks, which have taken over in all but name the 82 per cent
stake owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer.
The banks are working towards a decision on whether and how to sell their
stake.
An Abitibi official said the decision to omit the dividend was unrelated to
the change in control, but was entirely dictated by business factors.
The last dividend of 12.5 Canadian cents a share was paid in March. The
payout was cut from 25 cents in 1989.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, chief executive, said the dividend halt was 'in the
best long-term interests of our shareholders'.
The North American newsprint market bounced earlier this year as customers
lifted inventories to protect themselves from a price increase and the
possibility of a strike during labour negotiations at mills in eastern
Canada.
Abitibi suffered a CDollars 148m operating loss last year, and another
CDollars 24m (USDollars 18.7m) in the first three months of 1993.
Last year's losses were offset by proceeds of CDollars 353m from asset
sales, but no similar disposals have taken place so far this year.
The company is still seeking buyers for three paper-converting and office
products units.

share price fall

<TEXT>
WMX TECHNOLOGIES, the international disposal company that recently changed
its name from Waste Management, has issued an earnings warning.
It said declines in US government-directed environmental clean-ups were
trimming income from a prime subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, and
would lead to lower-than-expected earnings in the second quarter.
The news, released after Wall Street closed on Monday, pushed WMX stock down
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 at the end of trading yesterday. WMX said
although quarterly earnings from its other subsidiaries, including
Wheelabrator Technologies, Waste Management International and Rush
International were on target, softness in Chemical Waste's earnings would
reduce second-quarter results by 2 to 3 cents per share. Analysts had
projected WMX second-quarter earnings at near 45 cents per share. Now, they
say, earnings could be closer to 42 or 43 cents. The company will release
its second-quarter results in July.
Chemical Waste said it expected second-quarter operating earnings in the
range of 5 to 6 cents per share, below Wall Street estimates and down from
16 cents in the second quarter of 1992.
The company began to experience a drop in waste volumes from clean-up
projects in the last quarter of 1992, and the trend has continued so far in
1993.
'Government-mandated clean-up work at contaminated areas has failed to
materialise,' the company said.
The company added that private contracts for hazardous waste disposal were
being postponed.

VALMET, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, cut losses after
financial items to FM72m (Dollars 12.7m) in the first four months, from

Sales rose 38 per cent to FM3.31bn, and the operating margin rose to FM265m
from FM123m. However, financing costs increased to FM152m from FM84m, mainly
because of a FM50m foreign exchange loss following the depreciation of the
markka.
Given the stronger performance, and signs of revival in the wood processing
industry, the group has forecast a 'considerable improvement' in income for
the full year.

ARES-SERONO, the Swiss-based pharmaceutical group and world leader in human

strength. Operating income last year was Dollars 80m, writes Frances

Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive and principal shareholder, said
yesterday currency movements were obscuring gains in product sales and

In May, the group announced an 8.8 per cent drop in sales in the first
quarter, compared with a year earlier, but in constant dollar terms turnover
rose 3 per cent.

SKIS Rossignol, the French company which is the world's largest ski

It produced net profits of FFr36.65m (Dollars 6.45m) in the 12 months to
March 31, against a net loss of FFr53.95m the previous year.
News of Skis Rossignol's return to profit came a day after the announcement
of an increase in 1992-93 profits from Groupe Salomon, the other leading
French ski equipment maker. Both companies are recovering from a succession
of poor skiing seasons in the Alps.
The growth in turnover would have been even higher - at 17.1 per cent - on
stable exchange rates.
Operating profits rose sharply to FFr142.89m from FFr11.45m between the two
financial years.

VALMET, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, cut losses after
financial items to FM72m (Dollars 12.7m) in the first four months, from
FM126m in the same period in 1992.
Given the stronger performance, and signs of revival in the wood processing
industry, the group has forecast a 'considerable improvement' in income for
the full year, after 1992's FM298m loss.
Sales rose 38 per cent to FM3.31bn, and the operating margin rose to FM265m
from FM123m.
However, financing costs increased to FM152m from FM84m, mainly because of a
FM50m foreign exchange loss following the depreciation of the markka.
The company's paper machinery division was the star performer, with sales
rising to FM1.46bn from FM603m, thanks to the timing of several large
machine deliveries.
Other units improved sales, except at Saab-Valmet, where sales fell to
FM384m from FM608m after a dispute with Adam Opel interrupted production of
Opel Calibra cars.
Valmet's optimism for the rest of the year is based partly on a pick-up in
orders as the forestry sector shows signs of recovery. At the end of April,
the group order backlog was worth FM6.3bn, against FM4.7bn at the end of
April 1992.
The company forecasts a 10 per cent increase in 1993 sales from FM9.64bn
last year, and says all its units should show positive operation income.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS begins crucial talks today on a new three-year labour
contract with the United Auto Workers' union - but in a much improved
atmosphere, helped by a GM announcement that it is moving some car
production from Mexico to the US.
Detroit's other two big motor manufacturers - Ford and Chrysler - also face
contract negotiations this summer, but GM's are potentially the most
difficult because it faces more serious financial problems in North America
than its rivals, while its labour relations have been traditionally worse
than theirs.
However, Mr Jack Smith, chief executive of GM since last autumn, has been
trying hard to ameliorate the distrust between the company and the UAW -
including taking the unusual step of leading the GM team when talks open
today.
In a significant move on Monday, he also announced GM was to shift
production of 70,000 to 100,000 units annually of its Chevrolet Cavalier
sub-compact car from a plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, to Lansing, Michigan,
next year.
The move will create between 800 and 1,000 jobs in Lansing, which will be
filled, at least in part, by laid-off GM workers. In return, GM has won from
the UAW an agreement at the Lansing plant which should ensure much greater
labour flexibility and productivity.
The agreement, hailed by both the union and management as a example of
sensible co-operation, should also give a boost to proponents of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, bringing together the US, Mexico and Canada.
NAFTA is facing a tough battle in the US Congress for ratification, with
opponents arguing it would involve a large loss of American jobs to Mexico's
cheaper labour market. However, GM's move is likely to be used to
demonstrate that job movement will not be all one-way.
The Cavaliers being moved to Lansing are earmarked for the US and Canadian
markets. GM says the shift should not mean any job losses in Mexico, with
Cavalier production expanding to meet growing local demands and GM
considering building a new small car at Ramos Arizpe for the Mexican market.
GM does not manufacture a small car in Mexico, where this section of the
market is dominated by Volkswagen and Nissan.
Mr Stephen Yokich, the chief UAW negotiator at GM, said he believed this was
the first time a US motor manufacturer had moved production out of Mexico to
the US.
Praising Mr Smith, he said that 'since he took over as CEO we have had more
talk and more working together than we have had in the history of GM and the
UAW.'
Still, the contract talks will be heavy weather. The Big Three will be
seeking greater labour flexibility and lower health and pension liabilities,
while the union will be trying to maintain benefits and prevent job losses.
After initial negotiations, the union traditionally selects one of the Big
Three as its prime target and then tries to impose the settlement reached
with this company on the other two. Many analysts believe GM is the
likeliest target for this so-called 'pattern bargaining'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price suspends quarterly
payout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ABITIBI-PRICE, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, has
suspended its quarterly dividend, blaming sluggish newsprint prices and a
need for capital to modernise its mills.
Abitibi has been controlled for the past three months by a group of
international banks, which have taken over in all but name the 82 per cent
stake owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer.
The banks are working towards a decision on whether and how to sell their
stake.
An Abitibi official said the decision to omit the dividend was unrelated to
the change in control, but was entirely dictated by business fact-ors.
The last dividend of 12.5 Canadian cents a share was paid in March. The
payout was cut from 25 cents in 1989.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, chief executive, said the dividend halt was 'in the
best long-term interests of our shareholders.'
The North American newsprint market bounced up earlier this year as
customers lifted inventories to protect themselves from a price increase and
the possibility of a strike during labour negotiations at mills in eastern
Canada.
Mills sharply raised production to meet the demand, with capacity
utilisation in Canada jumping from 85 per cent in March to 99 per cent in
April.
But the improvement has not been sustained. Several companies, including
Abitibi, have announced production cutbacks to counter the renewed downward
pressure on prices.
Abitibi suffered a CDollars 148m operating loss last year, and another
CDollars 24m (USDollars 18.7m) in the first three months of 1993.
Last year's losses were offset by proceeds of CDollars 353m from asset
sales, but no similar disposals have taken place so far this year.
The company is still seek-ing buyers for three paper-converting and office
products businesses.
It sold a paper mill in north-west Ontario to a group of employees earlier
this year, but is providing CDollars 20m to support the venture.

ARES-Serono, the Swiss-based pharmaceutical group and world leader in human
fertility drugs, expects sales to fall this year to between Dollars 820m and
Dollars 840m from Dollars 854.5m in 1992, due mainly to the dollar's
strength. Operating income last year was Dollars 80m.
Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive and principal shareholder, said
yesterday currency movements were obscuring gains in product sales and
market share.
Its accounts are consolidated in dollars, although half its sales are in
Italy and Spain, which have suffered large currency devaluations.
In May, the group announced an 8.8 per cent drop in sales in the first
quarter, compared with a year earlier, but in constant dollar terms turnover
rose 3 per cent.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BARTHOLD von Ribbentrop, executive vice-president in charge of securities
sales trading at Deutsche Bank, is leaving Germany's largest bank to set up
an investment fund.
Mr von Ribbentrop, who has been with Deutsche Bank since 1971, is working
with a group of unnamed partners to raise DM500m (Dollars 301.2m) in
start-up capital. The fund will be designed to enable foreign institutions
to invest in medium-sized German companies, the so-called Mittelstand.
He said yesterday foreign institutions' opportunities to invest in the
German economy were limited by the structure of the German equity market.
There were only 665 quoted companies, and this did not cover the full depth
of the German economy.
Foreign institutions were obliged to channel investments into a small number
of large financial and industrial conglomerates, he argued. This left them
no option to make direct investments in the Mittelstand, which generated
about 50 per cent of non state-sector German GDP and employed 75 per cent of
the total German workforce.
A number of foreign banks had tried to establish such funds but have had
only limited success, reflecting the difficulties of entering the German
venture capital market.
Market participants say Germany's leading financial institutions tended to
get the best investment opportunities for their own equity participation
portfolios. Attempts by independent German financial institutions to set up
such investment funds had also foundered.
Mr von Ribbentrop, 52, who has been based in Frankfurt since 1986 after
spending most of his career with Deutsche Bank in New York, is succeeded by
Mr Bernd-Albrecht von Maltzan, 44, currently in charge of securities at
Deutsche Bank's Mannheim branch.

<TEXT>
FRAMATOME, France's state-controlled nuclear reactor group, yesterday
announced a slight fall in net profits, to FFr950m (Dollars 170.55m) in 1992
from FFr986m in 1991. It warned of a further fall in profits in the current
year.
Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, said he expected to see the group's net
profits settle at around FFr800m in 1993. This would be a reduction of 15
per cent on last year's figure.
The pressure on Framatome's profits comes at a time when the group is trying
to reduce its reliance on traditional nuclear activities by diversifying
into new fields.
Earlier this year, it agreed terms to buy Jeumont-Schneider, the electrical
components division of the Schneider electrical engineering group. One of
the conditions of the deal, which formed part of a pre-electoral reshuffling
of state assets by France's old socialist government, was that Framatome
agreed to sell the non-nuclear side of Jeumont-Schneider to Alcatel-Alsthom,
the electronics concern privatised by the last centre-right administration.
The diversification is expected to help Schneider's return to profits
growth.
The group last year saw sales slip to FFr12.66bn, against FFr14.17bn in
1991. However it benefited from an increase in orders, which rose to
FFr37.19bn from FFr33.17bn during the same period.
Mr Leny said he expected group sales to rise to FFr15bn this year.

FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shopping for European expansion
 -Ronald van de Krol finds Ahold seeking acquisitions closer to home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS pondering the question of where Ahold, the acquisitive Dutch
supermarket group, is likely to make its next significant purchase have a
yet wider range of possibilities on which to place their bets.
Ahold, the Netherlands' dominant food retailer, which already generates half
its sales in the US, is rapidly building up a presence in two virgin
territories, Portugal and the Czech Republic.
In Portugal, Ahold has recently concluded a series of deals with new
joint-venture partner, Jeronimo Martins, making it the second-largest food
retailer in the country in just 12 months.
In the Czech Republic, Ahold has taken advantage of the country's
privatisation programme to build up a 23-store chain. By the end of the year
it hopes to have 30 stores.
Concerted expansion in Europe is a new phenomenon for Ahold, whose
acquisitions outside the Netherlands have focused until recently on the US,
where it owns more than 500 supermarkets in the Boston-Chicago-Atlanta
triangle. The stores are spread mainly over four well-known supermarket
chains: First National, BI-LO, Giant and Tops, the last of which was
acquired in 1991.
Mr Cees van der Hoeven, Ahold's former finance director and now president,
says the company sought to spread its risks and build up a balanced
portfolio of companies. However, whether it invests in the US or in Europe
will depend on available opportunities, not on the pursuit of pre-determined
targets for geographic spread.
Southern Europe is particularly attractive because of expectations of high
growth, he says, but the company is casting its net widely.
'Ideally, I think in a number of years' time we should have operations in a
number of European countries. But by the same token, we should also have
further growth in the US,' says Mr van der Hoeven.
He says Ahold is in contact with potential acquisition candidates in the US.
In Europe, it is in constant touch with at least three companies interested
in pursuing ideas for business partnerships.
The timing of any big acquisition will determine whether financing is by
equity or debt, Mr van der Hoeven says. In the spring, Ahold made a Fl 450m
(Dollars 238.1m) rights issue to strengthen shareholders' equity after its
recent string of acquisitions.
Ahold's expansion in Europe is proceeding quite differently from its US
experience. In the US, Ahold grew by gradual expansion in 12 contiguous
eastern states, creating opportunities for co-operation between the various
chains in advertising, warehousing, distribution, private labels and
merchandising.
If this pattern could be followed in Europe, acquisitions in neighbouring
Germany and Belgium would be logical, but prospective candidates are
expensive and difficult to find. Instead, Ahold has chosen two very
different, far-flung markets to gain its first European footholds.
'There is some synergy in Europe, though admittedly less than in the
States,' he says. For instance, the Portuguese joint-venture has joined the
Associated Market Services alliance, which groups 11 top European food
retailers, including Argyll of Britain, Casino of France and Ahold itself.
Further synergy is created by the transfer of know-how in systems and
distribution to the Portuguese and Czech stores.
Mr van der Hoeven estimates that Portugal could eventually account for a
sizeable share of Ahold's annual sales, though probably not more than 10 per
cent of the total. The Czech Republic - a longer-term proposition - will
probably not come close to reaching this 10 per cent level, he says.
Unlike in the US, Ahold has chosen to expand in Portugal by way of a
joint-venture. Such arrangements are less common in the US, where people
prefer to know who 'the boss' is. In its joint venture with Jeronimo
Martins, the Dutch company holds 49 per cent of the shares, but its voting
power is equal to that of its 51 per cent partner.
All told, the two companies own 45 'Pingo Doce' supermarkets; another 40
stores to be given the Pingo Doce name; three Feira Nova hypermarkets; and
the 54-store Ino Supermercados chain of smaller grocery stores. These stores
have a combined annual turnover equivalent to Dollars 900m.
For all the excitement surrounding Europe's single market, Ahold does not
believe that exporting supermarket formulae from one country to another will
work, because each culture has its own way of presenting food. In Spain,
hypermarkets are a fixture in the food retailing landscape; in the
Netherlands, they are not.
Mr van der Hoeven says: 'Although Spaniards will be drinking Coca-Cola,
eating Campbell Soup and using Heinz ketchup and Nestle chocolate, they will
shop in a different environment.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN has failed to convince General Motors that its plans for a
revolutionary car plant in Spain are not a copy of a project drafted
previously by the US group.
'We have a right to be sceptical,' Mr David Herman, chairman of GM's German
subsidiary Adam Opel, said yesterday. 'It would be a real tour de force' if
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief who is now
at VW, had managed to develop a new concept between mid-March, when he left
the US, and mid-June when he announced VW's plans.
Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said the German company did not have any
confidential plans or documents about GM's ultra-low-cost factory project.
Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez's
announcement, suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW's
project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez's direction.
At the time Mr Herman wrote, German state prosecutors were investigating the
US group's complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents
with them when they moved to VW. The German company has consistently
rebutted the charges.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo in black and resumes acquisition
search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, returned to
profit in its second half and has resumed its search for acquisitions,
concentrating on the European computer services market.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.8m in the year to March 31, on turnover
of Pounds 56.7m, after a loss of Pounds 86,000 at halfway.
The group has changed its year-end, so there is no strictly comparable
period, but in the eight months to March 1992 it made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 611,000 on turnover of Pounds 38.5m.
The total dividend is maintained at 2.1p net per share with a final
distribution of 1.85p.
Earnings per share, however, were pushed down by abnormally high tax
charges, coming out at 1.6p.
Mr Peter Harrop, chairman, was relaxed about dipping into reserves to pay
the dividend, noting that the group now had no borrowings and that the order
book was picking up.
In the last financial year, all the profits came from the computer services
division, while the printed systems business undertook a painful
readjustment to reduced markets.
This meant the loss of 100 out of 480 jobs and led to exceptional costs for
the period of Pounds 1.53m.
There were also extraordinary debits amounting to Pounds 863,000 which
related largely to the write-off of loan notes received as part of a US
acquisition which was subsequently resold.
During the year, Kalamazoo made two acquisitions for the computer services
business.
Since the year end it has acquired a Dutch company, specialising in motor
dealer computerisation, the group's core sector.
Now, said Mr Harrop, the group is looking for companies to buy in France and
Germany, observing that, with the UK economy starting to recover and with
the continental economies declining, 'we are in the right place at the right
time'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Silentnight founder fails to cut dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM Clarke, founder and former chairman of Silentnight Holdings, the beds
group, yesterday unsuccessfully tried to persuade shareholders to cut the
company's dividend from 5.75p to 5.25p at the annual meeting. He argued that
not enough profit was being retained for development.
Mr Clarke also opposed the board over its search for three non-executive
directors to help comply with Cadbury recommendations on corporate
governance. He claimed this would push directors' annual salaries and fees
over Pounds 1m, compared with about Pounds 600,000 at present.
Both criticisms were heavily supported by a show of hands among more than
100 mainly small, private shareholders.
However, both failed on card votes because trustees acting for 51 per cent
of the shares - all owned by Mr Clarke and his family - supported the board,
arguing management should be either backed or sacked.
Mr Clarke said inflation had been 24 per cent over the last four years,
while Silentnight's turnover had risen only 21 per cent in the same period.
Pre-tax profits had risen 8 per cent and profits attributable to
shareholders 13 per cent. Dividends, however, had risen by 16 per cent and
retained earnings by only 11 per cent.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said a good second half of last year had
made up for a poor first half. Dividends were being maintained at last
year's total of 8p.
He said Silentnight had been ahead of 1992 in every month since Christmas.
Directors' earnings were lower in Mr Clarke's time because the business and
the board were smaller. With Pounds 14m cash in the bank, he was not worried
about having enough in reserve.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant sales to NHS help Philip Harris to
top Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP HARRIS Holdings, the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment
supplier, reported pre-tax profits up almost 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.76m
to Pounds 2.02m, in the year ended March 31, helped by buoyant sales to the
National Health Service.
Following three acquisitions, gearing at the year-end stood at 65 per cent
(28 per cent) and interest charges rose to Pounds 570,000 (Pounds 484,000).
The figures, however, excluded the Pounds 5m proceeds of March's rights
issue which were received after the year-end, reducing bank borrowings to
about Pounds 1m and gearing to about 10 per cent.
Turnover rose to Pounds 85.3m (Pounds 79.1m) with the medical division
contributing Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 51.3m) to sales and Pounds 1.41m (Pounds
1m) to operating profit. Results included contributions from the nine retail
pharmacies acquired in June 1992.
Sales to the NHS continued at a 'buoyant level' with the wholesale business
benefiting from the Folidays acquisition in February 1992.
While political pressure over the NHS drugs bill had affected margins and
stability, directors said that 'the natural growth in healthcare and in
particular the increasing age profile of the population indicates that in
the medium term this market should grow'.
The education and science division felt the effects of recession and changes
in the UK education system. Sales fell to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 27.8m) and
operating profits to Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.24m) following a centralisation
programme.
A final dividend of 4.65p gives a total of 6.85p (6.25p). Earnings were
16.47p (14.58p).

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pension refund helps reduce deficit at NSM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal mining group, reported a
reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.95m for the year ended March 31. There were
losses of Pounds 5.72m last time.
The deficit was reduced after a Pounds 1.6m exceptional credit in the form
of a refund received from the group pension scheme and a fall in the net
interest charge from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 9.3m.
After a series of small disposals, borrowings fell from Pounds 84m to Pounds
94m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 56m.
Mr John Jermine, chief executive, said further sales by the end of the year
should generate another Pounds 10m, while the disposal of exhausted coal
sites and the air condition and distribution business could fetch about
Pounds 20m by the end of 1995.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 7.88m (Pounds 89.2m) included Pounds 5.2m
(Pounds 87.4m) in respect of purchased goodwill on businesses sold. Mr
Jermine said he was confident there would be no more exceptional or
extraordinary items having taken all the write-offs needed.
Operating profit fell from Pounds 8.99m to Pounds 5.74m on reduced sales of
Pounds 114m (Pounds 147m).
The group was adversely affected by the decline in US operating profits to
Dollars 2.1m (Pounds 1.4m) compared with Dollars 7.3m, reflecting continuing
low levels of market demand and the failure of a new piece of production
equipment at one of the company's deep mines.
Operating profits from the UK sector fell from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.5m
against the background of uncertainty created by the government's coal
review.
Mr Jermine attacked the government's coal privatisation plans as
'unworkable' and said NSM would not be making a bid for any of the four pits
offered to the private sector.
He welcomed the government's intention to abolish the 'arbitrary and
punitive limit of 250,000 tonnes for private licences' but called for its
immediate implementation instead of waiting for the industry to be
privatised.
There is no final dividend. Losses per share were 13.1p (earnings of 11p).

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aiming for Midas' touch in software -
Combined ACT/BIS group will have annual sales over Pounds 250m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUBBER plants outside the offices of Mr Roger Graham, chairman and chief
executive of BIS Group, have a weary air.
They bely the resilience of one of the UK's oldest computing services
companies, newly acquired by ACT, the Birmingham based computer group, for
Pounds 93.5m. Together they will form an international company with annual
sales of more than Pounds 250m and a range of financial software packages
that few can equal.
Since 1987, BIS has prospered only fitfully under the benevolent but
somewhat detached management of Nynex Corporation of the US.
Last year it returned to the black, reporting an operating profit of Pounds
8.7m after a Pounds 1m loss in 1991, the first in its history.
Its acquisition by ACT should signal a renaissance for BIS and for
indigenously owned computing services companies in the UK.
ACT and BIS together will offer a range of financial software packages that
few, if any, computing services companies can equal and with little overlap
between them.
The list includes Midas, BIS's venerable but well regarded modular banking
systems, and Bankmaster, a banking system developed by one of ACT's more
recent acquisitions, the Irish software company Kindle. Midas is a product
for mature markets; Bankmaster suited to the financial systems of emerging
nations.
Founded in 1964 as a market research and training business, BIS quickly
diversified into computer consultancy. It is best known, however, for the
Midas package, which it has developed over the years into the most
successful piece of packaged applications software ever developed by a UK
company.
BIS Banking Systems now has more than 500 banking clients in 70 countries
and employs more than 600 people. Although Midas is over 20 years old, it
has gone through repeated facelifts to keep it up to date and was sold to 45
new clients last year alone.
Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman, said yesterday that he was committed to
supporting and developing Midas for well into the next century.
Nynex, one of the US 'Baby Bells', bought BIS for Pounds 75m at a time when
it was fashionable for telecommunications companies to spread their
interests through the acquisition of computing companies. More recently
Nynex has decided to concentrate on its core business worldwide and on its
substantial investments in cable in the UK. Mr Graham said that Nynex had
been a good parent but: 'now we need a long-term shareholder prepared to
make substantial investments'.
The search for a new partner had been going on for about a year. Lazards,
Nynex's merchant bankers, made the introduction to ACT; Nynex was attracted
by the fact that the Birmingham company was prepared to do the deal quickly
and the final papers were signed just before 8am yesterday.
ACT - which made profits before tax of Pounds 20.5m on sales of Pounds 153m
last year - is another of the UK's long established computing services
companies.
A flirtation with computer hardware ended with the sale of its workstation
business to Mitsubishi Electric in 1990, since when it has concentrated on
developing its principal divisions: ACT Financial Services, ACT Logsys,
dealing with computing services for government departments and utilities,
ACT Medisys, dealing with medical systems, ACT Computer Support, the
maintenance arm, ACT Cablestream, concerned with networking, and ACT Kindle.
It has grown rapidly, especially in financial services.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ascot Holdings, the renamed Control Securities, has satisfied all the
conditions of its Pounds 292m financial restructuring, which included Pounds
148m of bank debt and Pounds 90m of Swiss franc bonds. The proposals have
therefore become effective.
The group aims to publish its accounts for the year to March 31 by July 30.
Dealings in the shares, suspended since April last year, are expected to
resume the day after the accounts are published.
Mr Sydney Robin, who has chaired the group since Mr Nazmu Virani stepped
down in April last year, and steered it through the refinancing, has become
a non-executive deputy chairman. Mr Howard Dyer has joined the board as
chairman and chief executive.

Losses at Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted maker of hot stamping foils
and embossed holograms, rose from Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 2.26m pre-tax over
the year to end-March.
Directors said the second half was adversely affected by recession and

The deficit took account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 811,464. Losses
per share emerged at 11.2p (9.1p). Turnover was little changed at Pounds

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: LPA declines to Pounds 18,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at LPA Industries, the USM-quoted industrial electrical connectors
and accessories group, fell from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 18,000 pre-tax for
the half year ended March 31.
Turnover declined to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 3.18m). The interim dividend is
maintained at 1.65p, uncovered by earnings of 0.2p (2.41p) per share.
Although sales showed a reduction of 19.6 per cent and pre-tax profit was
only slightly better than break even the directors confidently expected an
improvement in those earnings ratios by the year-end.
They pointed out that a cessation of certain contracts during the second
half of last year was a main factor in the reduction in interim sales.
The current forward order book stands at Pounds 2.65m, against less than
Pounds 1m this time last year. However, some 70 per cent of these orders are
not due for execution until 1994.

At the year-end net asset value stood at Pounds 1m (Pounds 7.1m).

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca Pounds 1.3bn rights taken up by 86%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA'S Pounds 1.3bn rights issue was taken up by 86.15 per cent of its
shareholders and the balance of the issue was placed yesterday at 612p, 12p
above the rights issue price.
Shares in Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from Imperial Chemical
Industries at the beginning of this month, rose on the news, closing at
626p, up 8p.
SG Warburg and BZW, the securities houses which organised the placing, took
a 0.2 per cent fee for the placing, equivalent to 1.224p per share.
Investors who did not take up their rights will therefore receive 10.776p
per share.
The deal is the largest underwritten rights issue to have succeeded in the
UK market, with no shares being left for the underwriters to take up.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Zeneca, said he was 'delighted' by the
take-up of the issue.
Mr John Mayo, finance director, said: 'We achieved all the objectives we set
ourselves'.
Neither Mr Mayo nor Zeneca's brokers would say how many shares were sold by
the international marketing syndicate set up to find demand from outside
Zeneca's existing shareholder base.
Market sources suggest this operation did not find significant new demand
for Zeneca.
Mr Mayo said that, 'the syndicate sold shares in all the major time zones;
Europe, the US and Japan'.
However, he added that against a background of uncertainty in the US over
healthcare reforms, 'while there was demand, it might not have been at the
level seen two years ago'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood improves to Pounds 55m -
Underlying growth as period of consolidation draws to a close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Hazlewood Foods advanced from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 55m pre-tax
in the year to March 31 despite a number of adverse influences.
The group said that underlying growth in the base business, excluding
acquisitions and one-off factors, was 5 per cent.
Mr Peter Barr, chairman, said the period of consolidation, where its
numerous operations have been rationalised and integrated, was now coming to
an end.
The next stage was to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, to maintain and
eventually increase margins.
Hazlewood, which operates mainly in the UK and the Netherlands, saw strong
growth from its convenience foods activities.
The period covered 53 weeks, the extra week worth Pounds 1.3m to profits.
There was a Pounds 2.7m benefit from sterling devaluation offset by a Pounds
1.4m cost as debtor balances were translated at new rates. Recovery in the
cockle business, hit the previous year by fishing restrictions, added back
Pounds 2.6m to profits. Acquisitions, such as a full year contribution from
Sutherland, which was included for 7 months the previous year, chipped in
Pounds 2.9m.
However, a botulism scare at a meat subsidiary cost Pounds 1m and sharp
falls in tomato and capsicum prices cut Pounds 2.7m from profits.
A more conservative depreciation policy added Pounds 1m to the charge and
interest payable rose Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.8m.
Group turnover was 20.5 per cent higher at Pounds 761.8m and operating
profits were up 11 per cent to Pounds 66.8m.
Mr John Simons, finance director, said that margins were maintained if the
effect of a full year's inclusion of the lower margin distribution
activities of Sutherland were taken into account.
Earnings per share rose 8.1 per cent to 17.75p. A proposed 4.1p final
dividend makes a 6.4p total, a 4.9 per cent improvement on last year's 6.1p.
In the grocery and non foods division profits rose from Pounds 15.5m to
Pounds 15.8m. In the frozen foods division profits were up from Pounds 24.1m
to Pounds 27.1m, helped by the recovery in the cockle business and growth in
ready meals. In fresh foods profits were up from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 22m
as convenience foods more than doubled its contribution, offseting declines
in meat and produce.
A high level of capital expenditure, at Pounds 49.2m, and spending on
acquisitions totalling Pounds 20.9m, including Pounds 9.7m of integration
costs, led to a rise in net debt from Pounds 109.7m to Pounds 157.2m,
increasing gearing from 69 to 95 per cent. Since the year end the group has
sold its Dutch confectionery business for Pounds 14.2m.
COMMENT
Hazlewood is slowly translating its promises into action and at least the
profits are moving up again, if not yet back to the Pounds 57.1m made in
1990. Conditions for food manufacturers have been tough, and if anything
Hazlewood has been somewhat protected by having a third of its customers in
continental Europe. That might not be such good news as mainland Europe goes
further into recession. But it is pressing on with its plan to grow the
higher added-value activities and allow the less exciting areas to become a
smaller part of the whole. Gearing is a concern, but capital expenditure
will fall this year. 1993-94 profits might top Pounds 60m, putting the
shares, down 7p to 189p yesterday, on a prospective p/e of about 10, which
is not taking too much on trust.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Crabtree rises to 204p in first day of
dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Crabtree Group, the Gateshead-based metal decorating printing
press producer, closed at 204p yesterday, the first day of dealing since the
reversal into Somerset Trust.
Dealings in Somerset, which acquired Crabtree for Pounds 19.4m, were
suspended at 178p on May 4.
Mr Karl Watkin, chairman, welcomed yesterday's outcome. 'I'd rather see a
stable share price, gradually increasing, than a flash in the pan,' he said.
He was also pleased at the rise in value of his own 12.7 per cent holding,
from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 3.8m.
About 1m of the 11.25m fully paid shares changed hands in the first three
hours of dealing. Some 2m of the 3.6m nil paid rights were also sold.
Mr Nick Donaldson, a corporate finance director with Credit Lyonnais Laing,
whose placing of 6.6m shares at 150p had been oversubscribed, said the rise
was 'healthy' and very much as expected.
Multitrust sold its entire holding of 100,000 Crabtree ordinary and 300,000
rights over the nil-paid for a total of Pounds 352,000, a profit of Pounds
297,000 over cost.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Withdrawal losses leave Whitecroft Pounds
42m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based mini-conglomerate, reported deepening losses
of Pounds 41.8m pre-tax for the year ended March 31, against a previous
Pounds 3.65m, restated in accordance with FRS 3.
Turnover was Pounds 125m (Pounds 149m), a drop of 16 per cent. However,
there was a trading profit of Pounds 2.64m on sales of Pounds 108m in the
group's four remaining core activities. Losses were from property and the
discontinued home improvements operations.
Losses per share increased to 94.5p (9.6p). The new chairman, chief
executive and finance director - all of whom have taken office since the
departure of Mr Peter Goold as chairman in March - are not recommending a
dividend.
Whitecroft, which expanded quickly in the latter half of the 1980s on the
back of the property boom, has been restructuring and struggling to get out
of the sector since the recession began.
The bulk of losses follow the hiring of Hillier Parker as property
consultants and a consequent savage additional write-down of values. The
results show a Pounds 29.3m loss on disposal of the home improvement
businesses and a net Pounds 11.4m of property write-downs. These total more
than the Pounds 38.1m of losses before interest payments, supporting the
claim yesterday of Mr Mike Derbyshire, the new chief executive, that
Whitecroft's four core businesses were now profitable and should see it back
to health.
The four core businesses are now industrial, commercial and street lighting;
building products, mainly high-specification fire doors; medical cotton
fibre, where Edward Hall, a subsidiary is European market leader; and
textiles, where the group specialises in bleaching, dyeing and coatings.
Mr Derbyshire said a string of small to medium-sized office developments,
were now realistically priced in the books at Pounds 14.4m, compared with
Pounds 25m last year. Sales brought in Pounds 3.7m during the year.
He said future sales would represent a financial gain to the group and one
was nearing completion. The group, now down to 18 operating centres against
30 last year, has put its Wilmslow headquarters up for letting and will
relocate to more modest offices.
During the year the group shed another 10 per cent of jobs and now employs
1,860 people. Gearing is 150 per cent, with borrowings of Pounds 35m (Pounds
36.4m). Mr Derbyshire said borrowings were falling with property sales and
had peaked at Pounds 43m at Christmas.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Defence and NHS business help Vega advance
to Pounds 1.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VEGA GROUP, a satellite software specialist, lifted pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.72m in its first full year as a quoted company,
boosted by diversification into Health Service and Department of the
Environment contracts.
Defence business also grew. Satellites are 'areas of the Ministry of Defence
which are unaffected by the general military spending cuts,' said Mr John
Rigg, chairman, yesterday.
Turnover for the 12 months to April 30 expanded 29 per cent from Pounds
6.27m to Pounds 8.1m and earnings per share rose from 6.69p to 7.99p.
The final dividend is 1.86p making a total for the year of 2.73p.
There was an extraordinary item of Pounds 227,000 to cover the costs of the
flotation.
Cash flow continued to be positive and net assets rose from Pounds 1.12m to
Pounds 2m.
The number of employees has grown from 125 in May 1992 to more than 150,
with about 80 per cent in fee earning posts.
'Vega is very well positioned to continue its strong growth. The company has
contracts to provide support services to most European space projects', said
Mr Rigg.
'Many of these contracts extend over a number of years and provide a stable
financial base from which we can continue to develop new business.'
The company is looking for acquisitions in the software sector, he said.
These might include one or both of two other companies chaired by Mr Rigg, a
former chartered accountant with Arthur Andersen: Triad Special Systems and
Shreeveport.
He added that an alternative was the flotation of Triad, which is set to
make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 900,000 on sales of Pounds 5.5m this year.
Vega Group was floated in June 1992 via a placing at 122p. Yesterday the
shares rose 5p to 132p.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright favours the smaller investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARPETRIGHT has favoured smaller investors in deciding the basis of
allocation for its flotation, which was 2.6 times subscribed.
Trading in the shares starts today.
The issue was priced at 148p a share valuing the carpet retailing group
headed by Sir Phil Harris at Pounds 113.6m.
The offer for sale of 13.7m shares attracted 14,229 applications for a total
of 35.81m shares.
Another 25.45m shares were placed with institutions.
Applications for 250 to 3,000 shares will be met in full; those applying for
4,000 to 5,000 will receive 3,000; between 6,000 and 7,000: 3,500; between
8,000 and 80,000: 4,000.
Applicants for between 90,000 and 990,000 shares will get 5 per cent of the
amount they asked for and those for over 1m shares will receive 2.5 per
cent.
The level of subscription was described as 'not overwhelming' but since many
of the shares on offer were being sold by existing investors this suggested
that the pricing reflected a balance between sellers and buyers.
MFI Furniture Group sold its 20 per cent stake raising Pounds 21.5m.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W promises year of action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE AND Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, has been in the shade
lately.
While BT, its UK rival, launched glamorous bids for global mastery in
alliance with the MCI, the second largest US carrier, C&amp;W's high points have
been a domestic deal with Bell Canada Enterprises and the possibility of a
joint venture to build 1m phone lines in the Philippines.
The BCE deal - under which BCE took a 20 per cent stake in Mercury and C&amp;W a
12 per cent in BCE's UK-based cable TV company - gives C&amp;W scope to
diversify beyond straight telecommunications, but hardly amounts to a grand
strategy.
However, announcing the annual results yesterday, Lord Young, C&amp;W's
chairman, promised plenty of action for the year ahead.
C&amp;W is nowhere near BT's cash flow league. But with operating profits of
Pounds 771m on turnover of Pounds 3.8bn in the year to March 31, gearing
down to 13.2 per cent (25.9 per cent) and analysts projecting pre-tax
profits in excess of Pounds 1bn in the current year, the company can raise
its sights.
In the immediate future, all eyes are on the imminent launch in the UK of
Mercury One-2-One, the UK PCN mobile service of which C&amp;W is joint owner
with US West. So far C&amp;W has spent about Pounds 150m on One-2-One.
The competition, however, is not idle. Last week Vodafone, the largest
cellular operator, cut its London tariff by 25 per cent, and announced the
launch in October of a micro-cellular service to compete with PCN in the
south-east. Much depends on the price sensitivity of the mobile market, and
on the speed with which One-2-One rolls out its network beyond the M25.
Growth in the UK market also hinges on the success of 'easy access' -
dialling 132 from any phone to access the Mercury network - in attracting
new custom from BT.
Abroad, C&amp;W's plans appear less focused. It has 'hubs' in the Caribbean and
Asia-Pacific, plus operations in the US, central and eastern Europe and a
business networks division providing internationally-managed data services.
Lord Young said he talked 'almost every day' to potential allies like AT&amp;T
and Sprint, but that a link-up was 'possible not probable.' Instead, he
emphasised the avenues opening up in China.
'Sooner or later the Chinese will have to change their policy of ruling out
foreign equity stakes to achieve their ambitious growth plans,' he said.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Float values Court Cavendish at Pounds 51m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURT Cavendish, the nursing home company, has priced its new issue at 225p
a share, valuing the group at Pounds 51m. It plans to use the money raised
to repay Pounds 24.6m debt and to finance expansion.
Currently the fifth largest nursing home operator in the UK, Court Cavendish
aims to grow at 500 beds a year for the next three to five years, spending
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m a year. The company has a new secured bank
facility to borrow Pounds 20m.
UBS is placing 20.2m shares, 90 per cent of the total, 7.1m of which are
subject to clawback.
Existing shareholders are selling 2.56m shares, with 17.7m new shares being
issued.
The company's estimate of pro forma pre-tax profits for the year to end
April of Pounds 2.26m and earnings per share of 14.8p put the shares are on
an historic p/e of 15.2 at the issue price. A notional net dividend of 3.6p
for 1992-93 gives a yield of 2 per cent at the offer price.
COMMENT
Court Cavendish aims to differentiate itself in this competitive market.
Private and part-private clients fill 60 per cent of beds - more than
competitors - and a mix of residential with traditional nursing homes gives
it flexibility. The company's strategy of buying filled homes rather than
building new ones makes sense in today's property market. But it could mean
less efficient homes with higher costs. The immediate problem is uncertainty
created by recent changes to government funding rules. These should favour
corporate investors in the end, while social and political trends make
nursing homes a growth sector. The company says it has the finance for its
goal of 3,000 beds within about three years. It hopes that by 1996 there
will be a US-style lease-back market in nursing home assets to pay for
further growth. On forecast profits of Pounds 4.2m for the current year the
prospective p/e of 14 at the issue price looks cheap. Given the sector is on
15.5 and Westminster Health Care, a larger and recently floated competitor,
is on 16, the issue should go well.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: IBC plans to remove banks' control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Communications (Holdings), the conference and
newsletter publishing group, yesterday announced a package of proposals
including a Pounds 20m placing and open offer.
The proposals are designed to cut group debt by three quarters, remove the
banks' controlling interest, and enable it to resume dividend payments.
Shares in the company, which yesterday forecast an operating profit of
Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.28m) and a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds
750,000 (Pounds 572,000) in the six months to June 30, jumped by 3 1/2 p to
12p after the announcement.
Mr Peter Rigby, chairman and chief executive, said the proposals would
'normalise' the group, which is currently controlled by a group of seven
banks which hold 62.9 per cent of the equity.
The centrepiece of the proposals is the planned placing and open offer of
22.3m shares at 90p through Williams de Broe.
Qualifying shareholders will be offered 11 offer shares for every 75
existing shares. Subject to subscriptions under the open offer, up to 74.3
per cent of the shares have already been firmly placed with institutional
investors.
The group also plans a 1-for-10 share consolidation, mainly to facilitate
the placing and open offer.
The bulk of the Pounds 18m net proceeds from the placing and open offer will
be used to reduce the group's debt which is made up of Pounds 55m in bank
term loans and Pounds 27m of debenture stock. The bank loans comprise an
Pounds 18.3m interest bearing loan and Pounds 36.7m of non-interest bearing
loans.
Under the terms of a conditional agreement with the banks to reduce and
simplify the structure of the debt, the non-interest bearing loans will be
cancelled, the interest-bearing loan will be reduced by Pounds 2.8m and the
debenture stock will mostly be redeemed early at a discount.
Overall the measures will reduce borrowings by about Pounds 66.5m to Pounds
15.5m and will cut the banks' shareholding to about 19.6 per cent.
Following the reorganisation The group expects to pay a final dividend of
not less than 2p for the current year.
COMMENT
IBC's package of proposals makes a lot of sense and, as Mr Rigby suggests,
should provide 'a sound base for growth in profits and shareholder value.'
For their part the banks have probably already written off the bulk of the
non-interest bearing loans and deeply discounted debenture stock. The
company will end up with a single interest-bearing loan it can afford to
service and shareholders, including the banks, will see dividend payments
again. Meanwhile the group's 28 managers, who have invested Pounds 2m of
their own money over the past few years should, should provide the impetus
for the group to move forward again.

The West Bromwich Building Society increased pre-tax profit by 56 per cent,
from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 17.4m, for the year to March 31.
The rise was helped by a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shake-up at the Vestey empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD VESTEY has taken some of his executives by surprise by deciding to
establish a new management structure for the Vestey Group under which all
group operations and investments will report.
Lord Vestey and Mr Edmund Vestey, who is chairman of the Western United
Investment Company, are looking to hire a new chief executive and chief
financial officer responsible for 'all the family interests'.
However, Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive of Union International, the
principal trading arm of the Vestey Group, has privately made it clear that
he is not prepared in the short-term to report to any new management
company.
One of Union International's advisers yesterday said: 'Mr Robinson does not
currently report to anyone, not even Union's holding company Western United.
His contract, which has another 18 months to run, mentions nothing about
reporting to any new Vestey company'.
The Vesteys recruited Mr Robinson from Lonrho, the international trading
conglomerate, to turn around the heavily-indebted Union International. The
company recently reported profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds
30.8m in the year ended December 31, compared with a loss of Pounds 20.5m in
the previous year.
Mr Robinson reached a standstill agreement with Union's banks last year. The
arrangement, however, is unlikely to be completed until December 1994.
Mr Robinson is understood to have told the Vestey family that he is more
than happy with reporting to a new management company, but only after
Union's restructuring is completed by the end of next year.
He yesterday confined himself to saying: 'I welcome the idea of experienced
management at the top of the Vestey empire'.
Mr Edmund Vestey said: 'It is in the best interests of all the group's
stakeholders - employers, customers, shareholders - for a professional
management team to be given strategic and day-to-day management control.'
Mr Vestey will become non-executive chairman of the company and three other
representatives of the family will be non-executive directors.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Profits improve 5% to Pounds 12m despite
lack of consumer confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST LEISURE reported a 4.6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 12.2m but said it had not yet detected any recovery in consumer
confidence, writes Andrew Bolger.
Turnover for the six months to May 2 increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 52m
and operating profits by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 14m.
However, a higher tax rate meant that earnings per share fell slightly to
5.74p (5.88p).
Lord Rayne, chairman, said: 'During this period of continuing economic
stress, trading patterns have been volatile, with no consistent trends
discernible.
'The gains which have been made tend to reflect the group's own efforts,
rather than any recovery in consumer confidence.'
The sports division experienced a more difficult first half and the small
improvement in trading profits, from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 7.6m, was
entirely due to the first-time contribution from two new Super Bowls at
Bristol and Plymouth.
The dancing division maintained the progress achieved during the second half
of last year, increasing trading profits from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 7.5m.
That was mainly due to the successful refurbishment and relaunch of six
discotheques and the opening of a large new discotheque in Liverpool.
The resorts division improved trading profits from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds
1.7m, with trading ahead of last year during the Easter period. Blackpool
Tower, following the final phase of its Pounds 10m redevelopment, had traded
strongly since reopening for Easter.
The interim dividend is increased by 6.4 per cent to 2p (1.88p).
COMMENT
First Leisure's prospective multiple of 22 demands an ambitious rate of
growth. Pre-tax profits this year should grow to Pounds 35m, but whether the
company's foray into bingo will be sufficient to maintain its momentum must
be open to doubt. The acquisition of Nudge is certainly a sensible first
step. First Leisure will gain seven bingo clubs and considerable management
expertise. It can then expand the chain aggressively leveraging off its
proven leisure management skills. But the group will only have a small shout
in the bingo world. Rank and Bass already control about a third of the UK's
outlets and may make life difficult for the new entrant. Funding the
purchase by paper, despite gearing of 15 per cent, suggests First Leisure
may be reserving its firepower for something bigger. That will be needed as
the group's dancing and bowling markets mature and its tax rate climbs.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: First Leisure takes a Pounds 20m step into
bingo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST LEISURE, the group that took ten-pin bowling upmarket in the UK, has
finally made its move into bingo.
It has paid Pounds 19.9m for Nudge Leisure, a private company which owns
seven large bingo clubs operating mainly in the Midlands, and intends to
build a national chain of lavishly equipped venues.
The UK market of 1,000 bingo clubs is currently dominated by the Rank
Organisation and Bass, which between them control more than 30 per cent of
the clubs and a bigger share of the total revenue.
The market has long suffered from a dowdy image, being associated with
middle-aged customers playing for low stakes in converted high street
cinemas.
However, in recent years Rank and other operators have developed a new
sector of the market, operating out of purpose-built units with extensive
parking facilities.
Lord Rayne, chairman of First Leisure, said: 'These units are attracting a
new bingo customer who is more affluent and younger than the traditional
target customer.
'It is the possibilities afforded by this structural change that make the
bingo market particularly attractive to us.'
Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group's new bingo division would
grow mainly through the development of large units in main towns, close to
residential areas, but with extensive parking.
All would feature bars, food and gaming machines, which yield high profit
margins.
He expected to spend Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m on each outlet and aimed to open
two or three sites a year - eventually building a chain of 20-30 outlets,
each with capacity of up to 2,000 people.
This would give First Leisure another business of similar size to its three
other core activities - Super Bowls, discotheques and resorts such as the
Blackpool Tower.
Mr Conlan said he had wanted to move into bingo for a long time, but Nudge
was the first opportunity which offered the right size of sites with good
management.
In the year to March, Nudge made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of
Pounds 9.6m, so a maintained performance would enhance the group's earnings
per share.
The new bingo division will be managed by Mr Paul Talboys, 39, who joins
First Leisure from Bass, where he is a senior bingo executive.
The Nudge operation will continue to be run by Mr Peter Williams, who has
managed the company for the last five years and previously worked with Bass
and Mecca.
The acquisition was funded with a vendor placing of 5.65m First Leisure
shares with institutions at 353p by Hill Samuel, with Cazenove as brokers.
The shares closed 1p lower at 364p.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Metrotect sets placing price at 108p for
Pounds 26m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METROTECT Industries announced that the price of its flotation by way of a
placing was to be 108p per share, valuing the pipeline protection products
maker at Pounds 26m.
The shares are being placed on a pro forma p/e of 15. The yield is 4 per
cent, on a notional net dividend for the year to March 31 of 5.51p, which
would be covered 1.7 times by pro forma earnings per share of 5.51p.
The flotation involves a placing of 13.9m shares, representing 57.6 per cent
of the enlarged share capital. As a result of thorough marketing by Panmure
Gordon, the sponsor, the shares are being placed with about 130
institutions.
Some 7.64m shares are being sold by existing shareholders. This includes the
management, which has sold one third of its collective stake and is left
with 20 per cent, and 3i and NatWest Ventures, the institutions which backed
the management in its buy-out from BPB Industries in April 1990. They have
sold half their stakes and are also left with 20 per cent. The shares sold
will raise about Pounds 8.25m of the Pounds 15m raised.
The remaining 6.25m placed shares are new and will repay debt, redeem the
preference shares and A ordinary shares, and provide about Pounds 1m to fund
working capital requirements.
COMMENT
If the price looks high, Metrotect's growth should bring the p/e down. With
such a wide placing, there is likely to be a flurry of activity after the
flotation, before the normal core of 10-15 institutions emerges. On
prospects, the company is keeping its cards close to its chest: analysts are
expecting pre-tax profits for the year to March 1994 to be 15-20 per cent
higher than 1992-93's Pounds 2.28m, itself a surge up from Pounds 679,000
previously. Metrotect is expanding its market share in an expanding pipeline
market and will prosper as long as its market does as well. Keep an eye on
its trading statements.

FT  23 JUN 93 / France closes the gap on Germany: The main talking point in
European bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few months ago, international currency speculators were gunning for
the French franc, marking it out as another weak currency which could be
forced either to devalue within the European exchange rate mechanism - as
the peseta and escudo did - or to float free of the system, like the pound
and the lira.
However, the recent resilience of the franc has enabled the Bank of France
to cut official interest rates nine times in two months, prompting a rally
in the bond market which has narrowed the spread between French government
bond yields and their German counterparts.
Now the big talking point in European government bond markets is whether
French long-term interest rates will slide below those in Germany.
The 10-year yield spread over German bonds has fallen back almost daily to
reach new historic lows.
That the French government bond market has outperformed the German one
recently reflects the relatively better state of the French economy.
'France is sliding into recession, but Germany is much worse off. France has
a strong government whereas Germany's political situation only deteriorates.
French inflation is 200 basis points below German inflation, and although
French bond issuance will hit record levels this year, the fiscal mess is
awesome in Germany,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at
Midland Global Markets.
There are still plenty of investors who expect to see the French bond market
rally continue over the short-term.
Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says: 'We feel further
headway is possible, and that 10-year French yields will be the same as, or
even lower than, German yields in six months' time.
Mr Tim Swadling, a portfolio manager at AMP Asset Management, believes
10-year French yields will 'probably push through to 10-15 basis points
below German ones'.
But the next big question is whether French yields will remain below German
levels for any reasonable length of time.
Mr Swadling does not believe so. 'We've been underweight in the core
European markets - Germany, Belgium and Holland - and we've cut back from
being overweight in France to neutral because the potential is not so great
there now.'
There is already some evidence that investors are reassessing their asset
allocations. Some are taking profits in France and switching into German
bonds in maturities of up to seven years in order to pick up the higher
yield.
'This is a sign that investors expect French rates to remain below those in
Germany,' points out Ms Owens Thomsen. However, she believes that a slight
pick-up in French inflation will, in the longer term, prevent French 10-year
bonds from durably trading through German bonds.
Mr David Gibson, managing director of Schroder International Fixed Income,
predicts that 10-year French yields will go through German yields and that
this will be sustainable 'until it is perceived that Germany has resolved
its (economic) problems'.
Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities, points out that France
has been able to cut interest rates aggressively because of confidence in
the franc and the fact that 'the D-mark is so out of favour at the moment.
'The French economy urgently needs low short-term interest rates, but
whether the French can indefinitely continue to cut to below German levels
without stirring up a hornet's nest is doubtful.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Richemont to reshape its tobacco and luxury interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings, the tobacco and
luxury goods companies, were expected to be suspended from this morning
after an announcement that they were talking with their parent, Richemont,
about a group reorganisation.
The restructuring will lead to two separate companies, one concentrating on
the group's luxury goods such as Cartier, Piaget, Dunhill and Montblanc, the
other focusing on the tobacco interests through Rothmans.
Richemont said that grouping its luxury brands under a single company would
improve marketing opportunities and be more efficient. A previously
considered plan to separately list its luxury goods division, Luxco, was
rejected because of tax problems.
Rothmans' B shares jumped 8 per cent to 720p while Dunhill closed 18 per
cent higher at 405p, after both said they would return their surplus cash to
shareholders as part of the deal.
The reorganisation has been debated for some time by Richemont, the
Swiss-based but South African-controlled holding company set up by Mr Johann
Rupert, managing director.
At present, the group's structure is complicated because Cartier is jointly
held through Richemont and Rothmans International, while Dunhill is 57 per
cent owned by Rothmans.
Richemont would remain majority shareholder in both new companies, and has
proposed the reorganisation be carried out on merger terms. Shareholders in
Rothmans and Dunhill will receive shares in the tobacco and luxury
companies.
Rothmans, which is due to announce annual results on Friday, had net cash of
more than Pounds 300m last year-end, while Dunhill had Pounds 120m of net
cash at its March year-end, equivalent to 71p per share.
Each of the new groups would each be in the form of twinned UK and non-UK
holding companies. Shareholders would receive units representing twinned
shares in the holding companies, which would be listed in London.
The deal may be structured to gain tax benefits in terms of minimising
overseas shareholders' liability to UK advance corporation tax.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Depth of Ferruzzi debt to foreign banks revealed by minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the diversified Italian industrial group, owes foreign banks
L6,500bn (Pounds 2.86bn), Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, told a
parliamentary committee in Rome yesterday.
Mr Barucci warned of the dangers to Italy's credibility in international
financial markets if the crisis at the company were allowed to reach the
proportions of last summer's collapse of the Efim state holding company,
with total debts of more than L15,000bn.
Ferruzzi is one of Italy's most international companies and Mr Barucci said
about 110 foreign banks had lent to the group.
Bankers in Milan suggested the biggest exposure could be among French
institutions. The group controls French-based Eridania Beghin-Say, the
agro-industrial concern formed in 1991-92 from the merger of Italy's
Eridania with Beghin-Say, the French agro-industrial company indirectly
controlled by Ferruzzi.
The spread of Ferruzzi's operations and its voracious financing needs imply
many other leading international banks might have been big lenders.
Mr Barucci sought to calm fears in parliament that the problems at Ferruzzi,
which this month disclosed total group borrowings approaching L31,000bn,
implied a collapse. 'Ferruzzi is Italy's second biggest conglomerate and its
activities touch on strategic areas for the country. It is therefore urgent
to intervene now just in the group's own interest, but especially to avoid
any risk to the credibility of Italy as a whole,' he said.
Stock in the Ferruzzi Finanziaria holding company plunged more than 12 per
cent to L559. Montedison shares fell 2.24 per cent to L874.
Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director of Credito Italiano, said his
bank's exposure was about L1,300bn, AP-DJ reports. In spite of the scale of
Ferruzzi's difficulties he was optimistic about the outcome of the
situation. He said although Ferruzzi hoped to keep control of Eridinia
Beghin-Say, 'everything else is up for sale'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / ACT creates leading software group with BIS purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the Birmingham-based computing services company, yesterday agreed to
pay Pounds 93.5m for BIS Group, a UK subsidiary of the Nynex Worldwide
Services Group.
The deal will create the largest UK-owned computing services and software
company with annual sales of more than Pounds 250m and one of the world's
largest suppliers of financial software.
BIS is a software and services company best known for the 'Midas' software
package used by several hundred banks worldwide. Nynex, a US
telecommunications company with revenues last year of Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds
8.8bn), acquired BIS for Pounds 75m in 1987. It said yesterday that it
expected to recognise a book gain on the transaction.
The disposal reflects Nynex's decision to concentrate on its
telecommunications interests. Mr Fred Salemo, president of the Worldwide
Services Group, said the ACT deal was: 'Good for BIS and good for Nynex.'
Mr Roger Foster, BIS chairman, said the negotiations had been tough, but he
was satisfied with the price.
The cash payment will be partly funded by a 4-for-13 rights issue, at 123p a
share, to raise Pounds 50.9m. The issue is fully underwritten by Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
The rest will come from ACT's own resources. The group - formerly Apricot
Computers - had net cash of about Pounds 25m at its year-end in March.
About Pounds 25m of the payment will be deferred. It will be handed over in
two equal tranches six and 12 months after completion.
The deal reverses the trend of recent years where UK computing services
companies have been sold to buyers either in the US or mainland Europe. EDS
of the US, for example, bought SD-Scicon, while Cap Gemini Sogeti of France
bought Hoskyns.
ACT has been growing rapidly through acquisition, chiefly of financial
services companies. ACT and BIS are rare among European computer companies
in successfully selling packaged software internationally.
The deal and rights issue will be put to ACT's shareholders on July 8.
ACT's share price shed 2p to close at 153p yesterday.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Losses at LET hit Swedish parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the UK property company bought by SPP, the Swedish
insurer three years ago, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 448.6m in 1992.
The loss, one of the largest ever announced by a UK property company,
followed a Pounds 138.1m pre-tax loss for 1991.
The result, which the company blamed on 'adverse economic conditions', was
mainly due to write-downs on development and investment property.
SPP has supported LET with shareholder loans and new capital. Last December,
LET's parent company swapped Pounds 421.1m of debt for equity.
LET's parent company also bought Pounds 47.5m of new shares to allow it to
redeem its preference shares.
The result is an embarrassment for SPP, which has been criticised in Sweden
for its Pounds 491m acquisition of LET in 1990 when the UK property market
had peaked. Heavy losses suffered by Swedish investors and lenders in
overseas property markets have added to the crisis in the Swedish financial
system caused by the collapse of Swedish property values.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 354.5m in the UK; Pounds 20.9m
in continental Europe; and Pounds 73.2m in the US. It had a Pounds 55.3m
write-down on development property, a Pounds 180.9m write-down of investment
property and a Pounds 188.5m share of its associates' losses. The group's
net assets fell from Pounds 694.8m to Pounds 577m.
The losses partially reflect the group's exposure to the development market.
Its projects include proposals to redevelop Birmingham's Bull Ring and a
site in Spitalfields in the City of London.
However the latest report makes it doubtful that LET will develop these
projects. Property development had been scaled down to a point where it was
now incidental, it said.
LET paid a total of Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office. In
February 1992, Mr John Beckwith resigned as chairman. Mr Peter Beckwith, his
brother who took over as chairman, resigned last November. The two brothers,
who founded LET, owned stakes valued at about Pounds 40m each when LET was
taken over.
SPP is part of Trygg-Hansa SPP, which returned to profit in the first four
months of this year, after making heavy losses last year.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Mercury helps C&amp;W rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG growth at Mercury, the UK telecommunications company, helped its
parent Cable and Wireless to increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to
Pounds 824m in the year to March.
C&amp;W also made an exceptional profit of Pounds 118m on the sale of a 20 per
cent stake in Mercury to Bell Canada Enterprises.
Mercury's turnover rose by a third to exceed Pounds 1bn for the first time.
It claims to have secured 10.5 per cent of the UK telecoms market from BT,
against 8.5 per cent a year ago.
At Pounds 3.83bn, group turnover was 22 per cent up on last year's Pounds
3.12bn. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 918m (from Pounds 644m) after
exceptional items, which also included a Pounds 60m gain on the conversion
of warrants acquired in the creation of Hongkong Telecom in 1988, and an
Pounds 83m charge for the write-down of undersea cables.
Lord Young, C&amp;W's chairman, said group strategy was based on expanding from
its three 'hubs' of western Europe, Asia/Pacific (where it has a majority
stake in Hongkong Telecom), and the Caribbean (where operations include a 79
per cent stake in Telecoms of Jamaica).
'Strategic partnerships will come to shape our industry. We intend to
develop clusters around our three hubs, building on the critical mass we
already have in the three regions,' he said.
Asia-Pacific remains easily the largest of C&amp;W's three regions. Turnover
there was Pounds 1.7bn, up 20 per cent, with operating profits 16 per cent
higher at Pounds 563m. Hongkong Telecom benefited from a 26.5 per cent
increase in international call volume.
In the UK, Mercury's assault on the small business and domestic markets,
previously virtual BT monopolies, mostly accounted for the 50 per cent
increase in ordered lines over the year. At the end of March Mercury had
474,000 lines for residential customers and 535,000 for small businesses,
compared with 67,000 for the two sectors combined four years ago.
Before exceptional items, operating profit in the Caribbean region increased
by 11 per cent. C&amp;W blamed slower growth on continuing US recession.
At March 31 C&amp;W's gearing stood at 13.2 per cent, down from 25.9 per cent
last year.
A final dividend of 10.1p per share was declared, making a total of 14.85p,
against 13.25p. Earnings per share rose from 30.1p to 47.5p. Excluding
exceptionals, earnings were 38.8p per share, up 6 per cent.
C&amp;W's shares closed 13p up at 777p. The company plans a one-for-one share
split, to improve the shares' marketability.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By any standards, the 86 per cent take-up of Zeneca's rights issue must be
judged a success. This is all the more so, given the sagging share price
during the underwriting period. Since the underwriters and shareholders were
much the same institutions, the issue was always an all-or-nothing affair.
The overlap also left the company to sell the Pounds 1.3bn issue twice over.
That may ultimately limit the capacity of the London market to handle large
issues in the traditional way.
A US-style book building might relieve the problem of capacity created by
such a large issue, but is difficult to square with investors' pre-emption
rights. As GPA might testify, book building does not offer much certainty as
to the proceeds of the issue. But the success of Zeneca's issue does not
hide the limitations of traditional underwriting. If rights issues get much
bigger, the system may require refining.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 8 per cent rise in Rothmans International's shares and a corresponding
18 per cent leap in those of Dunhill Holdings suggests the UK market has
high hopes for Richemont's proposed restructuring, despite the somewhat
botched manner in which it was announced. The Stock Exchange was surely
right to suspend both shares given Richemont's distressingly vague
statement.
There is certainly a managerial argument for re-organising Richemont's
cascading shareholdings into two discrete industrial groups with separate
listings. The previous objection was the ostensibly punitive tax
implications. But the establishment of twinned UK and non-UK holding
companies may permit Richemont to skirt such difficulties. This should also
allow Rothmans and Dunhill to distribute surplus cash to shareholders more
efficiently. With some Pounds 900m of cash in the bank, Rothmans' largesse
could be considerable.
The fusing of Dunhill and Cartier - in which Richemont and Rothmans both
have stakes - would create an attractive international business. The
reshaping of Rothmans will leave it as a pure tobacco company supported by
enhanced dividend prospects.

<TEXT>
The Frankfurt stock market seems undaunted by the deepening recession and
the reluctance of the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. The DAX index is
again pushing up towards 1,700 despite a forward multiple, based on DB
Research projections, of 20 times next year's earnings. Part of the impetus
has come from foreign investors who have been trying to correct underweight
positions in German equities. Such a technical motivation, though, still
requires a belief that the market has further to go
There is a general expectation that a large swing in earnings could occur
between this year and next if only because restructuring provisions will
drop away. Judging by its cash-flow multiple, which excludes the effect of
such provisions, the market does not look so expensive.
But that argument holds good only if recovery is fairly quick and sustained.
The trouble is that German companies cannot have their Kuchen and eat it.
The weaker the currency - and the more there is talk of Germany losing its
anchor status in the ERM - the less the Bundesbank will feel inclined to
implement the monetary relaxation needed to pull the economy out of
recession.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the self-regulatory structures put in place during the 1980s, the
policing of Lloyd's insurance market has proved the least satisfactory. The
sheer scale of yesterday's losses lends support to such a claim. But Lloyd's
is also a uniquely opaque marketplace. As Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's
chairman, admits, not even its management has a firm grip on the figures.
Faced with such a paucity of information, and without a price mechanism for
guidance, individual Names have been left in the not always capable hands of
market professionals.
The proposed reform of the agency system - with more emphasis on syndicate
analysis - should help improve the quality of information available to
investors. The introduction of corporate members might also provide
individual Names with useful signals as market conditions change. But that
is no substitute for effective supervision. Lloyd's answer is to split the
regulatory and commercial functions of its council, and promise a more
vigorous approach to regulation. That echoes the approach championed for the
wider City last month by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and
Investments Board. In both cases, this may be the last chance to make
self-regulation work.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Cable's Chinese puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless has pearls scattered around the world, but somehow lacks
a thread to pull them all together. Hong Kong Telecom is a great property,
despite the tightening of price regulation and the advent of competition in
1995. Last year, international call volumes grew by 26 per cent. Longer term
prospects for Asian telephony growth are remarkable, with China alone aiming
to install capacity equivalent to three times that of BT by the turn of the
century.
Mercury is now attacking the UK market on several fronts with the
'one-two-one' cellular service a threat to both Vodafone's profit margins
and BT's domestic customer base. Combined with cable tv, easy access to
Mercury via the BT network and direct connection of larger customers,
Mercury's market share will grow despite increasing competition for premium
customers.
Other franchises such as Telecommunications of Jamaica are valuable niches.
That said, Cable's stated ambition of using the Caribbean as a hub for
operations in the western hemisphere looks a little fanciful. The company
wants to take minority equity stakes in businesses around its hubs and
provide value-added services to customers worldwide. Yet it is a relatively
small player in the global telecoms market and needs to focus its efforts
carefully. The management has yet to convince that it can do so. And if the
12 per cent dividend rise is a guide to expected long-term earnings
prospects, the market will have to decide what sort of premium rating that
prospect can command.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Top EBRD official accuses Attali of misleading him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RON FREEMAN, first vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, has taken the offensive in an increasingly heated battle
over top management changes at the bank by accusing Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD
president, of misleading him.
He made the allegation at a meeting on Monday of the EBRD's finance
committee, when he also accused Mr Attali of ignoring an instruction from
the chairman of the bank's governors, Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance
minister, to delay discussion of the reorganisation proposal.
At a meeting yesterday of the bank's directors, who represent countries and
agencies which own the bank, Mr Attali made it clear he was pressing ahead
with plans for two new senior vice-presidencies. This change would have the
effect of demoting Mr Freeman from number two to number four at the bank.
Mr Freeman told the meeting on Monday he felt he had been misled over the
past few months. Those present had the impression he was referring mainly to
being misled by Mr Attali about the reorganisation plan. 'We got the sense
that he felt he had been betrayed in other respects as well,' said a bank
executive, who called Mr Freeman's outburst 'astonishing'.
Mr Attali is also proposing that the EBRD's merchant banking department,
responsible for making investments in private sector projects in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, should be merged with the development
banking department, which is in charge of infrastructure projects.
They would be headed by a new chief operating officer, likely to be Mr
Ernest Stern, currently number two at the World Bank.
Mr Freeman has taken steps to increase his control of the merchant banking
department. He has sent out a message to all members of the department
stating that he has relieved Mr Guy de Selliers of his 'responsibility of
serving as my deputy for the time being'.
He said Mr de Selliers would remain responsible for the project work for
which he is assigned, but merchant bank team leaders would no longer report
to him.
Mr de Selliers yesterday sent out a memo saying he would like to go on
working for Mr Freeman and enjoying his trust, but that he had also worked
closely with and enjoyed the trust of Mr Attali. The memo says taking sides
would mean betraying the trust of Mr Freeman or Mr Attali.
Mr Attali's plan has received support from senior finance officials of the
G7 group of industrial countries. However, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, has been warned in a letter from Mr Claiborne Pell, chairman of
the Senate foreign relations committee, that under US law Mr Pell must be
consulted before any changes in EBRD vice-presidencies are put into effect.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Employer demand for graduates shows signs of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND from employers for this year's crop of college leavers has suddenly
increased after a slow start in the autumn, according to recruiters and
graduate careers services.
The Central Services Unit, the body which collects statistics from college
careers offices, said it had seen 'a small but discernible upturn being
notified' over the past six weeks.
There had also been a number of late bookings by employers for the round of
summer recruitment fairs, it said. Figures on demand are due to be released
at the end of the month.
The Association of Graduate Recruiters, representing recruiting employers,
echoed the CSU's findings. Ms Kate Tyzack, AGR chairman and recruitment
manager for Marks and Spencer, said the situation was 'very fast-moving and
positive' for graduates seeking jobs.
M&amp;S has decided to take on an extra 100 graduates this year, after
originally calculating that it would only need a total of 150. In 1991 the
company froze graduate appointments after having already offered jobs to 100
candidates - 70 went on to join the company the following year.
Ms Tyzack said this year's graduate intake had been increased because of the
difficulty of recruiting A-level entrants. More sixth-formers were going on
to higher education, rather than seeking jobs, she said.
As a result of reorganisation, M&amp;S also wanted to increase the number of
middle managers in stores.
Abbey National, the bank, said it was increasing its graduate recruitment to
100 places, from 75-80 in previous years. This was mainly because it was
moving into new business areas, such as insurance, and because of the upturn
in the housing market.
Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse, accounting and consultancy firms which
have traditionally been large recruiters of graduates, said intake was
'stable' this year. Arthur Andersen plans to take on 330 graduates and said
it was feeling 'generally more bullish' about taking on staff.
Price Waterhouse is recruiting about 420 graduates this year - about the
same number as in the past two years.

FT  23 JUN 93 / US increases duties on steel from 19 countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday significantly increased many of the
preliminary duties it imposed in January on Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) of
imported steel products from 19 countries.
The tariffs, which have been collected and held in escrow since January,
will only become final if the US International Trade Commission rules that
imports injure the US industry. A finding is scheduled for July 27.
Cockerill Sambre of Belgium sustained one of the largest increases when its
duty on hot-rolled steel soared from less than 5 per cent to just over 62
per cent. The duty on hot-rolled steel from France's Usinor-Sacilor leapt
from 12.4 per cent to nearly 80 per cent and the tariff on Japan's
hot-rolled steel jumped from 26.7 per cent to 40.2 per cent.
The new tariff levels ranged as high as 109.22 per cent on British Steel
plate. British Steel last night said the duty was so high because it had
decided not to participate in Washington's anti-dumping investigation. The
US was not a large market for British Steel plate.
However the steelmaker is still unhappy about the countervailing duty on
flat products, in spite of a reduction in the duty from the preliminary 19
per cent to 9.7 per cent.
'British Steel does not benefit from any subsidies to the former British
Steel Corporation, and we will be asking the European Commission to
challenge this through the Gatt,' it said.
The findings came on 72 dumping and subsidy cases, which were filed last
year against producers of flat-rolled steel, after efforts to negotiate a
multilateral steel agreement collapsed.
They come at a particularly sensitive time, with the US, EC, Japan and
Canada embarked on critical talks in Tokyo which they hope will resuscitate
the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The steel findings are considered by US officials to be separated from
politics. However, US trading partners say the findings are almost always in
favour of US industry.
To buttress their case for injury, American steel producers are arguing that
they have been damaged by deals between EC, Japanese and South Korean
cartels, which divert cheap steel into the 'open' US market.
The UK government last night condemned the US move, saying it would join its
EC partners in raising the 'unfair and unjustified' action at Gatt.
Earlier, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, accused
the US of using imports 'as a whipping boy for problems arising largely from
domestic competition within the US'.
The EC had voluntarily restrained its steel exports to the US for 10 years
on 'the clear understanding that this would settle any question of duties or
injury covering that period', he said.
Sir Leon said the Community, which had already challenged the US methodology
in countervailing duty cases through Gatt, might take other challenges to
dispute settlement panels.
Several trade analysts agreed that there were numerous market-sharing deals
between producers, but said it was irrelevant to the US case for injury.

Twenty odd years in New York is a long time for a German banker. Obviously
something of the American entrepreneurial spirit has rubbed off on Barthold
von Ribbentrop who is quitting Deutsche Bank, after a 22-year stint, the
bulk of it in North America, to set up his own investment fund.
'I think at my age it's still not too late to have another go at doing
something entrepreneurial' the 52-year-old son of the Third Reich foreign
minister said cheerfully yesterday as he enunciated plans for his new
investment vehicle that is to concentrate on medium-sized German companies.
Returning from the Big Apple in 1986, he discloses one of his most valuable
roles, in building the bank's securities operation, was sitting firmly upon
endeavours to buy up (unnamed) stockbrokers in London and elsewhere. 'This
would have been a total disaster' he says with refreshing honesty.
Just one step away from a board position, one of the most prestigious
possible trophies in corporate Germany, he was in no mood to admit to any
tinge of regret yesterday. 'The money may be better but the job is awful'.

Odd how the owners of some of the country's ugliest buildings see themselves
as stewards of the nation's artistic heritage.
For one, the UK's biggest industrial landlord, Slough Estates, is running a
poetry competition about the aesthetic merits of Slough to redress the
injury inflicted on the town by Betjeman's 'disgraceful' poem.
For another, British Land - owner of a motley collection of supermarkets,
offices, and trading estates - bedecks its latest annual report with Ben
Nicholson pictures and purple prose.
Drawing a parallel between Nicholson's avant-garde work and the company's
portfolio, the document intones: 'through the work that illustrates this
report we sense his concern for observation and discernment, his feeling of
balance and proportion - qualities that British Land regards highly in its
own portfolio.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roll on July 14 when the third and final sale of BT shares will bring to an
end the appalling TV adverts for the offer featuring the bumbling Inspector
Morose played by comedian Mel Smith. Dreamt up by advertising agency WCRS,
the BT3 campaign is (for anyone fortunate enough to have missed it thus far)
a weak parody of Thames TV's Inspector Morse series, based on Colin Dexter's
opera-loving detective.
Actually, Observer can put viewers out of their misery even sooner by
revealing how the whole thing ends. The mystery share-buyer turns out to be
none other than John Thaw, the actor who plays Inspector Morse in 'real
life'. The showdown is in the south of France, scene of Thaw's
poorly-received appearance in another TV series, Peter Mayle's A Year in
Provence.
Do hope this little bit of inside information doesn't result in the BT3
issue staging an equally spectacular flop.

Meanwhile London Business School's long hunt for its first professor and
assistant professor in business ethics has at last been resolved, but only
after some embarrassment for the selectors.
The problem seems to have been a dearth of ethical academics. In its
eagerness to draw on the best expertise in compiling the shortlist, the
committee originally recruited the highly-respected Jesuit Jack Mahoney as
external adviser. It then realised that the vital missing name was Mahoney
himself, who - whilst not involved in his own selection in any way -
yesterday became the anointed one for the professorship.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Observer: The empire bites back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What must ex-Lonrho chieftain Terry Robinson be making of the decision by
his present masters, the Vesteys, to look for a new chief executive as well
as a chief financial officer for their empire?
That's not to say the move is unwarranted. Faced with similar problems, most
big family companies would have sent for outside help long ago. Moreover
Robinson himself was imported 18 months ago to save the empire's biggest
province, the Union International meat business.
Perhaps because he is doing such a good job, the Vestey cousins Edmund and
Sam have decided that what they need now is a professional top boss coupled
with a financial panjandrum to head a new management company which will
oversee Robinson's business, their shipping interests and any other family
silver lying to hand.
While Robinson's name has not been ruled out, the Vesteys intend to search
high and low for the right person to take overall control. So perhaps
Robinson has been too sharply critical of the family regime to be deemed a
trusted retainer.
Be that as it may, the summoning of headhunters seems to have killed young
Tim Vestey's chances of automatically inheriting the top job on his return
from Cranfield Business school.
The new job has its attractions. After all, the empire has a Pounds 1.5bn
turnover and any chief executive will be well rewarded. There is even a hint
that the Vesteys might want to unlock some of their wealth via a stock
market float one day.
The downside is that the business owes its bankers much money. Running a
family business is never a dream of ease, especially when the owners don't
always see eye to eye. And in this case, if Robinson feels he is being
undermined, it could be a nightmare.

FT  23 JUN 93 / An uphill task for earthlings: The Rio Earth Summit offered
inspiration, but it ignored some vital issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
One year after the Rio Earth Summit, the world's most ambitious attempt to
address global environmental issues, ministers from more than 50 countries
have the opportunity to assess its legacy.
In New York today, they will hold the first meeting of the United Nations
Commission for Sustainable Development, which is intended to help turn the
summit's principles into reality.
The summit's long-term impact is hard to judge, because recession has pushed
the environment down the political agenda in many countries. The past year
has, however, justified the warning of Mr Maurice Strong, Rio's organiser,
that 'we simply cannot save the world in a one-shot quick-fix conference'.
Progress towards many of the specific targets set by the summit has been
slow, although Rio has won credit for changing attitudes in both developing
and industrialised countries. And pressing questions remain about whether
Rio's aims - from international treaties to raising environmental awareness
 -were the right ones.
Rio produced two main treaties - a framework convention on climate change to
help curb the threat of global warming, and a biological diversity
convention to help preserve the number and distribution of the world's
species.
Twenty-six countries have ratified the climate change convention out of the
166 that signed it. These countries, including three of the biggest present
or future emitters of gases - the US, China and Japan - are committed to
producing plans within a year for curbing 'greenhouse gases'. The total
number may seem small, but the convention will become international law when
50 have ratified; up to another 44 countries, including the UK, expect to
ratify later this year.
That tally is better than some critics of Rio feared in its immediate
aftermath. The target may have helped focus minds - several countries are
well advanced in plans for curbing the gases, particularly carbon dioxide.
Governments have found energy taxes particularly attractive - for instance,
the UK brought in new fuel taxes in the March Budget. Environmentalists
argue that such taxes are better at raising money than at persuading people
to use less energy.
But there have been recent signs that momentum on the climate change
convention is flagging. The Clinton administration is modifying its proposal
for a nationwide energy tax in the face of congressional opposition. The
European Community is also embroiled in a long-running dispute between
member countries on the feasibility of an energy tax weighted towards fuels
with the highest carbon content.
The biodiversity convention has encountered similar problems. One of Rio's
dramas was the refusal of the US under President George Bush to sign it. The
administration's objections stemmed apparently from the potential threat to
the US biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries, but it was alone among
the leading industrialised nations in opposing it.
Three weeks ago the Clinton administration, which has made much of its
'green' intentions, finally added its name. But of the 168 countries which
have signed, only 20 have ratified, including only four that are
particularly rich in species - China, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. The treaty
still needs another nine ratifications before it can come into force.
One of the difficulties in implementing the conventions has been funding.
The World Bank's Global Environment Facility, set up in 1990 to help
developing countries finance environmentally beneficial projects, is
currently supporting more than 100 projects.
However, the facility has faltered on two counts: first, international
wrangling over the criteria used to pick projects; second, its budget is
small compared with its aims - the Dollars 1.3bn pledged by World Bank donor
countries for its three-year pilot phase has nearly gone. In Beijing last
month, some 60 participants in the facility estimated that it would need
from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 4bn over the next three to five years.
Apart from the two flagship conventions, a host of broader, but less
specific, measures was agreed at Rio: a statement of aims for forests, a
declaration of environmental principles, and the Agenda 21 action plan - an
800-page plan for achieving global 'sustainable development'. The task of
turning these high-minded but ill-defined proposals into environmental
improvement falls to the new Commission for Sustainable Development.
While today's inaugural meeting of the commission seeks to do no more than
set up reporting procedures and administration, some observers are sceptical
that it can live up to its wide remit. One close observer of the
preparations says: 'They are already arguing over tiny phrases within
sub-clauses - it's just like Rio all over again.' But other officials and
advisers report a 'refreshing' and unexpected absence, so far, of the
north-south divides that characterised much of the Rio debate.
Some feel that the apparent narrowing of the gap between north and south in
the past year reflects a change in underlying attitudes since Rio.
Mr Richard Sandbrook, director of the International Institute for
Environment and Development, an independent think-tank, says: 'Rio's effect
on governments is remarkable. It has changed attitudes in developing
countries more than in the OECD. A lot of them, such as Zimbabwe and
Pakistan, are drawing up sustainable development plans in a way they would
not have done before.'
By setting a precedent for international consensus, the Rio conventions may
have helped push through last November's international treaty, agreed in
Copenhagen, on curbing damage to the ozone layer.
Mr Chris Hampson, a board director of ICI, the UK chemicals group, and a
former member of the UK's recently disbanded Advisory Council on Business
and the Environment, which was set up by the Department of the Environment,
argues that Rio also brought about a change in businesses' approach to the
environment. 'It was the first international conference in which business
was brought in officially. It recognised that in the end business will have
to deliver the goods,' he says.
Despite such endorsements, the question of whether Rio had the right
priorities remains. Climate change still heads many governments' lists of
environmental concerns, and environmental groups report considerable public
support for the issue. But biodiversity questions have been partly eclipsed,
at least in the public mind, by recent battles over commercial whaling.
US and UK government officials also say privately that Rio's emphasis on
sustainable development and the third world is remote from the public's
environmental priorities, which tend to focus on conservation of the
countryside. Several academic economists have taken a tilt at the notion of
sustainable development promoted by Rio. They argue that the concept is
confused, given that any economic activity uses up some irreplaceable
resources.
Most important, perhaps, is that in the past year it has become clear that
Rio ducked several environmental issues which will dominate the next decade.
It had almost nothing to say on the growing conflict between proponents of
free trade and environmental regulation. Such battles have come to the fore
recently, for example, in the US's dispute with the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs about whether it can ban imports of Mexican tuna fish.
Rio was likewise reticent on the subject of population growth and birth
control, for fear that controversy would scupper the whole conference. Last
week, Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, chose to devote much of his Rio
anniversary speech to these topics.
The limitations of Rio's agenda do not mean that its impact should be
dismissed. At the very least, by gathering together ministers from more than
100 countries, it established the principle that some environmental issues
are global and urgent, requiring international co-operation at the highest
governmental level.
But the record so far of the Rio signatories in devising practical answers
to problems of climate change and biodiversity is mixed. Rio called for
long-term solutions to long-term questions, but both its supporters and
critics want to know how long they should wait. On its first anniversary,
Rio offers inspiration for tackling the planet's environmental problems, but
has not yet produced solutions.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Personal View: An antidote to financial distress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR BRIAN UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Against a back-ground of profound changes in recent years in the scope and
nature of government involvement in economic activities, the idea of a
partnership between government, banking and business to help stimulate
economic recovery is gaining increasing attention. Such a partnership was
recently advocated by Brian Pearse, Midland Bank chief executive (Personal
View, May 14), as being capable of addressing three key areas where
financial distress is most likely to affect small enterprises. These were
their overdependence on short-term, fickle and often expensive liabilities,
the shortage of equity funds and long-term debt, and their vulnerable cash
flows.
This idea of a partnership, in the grey area where there is still scope for
private initiative and public involvement to come closely together, echoes
one of the themes debated at the meeting of European heads of state in
Edinburgh last December. On that occasion, there was a unanimous recognition
both of the need to alleviate the impact of the recession on small
businesses and of the fact that this would be more efficiently and
economically achieved through a pooling of public and private initiatives
and resources.
As a consequence, on top of temporary measures designed to stimulate
economic growth, it was decided to create the European Investment Fund
(EIF), an alliance among Europe's banks, the European Commission and the
European Investment Bank (EIB). Initially, the main activity of the EIF will
be to provide loan guarantees both to European small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and to trans-European networks projects, the latter
mostly in the fields of telecommunications, transport and energy. At a later
stage, the interventions of the EIF may be extended to include equity
finance.
The initial subscribed capital of the EIF will be Ecu2bn (about Pounds 1.6bn
at current exchange rates), of which 30 per cent is to be supplied by
European banks, 30 per cent by the Commission and 40 per cent by the EIB.
The amounts of investments and commitments the EIF can take on could
eventually be as much as eight times its subscribed capital, or some Pounds
12.8bn worth of guarantees and investments.
The EIF's activities will be conducted entirely on the basis of market
principles, and will include the duty to seek an adequate remuneration to
the capital employed by its shareholders. The necessary preparatory work is
well under way, and we hope to start operations by year-end.
Though not the first attempt at marrying private financial institutions with
public agencies (a few similar cases have successfully been implemented in
the US in the field of mortgage guarantees for residential housing), it is
nonetheless an innovation in the European financial landscape. The
expectation is that it could go some way towards alleviating two enduring
market 'failures', or 'market needs'.
The first of these market failures is the lack of long-term guarantee
mechanisms capable of drawing sufficient private funds to the infrastructure
projects so vital to a well-functioning European single market. This will be
the main area of activity of the EIF, at least in its initial phase.
There are two main objectives. One will be to facilitate an increased
involvement of traditional providers of funds, such as banks, by reducing
their capital requirements or transferring risk exposures.
The other will be to attract new investors by relieving them of certain
types of project risks or by adding liquidity to the financial claims
backing infrastructure projects. Either way, the intervention of the EIF
would aim at enhancing existing market mechanisms and widening the pool of
funds directed at these projects.
The second market need that the EIF will try to address is the thin and
often highly volatile flow of long-term debt and equity funds to Europe's
small companies, a key component of the Community's productive sector. Here,
the EIF would complement the existing public loan guarantee schemes and
other market mechanisms by offering loan guarantees to financing facilities
which support investments by SMEs. It would thereby ease smaller companies'
access to long-term finance, and make available better and cheaper terms and
conditions.
To pick up Brian Pearse's theme again, the EIF will represent exactly the
kind of co-operative action between government, banks and businesses that he
advocates. In taking it forward, the EC member states and the founding
members of the EIF will aim to help get Europe's economies back on their
feet and make them better able to respond to the competitive challenges of
increasingly open world markets.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Risk at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLIGHTED LIVES, dashed hopes, wrecked health and happiness: after any great
boom comes the reckoning. The boom at Lloyd's in the 1980s was
proportionately as great, in terms of reckless overcapacity, as in any of
the world's financial markets. The tragedies are those of gullible people
sucked into a bubble.
Lloyd's victims feel a special bitterness. Membership of the society was too
often offered as a privilege of friendship, not a commercial investment. The
bitterness of this legacy, and the litigation to which it has given rise, is
one of Lloyd's most pressing problems.
Unless it is resolved, it poisons the market's chances of building on the
sharp recovery in the underlying conditions of business reported at
yesterday's AGM. It will prevent the large-scale influx of new capital,
probably in a corporate, limited-liability form, on which Lloyd's future
depends.
The losses of the worst-hit groups of syndicates, those where Names have the
best chance of making a legal case against the former managers, run to at
least Pounds 1.8bn. Where can the money be found to settle these claims out
of court? One possible source is the funds available in the E&amp;O syndicates -
the insurers who would bear the cost of any proven misconduct by managers -
which for these syndicates are put at Pounds 700m-Pounds 900m.
The E&amp;O insurers would obviously seek to avoid paying out this much, and a
contribution from Lloyd's central funds would also be necessary. The Lloyd's
management appears to be hoping to keep any such contribution, effectively a
levy on the general membership, below Pounds 100m.
So the chances of a settlement revolve around how much the E&amp;O insurers can
be pushed into paying, how much more Lloyd's is prepared to pay from central
funds, and the proportion of the losses which the Names are to bear. This
crude arithmetic suggests that a deal to pay, say, 50p in every pound of
these syndicates' losses is just about achievable, if the Names can be
persuaded to settle for such a figure.
If they cannot, or if the funds run short even at this level, Lloyd's may
find itself pressed to re-examine the options it has fiercely rejected -
levying an extra entry fee on would-be corporate investors; or borrowing
against future profits to pay off past losses.
The stakes are high. Without a solution, Lloyd's may be unable to trade its
way back to prosperity and a secure future. Lloyd's deserves the best
efforts of its managers and members in the crucial phase of negotiations
over the settlement that lie ahead. Meanwhile, down in the Caribbean, the
hurricane season is starting. A string of natural disasters, depleting the
market's capital, would greatly hamper the task of finding the money for a
settlement. The odds are very finely balanced.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: BTU tax RIP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENERGY tax which President Clinton announced in February was that rare
thing: a tax that would raise money and improve economic efficiency at the
same time. Four months of special pleading later, the chances that it will
do either are fading fast. Mr Clinton's difficulties hold important lessons
for governments chasing the same prize.
When first unveiled, the BTU (British thermal unit) tax was the cornerstone
of Mr Clinton's deficit-cutting package, intended to raise Dollars 72bn over
five years. The final version has yet to emerge from Congress. But the idea
of taxing fuels on their thermal content has already been dropped. So too
has the revenue figure, now likely to be some two-thirds lower. What went
wrong?
As with much of the Clinton plan, the BTU tax began life as a careful
compromise, less green - and trickier to collect - than the carbon tax the
purists would have wanted, but apparently more likely to survive.
Unfortunately, the horse trading did not end there. Both efficiency and
clarity of purpose were the losers.
Increasing the price of fuels with a tax improves economic efficiency to the
extent that it makes people pay the full social cost of using the fuel. Not
all fuels impose the same costs. If a tax is to capture the differences
between them, it must be shamelessly selective, hurting some energy users
more than others. The problem is finding a way to sell such a seemingly
capricious tax. As Mr Clinton discovered, the result can be a costly mess.
Complicated taxes are usually the result of pinning several distinct aims to
a single mast. In the case of the BTU tax, Mr Clinton tried to meet an
environmental objective, while giving into the demands of 'dirty' fuel
lobbies and holding on to future revenues. The predictable result was an
exemption-ridden monstrosity, too complicated to collect or, indeed, to
defend. When he abandoned the BTU tax altogether on June 9, it was a mercy
killing.
Finding a replacement seems just a local US difficulty. Some kind of
generalised fuel levy is likely, along with further budget cuts to make up
the revenue shortfall. Both are clearly desirable in their own right. For
environmentalists, however, a uniform tax is a blunt instrument, since it
fails to match tax paid to relative damage done.
This is why non-Americans should pause. There may be little new in the sight
of yet another US president trying to introduce the kind of fuel taxes which
have long been accepted in other OECD countries. But Mr Clinton began on a
fresher path, which many in Japan and the EC wish to follow. His ambition
was to combine an environmentally nuanced idea of efficiency with cutting
the budget deficit. After the death of the BTU tax, governments may well
wonder whether both can be tackled at once.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Leading Article: A global test for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEST's disarray in the face of Bosnian and Somali bloodshed has not
facilitated Germany's efforts to inch towards a new role in foreign policy.
In 1990, German politicians spoke persuasively of the need to fulfil the
country's weightier post-unity responsibilities. Above all, they started to
search for a legal and political mechanism to allow the German army to take
part in peace-keeping missions outside Nato.
Three years later, Bonn is still looking for a means of carrying out this
goal in a way which commands a domestic consensus and which is practical. It
is in the interest of Germany and of the rest of the world that this aim is
accomplished. Unless it can participate fully in peace actions launched by
the United Nations, Nato, or the European Community, Bonn will not be able
to play the international political part justified by its economic stature.
The hearings yesterday at the constitutional court over Bonn's dispatch of
troops for the UN mission in Somalia highlight Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
difficulties. Discomfited by the US-led attacks in Mogadishu earlier this
month, the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are undertaking emergency
action to try to overturn the decision to send 1,700 German troops to east
Africa. The UN secretary general will tell Mr Kohl in Bonn today that the
Bundeswehr's presence in western Somalia is vital.
The constitutional judges seem likely to dismiss the SPD's arguments. Two
months ago, they turned down a similar bid to withdraw German airmen from
Nato aircraft enforcing the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia. However, Mr Kohl's
government is still immersed in wearisome negotiations over constitutional
changes to clarify the overall legal framework for Bundeswehr deployment.
The decisive element in this juridical quagmire is likely to be the question
of political will. Mindful of the constitutional limits, Mr Kohl's
government has, sensibly, been extremely cautious in using the country's
armed forces in the Bosnian and Somali conflicts. However, in other
policy-making fields, Bonn's stance has been less restrained.
German pressure was the main reason for the EC's rash decision to recognise
Croatia in December 1991. Yesterday, Mr Kohl called for the EC to lift its
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, risking yet another EC split.
Meanwhile, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has ruffled feathers in
the UK and France by suggesting that Germany should become a permanent
member of the UN security council. These ill-judged actions cannot be
ignored when they come from a government as important as Germany's. This
makes it all the more important that Bonn should adjust its constitutional
and political framework in line with its international responsibilities.
Germany's willingness to place its military at the service of the
international community is a concrete test of this process.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Kiev's hollow victory: Tough choices facing Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 10-day miners' strike in eastern Ukraine has ended, but for the
Ukrainian government it is a pyrrhic victory. To get the miners back to
work, it offered them a package of wage increases and coal price subsidies
which ministers admit could push the country into hyperinflation by the
autumn.
The sharp deterioration in the economy threatens not just the stability of
Ukraine, the second most populous former Soviet republic. It also has
implications for the region. Relations between Ukraine and Russia are
already tense: several disputes between the two following the break-up of
the Soviet Union are unresolved. A deterioration in Kiev's relations with
the large and restless Russian-speaking population in its industrial eastern
region could fuel tension with Moscow.
In contrast to Kiev's failure to implement economic reforms, one political
goal has been effectively pursued: President Leonid Kravchuk's aim of
bolstering Ukraine as an independent state by creating its own army. In the
past two years, Ukraine has built an army of half a million soldiers, armed
with sophisticated conventional weapons produced in the former Soviet Union.
Further, Ukraine could be on the brink of becoming a nuclear power. It is
likely the government will choose to retain, at least temporarily, some of
the 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles on its territory.
But while Ukraine may be growing stronger militarily, its economy is
increasingly impoverished. The main reason for its decline is the central
bank's runaway printing press. Under pressure from Russia, which felt
Ukraine was exporting inflation, Kiev introduced its own independent
currency, the coupon. So far, the coupon's brief life has been a disaster.
Since January, the currency has plunged to only a sixth of its value against
the dollar and, even before this week's hand-out to the miners, inflation
was running at more than 30 per cent a month.
The economic outlook is likely to worsen. To appease the miners, the
government promised a package worth 13 trillion coupons, a figure equal to
nearly half the tax revenues Kiev expects to collect this year. The
subsidies come on top of the 2 trillion coupons the Ukrainian parliament
agreed to pay to the agricultural sector last week.
Announcing the payments, Mr Ivan Illin, deputy minister of finance, pointed
out that 'agreeing with the miners' demands will lead to a 15-fold increase
in consumer prices. This is hyperinflation'.
Stagflation - inflation and recession simultaneously - might be a more
accurate description. As the value of Ukraine's money has fallen, so has its
output. Western economists estimate that national output overall fell by 16
per cent last year. Among the largest sectors, industrial production
declined 10 per cent while there was an 11 per cent fall in agriculture,
Ukraine's traditional mainstay, accounting for about a fifth of national
ouput.
Industry has been hit by Ukraine's lack of competitiveness on world markets;
a collapse in trade with Ukraine's traditional partners in the former Soviet
Union, and a collapse in military orders since the union disintegrated.
Though combined inflation and recession are no strangers to the
post-communist economies of eastern Europe, Ukraine's crisis is especially
notable since it has not even begun the fundamental reform - such as that
undertaken in neighbouring Poland - that might hold out hope of recovery.
Recession and a leap in prices in Poland were the short-term pain dictated
by the transition to a market economy. In contrast, Ukraine's feuding
government has introduced a patchwork of policies which have disrupted the
old, centrally planned economy but failed to create a market system to
replace it.
Some prices have been freed, but controls on many others remain. As a
result, although consumers have suffered price rises typical of the 'shock
therapy' approach to reforms, prices for agricultural goods remain
artificially low compared with those for manufactured products. This
disparity has left farms so impoverished that the government has little
choice but to grant agricultural credits or risk allowing Ukraine's fields
lie fallow.
Home-grown economic woes are exacerbated by the country's dependence on
subsidised Russian fuel.
Russia is increasing its oil prices to match those on world markets. This,
coupled with an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to conduct all trade at
world prices by the end of the year, means Ukraine faces a balance of
payments gap of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn this year.
Ukraine's main hope of recovering from its economic malaise is rapidly to
implement a combination of tighter monetary policy and structural reforms,
such as lifting price controls, subsidies and embarking on privatisation. Mr
Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, who says he backs such a strategy, has been
unable to get reform under way because of his battle with the president and
parliament over who should be running the country.
If Kiev were to demonstrate its commitment to economic change, it could
expect western financial assistance, particularly to help cover its trade
deficit. An IMF programme tailored to do that was in the pipeline, but the
internecine conflict in Kiev which erupted in May halted the negotiations
and delayed indefinitely the delivery of IMF assistance.
The political battle in Kiev is one reason the government has failed to
implement reform. Another is that, as the miners' strike demonstrated,
Ukraine is a fragile young nation, with a weak sense of national identity.
The government is paying subsidies to unprofitable industries in part
because it wants to keep the country together: it fears that widespread
closures could undermine the loyalty of millions of mainly Russian-speaking
Ukrainians in the east.
The black-faced, red-hatted miners know the government is in a quandary. But
Kiev cannot afford to continue indefinitely to subsidise loss-making
industries and postpone real reform. The brush with the miners of the
Donbass was perhaps only a taste of what is to come.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Highs and lows of a dizzy decade: Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
out-going governor of the Bank of England, speaks to Peter Norman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are busy days for Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank
of England.
His 10 years with the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street are ending in a giddy
social whirl. On Monday, he took his leave of the City and politics. Three
former chancellors, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new tenant of Number 11 Downing
Street, and Lady Thatcher were among those bidding farewell in the Bank's
ornate Court Room. Last night it was time to say goodbye to his staff. In
eight days, Mr Leigh-Pemberton hands over to Mr Eddie George, the present
deputy governor, and a new deputy, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, formerly of the
Economist.
The departure of any Bank governor is a significant event in UK financial
history. But Mr Leigh-Pemberton is going after a particularly momentous two
terms of office.
Monday's high turnout of the great and the good from Westminster and the
City may be a sign that the Bank's star is again in the ascendant after
recent setbacks. Although Mr Leigh-Pemberton has experienced his fair share
of ups and downs since trading the chairmanship of the National Westminster
Bank for his secluded office facing on to the Bank's Garden Court, he is
leaving the Bank in reasonable shape in spite of the pound's exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism and criticism of the BCCI closure.
It has benefited from Britain's departure from the ERM to the extent that it
now has a clear mandate to fight inflation and a more open relationship with
the Treasury, with which it shares responsibility for monetary policy. In
the lively debate under way over whether the Bank should have more autonomy,
Mr Leigh-Pemberton clearly feels that the tide of history is moving the
Bank's way and in the direction of independence.
Nevertheless, in spite of the internationalisation of the City and the
cut-throat competitiveness of today's financial markets, he argues that the
Bank still has 'a very strong traditional position of prerogative in the
City'. The governor's eyebrows may be backed with statutory powers rather
than a dominant position in the markets these days. But used judiciously,
they can still exact obedience in the Square Mile.
Speaking in his office yesterday, Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who was elevated to
the peerage in the recent Queen's birthday honours list, said he was
convinced that central bank independence is 'an idea that is gathering
momentum all round the world'. He appreciates that Britain has a problem of
reconciling independence with parliamentary accountability: 'But I'm not
convinced that this is insoluble.'
The way forward, he suggests, is to allow the Commons Treasury and Civil
Service Select Committee to play a key role in holding the governor of an
independent British central bank to account. 'One or two MPs have said to me
that answerability on the floor of the Commons is fundamental,' he says.
'But as a matter of fact, MPs have a much better opportunity to test an
official or a governor in the select committee where you can follow a line
of argument to its end over a period of three hours. On the floor of the
House, you get a question, a supplementary and then perforce the matter
moves on.'
He believes a Treasury Committee report on the future of the Bank, which is
due towards the end of this year, could be a good starting point for a 'a
very careful and considered debate' on the merits of Bank independence.
In the meantime, much of the obscurity and secrecy that used to surround the
making of monetary policy by the Bank and Treasury have been stripped away
as a result of the greater openness that has followed Britain's departure
from the ERM and the adoption of a specific inflation target committing the
government to keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent over the rest of
this parliament. This state of affairs is 'quite the most satisfactory of my
10 years as governor', he says.
But the Bank, unlike some central banks, has other responsibilities besides
achieving price stability. Is there not a danger that it will be subject to
conflicts of interest if it retains responsibility for banking supervision
or the welfare of British industry?
'I don't think there is. I find it surprising that people ask that
question,' he says. 'I've never found a conflict of interest between our
prime function, which is sound money, either with banking supervision or
with the Bank's industrial finance policy.
'People may think one must go easy on banking supervision or one must go
easy on monetary policy because of the strain on the banks. Quite the
opposite, we must make sure the financial sector remains vigorous in an
environment of monetary stability. And the same goes for our work in
industrial finance.'
Nor does he consider the problems that the Bank's supervisory department has
faced in controversial cases such as the Johnson Matthey bank rescue of 1984
or the more recent closure of BCCI are reasons for the Bank to pull out of
supervision.
'I understand the arguments for hiving off. And there have been moments when
I've been sorely tempted to say the Bank would be better off to be relieved
of this very difficult function. But my opinion still remains that on
balance it is best that supervision is carried out in the central bank.'
A free-standing supervisory authority would have to rely on intelligence
provided by the Bank. At the same time, the Bank needs to 'remain very close
to the banking industry, partly in order to work its market operations
better but chiefly also to have its finger on the pulse for lender of last
resort functions'.
But remaining close to banking does not mean taking an uncritical view of
developments in the Square Mile. Lapses in the City's commercial morality
clearly worry Mr Leigh-Pemberton. 'People in the City are driven to cutting
corners by competitive pressure,' he says.
In this hyper-competitive world, the central bank governor has to use his
powers differently than in the past. But the famous eyebrows can still have
an impact.
'It is still possible to exercise powerful influence over leading figures in
the City and its institutions. The reason one can do this nowadays is
perhaps because of the background of statutory powers.'
Whatever the reasons, the end can be effective. There have been cases where
'one might have to say to a certain person or a certain house: 'Well look,
the way you're conducting business, it's not really acceptable. Please
accept my advice and adjust your style, because if not, we may have to think
about a formal finding. And I'm sure you wouldn't like that.' ' Such tactics
may be reminiscent of the old-boy network of past decades, but they have
worked in his 10 years of office.
Looking back, Mr Leigh-Pemberton would like to be remembered for having
helped bring inflation down. He is also pleased with the progress that
Britain is making in European affairs although 'there have been terrible ups
and downs'.
'But if you want me to answer you quite personally, I would like to be
thought to have given good leadership to the City, the banking industry,
even modestly internationally,' he says.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: System fails if wages have to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK REED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls' report on rising unemployment in the European Community
('A labour market gripped by 'Euro-sclerosis'', June 21) suggested that the
only solution lay in following the experience in the US, whose better
performance on employment he attributed to falling real wages. He did not,
however, discuss the further question which his analysis prompts, though it
stared the reader so closely in the face: why, in a time of rising
productivity, should real wages have to fall?
To turn to basics, rising productivity means that the average unit of labour
(or, to non-economists, person) produces more goods and services. Falling
real wages mean that that same person is rewarded for his or her labour with
fewer goods and services.
To argue that mass unemployment can be avoided only by falling living
standards at a time of rising productivity and rising productive potential
is surely to point to a massive failure of our economic system. Equally
surely, an adequate response to mass unemployment must start by identifying
the source of that failure.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: Mortgage arrears gloom overdone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADAM COLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ('Mortgage arrears leap', June 21) may well overstate the
gloom surrounding the mortgage arrears data you report, although the overall
rise in mortgage arrears over the last year was, of course, disappointing.
Your analysis misses an important statistical point. You asserted that, in
spite of a halving in mortgage rates since 1991, the number of households in
two or more months' arrears rose by 27,000 in the year to the end of March.
This made no reference to the fact that, because mortgage rates have fallen
(by 3 percentage points over the period), many people find themselves more
months in arrears - although their level of arrears has not increased. An
individual who is six months in arrears with mortgage rates at 16 per cent
is 12 months in arrears if mortgage rates fall to 6 per cent and the monthly
repayment halves.
As the number of home-owners in arrears for shorter periods fell sharply
(down by 43,000 for arrears of less than six months), while the number in
arrears for longer periods increased (up by 73,000 for more than six
months), this technical effect may account for a large part of the increase
in longer-term arrears. The success of the government in persuading lenders
not to repossess such homes probably played a relatively minor role.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: Executives' pay should reflect value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOEL M STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'The gravy train bumps along' (June 22), Robert Rice asks how the
executive gravy train - including huge pay-offs for failure - can be
stopped. Unfortunately, the problem is not just pay-for-performance. The
fundamental structure of 'debt-equity' schemes is the true underlying
problem. The sum of wages, retirement income and medical benefits, all
senior liabilities of the firm, represent as much as 90 per cent of total
compensation, with the 10 per cent remainder coming from equity claims in
the form of variable pay, profit sharing, and shares or share options. This
disequilibrium motivates managers to increase the firm's size, often with
alarming results.
A far more sensible alternative is to alter the weighting to something
closer to 50-50. Moreover, bonuses should be tied to the most significant
operating result associated with creating share value.
Research indicates that economic value added (EVA) is as much as three times
as important as earnings dividend growth, and cash flow. EVA is total
capital multiplied by the difference between the rate of return on total
capital and a cut-off or threshold rate of return for risk.
To make maximum EVA an incentive, managers should receive a percentage of
the amount of EVA as a first bonus, and a second bonus based on a percentage
of the change (or improvement) in EVA. There should also be a distinction
between declared and paid bonuses.
I suggest only one-third be paid immediately and the remaining two-thirds be
deposited into a bonus bank to be paid later. The two-thirds is subject to
loss if the change in EVA next year and the year thereafter is sufficiently
negative or if the manager/ employee leaves. A proportion of the bonus can
be used to purchase share options that have a rising exercise price.
More than 50 companies have implemented EVA incentive schemes and the
results have been phenomenal. Boards of directors have aligned the interests
of shareholders and managers, and realigned the distribution between senior
liability claims and equity claims. Most importantly, there cannot be any
pay-off for failure.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: Suchocka government wasted chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof KAZIMIERZ STANCZAK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a Pole and an economist, I completely disagree with your editorial,
'Poland on a detour' (June 2), which is sympathetic to the toppled
government of Miss Suchocka.
This government's preoccupation has been with pleasing the International
Monetary Fund, by implementing an archaic economic theory dogmatically
allergic to any budget or trade deficit. Yet, economic research in the last
20 years has shown that, in the case of temporary government spending, such
as paying for a transition away from communism, an optimal policy would
include budget deficits. Also, under certain conditions, the precise way the
government is financed (via debt or economically efficient taxes, for
example) is irrelevant.
Furthermore, a country which moves from a low-efficiency to a
high-efficiency state should borrow, not pay back or lend. It should, in
other words, run a current account deficit.
Miss Suchocka's cabinet has also spent its energy on a hand-holding approach
to mass privatisation and introduced new taxes (22 per cent VAT, for
example), tariffs (which are due to increase by 6 percentage points) and so
forth. But the government has failed to recognise the importance of laws to
establish property rights, promotion of competition and growth through the
accumulation of skills. It has also chosen not to be bothered by the 14 per
cent rate of unemployment.
As expected, the efforts of Miss Suchocka to change the European Community
policy towards Poland have produced nothing. Poland's competitive exports
continue to face obstacles and, having adopted EC tariffs as well, Poland
ends up protecting jobs where EC industry is most inefficient, jobs which
sometimes the country does not even have. The cabinet has foregone a more
natural option for a small country: a multilateral approach that would
include free trade areas with a large number of countries, including the US.
With Poland's crime rate going through the roof and the quality of schools
going down the drain, the Suchocka government's incompetence and lack of
vision has wasted another chance for Poland and her teething capitalism.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Mixed bag at the Vienna Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vienna being a sumptuous stage set, one should not be surprised if people
take advantage of the fact. So, one evening last week, Placido Domingo not
only sang in two separate opera houses - Il Tabarro in the Volksoper started
an hour early to allow him to cross the city for Pagliacci in the Staatsoper
 -he even made the journey between the two by tram.
What the opera houses put on is not part of the Vienna Festival as such; but
the visitor can and does dip into it, as well as into splendid exhibitions
like The World of The Mayas at the Kunstlerhaus and The Gold of Kiev at the
Kusthistorisches.
This year's festival has had a strong drama content, from a variety of
sources. The shows which have been most remarked on include the Moscow
Taganka production (by Lyubimov) of Schnittke's remarkable music drama
Doctor Zhivago, which sets about 20 scenes from the novel to a combination
of live electronic music. It was premiered in Vienna before going on to open
successfully in Moscow. Luc Bondy's French-language John Gabriel Borkman
from Lausanne impressed by its lightness of tone. The Ibsen characters were
for once not absolutely doomed from the start: they were permitted a certain
development. The Borkman couple was even granted a suppressed love for one
another: an interesting, maybe even valid, concept.
The special theme this year has been classical antiquity; it has given rise
to a not wholly successful ragbag of productions. There was a new Orfeo
opera by Walter Hus, from Antwerp; the Berlin State Opera brought the 1776
Paris version of Gluck's Alceste. In drama proper, Slovenia gave us Antigone
and Romania Phaedra. The Italian IRAA Theatre, now based in Melbourne,
contributed The Trojan Women. Fortunately or unfortunately, according to
your point of view, all these were rewrites of the original Greek to make
contemporary political points. A further example of the genre, Matthias
Braun's The Persians (Kammerspiele, Munich), started interestingly with
members of the chorus scattered about the audience, but soon revealed itself
as yet another allegory of the last days of the Nazis, and a turgid one at
that.
By far the finest production on show was the oldest: the 26-year-old Piccolo
Teatro version, by Giorgio Strehler of course, of Goldoni's Le Baruffe
Chiozzote (Trouble in Chioggia). It comes close to perfection, commedia
dell'arte with heart. A tale of quarrelsome fishermen and their women folk,
finally reconciled by a deft young law officer, it is based on an early
experience of Goldoni himself. Strehler choreographed it as lovingly as a
Buster Keaton film. The main set, a quay with a fishing boat's sails and
nets outlined against the sky, was exquisite; and the people were presented
with both wit and affection. One was left with an aching sense of having
eavesdropped on genuine human lives.
Strehler, now in the veteran category - he was born in 1921 - is still full
of plans: to produce a life of Goldoni as well as Pirandello's Mountain
Giants at the Picolo, to plug at least part of the 2,000-line gap still
remaining in his marathon production of Goethe's Faust.
So, this year's festival has been a mixed bag. As it was ending, a large
screen in front of the City Hall was showing the first of a series of video
recordings of Mahler's symphonies, conducted by Bernstein; they will be
followed by Karajan opera performances on film. These are part of yet
another event, Klangbogen (Sound Spectrum) which overlaps the festival,
which in its turn had overlapped with the spring festival . . .

FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Himself - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writer Brian Phelan had an idea. The resemblance between the old style
actor-managers who barnstormed the country mesmerising audiences with fire
and brimstone dramatics, and the modern evangelical preachers in the US with
their equally spine-chilling rantings, could surely be crafted into a play.
Phelan's second idea was really just a footnote. There is only one actor
with the physical presence and dominating personality to step into the shoes
of Donald Wolfit and Jimmy Swaggart. Luckily Timothy West was available.
Himself is now touring the country.
Coming from Dublin, Phelan makes his actor-turned-preacher Irish -
Christopher Cameron, or 'Himself', as the man of the house is known in
Ireland. And 'Himself', rather than 'Sir' or 'Maestro' demanded by other
actor-managers, suits his cosy, domesticated, character. Cameron is not a
man of bombast, rather a second-rate travelling player, delighted to be
invited to lecture at a Kansas drama school.
But his whimsical style and actorly skills attract the attention of sinister
business interests, anxious to find a preacher through whom they can cash in
on the gullible public who think that a Dollars 25 donation ensures access
to Heaven. Cameron treats the role of Bible basher as just another meaty
part and the money starts to roll in.
The problem is that Phelan does not know what to do with his characters,
except the obvious. Himself starts to believe that he is chosen of God; the
young acolyte Sister Annie (Sharon Small), who arrives as a sexual rival to
Cameron's sensible wife Meg (Susan Engel), just disappears. The initial
ending is predictable, but the follow up is incredible.
Director Paul Unwin manages to disguise the elusive plot by keeping the
dialogue on the boil, and by transforming the drab bare sets of life on the
road to a glamorous luxury studio as Himself dominates the Californian TV
ratings. We watch the man change from a bald, cor-seted, journeyman actor
into a white robed, toupeed prophet, we know that his basic niceness is
unimpaired. He, and we, are enjoying a role.
The villainous string-pullers always remain mysterious and the plot
developments are contrived, but Phelan is good on character, especially
Dermot Crowley as John, the marketing man who has found the perfect product
in God; Jud Meyers as Tom, the true believer whose faith is explioted; and
Susan Engel, who manages to tame Timothy West into a good company man.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Smothered in goo but still top hole - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How depressing to find the BBC introducing its first afternoon of Wimbledon
coverage with another of those childish compilation tapes in which players
are seen grimacing, punching the air, blowing kisses and so on, all cut to a
monotonous disco dance number. Snooker began this grubby little habit, then
it turned up in rugger and athletics and now it is being inflicted upon
tennis fans. It seems there is no event which the BBC will not attempt to
smother in goo, from the Cardiff Singer Of The World contest to the once
dignified Wimbledon. If it was not for the excellence of the real McCoy -
the live coverage - it would make you wonder about continuing to champion
the BBC as our main national broadcaster.
                            *      *      *
Having said which, there is a nasty trend in Committee Room 15 at the House
of Commons where the National Heritage Committee is inquiring into the
future of the BBC (yes, again; there does not seem to be a flicker of light
at the end of this inquiry tunnel). Listening to some of the witnesses and,
more worrying, some members of the committee, you could easily get the
impression that cable and satellite are already available to most British
viewers. They talk as though the days of terrestrial television - BBC, ITV,
Channel 4 - are over and multiple choice is here, so that there is no longer
any need to impose the hideous burden of the licence fee on a seething and
rebellious population.
So powerful was this impression last week that it seemed sensible in giving
my evidence to make the point that the biggest weekly share of viewing for
satellite and cable ever recorded by BARB was 6.5 per cent, leaving 93.5 per
cent to terrestrial broadcasters. Time permitting, I might have added that
the British seem remarkably happy with the terrestrial operators, showing
less enthusiasm for the new technologies than viewers in other countries.
The British take-up rate for cable (those paying to hook up when the cable
passes their door) is very low, and even in the small number of homes that
have dishes, only 32 per cent of time is spent with satellite channels,
leaving 68 per cent to the terrestrials.
Most of the hostility, I suspect, is inspired by the doctrinaire political
feeling that the licence fee is part of an old fashioned collectivist system
which, along with the welfare state, should now, in the post-communist
world, be replaced by something more market driven. Pragmatism suggests this
is crazy: compared with any other scheme the BBC and the licence fee have
proved astoundingly productive and efficient, and foreigners from Warsaw to
Oshkosh would tell the committee they are mad even to think about scrapping
them. Dislike of the licence comes chiefly from politicians who would dearly
like the general public to object, but who can rarely scrape together more
than half a dozen letters of protest when challenged.
                            *      *      *
Regular readers may have noticed that while television critics elsewhere
were rending their clothes and falling on their remote controls at the
ending of Cheers, the event passed without a murmur from this column. Now
that the repeats are up and running it may be time to say why. Although
Cheers was (given the repeats, is) an efficient vehicle for delivering
American wisecracks, it never produced a character as strong or memorable as
Bilko or Lucy. You may say that was never the intention: this was not a star
series like those old shows, its strength was in ensemble playing from a
large cast of near equals.
Perhaps so, but if it is to be judged on those grounds then its inferiority
becomes clear the moment you consider MASH Not only did MASH take ensemble
playing to a considerably higher level, but it managed, year after year, to
combine comedy and pathos in a way that Cheers aspired to but rarely
achieved. MASH had the advantage of ambivalence arising from its setting:
the jokes gained a keen edge from the perpetual proximity of pain in the
frontline operating theatre. No doubt the funny and sympathetic depiction of
the lonely and inadequate in Cheers was (is) hugely appealing to many
viewers; but that does not make it one of the great sitcoms. It is good but
not outstanding.
                            *      *      *
Those with a passion for Italy and some knowledge of the country may have
thought that 'Italian Week' on BBC2's Late Show would not be for them: too
busy offering a child's guide to the new politics, or rowing back over the
mafia trials. In the event quite a lot was, indeed, familiar and you
realised once more how superior print can still be when it comes to detail.
For instance, in describing the new magistrate hero, di Pietro, the
programme never hinted at his mastery of computers and the central
importance this has played in his fight against crime, though FT readers
learned this in detail months ago.
However, Nick Hornby gave an excellent report on Italian football and its
symbolic significance, even as a substitute for politics; David Stafford and
Tom Conti offered a wickedly accurate and consequently hilarious 10-point
charter for being Italian ('Dress British . . . Think taupe . . . Dare to be
similar . . .'); the importance of public opinion in the new drive against
the mafia was well read; we were given an unexpected and eye-opening report
on the Rome opera house; and, even if the studio discussion was
disappointing, anyone who watched throughout the week will have ended with a
much clearer idea of what it means at the moment to be an Italian.

The shift away from adult television and into tabloid telly continues
inexorably. Among last week's newcomers was Fantastic Facts on ITV which
presenter Jonathan Ross promised us would be 'outwageously funny'. It was
not. Fantastic Cliches would have been a better title. From Ross's script
('Without further ado . . .') to the 'fantastic' items (you can adopt a
pothole in Minnesota) there was little that the normal viewer would not have
come across several times before, including the famous fainting goats. The
biggest giggle came when the camera showed us a boy's book with a decorated
cover and the title 'Scouts In Bondage', but you need more than that and yet
another stuntman's expose to make a half hour programme. The most
embarrassing moment came in the network trailer which assured us that one of
the items was 'incredulous but true'.

ITV's three-part Thursday drama Telltale, featuring two detectives and a
supergrass, is proving a bit of an enigma: is it just another proficient but
unsurprising police drama starring Bernard Hill who, however good he may be,
is currently dangerously over exposed? Or is its chief preoccupation really
the home lives of the detectives, a theme beloved of Z Cars writers in the
1960s? Or, as I vaguely suspect, is its real concern 'Stockholm Syndrome',
the tendency of captors and captives, in a bank siege or aircraft hijacking,
to develop a common front against the world? Only the final episode tomorrow
will tell, but I shall be disappointed if Stockholm Syndrome plays no part.
                            *      *      *
Last week's column on commercials failed to mention Paul Merton's current
campaign for Cusson's Imperial Leather where he bursts in on the children's
bathtime, drops his microphone in the bath, and promises the irate mother
compensation: 'We'll give you about . . . eight quid'. Why or whether it
sells soap is anybody's guess, but it made me laugh more than any of the
week's sitcoms.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Monteverdi's 'Orfeo' - Boston Early Music Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Boston Early Music Festival and Exhibition is the annual American rally
for cornetto freaks, luthiers and glass-harmonica makers, besides offering
also a crowded bouquet of performances: for a few days the city's churches,
chapels and meeting halls resounded this year to Byrd, to 14th-century
cabaret, and to viola da gamba players flying on the good fortune here of
Alain Corneau's 'Tous les matins du monde'. The main event - held in the
Sanders Theatre of Memorial Hall, Harvard's equivalent in architectural
appeal to the Oxford Union - was a staging of the Monteverdi Orfeo, under
the musical direction of Andrew Parrott.
He is a festival regular. His brisk, fit performances of the Bach suites
with the BEMF Orchestra have just been released on CD, and previous
festivals have yielded fine concert recordings of the Mozart Requiem and C
minor Mass. In that succession, the Orfeo was disappointing. Early music
people have long been an international family, but the combination here of
British musicians (Parrott, Andrew Lawrence-King) and Americans (the strings
of The King's Noyse, the wind band Concerto Palatino, and sundry continuo
players) sounded like an assortment of separate parties, some of them with
their own ideas about intonation (the kit fiddles used for Monteverdi's
'violini piccioli alla francese' were particularly acid). The singing had
its problems too - chiefly of dullness. For a breath of life one had to
wait, paradoxically, for the underworld scene where Orpheus meets Charon.
Joseph Cornwell's 'Possente spirito' was, like his whole performance in the
central role, studied, efficient and uniform, but Jan Opalach as the Stygian
oarsman produced a nice cameo of dim-witted nobility.
Maybe all the others were thoroughly depressed by their clothes. Someone had
gone to the trouble of consulting drawings of masque costumes by Inigo Jones
and others, but the results - badly made, in modern textiles synthetically
dyed - were lamentable. With almost all the cast made up as rosy-cheeked
dolls, with clumsy efforts at rhetorical grouping and posture, and with a
coarsely painted and crude simulacrum of a Baroque set, the visual
experience was dire: maybe that, more than anything else, was responsible
for the musical failures. Singers perform well when they look good.
Instrumentalists, in a singer-focused opera, concede to the messages they
hear from the stage. What we heard from both may well have been dismay.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Bach in high style - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ninth, month-long Lufthansa Festival of Baroque Music has already been
going on since June 1. Always based in the church of St. James, Piccadilly,
it has stretched this year more than ever to the Wigmore Hall, where on
Monday the St. James's Baroque Players and Consort (conductor Ivor Bolton)
delivered a Bach programme in high style.
The hall was just about full. That reflected both the confidence that the
Festival has inspired among lovers of 18th-century music, and the attraction
of two star performers: the harpsichordist Joshua Rifkin, famous for his
'Baroque Beatles', Scott Joplin numbers, tangos and Bach Passions with one
voice per choral part - and the young Canadian baritone Gerald Finley,
already admired as Britten's Albert Herring and in Mozart at Glyndebourne.
Finley was billed here as a 'bass-baritone', but in the bass register the
voice still lacks body - surprising in view of his singularly beautiful
timbre higher up, where a great factor in the appeal is his warmly affecting
bass undertone. No doubt the passing years will lend ballast to his bottom,
but meanwhile the voice is lovely to hear. Easily and naturally produced,
confidently flexible, laden with dewy, unaffected character; just the
qualities, one might add contentiously, that British voice-training seems to
throttle in British baritones . . .
In the cantata 'Ich habe genug', no. 82 in the BMV index though composed
only months later, Finley's uncomplicated honesty was compensation enough
for slightly lightweight feeling. This great solo cantata, like the earlier
one, has acquired a false Romantic patina through the attentions of
ultra-subtle Lieder specialists; the expressive challenges that Schubert and
Wolf would set for their interpreters were of quite another order. Here,
Anthony Robson's fine, period-oboe solos in both cantatas answered
unerringly to Finley's style.
Rifkin and Bolton played the two-harpsichord concerto in C (BWV 1061) with
energetic polish and in faultless balance. I thought them too metronomically
harnessed in the rich central Adagio - but we shall never really know what
breadth of rhythmic freedom Bach himself might have expected: the gramophone
arrived too late. Contrariwise, in the familiar A minor violin concerto (BMV
1041) Micaela Comberti was sweet-toned and nervily fluent, with no
commanding thrust. I wanted franker, gutsier sawing-away, but could not
pretend to anything more than 'period' intuition as back-up.

FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Labour leader in the shires
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shire counties of England and Wales now have a Labour chief. Dennis
Pettitt was yesterday elected leader of the Association of County Councils,
by the councillors who took office in last month's electoral landslide
against the Conservatives.
Pettitt is the only Labour party member ever to have held the post, which he
also held briefly between 1988 and 1989 when no party had overall control of
the ACC.
A 67-year-old, and leader of Nottinghamshire county council since 1979,
Pettitt is likely to use the weight of his experience to build more
co-operation between the local government associations, and also present
more coherent alternatives to the central government.
He can be expected to play down the sharp divisions with the Association of
District Councils, revealed by the reorganisation of boundaries by Sir John
Banham's Local Government Commission, in favour of a more coherent front.
Pettitt is a Birmingham man by birth, and spent 10 years in East Africa,
working in the lift industry, before settling in Nottinghamshire.
His deputy, who had been seen as a potential rival for the post, will be
Josie Farrington, 52, a Lancashire county councillor since 1977. Also a
Labour representative, she is president of the Council of Europe committee
for culture, education and media, and is working on establishing a local
radio station in Croatia. Farrington was Labour's candidate in the Ribble
Valley by-election of 1991.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Too much of a good thing -
Ariane Genillard describes how Germany's national recycling scheme is
collapsing under its own success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day for a year Margot von Shad carefully picked her rubbish apart,
setting aside the cans, cartons, packaging and other household products
marked with a green dot to put in yellow rubbish bins in front of her house.
But last Sunday she decided, along with some friends, that it was a waste of
time.
'All this effort and now we hear it is for nothing,' she says
disappointedly. Along with millions of other conscientious Germans, she is
dismayed by reports that the country's waste collecting and recycling scheme
is going bankrupt.
The scheme, known as Duales System Deutschland (DSD), is collapsing under
the weight of the rubbish it is collecting and sorting out. DSD was set up
last year by 600 industrial groups to meet government-imposed recycling
quotas, but last week it announced that it needs DM500m (Pounds 200m) just
to keep going.
Part of the problem is the scheme's success. For plastics alone, DSD expects
to collect this year four times the amount it was set up to deal with. At
the weekend, Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister who devised the
scheme, proudly referred to his fellow Germans as the '(trash) collectors of
the world'.
But Topfer's compliment is hardly soothing the worries of both an
environment-conscious public and German industry. DSD's ability to recycle
waste lags well behind its success in collecting it. With dumping sites
filling up and scandals over waste exports increasingly surfacing,
politicians and industrialists are now under pressure to rethink the entire
system.
Some critics have taken action. Last week, the Rhineland Palatinate state
withdrew from the scheme. As one official in the local environment ministry
put it: 'We are suffocating under mountains of DSD waste and we have no more
storage for it.'
But retail traders have been the loudest in voicing their fears. If DSD
fails to collect household waste, it will be legally bound to take back
packaging from its customers.
DSD collects and sorts out waste from 96 per cent of German households. It
was established in response to the ground-breaking 1991 packaging law which
forced manufacturers and retailers to take packaging back. Other European
countries such as Austria and France, eager to find solutions for the
ever-increasing production of household waste, have since been taking a
close look at the German law and its application.
At the core of the nationwide scheme lies the German concept of
Kreislaufwirtschaft - a closed circle economy where all products are re-used
ad infinitum. The ultimate aim is to have industry manufacture products that
offer viable recycling possibilities.
To implement such a goal, industry must bear the financial costs of
recycling, environmentalists say. Under the packaging law, manufacturers and
retailers are responsible for collecting and recycling packaging products.
The law effectively shifted waste management away from cash-strapped
municipalities to the private sector.
Faced with the cost of both collecting and recycling their own products,
industry will have an incentive to manufacture environment-friendly
products, Topfer hopes.
But in practice, the system contains a major flaw, which many anti-DSD
environmentalists are now quick to point out. The entire scheme is based on
the assumption that there are cost advantages in manufacturing products that
can be easily recycled. But in the case of plastic, the largest packaging
product on the market, recycling may be economically less viable than
'down-cycling' - destroying the product through methods such as
incineration.
Unlike glass, aluminium and paper, which have been recycled for decades,
plastic packaging such as yoghurt pots and beverage bottles are of little
value to recyclers. They contain different colourings and are usually made
of mixed elements.
'The industry has known for years that heavy investments would be needed to
recycle plastics. The bottom line is that they are only interested in the
plastics leaving the market in an orderly fashion, no matter what their
destinations are,' says Franz-Joseph Fraundorfer, from the German-based
office of consultants Arthur D Little.
In 1993, DSD expects to collect nearly 400,000 tonnes of the 1.2m tonnes of
plastics produced annually in the country. But recycling capacity in Germany
stands at just 124,000 tonnes.
However, a further 152,000 tonnes will be exported. In response to a scandal
last year in France, where German waste was found sitting in the open air on
a badly controlled landfill, DSD has set up a system to test the viability
of recycling companies abroad.
Many cases slip through DSD's net, says Greenpeace, the environmental group.
Only last March Greenpeace claimed to have found thousands of tonnes of DSD
waste in Indonesia, despite an Indonesian government ban on waste imports
brought in last November to curb the flow of waste entering the country.
'DSD even pays foreign firms to take back plastics, which are then put on
empty ships returning to Asia from German ports,' a consultant says.
Part of the solution lies in Germany developing its own recycling
facilities. But investments in plastic recycling, which are costly and
involve lengthy research, are dragging behind.
RWE, for instance, the big west German utilities company, has invested DM10m
in a pilot plant to separate aluminium from polyethylene used in
manufacturing beverage cartons. If that is successful, a permanent plant
could recycle up to 10,000 tonnes of such cartons a year. But that would be
less than a quarter of the 60,000 tonnes a year on the market.
Overall, RWE expects to be able to recycle 40,000 tonnes of plastic this
year. By 1996 the utilities group hopes to have a recycling capacity nearing
200,000 tonnes.
Veba, the energy group and Ruhrkohle, the coal producer, are also working
together to recycle 40,000 tonnes of plastic a year by melting it down and
using the resulting oil in an oil refinery. However, such recycling
technology is limited to large plants that are coupled with a refinery.
Such recycling efforts pale in the light of the 800,000 tonnes of plastic
that DSD is legally bound to recycle starting in July 1995. Worried about
how it will deal with all that waste, the company has been calling out to
the chemical industry to start investing in recycling facilities. But as a
director from Bayer, the chemical group, puts it: 'We are all losing money.
Where do they think we will find it for such non-productive investments?'
Consultants instead argue that 'recycling at all cost' may simply not be the
best approach. 'France, for instance, has developed incineration techniques
which are technically and environmentally very effective,' Fraundorfer says.
Meanwhile, household waste collected by DSD can no longer be legally burned
or dumped on landfills and is accumulating in temporary storages.
Politicians from Germany's opposition Social Democratic party say the law
should be changed and plastics, for example, taxed.
But Topfer refuses to renege on the packaging law. 'If industry is forced to
assume the cost of recycling and invest,' says an official from the federal
environment ministry, 'then they will change their plastic packaging to
something else.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Former Hammerson chief takes expertise to Asda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Parry has been appointed as a non-executive director of Asda Property
Holdings, following his retirement earlier this month as managing director
of Hammerson Property Investment and Development Corporation.
Tony Roscoe, managing director of Asda, said that Parry had been asked to
join the board because of his integrity, depth of knowledge and experience
of running a much larger property company.
Asda Property Holdings used to be one of the few residential property
companies on the stock market, but the proportion of residential property
has now fallen below 10 per cent of its portfolio.
Over the last 18 months the company has repositioned itself by selling
residential property and buying high yielding commercial property.
Parry joined Hammerson in 1984 from Commercial Union Properties, where he
was managing director. He spent his early career as a development surveyor.
Parry was last year's president of the British Property Federation, a
landlords' association. He is also a member of the Department of
Environment's Property Advisory Group, a member of the British Council of
Offices and a board member of the College of Estate Management at Reading.

FT  23 JUN 93 / People: Jesuit for Dixons ethics chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jack Mahoney is to become Dixons professor of business ethics and social
responsibility at the London Business School, filling the post created by a
Pounds 1m bequest from the UK electronics group in July last year.
Mahoney, a Jesuit priest and former principal of Heythrop College at the
University of London, is currently F D Maurice professor of moral and social
theology at King's College, London.
He is also the founder and director of the King's College Business Ethics
Research Centre, which he says is likely to wither with his move to the
London Business School in October this year.
'Complacency was beginning to set in,' he said. 'I saw myself coasting
gently to retirement. I realised that if I was serious about business ethics
this was something I should not pass up.'
'As a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit I don't have a strongly biblical basis nor
fundamentalism. I happen to believe that there are God-given capacities that
allow everyone to work out what is right to do. I want to help them find the
ordinary human decencies and apply them in business.'
In addition to the professorship, the Pounds 1m bequest paid over five years
by the Dixons Charitable Foundation, will fund a research and teaching
programme in ethics and responsibility.
As part of the programme, Diana Robertson is to be appointed assistant
professor of organisational behaviour and business ethics in August 1994.
Robertson is currently assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, and taught courses on
business ethics while a visiting assistant professor at LBS during 1990-92.
Andrew Likierman, deputy principal of the London Business School, said: 'I
am very enthusiastic. We have an extremely strong team with these two which
will give us a big push in the area of business ethics.'
Mahoney said his priorities were to put the teaching of the subject on to
the agenda of the school; consider ethical audits of companies; and to
develop a series of debates and a network of business ethics teachers.

Barclays Bank, which calculates it is already Britain's fourth largest
provider of unit-linked life insurance and pensions products, has moved to
strengthen its management team with its eye on moving further up the league
tables.
Bancassurance, the sale of life and pensions products through bank and
building society outlets, is forecast to grow to 30-50 per cent of the total
market by the end of the decade and all four major UK clearers have
announced their intentions to be serious players.
Barclays Financial Services has recruited as sales manager Keith Strudley,
48, from rival Midland Bank where he played a key role in expanding and
developing distribution channels.
Strudley has had a long career in bancassurance, having spent 15 years at
TSB as a regional sales manager.
Barclays has also recruited Phil Smith as finance director for its financial
services unit. Smith had previously occupied a similar position at
Prudential Assurance Company's general insurance division.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Clean-up brings unusual
alliance - An innovative plan to repair damage caused by mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining is a messy business. And coping with its social and environmental
side-effects has often posed an even murkier problem, especially in the
Third World.
In spite of the wealth of expertise among development agencies, and the
growing environmental pressure on the sector, mining companies and
development charities have usually been reluctant to collaborate - or even
to communicate - with each other.
But in the impoverished west African country of Sierra Leone, a scheme is
under way which shows that, though co-operation is not easy, it can be
innovative. The partners in the project are a small mining company, Sierra
Rutile - a subsidiary of the US-based group Nord Resources Corporation - and
Care, an international development charity.
Sierra Rutile's main business since the mid 1980s has been mining the
titanium mineral rutile through wet dredging. The process requires flooding
areas of fertile farm land, which are often unusable for farming afterwards.
But since the late 1980s, the company has tried to make amends by putting
about 3 per cent of its annual turnover into alternative agricultural and
development projects. Using that funding, and the development expertise of
Care, basic sanitation and sustainable agricultural programmes have been set
up for some 3,400 farming families living around the mining area.
'The aim is to provide something for people who have nothing,' says Derric
Hanvey, a director of Sierra Rutile and a key architect of the scheme. He
points out that in a country like Sierra Leone, where the state is weak, the
mine is practically the only form of infrastructure - and employment - in
the region.
The practice of providing wells, seeds and schools is not in itself unusual
in the mining world. In recent years, most mining companies operating in
west Africa have been stepping up their assistance to local communities and
environmental programmes - primarily as a result of environmental pressure
and tougher legislation.
'The big mining companies are now on the defensive about these issues,' says
Chris Hinde, editor of the Mining Journal which, in deference to the
changing climate, is about to launch a new environmental supplement. He
estimates that approximately 10 per cent of the total start-up costs for new
mines is earmarked for environmental rehabilitation projects.
What makes Sierra Rutile's project unusual is the involvement of a
non-governmental charity. Until now, mining companies have preferred to use
their own staff or consultants, rather than charities or environmental
groups, to administer their aid.
'In this respect the project is unique,' says Edward Watkins, a mining and
environment consultant who believes that, by collaborating with Care, Sierra
Rutile now has 'much more credibility' in the region.
Sierra Rutile claims it chose to work with Care because of the charity's
expertise and as a recognition that the most effective forms of development
work are those that stress farmer participation - something that is hard to
develop under the paternal structure of a big mining company.
However, some green groups believe that, despite the mine's efforts, the
farmers are still losing out. And they say Care is in danger of becoming
compromised by being involved in the project.
Care stresses that the actual implementation of the project remains under
its control. 'We appreciate that this donor is enabling the charity to
assist project participation as planned,' says Patrick Sayer, UK director of
Care's west African projects. 'What we get out of this project is the same
as what we get out of any donor.'
The sensitivity of charities to criticism on this issue highlights the
problems that may dog attempts to repeat the scheme elsewhere. For while all
parties say they hope the project will set an example, overcoming the
decades of suspicion - and differing objectives - between mining companies
and development workers may prove as difficult as rehabilitating the mining
land.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Management: Time to use a little help from abroad - More
British companies are inviting foreign directors to join their boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: international high-fliers with strategic vision, energy, commitment.
Preferably continental European or American US nationals, must be prepared
to visit UK for 12 board meetings a year. Successful candidates will get
rare insight into the running of UK companies. About Pounds 15,000 a year
plus expenses.
The call has gone out: foreign non-executive directors are being sought by
British companies. The markets for British products have long been
international, and the markets for British shares are becoming increasingly
so. But until recently British non-executives had been selected from among
the chairman's golfing friends, fellow citizens to the last.
A few British companies have had big-name foreigners on their boards for
some time. Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, joined the board
of Pilkington 10 years ago. Charles Price, the former US ambassador to
London, sits on the boards of British Airways and Hanson.
ICI has no fewer than three foreigners on its board: Paul Volcker, the
former head of the US Federal Reserve Board, Tom Wyman, who is also a
director of General Motors and AT&amp;T, and Ellen Schneider-Lenne, a director
of Deutsche Bank.
The trend is now gathering pace. Last week Rank Organisation took on its
first foreigner with the appointment of James Harmon, chief executive of the
US bank Wertheim Schroder. Rank had become aware that its increasing
turnover from the US did not tally with its all-British board, and sent
Schroder, its merchant bank, to recruit a suitable American.
A few days earlier, Budgens, the small British supermarket chain, gained a
foreign heavy-weight in Hans Reischl, chief executive of Rewe, the large
German food retailers.
Reischl, whose company has a stake in Budgens, plans to use his position on
the board as a listening post - to get first-hand knowledge of the British
market.
Whitehead Mann, the headhunting firm, has recently surveyed the top 100
British companies and concluded that in the foreseeable future 84 per cent
of big public limited companies will have at least one foreign national on
their boards.
Of the companies surveyed, 40 per cent already have a foreign non-executive
 -half of those executives have been taken on in the last two years - and a
further 44 per cent are planning to recruit one.
Of the existing foreign directors, Americans are slightly more plentiful
than Europeans, whereas Japanese are still rarities. However, this balance
is changing. According to the survey, 60 per cent of companies are looking
to Europe to fill the next slot on the board.
The motivation for taking on foreign directors is shared by most companies:
nearly all said they hoped to gain a more international perspective or a
fresh insight into a particular region. Those who have already hired their
foreign directors seem happy with the result; more than half of those asked
were very pleased and none was disappointed.
Yet finding the right person may be a slow process, as Grand Met found out
when it completed a 14-month search before coming up with German management
consultant Gertrude Hohler.
One problem is the commitment of time required of non-executives. British
boards meet about three times as often as those of US companies or the
supervisory boards of German companies.
Foreigners have further to come, although this difficulty can be overstated.
'It is quicker to get from Paris to London than from London to Norfolk,'
comments Bruce Rhodes, a director of Pro Ned, the organisation set up to
promote non-executive directors. Indeed, the Whitehead Mann survey showed
that attendance by foreign nationals was no worse than attendance generally.
Rhodes also argues that language is not the barrier it is believed to be, as
the sort of people with a suitably broad perspective to make them possible
candidates are likely to be able to speak good English anyway.
More of a problem is that non-executive directors in the UK have the same
legal responsibility as executive ones. This is particularly a concern for
American candidates, who are unlikely to take the position unless the
company takes out special insurance for them. If the company has business in
the US such cover may be expensive.
Busy foreign executives may also be concerned that the matters discussed at
the meetings are too routine and time-wasting. 'The guys don't worry about
jet lag - but they may be worried that the board meetings are too
operational, and are not the best use of their time,' says Ian Butcher of
Whitehead Mann.
To get around this problem, many UK companies are setting up international
advisory boards. Such boards may consist of two or three international
heavy-weights who meet the chief executive and perhaps one or two other
board members twice a year in assorted locations to discuss global strategy.
While foreign directors are in demand by British companies, the same does
not seem to be the case for British directors and foreign companies. This is
partly because the board structure in some countries does not invite
outsiders. In Germany, for example the supervisory board is made up of
representatives of the workforce and shareholders.
The US as a bigger country can perhaps afford to be more insular, and if it
wanted help from foreigners the UK might not be its first point of call.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Management: A flight of discovery - How a Belfast aerospace
company has introduced benchmarking into its strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FEW large manufacturing businesses
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
fewer still in aerospace and defence - can claim to be employing more people
today than they were four years ago. Short Brothers of Belfast (Shorts for
short) is one of them.
The size of the company's workforce - more than 8,000 at the last count - is
one indication of the liberating effect that privatisation appears to have
had on the world's oldest aircraft production company. Taken over by
Canada's Bombardier Corporation in 1989, Shorts was the instant beneficiary
of an investment programme by Bombardier and the UK government. The Pounds
200m Shorts received has been used to increase efficiency, extend its
capabilities and significantly improve its financial performance. Last
year's pre-tax profit of Pounds 28.5m compared with a Pounds 47m loss in
1988.
But while costs have been cut, product quality sharpened, lead times
narrowed and a more customer-orientated culture instilled, the
competitiveness of Shorts' international markets means the company can aim
for nothing less than world-class standards. That is one reason why 18
months ago it embraced benchmarking as an important part of its quality
management strategy.
Roy McNulty, Shorts' quietly spoken president, defines benchmarking as 'the
continuous improvement of what we do by learning how others do it'. 'What we
do,' he adds, 'can be products, processes or services, whilst 'others' can
be other divisions within Shorts, companies within the Bombardier group,
direct competitors, or best practice companies.'
Initially, Shorts was attracted to benchmarking by a desire to evaluate the
first phase of the investment programme, and to ensure that Pounds 70m of
still uncommitted funds were sensibly targeted. The company talked
extensively to three consulting firms - Andersen, Ingersoll Engineers and
Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton - before choosing Booz on the basis of its knowledge
of the aerospace industry.
Benchmarking at Shorts, explains Brian Little, vice-president and general
manager of manufacturing, has been one tool in a wider programme for change.
That has involved identifying customer needs more closely, establishing
deeper relationships with a smaller number of suppliers, and investing in
people.
Of the two benchmarking studies so far undertaken, the more ambitious
compared seven of Shorts' manufacturing processes with those of 28 worldwide
competitors. Teams of four to five people - roughly divided between Shorts
and Booz representatives - were set up last spring and worked full time on
the project for 12 weeks.
Little says it was important to establish a realistic benchmarking
methodology - eliminating accounting distortions and isolating the true
manufacturing value added from tax breaks and other incentives - as well as
attempting to quantify the real 'cost drivers' in an individual process.
For each process, Shorts worked out its relative cost position, as well as
best practice performance metrics. For example, in composites fabrication
its utilisation rate was 4-5 per cent more efficient than the two benchmark
companies, its overhead structure 5-14 per cent cheaper and its factor costs
in one case 63 per cent lower after stripping out state subsidies.
Shorts found that its parts-flow performance, graphite utilisation, scrap
rates and quality costs relative to total costs were in line with best
practice. On some products, though, its scrap rates were worse than the
benchmark.
Overall, Little claims the survey found Shorts 'as competitive as any
company in the world' in five of the seven processes. In the other two -
which Little won't identify for commercial reasons - 'we have had to do
quite a lot of re-engineering, particularly to reduce the costs of our
operating systems and practices'. In one case, the study highlighted an
important choice: whether to buy in technology that is two to three years
ahead of the field or try to develop it in Belfast.
Process improvement plans have been clearly based on observed best
practices, and performance metrics used as process performance targets. In
the current recessionary markets the studies have also given Shorts a more
detailed picture of its rivals' pricing relates to their costs.
Shorts' corporate services benchmarking project, by contrast, appears less
advanced. But by comparing other companies' practices in areas like
information technology, sales and marketing, finance, and facilities
engineering, Shorts hopes to be able to identify savings.
Little, who is something of a benchmarking evangelist, insists 'there is
always something to be learned from visiting someone else's factory. It can
be a great trade'.
He admits it is more difficult benchmarking direct competitors. But,
intriguingly, he says: '90-95 per cent of the data required to do a
reasonably effective cost-competitive benchmarking job are in the public
domain. Plant visits help but a lot of information comes from suppliers,
magazine articles, public accounts and simply studying the physical size of
other people's manufacturing operation. It is particularly easy in the US
where the Freedom of Information Act helps and trade union agreements can be
quite detailed.'
Companies that try to discourage benchmarking studies are wasting their
time, he says. 'Moreover, we have discovered that the people who are most
secretive generally have the least to hide.'
Japanese companies have been mostly co-operative. 'They usually believe you
won't use the information, or that by the time you do they will have moved
ahead again,' Little observes wryly.
Visits can also be useful closer to home, and with non-competitive
'partners'. Little is confident Shorts can improve the capacity utilisation
of its autoclave (curing oven) by studying a local bakery, and that a
garment manufacturer can pass on valuable lessons about managing materials
flow.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Jobs: Self-imposed stranglehold on recovery - A
do-it-yourself guide to how understanding things differs from being able to
do them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUT of the shadows of a dark empty street springs a hulking man. Wrapping
his fingers round your throat and giving you no chance to knee him, he
presses both thumbs on your Adam's Apple and starts throttling the life out
of you.
What do you do to stop him?
Although some readers will no doubt know the answer, if you're anything like
the people to whom the Jobs column demonstrated it at a conference not long
ago, most of you will not. The object of my demo was to clarify the
difference between two broad kinds of knowledge. One is the academic sort
forming the main stock in trade of higher education at universities and so
on. The other is the type essential to the doing of almost all skilled work.
The fact that the difference exists is crucial, especially in Britain. For
it seems clear that unless we improve our stock of work skills, we shall be
unable to keep up our present standard of living. And one costly service at
risk to economic faltering is our network of higher educational institutions
which, however else they may benefit the community, aren't earning their own
keep.
How expensive they are was illustrated by the Labour shadow education
minister Jeff Rooker at a Lancaster University seminar last week. He said
his inquiries showed that the average yearly cost of nursery schooling to
the taxpayer was Pounds 1,400 a head, rising to Pounds 2,200 in secondary
schooling, and Pounds 2,700 in college courses not leading to degrees. At
university undergraduate level the averages leapt to between Pounds 6,000
and Pounds 9,000 depending on subject studied, and at Oxford and Cambridge
in particular to Pounds 8,000-Pounds 11,000.
Anyone doubting that higher education is failing to cover its costs should
read a study by the seminar's organiser, Lancaster's Jim Murphy, in the
latest Oxford Review of Education.
One thing he does is to take apart various reports that have tried to
justify further expansion of higher education on grounds that Britain
provides less of it than do certain countries which are better off. He shows
that, whatever may account for the wealth of nations, it is not their
provision of post-school courses.
Dr Murphy also rebuts claims that more people with degree-level education
are needed by companies. He points out that, even before the recession, the
British government's Highly Qualified People survey found that 'a degree was
considered essential for only a third of the jobs' for which companies had
recruited new graduates. In the other two thirds of cases, the employers
said the work could be done just as well by 18-year-old recruits who had
left education after the Advanced level exams, and been given relevant work
experience and training.
Such findings do not deny that most graduates are personally enriched by the
intellectual stimulus of degree studies. The snag is that unless the
personally enriching activity also pays for itself - which the figures
suggest it doesn't - it is a drain on the economy. As Jim Murphy puts it,
the idea that intellectual energy converts into national prosperity looks to
be mistaken.
The question why that is so brings us back to you readers standing in the
dark street being throttled - unless, of course, you've already expired in
the interval. For, to my mind at any rate, the explanation lies in the
difference between the sort of knowledge that's the stock in trade of higher
education, and the kind which practical skills essentially depend on.
The academic sort consists of two main elements. One is quasi-factual
knowledge: knowing that something is so. The second is scientific-style
explanations of certain phenomena: knowing why they are so. But work skills
are based on know-how, which is more complex.
For one thing, the academic elements are easier to teach, as I hope to
illustrate with reference to the throttler. First comes a know-that: what it
is that you can do to stop him, virtually regardless of how much bigger than
you he may be.
Put the palm of one hand flat on his chest and, whichever hand you use,
slide forward the foot on the same side of your body. Then push, sharply
swivelling your shoulders and hips sideways, as though your hand on his
chest were holding an archer's bow and you were drawing it with the other.
No matter how hard he tries to hang on, he'll have to let go. If you don't
believe me, test it with colleagues.
Having taught you that you can stop a throttler in that way, I'll explain
why it works.
His grip depends on just the power of his hands and shoulders. Against that,
while it may seem that you're using only one arm, you are in fact opposing
the force of most of your body from the big toe of the front foot upwards.
The only trouble is that, even though you now know both that and why, if
you're ever seized in a throttle for real by someone much bigger, it's odds
on you'll die. Or, at least, that is the lesson of my experience.
The instructor who taught me the technique was scientifically minded. After
demonstrating and explaining it, he had me practise it on him 50 times with
either hand. Then minutes later he suddenly grabbed me and began throttling
in earnest. After the second or so it took to realise what was happening, I
fought for my life, tearing at his arms and trying to knee and kick him. The
only thing I didn't try was the push technique.
Once I went limp, he let go. 'Wasn't that interesting?', he said as I
crawled off to vomit. He was right. It had shown me the difference between
know-that and know-why on the one hand, and know-how on the other.
The distinction is scarcely a new discovery. Aristotle pointed it out some
2,300 years ago. He wrote that absorbing knowledge intellectually is not
enough to make it usable. To become readily convertible into skilful action,
it 'must be worked into the living texture of the mind'* And while he didn't
specifically say so, the inference is that the only way to gain such skills
is by diligent practice in conditions that are increasingly real.
But although his advice has been available for two millennia, the British in
particular seem lately to have ignored it. For our *Ethics VII 1147a.
Penguin 1955.
30 years of repeated expansion of higher academic studies has been
accompanied by the discarding of a learning method more like the one
Aristotle looks to have had in mind: apprenticeship.
All of which would appear to leave any government seriously interested in
economic advance with a choice. Either universities and the like must
themselves learn to impart productive know-how to their students in much
greater measure. Or much of the higher educational structure must be
scrapped and replaced with apprentice-style learning.
Either way, however, it would be foolish to expect the result to be less
expensive - far from it. Indeed, one of the arguments for expanding the
educational network was that a given number of students could be put through
its courses far more cheaply than through the apprentice training that went
before.
Hence any return to a know-how emphasis in learning will inevitably mean a
still heavier bill. But it would surely be better to put more money into a
process which contributes to national prosperity than maintain today's level
of spending on a cost.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Borrowing by companies hits nine-year low: Lower interest
rates cut savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE improvement in company finances, helped by higher profits and lower
interest payments, has put the corporate sector on the road to a strong
recovery, yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office show.
In the first quarter companies needed to borrow a net Pounds 591m to cover
outgoings - down from Pounds 7.99bn in the fourth quarter of last year and
the smallest quarterly figure for nearly nine years.
Total undistributed income, allowing for profits and after taking into
account interest payments, tax and dividends, came to Pounds 11.6bn in the
first quarter at current prices, the highest figure since early 1989.
Company investment, paid for out of undistributed income and including cash
spent on plant, buildings and vehicles, was a real, inflation-adjusted 0.5
per cent higher in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of
last year.
It was particularly boosted by capital spending by non-manufacturing
businesses which invested 2.1 per cent more over this period. Capital
spending by manufacturers fell 3.2 per cent between the two quarters.
Gross trading profits of companies increased 8.4 per cent at current prices
in the first quarter compared with the equivalent period a year earlier.
Profits were 1.8 per cent higher than in the last quarter of 1992.
Taking into account capital transfers and stock appreciation, total company
receipts in the first quarter came to Pounds 10.84bn, 14.9 per cent up from
the Pounds 9.43bn in the fourth quarter of last year and a healthy 45.1 per
cent increase on the corresponding period last year.
Company outgoings were reduced by cuts in bank base rates. These pushed
interest payments down by 10 per cent between the successive quarters.
Taxation came down by 1.3 per cent and dividend payments on ordinary and
preference shares fell 10.9 per cent over the same period.
The overall financial deficit for companies in the first quarter came to
Pounds 147m, down from Pounds 2.1bn in the fourth quarter and the smallest
figure since the third quarter of 1987. Companies repaid bank loans
totalling a net Pounds 5.19bn.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Art sale total exceeds Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S secured its highest total for an Impressionist and modern art sale
in London for three years last night when it secured Pounds 20.35m from 84
lots. The top price was Pounds 3m paid for a 1937 abstract painting by
Kandinsky.
A work by Daumier, depicting a washerwoman, sold for Pounds 1.65m - below
forecasts but a record for the 19th-century artist. A portrait by Modigliani
of his sister more than doubled its estimate at Pounds 1.48m.
The 22 pictures from the collection of the late Madame d'Alayer, the
grand-daughter of the Parisian dealer of the first impressionists Paul
Durand-Ruel, all sold. They reached a total of Pounds 4.7m. A sketch by
Monet of a woman with an umbrella sold for Pounds 353,000, a record for a
Monet drawing, to a Japanese dealer. The Japanese were back in the saleroom
after a two-year absence.
The sale of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's on Monday night
produced the lowest unsold total by value - 16.4 per cent - for more than
three years. The 58 lots brought Pounds 17.9m, with the most desirable and
expensive paintings attracting keen interest.
A Renoir portrait of a young girl with a basket of flowers sold for Pounds
5.72m.
Meanwhile, Christie's is to sell the art collection of the dancer Rudolf
Nureyev, who died in January. The Pounds 4m expected to be raised from
auctions in London in December and in New York in January next year will
benefit two foundations established by Nureyev to help dancers and classical
dance.
Among the highlights of the sales are a painting by Fuseli inspired by
Milton's 'Paradise Lost', which carries an estimate of up to Dollars 700,000
(Pounds 466,667); a Roman marble torso of 'The Fillet Binder', based on the
Greek original (estimate up to Dollars 500,000); and a Reynolds portrait
(Dollars 600,000).

FT  23 JUN 93 / Job problems persist in confident Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB PROSPECTS in the west Midlands hinge on the performance of medium-sized
companies rather than the small-business sector, a survey of the regional
economy published today shows.
The survey of more than 1,000 companies by Price Waterhouse, accountants,
with the Warwick and Wolverhampton Business Schools, shows that 25 per cent
of medium-sized businesses have reported staff increases, compared with 12
per cent of small companies and 19 per cent of large companies.
Job prospects remain gloomy, however. Nearly half the companies expect their
employment needs to decrease, while 33 per cent expect to recruit more
labour in the second half of the year.
There are also the first signs of a skill-shortage problem in the region.
Last winter 41 per cent of companies found it easy to recruit needed skills.
This proportion has now fallen to 35 per cent. The number of companies
reporting recruitment problems since last winter has risen from 8 per cent
to 12 per cent.
These concerns appear against a background of sharply rising business
confidence, with 49 per cent of companies reporting better sales and 77 per
cent expecting improved trading conditions over the next six months. Indeed,
more companies are looking forward to future growth than at any time in the
past three years.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Hopes of steady recovery boosted: GDP rise 0.2 points higher
than thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER CONSUMER spending and strong export growth has led to a sharp upward
revision in economic activity, underlining hopes for a steady recovery later
this year.
Output in the first quarter was helped by the biggest six-monthly fall for
eight years in the proportion of consumer incomes directed to saving, and by
buoyant service-company investments.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that excluding oil and gas
extraction, gross domestic product in the first quarter grew by an
inflation-adjusted, year-on-year 0.9 per cent, up from an earlier estimate
of 0.7 per cent.
The savings ratio - consumer savings as a percentage of total disposable
income - fell to 10.3 per cent in the first quarter from 11.3 per cent in
the last quarter of 1992 and 12.1 per cent in the third quarter.
This large six-monthly fall was helped by lower interest rates reducing the
incentive for people to save. It released more cash for spending on goods
and services.
Excluding energy production, GDP expanded 0.7 per cent in the first quarter,
compared with the final quarter of last year. This was in line with earlier
estimates. Total quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the first three months is
put at 0.4 per cent, up from the initial estimate of 0.2 per cent two months
ago.
As a result of new data government statisticians reckon the economic decline
in the first half of last year was steeper than originally thought. They
have revised upwards their growth figures for the second half.
This means the recession is officially thought to have bottomed out about
spring of last year, with total GDP including oil and gas having expanded in
both the third and fourth three-monthly periods at a quarter-on-quarter 0.3
per cent. GDP in the first quarter was up 0.9 per cent compared with the
same quarter a year before.
Economic activity in the first quarter was helped by the pound's devaluation
boosting exports of goods and services. These grew 3.3 per cent from the
previous quarter and 6 per cent from a year previously. Imports of goods and
services expanded less, by 1.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively.
Consumer spending rose 0.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1992 and
the January-March period. Spending on durable goods rose 1 per cent, while
spending on energy fell 4.3 per cent due to mild weather. Real personal
disposable income fell 0.6 per cent between the two quarters, partly
reflecting a fall in employment and lower social security payments.

FT  23 JUN 93 / No increase in current-account deficit: Exports grow faster
than imports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in earnings from the export of services has failed to prevent an
increase in the current-account deficit to its highest quarterly level for
nearly three years.
The gap on the current account between all imports and exports - taking in
merchandise goods and invisible trade, covering services and financial
transfers - came to Pounds 4.01bn in the first quarter. This was up from
Pounds 3.88bn in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds 2.26bn in the
third quarter.
The surplus on invisible trade was Pounds 494m in the first quarter, little
changed from Pounds 474m in the previous three-month period. In the third
quarter of last year the invisibles surplus was Pounds 1.02bn.
The net income flowing into the UK from invisible trade helped to defray the
large deficit on visible, or merchandise, goods. This reached Pounds 4.5bn
in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 4.35bn in the last quarter of
last year.
One bright spot from the seasonally adjusted CSO figures is that the surplus
on services in the first quarter came to Pounds 1.15bn, up from Pounds 647m
in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds 892m in the July-September
period.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Mining group calls pit sale plans 'a farce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSM, the private mining group, yesterday condemned the government's plans to
privatise British Coal as a 'farce' and said it would not bid for any of the
20 pits put out to tender under the present rules.
The company was previously thought to be a likely bidder for some of the
mines. Its decision to keep out of the privatisation process is a further
blow to the government's plans to sell 20 of British Coal's pits.
Last month the Young Group, the independent mining company, said it was
withdrawing from the tender process.
Mr John Jermine, NSM chief executive, said: 'No one in their right mind is
going to buy the pits put out for tender by British Coal. 'The way the
process is being conducted shows how privatisation of the industry has
become a farce.'
The tender documents for the first four pits have recently been sent to
prospective buyers. Although NSM is heavily debt-laden, with borrowings of
more than Pounds 80m, it was seriously considering buying some of the pits
after its reorganisation last year.
Mr Jermine said the British Coal documents contained such punitive demands
that he believed the corporation remained intent on closing them. He
described Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, as acting as the
'government's receiver'.
As things stand, Mr Jermine has ruled NSM out of bidding for any other of
British Coal's pits put out to tender.
He identified four main clauses in the privatisation documents which he
believed made it financially unrewarding for any private company to bid for
the mines:
British Coal is selling mines which have no market for their coal.
It is not clear how much the private sector will have to pay for subsidence
in the pits put out to tender.
Restoration of the pits after the mines have been exhausted could run into
hundreds of millions of pounds.
British Coal has not made clear how it plans to use the subsidy from the
government.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, is
considering bidding for some of the 20 pits, although not for any of the
first four.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, recently said he would bid
for up to 11 pits in the belief that British Coal's concentration on the
electricity supply market leaves gaps in other markets.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Steaming into Bristol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULK carrier Pytchley yesterday became the largest ship to enter
Bristol's Royal Portbury dock when it delivered 37,000 tonnes of coal to
National Power, the electricity generator, at the company's new import
facility.
The facility, built at a cost of Pounds 80m, is likely to handle much less
than its 7m tonnes capacity this year. The government's decision to
subsidise output from at least a dozen British pits means that National
Power will import only about 1m tonnes this year and a similar amount next
year. But the company says the facility has already paid for itself by
forcing British Coal to reduce its prices in five-year contracts.
The port will also be used to import cars and commodities such as timber and
agricultural products. Unloading can take place at 4,000 tonnes an hour
compared with a previous rate of 4,000 tonnes a day.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Post Office chief demands sell-off decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of the Post Office, Mr Michael Heron, yesterday renewed calls
for a government decision on the company's privatisation.
A decision had been expected by the end of this month but the issue, which
has been dogged by controversy, is likely to be delayed by the illness of Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who suffered a heart attack
this week.
It was already delayed by the sacking in last month's government reshuffle
of Mr Edward Leigh, who was junior trade and industry minister.
Mr Heron said recent signals from the government threw 'very little light'
on whether privatisation would go ahead. 'When you're running a business,
the one thing that gets you is uncertainty,' he said.
As on previous occasions, Mr Heron refused to be drawn on his views on
privatisation. 'What we need is the freedom to meet the commercial
challenges of the future, which lie in technology and internationally,' he
said. 'Whether that means privatisation is for the government to judge.' He
was now hoping for a decision by the end of the year. 'If it goes beyond
that point, all you're doing is increasing the hill we've got to climb in
terms of opportunities and challenges,' he said.
Mr Heron said the board would prefer the businesses to be kept together if
privatised. He denied that morale in the Post Office was low as a result of
the delay. Although morale had suffered slightly, he said, it was still
higher than in most commercial organisations.
Mr Heron was presenting the Post Office's results for the year 1992-93.
Pre-tax profits were up 15 per cent at a record Pounds 283m - the 17th
successive year of unsubsidised profits.
The Post Office contributed Pounds 80m in cash to the Treasury over the
year, compared with a targeted contribution of Pounds 66m. Mr Heron
described the sharp rise to Pounds 181m required by the Treasury this year
as 'a daunting challenge'. He said the board was examining ways to raise the
money, and did not rule out higher letter prices, which have been frozen
since September 1991.
Profits from Royal Mail were down 5 per cent at Pounds 252m. Those at Post
Office Counters, the retail network, were down 4 per cent at Pounds 25m.
Losses at Parcelforce, the parcel delivery business, were reduced from
Pounds 24m to Pounds 13m. Postal workers in London are to vote on strike
action over compensation payments for compulsory transfer of staff between
sorting offices. The Union of Communications Workers said nearly 6,000 jobs
were due to be cut in London over the next three years because of the
introduction of new machinery.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Former miners' job hopes improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL Enterprise, the job creation arm of the mining industry,
yesterday reported a 60 per rise in job vacancies in recent weeks. It said
more than half of miners leaving the industry would be in work within six
months.
Last week Enterprise placed 279 ex-miners in jobs, the best figure for 18
months.
The company said it expected to find jobs for more than 80 per cent of
miners who sought its help within a year of losing their coal jobs. If the
record of previous years was maintained about a third of those who were
successful would maintain or improve their pay.
Mr David Pickering, Enterprise commercial director, said companies contacted
by his staff were optimistic about prospects and were taking on employees as
a result. In the last past six weeks there had been a 60 per cent rise in
advertised vacancies.
Although British Coal is contracting at an unprecedented rate, the number of
people leaving it in the past year or so has been much lower than the 35,000
annual job losses of the late 1980s. Fewer than 20,000 miners have left the
industry since last October.
Mr Philip Andrew, Enterprise chief executive, said about three quarters of
blue-collar workers leaving British Coal and virtually all white-collar
staff had sought the agency's help.
The increase in job opportunities was at the higher end of the pay scale, in
jobs with Pounds 15,000-plus salaries. Growth areas were in welding,
offshore oil and computer numerically controlled (CNC) skills, but not in
computers generally.
British Coal Enterprise plans to spend Pounds 50m in reviving former
coalfield economies this year. Last year the company helped create 11,136
jobs compared with 7,200 the year before. The cumulative total since 1985 is
more than 90,000.

FT  23 JUN 93 / British Coal backs National Forest project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has agreed to support the creation of the National Forest,
which would bring into being 200 sq miles of wooded landscape in central
England, and tailor land reclamation work towards it.
The National Forest development team and the property division of British
Coal yesterday published a charter, intended to define their future
relationship, which commits British Coal to tree planting as part of its
reclamation programmes.
The charter represents a shift in British Coal land policy, which previously
went against acting in areas where no legal obligation existed. Though
British Coal has no obligation to restore land used by pits which started
before 1947 - the majority of the landholdings in this case - the charter
says: 'British Coal will seek actively the land's restoration in accordance
with the National Forest strategy either directly or through a suitable
agency.'
The forest has government approval, and the Treasury and Department of the
Environment are examining the project's business plan.
Ms Susan Bell, development director of the project, said the charter was
'absolutely crucial' to the future of the forest. British Coal is the
largest landowner in the National Forest area, with 10 per cent.
One of the biggest environmental exercises in the UK, the National Forest
was conceived by the Countryside Commission in 1987 as a way of transforming
areas of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, which cover one of
the oldest UK coalfields. The collieries have closed, but opencast mining
continues.
Mr Tony Palmer, head of British Coal's property division, said: 'If we've
used the land for opencast, we normally have to rehabilitate it. In the past
that has tended to be towards agriculture.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler attacks Polly administrator
over party cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NORMAN Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, last night attacked
Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrator, for taking 18 months to reply to
the party's letter giving details of donations received from companies
associated with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
As the government rejected a Labour assault on 'sleaze and corruption' in
the party's funding, Sir Norman hoped the accountants would now 'start
dealing with us and will not seek to pursue this through the newspapers.'
The party confirmed last night Touche had asked for the return of the Pounds
440,000 donated by Mr Nadir's companies, but said the approach contained no
evidence the funds had been stolen.
The party is to consult its lawyers before replying. It has pledged to
return the money if it can be proved it has been stolen.
This latest twist to the saga came as the Tories maintained in the Commons
that financial support for political parties should be left on a voluntary
basis and not made a compulsory burden on the taxpayer.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, told MPs that Labour's hidden agenda in
the row over Conservative finances was to get its 'paws' on the public purse
by forcing the introduction of state funding for political parties. Labour's
financial 'crisis' had left it eager for the taxpayer to 'bail out their
sinking ship', he said.
Both Mr Hunt and Sir Norman attacked Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party
deputy leader, for choosing to lace her opening speech with 'rumour' and
'innuendo'. It was a 'shabby, irresponsible, miserable' speech of which he
thought Mrs Beckett would one day be ashamed, Mr Hunt said.
Mrs Beckett repeatedly sparked pandemonium on the Tory backbenches with the
forthrightness of her allusions to recent reports about the alleged trading
of contributions for honours and the extent to which the Conservative party
is funded by undisclosed or foreign donations.
For as long as the Conservative party would not reveal where it got 'more
than 50 per cent' of its money from, Mrs Beckett said, the suspicion would
exist that the damage that would be done if voters found out must be 'even
worse' than the damage being in-flicted at the moment.
While Mr Hunt attacked Labour's links with the trade unions, Mrs Beckett
maintained that the 'heart of the matter' was that a wide range of
allegations could be made because of the 'secrecy' that surrounded Tory
party accounts.
She said that the Hartley Investment Trust - the company which had given the
largest ever recorded donation to the Conservative party - had broken the
law by twice failing to file its annual accounts on time. Sir Marcus Fox,
chairman of the powerful Tory 1922 committee of Tory backbench MPs, was a
director of the company, she said.
After the debate ended amid a noisy storm of accusations and
counter-accusations, a Labour motion expressing concern at Mr Nadir's
donations and urging the government to begin proceedings against companies
making undeclared political donations was defeated by 291 votes to 250, a
government majority of 41.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil revenue tax change agreed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS finance committee yesterday passed the government's amendment to
the North Sea tax changes included in the Budget. The amendment will help to
cushion companies worst affected by the proposed changes to Petroleum
Revenue Tax, although opposition MPs argued that it does not go far enough
towards providing short term aid.
The amendment will make it easier for companies to claim the Pounds 200m
transitional relief earmarked in the government's Budget proposals.
Companies will be able to claim financial help with exploration and
appraisal work up to a cap of Pounds 10m per company until the end of next
year.
The changes to PRT included in the Finance Bill reduce the rate paid on
existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish tax relief for
exploration work. Opposition MPs on the committee argued that the changes
should be phased in over at least 3 years.

MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is unlikely to resume
ministerial responsibilities until late summer, Michael Cassell writes.
Mr Heseltine, who suffered a mild heart attack on Monday, is recovering in
hospital in Venice, where doctors yesterday were satisfied with his
progress. He is expected to remain there for a few days before being given
medical permission to be flown home.
In spite of Mr Heseltine's central role in Mr John Major's government it is
expected that he will not return to Westminster before the summer recess in
late July.
He would then be able to extend his period of recuperation well into the
holidays, with the possibility that he could re-emerge on the political
scene at the Tory party conference in early October.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit warns on Maastricht bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister and party chairman,
aligned himself with Mr Tony Benn,MP for Chesterfield and champion of
Labour's left wing, in opposing the Maastricht bill in the House of Lords
last night.
He also ruffled ministerial feathers by challenging an agreement between
government and opposition leaders on the time to be devoted to a debate on a
common European defence policy.
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, opted for a non-speaking role
as Lord Tebbit initially took the lead in attacking the bill from the
government back benches.
He stressed that he was at one with Mr Benn in resisting the federalist
tendencies of the European Community so as to ensure that basic decisions
affecting the British people were taken at Westminster and not Brussels.
Lord Tebbit then upset ministers by making an unsuccessful attempt to
prolong the discussion on a common defence policy on the grounds that
Baroness Chalker, foreign office minister, had failed to deal with all the
issues in making what was intended to be the final speech.
With no guillotine available to the government in the Lords arrangements for
an informal timetable assume special significance, particularly at the start
of a marathon committee stage - 430 amendments are already down for
discussion and more are expected.
Lady Chalker commented 'I do not think anything I say in this debate will
ever satisfy Lord Tebbit'.
In the first voting challenge - on an amendment moved by Lord Jay (Lab)
seeking to overturn the provision in the treaty imposing European
citizenship on British nationals - the government secured a majority of 194
(242-48).
Lord Tebbit forecast that, in spite of ministerial assurances that European
citizenship would confer new rights and no new responsibilities, British
nationals were likely to be subject to new demands, possibly including
conscription to the armed forces,as federalism gained momentum in the years
ahead.

one Tory and two Labour - made a week-long visit to northern Cyprus at the
invitation of the Turkish government.
Since then the Friends of Northern Cyprus parliamentary group has grown into
a sizeable and influential body with about 60 members from both houses of
parliament.
The group - registered with parliamentary authorities and structured like
scores of similar all-party bodies focusing on particular countries or
territories - campaigns for a settlement to the island's problems based on
the equal treatment of Turkish and Greek Cypriots.
Sir Keith Speed, the Conservative MP for Ashford who is the group's
chairman, said: 'Our aim is to try to bring a fair and just settlement for
all communities.' The group's position is broadly in sympathy with the
Turkish Cypriot cause.
The group has helped arrange visits by parliamentarians to northern Cyprus,
with expenses paid by the northern Cyprus authorities. The most recent was
during this year's Easter recess.
Twelve MPs from four parties took part in the Easter trip, which was led by
Mr Andrew Faulds, a vice chairman of the group. The visit - described as a
'perfectly standard trip' by Mr Faulds - combined meetings with senior
politicians with visits to archaeological sites, a brewery and an orange
juice factory.
Mr Faulds hopes to arrange a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, to report on the trip. He hopes there will be more trips.
The most recent register of MPs' interests indicates that four Conservative
MPs - Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mr Terry Dicks (Hayes &amp; Harlington), Mr
Peter Fry (Wellingborough) and Mr Robert Jones (Hertfordshire West) -
visited the island in September last year as guests of the northern Cyprus
authorities.
Sir Keith is one of at least three MPs with property in northern Cyprus  - a
three-bedroomed bungalow he bought in 1987. 'I spent more money doing it up
than on the property,' he said. It had been owned by the same Turkish
Cypriot family since 1955.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, lists two cottages in
northern Cyprus in the register of MPs' interests. He bought the property
from an Austrian before the island was divided and has 'been there' for 22
years.
Sir Dudley Smith, Tory MP for Warwick and Leamington, has leased a house in
north-ern Cyprus for eight years.
The group released a 220-word statement following Mr Asil Nadir's flight to
northern Cyprus urging him to 'consider his position and voluntarily return
to Britain where he can face the charges alleged against him'.
The statement went on: 'We cannot condone the breaking of bail by anyone to
flee from British justice.' But, alluding to Britain's refusal last year to
extradite a Turkish Cypriot woman who fled to the UK to avoid drug charges,
it argued that the government could not 'have it both ways'.
It added: 'The reason why there is no extradition treaty is because the UK
government will not recognise the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus.'
MPs belonging to the group express concern that Mr Nadir's action has made
the prospects of an acceptable settlement more remote.
Sir Keith said he had never met or spoken to Mr Nadir but admitted to
thinking on 'one or two occasions' it might have been 'a good idea' to try
to do so. He said he once met Mr Nadir's sister at a reception attended by
300 people.
He said his personal view as chairman of the group was that it would be best
to 'let the dust settle' before further trips to northern Cyprus by
parliamentarians were arranged. 'But it would not stop me from going on
holiday there.'
The chairman of the home affairs select committee last night hit back at the
101 Labour MPs who signed a 'silly' early day motion attacking him over an
expenses-paid visit to northern Cyprus.
Sir Ivan Lawrence said the MPs were 'shooting themselves in the foot' by
putting down such a motion, since those who went on the visit included some
'very highly respected' Labour MPs.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rebellion looms over allocation of
new EC seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is set to face a Euro-sceptic rebellion over legislation to
create six extra UK seats for the European parliament.
Debate on the legislation was originally planned for this week, but was
delayed because ministers feared a coalition involving almost all the
opposition parties and the Tory rebels might stop the bill in its tracks. It
is now provisionally scheduled for next week.
Under the planned arrangements five of the six extra seats will go to
England and one will go to Wales.
The boundaries of the new seats will be drawn up by committees appointed by
the home secretary.
Labour will put down an amendment refusing to allow the bill to proceed
because there is no provision for an extra seat for Scotland. A similar
tactic is planned by the Scottish National party.
Unless the amendment is framed in broader terms, however, it is unlikely to
attract the full range of potential opposition to the proposals, scuppering
the bill itself.
Instead, the most likely common strand of argument seems to be that the
seats should be allocated by the independent Boundary Commission - a demand
that is shared by some Tory Euro-rebels as well as opposition parties.
If the revolt resulted in the loss of the bill it would cause severe
diplomatic difficulties for the UK. The expansion of the European
parliament, in which the unified Germany will get an extra 18
representatives, was agreed at the Edinburgh summit last December. It was
decided that if any European Community country failed to make the necessary
arrangements then none of the new seats would be created.
Detailed discussion of the legislation is likely to take place in the
Commons as a whole, and will be difficult to guillotine. The elections will
take place in June next year.
Government business managers are cheered by the fairly limited scope for
amending the bill. In particular, planned amendments from the Liberal
Democrats to bring an element of proportional representation into the
elections seem likely to be ruled out of order.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour presses government over
party funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party disclosed yesterday that it had been contacted by
Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrators, for the first time since giving
the accountants details of the company's donations to the party some 18
months ago.
The move came as Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, led a vigorous Tory
assault against labour accusations of 'sleaze and corruption' in the party's
funding.
During a stormy Commons debate Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said
that he had just received a letter from Touche Ross.
The administrators had not previously been in touch since Sir John Cope,
then party deputy chairman, had written to them in October 1991 giving
details of the company's Pounds 440,000 donations to the Tories.
Sir Norman added: 'I hope Touche Ross now start dealing with us and will not
seek to pursue this through the newspapers.'
This latest twist to the saga came as the Conservatives argued strongly that
financial support for political parties should be left on a voluntary basis
and should not be made a compulsory burden on the taxpayer.
Mr Hunt told MPs that Labour's hidden agenda in the row over Conservative
finances was to get its 'paws' on the public purse by forcing the
introduction of state funding for political parties.
In a fighting speech which provoked howls of outrage on the crowded Labour
benches opposite, the employment secretary said Labour's financial 'crisis'
had left it eager for the taxpayer to 'bail out their sinking ship'.
Both Mr Hunt and Sir Norman attacked Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party
deputy leader, for choosing to lace her opening speech in yesterday's debate
on the funding of political parties with 'rumour' and 'innuendo'.
Mr Hunt said it was a 'shabby, irresponsible, miserable' speech of which he
thought Mrs Beckett would one day be ashamed.
Mrs Beckett repeatedly sparked pandemonium on the Tory backbenches with the
forthrightness of her allusions to recent reports about the alleged trading
of contributions for honours and the extent to which the Conservative party
is funded by undisclosed or foreign donations.
For as long as the Conservative party would not reveal where it got 'more
than 50 per cent' of its money from, she said, the suspicion would exist
that the damage that would be done if voters found out must be 'even worse'
than the damage being inflicted at the moment.
While Mr Hunt attacked Labour's links with the trade unions, Mrs Beckett
maintained that the 'heart of the matter' was that a wide range of
allegations could be made because of the 'secrecy' that surrounded the
accounts of the Conservative party.
In one of her more telling thrusts, Mrs Beckett said that the Hartley
Investment Trust - the company which had given the largest ever recorded
donation to the Conservative party - had broken the law by failing to file
accounts for the years ending March 1991 and March 1992 on time.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful Tory 1922 committee of Tory
backbench MPs, was a director of the company, she said.

UN FORCES should not be made to adopt a combat role in Bosnia, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, insisted yesterday.
He was responding to suggestions the rules of engagement for British troops
in UN humanitarian operations might have to be changed to allow for the task
of protecting civilians.
He said: 'We do not believe that the current rules of engagement need to be
changed in order to assist nations in their humanitarian efforts. Clearly if
any new mandate was to be considered, it would open the question as to
whether the rules were appropriate.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine set for lengthy absence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who suffered a mild
heart attack on Monday, is unlikely to resume his ministerial
responsibilities until late summer, Michael Cassell writes.
Mr Heseltine is recovering in hospital in Venice, where doctors said
yesterday they were satisfied with his progress. He is expected to remain
there for a few days before being given medical permission to be flown home.
In spite of Mr Heseltine's central role in Mr John Major's government it is
expected that he will not return to Westminster before the parliamentary
summer recess, towards the end of July.
He would then be able to extend his period of recuperation well into the
holidays, with the possibility that he could re-emerge on the political
scene at the Tory party conference in early October.
Mr Major said yesterday that Mr Heseltine was comfortable and news of his
progress was 'quite encouraging'. The British Embassy said the minister was
'cheerful'. His condition was satisfactory and he had seen his family during
the day.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Financial crisis hits biggest rail union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RMT transport union, which represents 105,000 workers mainly in the rail
and maritime sectors, faces a financial crisis.
The union spent Pounds 3.6m more than its Pounds 6.4m income in 1991, the
last year for which it has provided figures.
The crisis is likely to be exacerbated by a significant cut in income from
its core membership in British Rail. Officials say it could face a cut of
more than Pounds 1m in income following BR's decision to stop 'check-off'
facilities - the automatic deduction of union dues from pay packets.
The union has won a new reputation for militancy in the past few months with
two one-day strikes against rail privatisation and a decision to hold a
ballot on industrial action over the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit.
As a result of the industrial action against privatisation BR said it would
withdraw check-off, which has existed since 1965. It had been expected that
BR might change its mind, but the union executive has pre-empted this and
decided it does not want to continue with check-off as long as it can be
used as a weapon against the union.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's leader, put a brave face on the move. He said:
'Leaving check-off could be a blessing in disguise, we are going to have to
re-learn some old organisational lessons.'
The union hopes that a majority of members will switch to direct debit
payments from their bank accounts, but a sizeable minority of 30 per cent to
40 per cent are expected to pay union collectors. One official said that
between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of the 68,000 members in BR were likely
to stop paying dues altogether.
The same official admitted that the union had financial problems but
stressed that the 1991 deficit was partly a result of the cost of mergers
and said the figure was substantially lower last year.
'The danger is that the income loss from ending check-off could push the
deficit back up,' he said.
Like many unions the RMT's expenditure - Pounds 10m in 1991 - was not
initially cut in line with the fall in membership income caused by large job
cuts on the railways. The union has assets of more than Pounds 12m, but most
of that is tied up in property.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Faint heckle from dispirited Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL DEENY, chair-man of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, forecast
at the Lloyd's annual meeting yesterday that the market was about to embark
on 'the biggest and most costly exercise in the history of debt collecting'.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, announced that 1990 losses were Pounds 2.9bn -
even greater than the total he forecast less than two months ago.
Names were left in no doubt about the momentous nature of the occasion. Mr
Rowland said the loss 'represents in every way the low point of Lloyd's
history in the last 305 years'.
Most of the Names questioning Mr Rowland spoke in a dispirited fashion, as
if they had already given vent to most of their anger at a much bigger
meeting of Names at the Royal Albert Hall last month.
Mr Edward Sherwell, a steward at the Royal Festival Hall, said at the start
of the meeting: 'It will obviously be a very sad day.'
And so it proved - even bleaker than a conference of the Communist party
that Mr Sherwell recalled when everybody had been grey, even the children.
Only about 1,200 Names attended - including many who work at the insurance
market - leaving the concert hall half empty. In a three-hour presentation
Mr Rowland and his fellow council members on the platform were heckled only
occasionally.
One critic, Mr John Podmore, unexpectedly launched an attack. What was Mr
Rowland doing about the Names who had lost or had taken their lives and the
'ultimate absolutely appalling destruction of quality of life' suffered by
many Names? 'This must be atoned for by the society,' said Mr Podmore or
'those who have been fleeced will have their revenge,' he concluded with a
flourish.
Accusations that Lloyd's was allowing corporate investors to participate on
more favourable terms than its existing Names drew mild applause.
But by 1.25pm many Names were already trooping out of the hall, leaving only
a handful of dissidents to vote against approval of the annual report and
accounts.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Sale cleared after attack on Kuwait: Arms-for-Iraq Inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT cleared an export licence for ammunition to Jordan made by
the munitions company Royal Ordnance six weeks after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, it emerged yesterday.
The Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry has been told that from November 1984 Jordan
was suspected of being used to channel equipment to Iraq.
Further official documents made available to Lord Justice Scott show defence
exports to Jordan continuing until at least September 14 1990.
On that day the Department of Trade and Industry cleared the export licence
for artillery shells from Royal Ordnance, the armaments subsidiary of
British Aerospace, after the contract had been vetted by the Ministry of
Defence.
Lt-Col Richard Glazebrook, a former MoD official, told the inquiry that the
licence involved a contract for ammunition previously sent to Jordan which
had proved faulty.
It was approved in spite of what Lt-Col Glazebrook called 'cumulative
evidence' from defence intelligence that Jordan was being used by Iraq to
help build up its arsenal. During yesterday's hearing the inquiry's counsel,
Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, referred to further government documents which
show that in July 1988 senior MoD officials were told by the chief of staff
of the Jordanian armed forces, Field Marshall Bin Shaker, that Jordan had
been officially pressed by Iraq to act as a 'front' for defence contracts.
This did not alter government policy, which was that Jordan fell outside
guidelines restricting defence sales to Iraq and Iran and that the UK should
minimise disruption to its trade links with Amman.
Lt-Col Glazebrook confirmed yesterday that in 1988 and 1989 the government
approved contracts with Jordan for artillery fuses and explosive booster
pellets involving Ordinance Technology, a military engineering company. The
main contractor was named as Space Research Corporation, the company at the
centre of the Iraqi supergun project.
Executives of the company were given suspended sentences last year for
conspiring to ship illegally artillery fuses for long-range shells to Iraq.
They are appealing on the grounds that they were prevented from seeing
evidence of government collusion in arms sales to Iraq.

FT  23 JUN 93 / 2% limit on water bill rises urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday called for rises in water
bills to be held to about 2 per cent a year in line with likely rises in
household income.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Escalating price increases
must stop.' He added: 'A continuing increase in prices, well above the rate
of inflation, will not be acceptable to customers.'
Ofwat's report for the year to March, published yesterday, showed that
customer complaints to its regional committees rose by 39 per cent last year
to 14,795. Of these, 62 per cent were about rising prices and other problems
with bills.
The sharp annual rises in bills are being caused by the industry's
modernisation, costing about Pounds 45bn, which is required by new UK and
European environmental rules.

The move follows controversy over tests for children at seven and 14.
Mr Eamon O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the idea was likely to face
similar opposition from teachers and parents.
The idea of tests for children starting school was seized on by Mr Patten
when it was mentioned on the Sky News television programme Target. He said:
'I think it might be a very good idea to have some judgment. If teachers are
worried that children are coming in at rising five at different levels,
different backgrounds and the rest of it, and it is therefore very difficult
to judge their progress at seven, what we need is something very simple to
measure what their standards are when they enter school.'
Mr O'Kane said: 'After the ham-fisted way the other tests have been handled,
the idea of having yet another tier of them isn't a principle we are likely
to endorse.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Healthcare spending curbs are 'likely to fail'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK HEALTH spending will rise from 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product in
1988 to more than 6.6 per cent by 1998, says a survey of 425 leading
professionals in the healthcare sector.
The increase - generated by more expensive procedures, an ageing population,
harder-to-treat illnesses such as Aids and cancer, and higher expectations
of care among patients - is forecast in spite of government initiatives to
control spending.
The growing demand will lead to yet further changes in healthcare provision,
according to the survey, part of a pan-European study commissioned by
Andersen Consulting and consultants Burson-Marsteller.
The report says a tiered system of care on two or more levels is likely to
emerge. More than 75 per cent of those polled expect that there will be a
specified minimum level of care by 1998. Rationing of services is also
expected - more than half of those surveyed expect certain expensive
treatments to be excluded from some of the population.
Some patients are also likely to be excluded from less expensive services
for reasons such as age - the report gives the example of dialysis for
elderly patients.
Attempts by hospitals to control costs will lead to 22.5 per cent fewer
acute beds by 1998 than there were in 1990 as more patients are treated on a
daycare or out-patient basis, rather than being admitted overnight.
Hospitals will compete increasingly with general practitioners, who will be
looking to expand the scope of their practices to include minor surgery and
other non-specialist procedures.
The survey predicts that competition between hospitals for business will
alter the way hospitals are managed. More than half of those polled expect
information technology to lead to a significant improvement in the quality
of patient care.
The use of non-patented generic drugs will be encouraged, according to 97
per cent of those polled. More than 93 per cent expect NHS doctors to be
limited in the range of drugs they can prescribe, 38 per cent expect
controls on drug company profits and 57 per cent expect the introduction of
price controls on medicines.
Patients will pay a greater share of the cost of their medicines, the survey
says. More than 80 per cent of healthcare professionals expect patients to
pay more for their prescriptions and 75 per cent expect an increase in the
use of over-the-counter, non-prescription drugs which are paid for by the
patient, not the government.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Lloyd's reserves rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAPITAL base of Lloyd's of London has been dented by the insurance
market's record losses of Pounds 2.91bn, but a strong increase in the
reserves held to pay future claims mean that the deterioration has been less
marked than feared.
Overall net assets fell to Pounds 6.09bn as at the end of December 1992,
from the previous year's Pounds 6.54bn. The fall in the assets held by
Names, the individuals whose assets support the market, was compensated for
by a rise in the size of the central fund, which meets claims when Names are
unable to meet their obligations, along with an increase in other reserves.
Members' means declined from Pounds 7.30bn in 1991 to Pounds 6.38bn. These
include so-called 'funds at Lloyd's' (deposits, personal reserves and
special reserves) and other members' assets.
The net assets of the central fund increased to Pounds 1.15bn from Pounds
445m. Net assets of the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administrates and
regulates the market, fell from Pounds 263m to Pounds 252m.
Premium income - after brokerage and commission - amounted to Pounds 6.4bn
in 1992, compared with Pounds 5.01bn in 1991. An increase from Pounds 7.82bn
to Pounds 10.85bn in reinsurance premiums paid by syndicates to close their
1990 year of account also helped swell income in the premium trust funds.
Overall the US, Canadian and sterling premium trust fund plus some other
monies held by Lloyd's to meet claims grew to Pounds 16.66bn from Pounds
12.26bn.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 2,915m was made up of losses of Pounds 1,328m
(Pounds 2,063m in 1991) from business underwritten in 1990 and a further
Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 396m) in reserves to pay future claims on business
underwritten in earlier years.
Personal expenses of Pounds 457m (Pounds 292m) include a levy of 1.66 per
cent from each Name's 1990 premium income limit credited to the central
fund.
Provisions for current and future liabilities rose to Pounds 18.25bn from
Pounds 13.72bn.
Of the 388 syndicates trading during 1990, 115 produced a profit after
personal expenses.
The burden on Names of the special levy led to a sharp increase in market
costs to Pounds 1.43bn from Pounds 921m. Syndicate expenses fell marginally
to Pounds 671m from Pounds 673m.
Names' subscriptions fell from Pounds 55m to Pounds 51m, central fund
subscriptions from Pounds 62m to Pounds 4m, and agents' fees rose Pounds 2m
to Pounds 129m.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Judge allows group action on cash machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JUDGE yesterday cleared the way for a mass legal action against banks and
building societies by customers claiming to have lost money through
fraudulent or 'phantom' withdrawals from automated teller machines.
In the first significant judgment in the 'phantom withdrawals' action, Judge
John Hicks QC allowed the actions to proceed together initially.
But he made clear that judgments in cases where plaintiffs claim that bank
technology has allowed withdrawals from their accounts even though they had
not disclosed their personal identification numbers to others would
eventually be made individually in the county courts.
The judge also rejected as 'misconceived' an attempt to force the
organisations involved - Barclays, Midland, Lloyds, TSB and Nationwide
Building Society - to write to all customers telling them of the legal case
and that they could join the action.
The decision extends the practice of allowing mass actions in the civil
courts. Mass actions have been common in cases involving disasters or the
side-effects of drugs such as Thalidomide, where there is a single cause
behind the complaints.
This is thought to be the first occasion a mass action has been allowed when
there are several different causes. In this case, there are differences in
the cash machine systems operated by the banks.
The test case involves nine customers claiming the return of a total of
between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 20,000. The lead case involves Mr and Mrs
James McConville, from St Helens, Merseyside, who say they lost Pounds 400
after their cash card was stolen.
Following the judgment Barclays Bank said that it was to test the use of
cameras at six machine sites. The bank said this would aid its efforts to
prevent card fraud by allowing it to identify those carrying out fraudulent
withdrawals.
J. Keith Park, the solicitors co-ordinating the group action, said the
judgment was a victory because it would allow legal costs to be spread, and
give individual claimants the confidence to pursue actions against large
banks and societies.
The solicitors expect a further 30 customers and at least six further
defendants - NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Abbey National, Halifax and
Woolwich Building Societies and Western Trust and Savings Bank - to become
involved in the action.
The judge said the plaintiffs could use 'any means properly open to them' to
encourage other bank customers with complaints about withdrawals to join the
action.
Mr Nick Davis, of J. Keith Park, said the firm had received about 1,000
inquiries from people claiming to have lost amounts from Pounds 40 to Pounds
9,000. National Westminster Bank is raising charges to retailers for which
it processes credit and debit card transactions. The rise - averaging 7 per
cent for credit cards and 9 per cent for debit cards - follows similar rises
by other banks.
The bank said it was offering to waive the increases to retailers who hired
machines to check transactions for fraud electronically.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Du Cann meets creditors to ward off bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR EDWARD du Cann, a former chairman of the Conservative party and of
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday met his creditors
in an attempt to stave off personal bankruptcy.
Sir Edward said he had put proposals for paying off a proportion of his
debts to creditors at the meeting. He described the meeting as 'useful'.
Under an individual voluntary arrangement scheme 75 per cent of the
creditors (in value) have to vote in favour for an agreement to go through.
The only vote taken yesterday ratified a decision to adjourn the meeting for
14 days. No vote was taken on Sir Edward's proposals, which he said were a
'private matter between creditors and myself'.
Two separate sources said, however, that Sir Edward had offered creditors
about 40p in the pound if they agreed to a voluntary arrangement.
Creditors include the Leeds Permanent Building Society, the Inland Revenue
and the City law firm Denton Hall Burgin and Warrens, legal advisers to
Lonrho.
Sir Edward resigned as a director of Homes Assured, the mortgage company
which collapsed in 1989, just days before its liquidation. The ensuing
controversy led to his resignation from Lonrho.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Women lose out over 'networking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEN ARE seven times more likely than women to get a job by using personal
contacts, says a survey of redundant executives.
InterExec, the employment consultancy which carried out the survey, said
women had fewer female contemporaries at senior levels in business and find
it difficult to approach men to gain information about job opportunities.
The consultancy found that over the past 12 months, out of 500 redundant
executives who had been earning more than Pounds 30,000 a year, 70 per cent
of men obtained jobs by 'networking', while only 10 per cent of women got
jobs using the technique.
Mr Nick Hawkins, InterExec's chairman, said senior women were more reliant
on job advertisements and professional help than men.
Women were losing out because 63 per cent of top jobs were not advertised.
The Industrial Society said the results might indicate that women faced
discrimination when they attempted to network, and not that they were
failing to usecontacts.
Ms Jo Gardiner, Industrial Society national campaigns leader, said she
thought it unlikely that women were reluctant to contact men about job
opportunities because of a possible misunderstanding. 'The senior women I
know take a professional approach and have the courage of their convictions
 -that's how they've got where they are.'
She said women lacked the 'old boy' contacts that men had, and that was why
concerted efforts had been made by women in, for example, the City, law and
advertising, to set up networks. The Industrial Society's own network for
junior- and middle-level women in all sectors - the Pepperell network - was
launched in October and has about 1,000 members.

FT  23 JUN 93 / 2% limit on water bill rises urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday called for rises in water
bills to be held to about 2 per cent a year, in line with likely rises in
household income, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Escalating price increases
must stop.' He added: 'A continuing increase in prices, well above the rate
of inflation, will not be acceptable to customers.'
Ofwat's annual report for the year to March 1993, published yesterday,
showed that customer complaints to its regional committees rose by 39 per
cent last year to 14,795. Of these, 62 per cent were about rising prices and
other problems with bills.
The sharp annual rises in bills are due to the industry's modernisation,
costing some Pounds 45bn, which is driven by new UK and European
environmental regulations.
Mr Byatt said yesterday that the water companies' market plans, which
estimate capital spending for the next decade, showed that water prices
would have to rise by an average 6.25 per cent a year between 1995 and 2000
on top of inflation to cover all likely spending.
The report also said that despite a 12 per cent reduction during the year,
disconnections remained high with 18,635 homes cut off.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Face change, US steelmakers told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE big integrated US steel companies and their unions were accused
yesterday of being resistant to change, and told that protectionism was not
a solution to their problems.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, speaking at
a steel conference in New York, said the US integrated steel industry 'puts
me in mind not of the dinosaur, to which it is often compared, but rather
the ostrich.'
He said movements in competitive positions based on cost/price relationships
and exchange rate swings, along with new technology, should by now have led
to a fundamental reassessment by US integrated steel of its position in the
market place.
'Instead,' he said 'there has been a tendency to push the blame for the
growing problems onto some external agency, the curbing of which might
facilitate a return to prosperity. This comfortable response allows
companies to avoid facing up to the necessity of change, and to defer their
problems for the time being.'
Mr Moffat's speech comes a day after he criticised continuing state
subsidies for steelmakers in Spain and Italy, and urged the European
Commission to press ahead with its restructuring plan for the European steel
industry.
Mr Moffat said the US provided a good example of the problems which arise
from recourse to protection. Imports' share of the US market had risen by 6
percentage points to 18 per cent over the period from 1973 to 1992, in line
with the worldwide trend towards expansion of trade.
Yet in the same period the US integrated producers' share of the US market
had fallen by 29 percentage points to 33 per cent.
The beneficiaries had been the mini-mills, up 16 percentage points to 22 per
cent, and the 'reconstituted mills' - companies reorganised under Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings and management buy-outs, which now take 27 per cent
of the market.
Mr Moffat said that, while he did not dispute the right of countries to take
action against genuinely unfair and injurious imports, 'I strongly believe
that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should play an increasingly
important role in the determination of such decisions.'
He suggested industry should enter into a multilateral steel agreement,
which would underpin the elimination of subsidies, encourage privatisation
and result in less government interference. 'Anti-dumping actions and
subsidies are merely delaying actions. They will not solve the problems the
industry faces.'

Canada is Australia's fourth biggest and fastest growing beef market. Sales
were expected to reach ADollars 150m (Pounds 67.5m) this year.
The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had earlier challenged the
tribunal finding and had lodged an appeal with the Canadian court of appeal.
The two countries are leading members of the Cairns group of agricultural
exporters lobbying against protectionist moves.

Kamaz, Russia's biggest truck manufacturer, said yesterday it had obtained
promises of Rbs30bn in cheap state credits to rebuild an engine plant
destroyed by fire, but was still looking for a foreign partner to invest
about Dollars 200m, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow.
The group, one of the first to be privatised in the former Soviet Union,
said it wanted to restore half the old engine-producing capacity to how it
was while replacing the other half with a foreign joint venture producing a
new type of diesel engine.
Mr Leonid Komm, finance director, said in an interview the company was
examining proposals from leading western diesel engine manufacturers. This
included Cummins of the US.

THE European Investment Bank and the Lisbon government have signed contracts
for Es95.5bn (Pounds 400m) in loans to Portugal for use in industry, energy
and infrastructure projects, Peter Wise writes from Lisbon.
The main Es55.7bn loan will go to AutoEuropa, the Es300bn Ford/Volkswagen
joint venture that will begin manufacturing passenger vehicles in southern
Portugal in 1995.
Two loans totalling Es17bn will be used to finance small and medium-sized
companies in industry, industrial services and tourism. Two other loans of
Es6bn each will finance roads. Among other loans, one of Es5.7bn will be
used to improve energy facilities on the Azores islands.
The loans bring total EIB lending to Portugal in 1993 to Es137bn. But other
approved projects are expected to lift the total to Es330bn.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Some bend in a hard market debate - Some
of the heat has come out of the clash over steel sales / Trade Across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
THERE is a giant with his foot in the door, says Mr Ruprecht Vondran,
president of the German Steel Federation. He has already overturned a few
chairs, but that should not prevent us from inviting him in and offering him
a seat.
We should take care, however, that 'he does not bring the roof down, or even
the whole house to tumble around our ears'.
Mr Vondran's colourful language, in a recent speech in Berlin, was a
reference to imports of steel from the former Comecon countries, a giant of
the world steel industry with more than 210m tonnes of crude production
capacity.
Yet, after two years of east-west recrimination and amid continuing
recession in the European steel market, it now looks less likely that the
house will tumble down.
About three-quarters of the old eastern bloc's steel production is in the
former Soviet Union, but it is the remaining 56m tonnes, largely in Romania,
Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics, that is being blamed for adding
to the problems of German and other western European steel companies in the
past two years.
The European Community's trade balance with the former Comecon countries has
shifted from a deficit of 400,000 tonnes in 1989 to nearly 4m tonnes last
year. More than 80 per cent of the 4.8m tonnes exported to the leading
western buyer countries goes to the EC and countries of the European Free
Trade Association.
Last year, about 380,000 tonnes of steel a month reached the EC from the old
Comecon countries, with the former Czechoslovakia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States accounting for about 250,000 tonnes in total, and the
rest shared in descending order by Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.
Imports from the eastern countries to the EC generated considerably more
heat than might seem justified by the market share they took last year -
just 3 per cent.
But western producers complained loudly that unfairly subsidised eastern
European steel, mainly long products such as reinforcing bar for concrete,
merchant bars and wire rod, undercut the price of western equivalents and
further destabilised an already weak market.
Whatever the merits of the case, there is little doubt that exports to the
EC have provided a lifeline for the eastern producers. Mr Jeremy Fletcher,
an independent steel consultant, says the east European producers have seen
domestic demand for steel fall sharply, but have been more affected by a
breakdown in the financial system which means customers cannot pay for
steel.
On top of that, steel prices have been kept artificially low in domestic
markets to enhance the competitiveness of the customer base in industry.
Consequently, the western European market and prices look attractive. More
than that, however, exports to the EC have generated cash that has been
reinvested in the east's nascent modernisation efforts. 'That's a very good
thing,' says Mr Fletcher, 'as it is saving the west a lot of money.'
Although ceilings are being placed for three years on imports of Czech wire
rod, and various hot- and cold-rolled steels from both the Czech and Slovak
republics, the prevailing trend is towards free trade.
It is clear both western and eastern producers have taken note of the
political realities in Brussels, which is unwilling to block eastern
producers out of their closest export markets - because of the wider issues
involved for the fledgling democracies - and yet painfully aware of the
western producers' problems.
But the approach of the eastern producers has also changed. 'In the first
two years they were so nave, selling at prices so far below the market that
they were not getting the full benefit,' says Mr Fletcher. 'Now they are
getting better revenues and profits from limited volumes.'
Steel imports from eastern Europe to the EC are likely to continue to rise,
but not greatly, experts say. 'I can see them steadily increasing over the
next few years, although not to 10m tonnes or anything like that,' says Mr
Peter Fish, managing director of the Sheffield-based steel consultancy Meps
Europe.
From 1994, he says, the relationship will be much like that between the EC
and Efta countries - 'living together in slightly different trading blocs,
making agreements and then getting on with it,' he says.
But, for at least the next five years, the cash generated from sales in
Europe will remain crucial to financing the eastern producers' moves to
raise efficiency, close the most outdated capacity and wean themselves from
indirect subsidies such as cheap ore.
That modernisation process still has a long way to go, and has gone furthest
in Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics. But western producers and
spokesmen such as Mr Vondran see the process as a crucial quid pro quo for
allowing eastern companies a foot in the door at home - and eventually
forging the two industries into one.
There will be further articles on trade between eastern and western Europe
in coming weeks

<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials were optimistic yesterday that recent political turmoil
in Japan would not upset trade talks taking place in Tokyo from today.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, minister for international trade and industry, said
yesterday that while the government was divided on political reform, there
was no fundamental disagreement over trade policy.
Trade ministers from the US, Canada, the EC and Japan are meeting in Tokyo
for two days of talks designed to spur the stalled Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The countries are aiming for agreement on market access, centring on mutual
elimination and harmonisation of tariffs, by the end of the year.
Mr Peter Sutherland, newly appointed director general of Gatt, said earlier
this month that failure to agree on market access in Tokyo could sink
prospects for concluding the Round.
Mr Mori indicated that market access agreements on such issues as tariff
reductions for Japanese processed farm products, for example, were not
likely to come now.
According to a government official close to the talks, there is only limited
Japanese scope for further tariff cuts in two contentious areas  - distilled
spirits and forest products.
Japan has implemented a 50 per cent reduction in tariffs on distilled
spirits since the Uruguay Round talks were started in 1986. 'Importers have
increased market share and the Japanese industry is not in a strong
situation so it is difficult to talk about a zero-for-zero option,' the
official said.
On forest products, the Japanese also believe they have made substantial
concessions in a bilateral agreement with the US, made on the understanding
it would be part of the Uruguay Round. 'We feel that we cannot go much
further,' the official said.

<TEXT>
Australia is to lodge a complaint with Gatt over Canadian moves to impose a
25 per cent tariff on Australian beef imports, Emilia Tagaza writes from
Melbourne.
The tariff, which will be in effect for the rest of 1993, was imposed after
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal found there was a potential threat
to the Canadian industry if beef imports continued at current levels.
Canada is Australia's fourth biggest and fastest growing beef market. Sales
were expected to reach ADollars 150m (Pounds 67.5m) this year.
The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had earlier challenged the
tribunal finding and had lodged an appeal with the Canadian court of appeal.
Canada and Australia are key members of the Cairns group of agricultural
exporters lobbying against protectionist moves.

NEW TALKS aimed at restoring exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
power in Haiti are expected to begin later this week following a 'positive'
response from the country's military rulers, Mr Dante Caputo, the special UN
mediator, said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in
New York.
Mr Caputo said a letter from General Raoul Cedras, chief of Haiti's armed
forces, saying he was willing to meet Fr Aristide, 'opens up possibilities
for fruitful negotiations'. Gen Cedras led the September 1991 coup that
ousted the president.
However, a UN spokesman said sanctions against Haiti were still likely to go
into effect today, despite the apparent progress. The Security Council last
week ordered an oil and arms embargo against the Caribbean country but
delayed its implementation pending new efforts to reinstate Fr Aristide.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP MORRIS and RJR Nabisco, the two largest US tobacco companies,
yesterday sued the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming its report on
the dangers of passive smoking was unscientific, 'arbitrary' and
'capricious'.
The companies claimed the agency reached its conclusion that environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS) was a cancer-causing substance 'only by manipulating and
cherry-picking data, ignoring critical statistical studies and chemical
analyses, failing to account for confounding factors and sources of bias
(and) violating basic statistical principles'.
Their suit, which is backed by other industry groups, also argued that the
EPA's scientific guidelines were violated.
The legal action follows a high-profile EPA report, published in January,
which classed ETS as a class A carcinogen. This is the most serious category
of cancer-causing material.
The EPA report indicated that about 3,000 US non-smokers die from lung
cancer caused by exposure to tobacco fumes each year, and that exposure to
ETS increases the risk of asthma in 'normal' children. It could also
increase the severity of symptoms in children prone to asthma, the agency
said.
A draft version of the EPA's study, published three years ago, was attacked
by the industry and was sent back by a science advisory board for better
justification of its conclusions.
However, since its publication the report has been used by anti-smoking
activists to demand more restrictions on smoking in public places, and has
almost certainly contributed to an increasingly proscriptive climate in the
US.
Most states now have some restrictions on smoking in public areas.
The suit was filed with the district court for the middle district of North
Carolina.

CONTINUING delays in talks on a new accord with the International Monetary
Fund are jeopardising Brazil's agreement with the Paris Club of official
creditors.
The Paris Club agreement, for the refinancing of Dollars 21bn (Pounds 14bn)
official debt, was signed in February 1992 shortly after Brazil had
successfully negotiated a standby loan with the IMF - an essential condition
of the deal. The subsequent collapse of the IMF accord forced Brazil to seek
a waiver from the Paris Club in January, which expired three weeks ago.
The Paris Club will meet tomorrow to decide whether to grant Brazil a new
waiver or declare the country in default. On Monday Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, Brazil's new finance minister, met ambassadors from Group of Seven
industrialised countries to ask for 'understanding and support' in the wake
of his new economic plan.
He pointed out that a technical team from the IMF was due in mid-July to
reassess the economic situation and that Brazil was still on track to
complete a Brady-type deal with its commercial creditors in November.
Although Paris Club members are unhappy about Brazil's poor record with the
IMF, they are thought unlikely to declare default, particularly as 11 of the
13 countries have now signed bilateral agreements with Brazil.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Venezuela's central bank keeps its head: What happened when
all around were losing theirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA has this year passed through a political crisis that in times past
would have brought a collapse in economic confidence and a run on the
currency.
Yet despite two failed military coup attempts last year, the suspension this
year of President Carlos Andres Perez on corruption charges and forthcoming
presidential elections in December, there has been no panic flight of
capital.
The credit for breaking the vicious cycle between political and economic
stability is widely laid at the door of one of the institutional reforms
promoted by Mr Perez: the creation of an independent central bank whose sole
focus would be on maintaining monetary stability.
The central bank's new autonomy hangs on a law that went on to the statute
books on December 4. A new six-strong board was appointed by Mr Perez on
December 23. The central bank president, Ms Ruth de Krivoy, was appointed
for a five-year term.
Her successor will be chosen by the president and must be ratified by a
two-thirds majority of the senate. At the end of May, the bank completed its
transition by withdrawing from responsibilities to provide export finance.
'The independence of the central bank has meant a profound change in the way
politics and economics relate. Because we have more efficient decision
making in terms of monetary policy, the central bank was able to move
effectively to counteract the shock to the financial markets arising from
the political uncertainty,' said Ms De Krivoy in an interview.
The shock was a sharp drop in the demand for money caused by the political
crisis. To counteract this and to protect the Venezuelan currency, the
bolivar, the central bank raised interest rates sharply. Benchmark interest
rates (on 91-day central bank zero-coupon notes) almost touched 70 per cent
simple around May 19, the day before the supreme court voted that there was
a case for the impeachment of Mr Perez. More conventionally expressed in
compound interest terms, assuming reinvestment, this is an annual interest
rate of 90 per cent in a country where inflation is running in the mid-30s.
As a result, foreign exchange reserves rose in April and were steady during
May. The reflow of capital that occurred was a break with the past,
suggested Ms de Krivoy. 'In the past, in an election year and with political
uncertainties, our experience was that capital flows were a one-way traffic
out of the country and would not have come back before the elections.'
Bankers in Caracas agree that the central bank was an important bulwark
against instability during the political crisis. But they criticise the bank
for allowing interest rates to fall too rapidly in early May, which meant
only that they had to be jacked up again sharply later in the month.
The rapid fall in interest rates suggests to some that, nominally
independent though the central bank is, it is prey to political influence.
As benchmark interest rates fell below 42 per cent last week, some bankers
reckoned rates had again - perhaps for political reasons - been allowed to
fall too far for comfort.
Some financiers believe Ms de Krivoy is walking a fine line between trying
to establish the central bank's reputation as an independent agency while
not exposing her own position for what it is: precarious.
Unlike her successors, Ms de Krivoy was not confirmed by the senate, and the
institution has little popular support. Furthermore, according to the new
central bank law, the president and the directors can be removed by the
president for a variety of reasons, including 'failure to perform the
responsibilities of the position'.
Thus while the central bank may have some independence when the executive is
weak, as it has been this year, things would be different under a strong
president. 'If (presidential candidate Rafael) Caldera becomes president,
Ruth de Krivoy will be history,' said one banker. Mr Caldera, a former
president offering a populist election platform, is one of two leading
contenders.
Furthermore, unless action is taken by Congress to cut the budget deficit,
interest rates will have to remain high for some time, intensifying already
significant pressure on the central bank.
Ms de Krivoy does not deny that high interest rates will take its toll on
the economy: 'Growth this year will be low.' She declined to be more
specific, but growth of between 2 and 4 per cent does not seem out of the
question, compared with last year's 7 per cent and the 1991 figure of more
than 10 per cent.
She said the central bank had taken the course that - given the political
uncertainty and a budget deficit that remains a cause of concern to
financial markets - it believed would minimise social costs, the impact on
inflation and on international reserves.
The key to sustainably lower interest rates, according to the central bank
president, is a period of political stability and action by congress to
reduce the budget deficit. This ran at 6 per cent of gross domestic product
last year and is expected to be 4 or more per cent this year. Tax
legislation will be needed this year - a proposed partial value added tax
and a corporate assets tax - to bring it down to 2 per cent next year.
Legislators differ on the probability of this going into law this year. The
tax bills are likely to be included in an enabling law which congress must
pass before its session ends on August 15 before the elections. This would
allow the bills to be enacted by presidential decree.
In the mean time, the central bank has some communicating to do. 'We have to
explain that it's not just a matter of forcing interest rates to come down
in a way that doesn't reflect the true situation of the country,' said Ms de
Krivoy.

The border monitor force could become the vanguard of a broader UN truce
supervision mission of around 2,000 if a peace accord is signed tomorrow, UN
officials said.

MS RUTH Richardson, New Zealand finance minister, said yesterday her
election-year budget next week would stick to economic policies that have
led the country out of economic crisis but made the government deeply
unpopular, Reuter reports from Wellington.
She said in an interview that the July 1 budget - five months before a
general election - would display fiscal responsibility to maintain New
Zealand's economic recovery.
Ms Richardson said she expected the deficit to swing into surplus before the
turn of the century.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Enduring foe of Japan's provinces: Robert Thomson visits a
once-thriving city blighted by the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT much prompting, the residents of Kamaishi, in northern Japan, will
vividly describe how they or their forebears rebuilt the city on the rubble
of devastation wreaked by tidal waves and US wartime bombing raids.
But the confidence displayed in past conflicts with calamity is being
severely tested by a more enduring foe, recession. A steel plant has been
gradually decommissioned, the fishing industry is in decline and, now, the
local bank, Kamaishi Shinkin, is to be liquidated.
'Kamaishi Bank was like the local doctor. Now we will have to deal with the
big hospitals,' said Mr Morio Wada, head of the chamber of commerce. The
'big hospitals' are the regional banks taking over the 12 branches of the
Shinkin, which is on the lowest rung of the Japanese banking hierarchy.
Kamaishi is unusually blighted, but some causes of its ills are shared by
other provincial Japanese cities, and the political upheaval in Tokyo has
added to the economic uncertainty in regional areas.
The continuing downturn has most hurt centres already made vulnerable by
structural changes such as manufacturers relocating to lower-cost east Asian
countries and the steady outward flow of young workers to larger regional
cities and Tokyo.
Kamaishi Shinkin's death was the direct result of its role as the local
provider of funds to small business, as money was pumped into ailing
companies unable to raise funds from other sources. For its sins of
commission, the bank's bad loans are now estimated at 41 per cent of its
Y35.6bn portfolio, though a regional banker said the final non-performing
figure would be close to half the outstanding loans.
Having been the site of the country's first blast furnace for pig iron in
1857, Kamaishi now has the ignominy of being home to the first Japanese bank
to receive liquidation assistance from the Deposit Insurance Corporation,
likely to provide about Y20bn to ensure that depositors are not out of
pocket.
For Japanese outside Kamaishi, the most disturbing characteristic of the
bank's demise is that it was not a result of stock and property speculation
during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s. The failure of finance companies
with a taste for speculation is seen as an inevitable result of their
excesses and not as a sign that the established order is crumbling.
'It's a terrible thing that the name Kamaishi Bank will disappear,' lamented
Mr Takeyoshi Noda, the city's mayor, whose office is coloured by relics of
Kamaishi's glory days. The Nippon Steel Kamaishi rugby team won the national
title seven years in succession during the 1970s. Mr Noda has a bruised
rugby ball atop a display cabinet.
But as Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, has scaled down its
plant, transfering operations to newer factories in the south, the rugby
team has also lost potency. There is a smaller pool from which to select
players, as Kamaishi's population peaked in 1963 at 92,123, and fell to
50,820 this year.
The area's struggling businesses were further shaken last year when the
Japanese government estimated that Kamaishi would have a population of only
27,000 in the year 2010. Mr Noda thinks the calculation did not take into
account efforts to revive the city, including a Nippon Steel-sponsored
mushroom farm and a building materials company.
But it is these new ventures which have been most exposed to the harsh winds
of recession. The city had hoped that Nippon Steel would build a theme park
on an old factory site, but the poor response to Space World, another theme
park built at a former steel plant in the south, led to the shelving of
those plans.
The building materials venture has been bruised by the fall in private
construction demand. An increase in public works spending this year may
help, but demand for private housing in Kamaishi is falling in tandem with
the population. Mr Noda has high hopes for an office furniture venture, but
demand will be dampened by securities houses' planned 68 per cent cut in
capital spending this year and smaller reductions by other institutions.
'There was no financial bubble in Kamaishi, but we have been hurt by the
bubble's collapse simply because the real economy has been hurt,' Mr Noda
said. 'Land prices were falling here, when they were surging in Tokyo, but
now we find it difficult to offer young people good jobs. We have to create
more projects.'
Local businesses fear that the regional banks may not be as willing to risk
funds on a new venture which could have expected support from Kamaishi
Shinkin, officially thought to have been too sympathetic to the local cause.
One regional banker said the the small bank had been more interested in
'sentiment than asset-backing'.
Three years ago, Mr Susumu Oikawa was sent from the finance ministry to
restructure Kamaishi Shinkin, as it was hoped that low-interest loans from
the Shinkin banks' governing body would be enough to ensure survival. But,
as Mr Oikawa explained, the continuing downturn in the national economy has
pushed many businesses, including his bank, over the edge.
'Some Kamaishi people invested in stocks, but that did not bring down their
companies,' said Mr Oikawa, aged 58, who will be idle after the formal
liquidation in October. His transfer was a form of amakudari, a descent from
bureaucratic heaven to a private financial institution.
'Many Japanese have a traditional image of Kamaishi as a robust, steel
producing city, but when I came here I was quite surprised. Businesses were
in trouble, and it has got worse,' he said.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Pakistan still seeks political peace after Sharif's return:
Tensions which threaten democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Due to present political crisis, progress is stalled, development is
hampered, Pakistan is suffering.'
SO SAYS a large front-page advertisement in a local newspaper, signed by 10
leading businessmen. The ad also lists 30 'important achievements' of Mr
Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, with a caption which reads: 'No man has done
so much in such a short time'.
While supported by many in business, who are keen to see progress in his
economic reform plans, the recently reinstated Mr Sharif is faced with
equally passionate critics who claim his government has been corrupt and
ineffective.
The polarised environment that has resulted is perhaps the most important
source of continuing political uncertainty in Pakistan, a country which has
lived under martial law for more than half of its 46-year history.
Mr Sharif and politicians loyal to him say publicly that they are in command
after the supreme court's verdict last month, which overturned an earlier
presidential order and restored the government. But the prime minister is
facing strained relations with at least two of the country's four provinces.
Tensions with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan have only just begun to recede,
though no one knows if the two leaders will return to a normal working
relationship. Mr Khan said last week he would welcome Mr Sharif if the prime
minister came to visit him. Since the government's restoration four weeks
ago, the two met only once and briefly, on the return of the corpses of
Pakistani soldiers who were killed in Somalia.
Mr Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader. bitter foes for
almost five years, have formed committees of aides in an attempt to resolve
their differences. Both leaders have a stake in saving the democratic
system, because their own futures will be determined by its future.
But there are few signs of any imminent breakthrough. Ms Bhutto is demanding
basic electoral reforms, formation of a broad-based 'national government'
which includes the opposition, and fresh mid-term elections.
'Nothing short of a national government with fresh elections will get
political stability. Otherwise, we'll have manipulations. Somebody will be
up, somebody will be down,' said Ms Bhutto recently in support of her
demands.
One of her party MPs is expected to participate in a parliamentary committee
set up over the weekend to recommend constitutional changes. Among those are
certain to be proposals for repealing the controversial constitutional
amendment which empowers the president to sack elected assemblies and call
elections.
Mr Sharif has so far shown few signs of giving ground. The cases of
corruption against Ms Bhutto which were filed against her after her
government's dismissal in August 1990, though never proved in court, have
still not been withdrawn.
In addition, the opposition claims that some of its supporters are still
being persecuted. 'If the prime minister is not even prepared to pay the
price of peanuts for initiating talks with the opposition, then I don't
think we are going to get anywhere,' Ms Bhutto adds.
Its also not clear how far Ms Bhutto is willing to compromise, especially
after recent reports of a dent in her popularity following her party's
decision to join the government of Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the interim prime
minister who briefly replaced Mr Sharif.
In its efforts to seek political peace, the government feels encouraged that
the other important actor in Pakistani politics, the army, has so far
remained neutral. The defence budget was only raised by 1.9 per cent this
year, far below inflation, which is officially estimated at around 10 per
cent. That step has been widely seen as a sign that the government has some
support from the army to undertake its economic reform policies.
However, should there be, in the worst case, political deadlock, street
demonstrations, and/or the refusal of the provinces to work with the centre,
there could be an opportunity for troops to be called to take control of the
situation.
Mr Khan's term of office ends in November, and it is still unclear if he
will seek a second term. The prime minister is believed to be unwilling to
hold elections before then, fearing that the president's supporters, joined
by the opposition, would launch a fierce attack against him.
'Nawaz Sharif has staged a legal come-back, not a political come-back. The
political reasons that led to the dismissal of the Sharif government still
lie unanswered and unredressed,' says Ms Bhutto.
Other critics also argue that the government must first establish political
peace before becoming confident that it is back to stay and that the country
is back on the road to democracy and economic liberalisation.
The future of economic reforms will be the ultimate test case, says the
chief executive of a large company in Karachi, Pakistan's business capital.
'But right now with all this political uncertainty, the prospects don't seem
terribly good unless things settle down.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / Algeria unveils blueprint for fresh elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S military-backed five-man presidency has unveiled a draft blueprint
for 'the return of the electoral process' in the country, according to which
presidential elections will be held by 1996 at the earliest.
Under the blueprint, circulated on Monday to political parties and other
interest groups, the ruling High State Council (HSC), as the joint
presidency is known, will hand over power at the end of December to a new
presidential body. This will oversee a transition period of two to three
years before elections.
A National Consultative Council, embracing political, economic and social
groups, will be formed to advise the presidency during the transition, along
with a new transitional government, according to the document. It also
commits Algeria to an accelerated opening of its failing and largely
state-held economy, saying 'our economy needs, now more than ever, another
strategy, a new model'.
The draft plan follows three rounds of talks between the HSC and several,
though not all, of Algeria's leading opposition parties and national
associations. The dialogue excluded among others the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), whose proximity to outright victory in a 1991 general
election prompted the cancellation of the poll by the government, and threw
Algeria into its present political crisis.
The HSC's announcement is the first timetable for the resumption of any form
of democracy since it took over from President Chadli Bendjedid after the
abortive first round of elections. Its decision to hand over at the end of
this year coincides with what would have been the expiry of Mr Chadli's
presidential term.
The document is due to be discussed at a national conference of political
and other interest groups, possibly next month. The resulting proposals,
which Monday's document says will include alterations to the electoral law
and some parts of the constitution, will be put to a referendum in the
autumn. The 1989 constitution will stay in place during the transition.
Diplomats in Algiers said the HSC's programme was designed to rally what
consensus the government can muster while attempting to shore up its
legitimacy in the absence of elections. However, they pointed out that
political parties were still likely to disagree considerably on the detail
of the blueprint.
Moreover, the proposals come as the government tightens further its military
crackdown on FIS extremists in the face of a steady series of bloody FIS
ambushes of police and military targets. More than 15,000 troops are
deployed in and around the capital.
Although the document says that Islam will remain the 'state religion' and
is the 'foundation of society and the root of its values', it does not
envisage lifting the ban on FIS, which drew some 3m votes in the 1991 poll.
Instead, it emphasises that the government will 'proceed with the
eradication of terrorism' during the transition.
Francis Ghiles adds: Prof Mohamed Boukhobza, head of Algeria's National
Institute for Global Strategy and a respected sociologist, was assassinated
yesterday in Algiers, knifed in his flat. His murder comes three months
after the slaying of his predecessor and former education minister, , Prof
Djilalli Lyabes.
Meanwhile 40 conscript soldiers in a platoon hunting Islamic fundamentalists
in the Chrea mountainous range above Blida, south of Algiers, were killed at
the weekend, it was learnt yesterday. The massacre was the worst since the
insurrection began.

ZIMBABWE is changing its currency regulations to let citizens and foreigners
hold bank accounts in foreign exchange with no questions asked, according to
Mr Kombo Moyana, central bank governor, Reuter reports from Harare.
'Capital brought into the FCDA (foreign currency denominated account) will
not be subject to tax and proof of sources will not be required,' he said.
'As an incentive, no withholding tax will be levied on the interest earned
by these accounts.'
President Robert Mugabe flew to London this week to campaign for investment
from British business leaders. He was expected to announce changes to
foreign exchange rules, which investors see as a curb on their presence. A
long-standing ban on foreign businesses investing on the local stock market
was abolished in April. They are now allowed to remit most of their profits.
The Zimbabwean economy shrank by 12 per cent last year. Economists expect it
to decline again this year.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Growing signs of economy bottoming out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of economic statistics published yesterday added further weight to
claims that the Japanese economy is bottoming out after a two-year decline.
A wide-ranging quarterly survey conducted by the Finance Ministry found that
business confidence improved markedly in the second quarter of the year, the
second consecutive quarter of improvement.
The Economic Planning Agency said the economy was bottoming out in its
commentary on its index of leading indicators, which stood at 70 per cent in
April. It was the fourth consecutive month the index has stood at more than
50 per cent. A reading of less than that is taken to forecast a
deterioration in the economy.
The cautious optimism in the surveys may be encouraged by the yen's sudden
weakening in the past few days in response to the political turmoil
triggered by the defeat of the government in a no-confidence vote last
Friday.
The yen closed at Y111.25 against the dollar, down Y0.77 from its close on
Monday. The fall in the currency will be welcomed by exporters.
Another government survey found household spending in April was slightly
higher than the same month last year, the second consecutive monthly
improvement.
However, both the EPA and the Finance Ministry stressed it was too early to
say that the economy was starting to recover even if it was bottoming out.
Personal consumption remains depressed, capital investment is being cut and
in the longer run political instability could throw in doubt the
government's ability to support the economy with further fiscal measures
after the July 18 election.
The Finance Ministry's May survey of business confidence among 4,673
manufacturing companies put the index of business sentiment at minus 12.2
compared with minus 20 in the February survey.
Large companies expect business conditions to recover from the final three
months of this year. Profits in the first half of the financial year to next
April will fall slightly compared with last year, but this drop will be more
than offset by a profits recovery in the second half of the year, the survey
found.
Companies' worries about whether they are carrying excess labour are also
easing. About 8.7 per cent of companies in the May survey said they were
carrying excess labour compared with 9.3 per cent in the February survey.
The rise in the EPA's leading index to 70 per cent was due to a rise in
housing orders, demand for consumer durables and the money supply. Household
spending rose by 1.6 per cent in real terms in April, compared with the same
month last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party split yesterday when Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the leader of a rebel faction, and 43 other MPs handed in their
resignations in preparation for the launch of a new political party today.
The heads of the LDP's remaining five factions held a crisis meeting in an
attempt to stabilise the party, which is in danger of losing further members
ahead of a general election called for July 18.
LDP officials conceded that the party could lose power, which it has held
since 1955, while the Social Democratic party, formerly known as the Japan
Socialist Party, believes it could rule the country in a coalition with the
Hata rebels.
Japanese foreign policy would be reviewed if the LDP lost the election, but
Mr Sadao Yamahana, the SDP chairman, yesterday told the departing US
ambassador to Japan, Mr Michael Armacost, that a socialist-led government
would still put special emphasis on the relationship with Washington.
'Whatever happens, I want to assure you that there will be no change
regarding the high importance we accord to Japan's relationship with the
US,' Mr Yamahana told Mr Armacost, who is soon to be replaced by Mr Walter
Mondale, the former US vice-president.
The SDP has traditionally opposed a US-Japan Security Treaty signed in 1951,
and the party also objected to the participation of Japanese military
personnel participating in the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia,
essentially because it wants the military to be disbanded.
While the LDP may be in danger of defeat, no clear pattern has emerged from
an early rush of opinion polls. A poll by the Mainichi Shimbun, a national
newspaper, of 1,000 eligible voters found that 79 per cent supported Mr
Hata's defection from the LDP, but only 9 per cent would vote for his party.
After handing in his resignation yesterday, Mr Hata said his group could not
turn back after having voted in favour of a no-confidence motion against Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, on Friday night. 'Japanese politics has
already entered a new phase,' he said.
The meeting of faction heads from the LDP, which controls 232 members of the
present 476-strong lower house, resolved to put aside factional differences
for this election in an attempt to secure a parliamentary majority. Mr
Michio Watanabe, head of one faction, said the party should be able to work
in a new parliament with some of the pro-reform rebels who resigned
yesterday: 'These people are not socialists or communists - basically they
believe in the same things we do.'

AN INDIAN parliamentary committee yesterday blamed foreign banks operating
in India for initiating the Rs50bn (Pounds 1.1bn) Bombay financial scandal
and suggested in a draft report that all banks in the country, Indian and
foreign, be brought under strict parliamentary control.
The joint parliamentary committee set up last year to investigate the stock
market scandal said in its second draft report: 'Foreign banks have been
initiators of the scam as well as major players. With their tremendous
resources, their clout, their aggressive posture and posturing, they can, if
they choose, play havoc with the economy.'
The report came down heavily on the Reserve Bank of India, the country's
central bank, for not putting in place a system of inspection for financial
institutions. 'Deregularisation and liberalisation without effective checks
and balances would be an unmitigated disaster.'
The Finance Ministry had also failed to 'exercise much closer supervision of
the entire securities and banking transactions' of all banks, and was
accused of 'not monitoring the stock exchanges, or undertaking formal
assessments of alleged irregularities in the stock markets, despite being
the sole authority responsible for this'.
Three government employees were badly hurt when militants fired a rocket
yesterday at the civil secretariat building, seat of the Jammu and Kashmir
government, in Srinagar.
A pro-Pakistani militant group, Operation Balakote, telephoned a local
newspaper office claiming responsibility for the attack, minutes after the
rocket pierced through the second-floor office of Mr R K Sayeed, an adviser
to the Jammu and Kashmir governor, injuring his staff.

ONLY A DAY after a rebel military leader announced he was ready to step into
Azerbaijan's political vacuum and assume power, several of his men have
entered the capital of Baku.
Fresh negotiations have been launched to try to end his revolt but it is
becoming clear that the republic's acting leader, Mr Gaidar Aliyev, is
losing control.
The rebel warlord, Mr Surat Husseinov, has a 50-man band dug in on Baku's
southern outskirts, with three tanks pointed towards the capital.
Several of his men were seen inside the capital yesterday afternoon but
their motives were unclear. The capital seemed peaceful and there was no
apparent tension despite Mr Husseinov's warning on Monday that he might
decide to take power.
The parliamentary chairman, Mr Aliyev, who has served as the republic's de
facto leader since the elected president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled and
secretly took refuge in his home village last week, said yesterday that he
was still discussing Mr Husseinov's demands.
Privately, Mr Aliyev told foreign diplomats on Monday that Mr Husseinov was
demanding to be made president or prime minister. He also wanted to be given
effective control over the important ministries of defence, interior and
state security, or KGB.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Estonia proudly wears its kroon of thorns: The first
ex-Soviet republic to dump the rouble and beat inflation - but at a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPE LEGRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a turbulent year when a handful of former Soviet republics has
followed Estonia's lead, the small Baltic country has just marked the first
anniversary of the introduction of its own currency, the kroon.
Estonia, less than twelve months after achieving its independence, became
the first state emerging from the Soviet empire to dump the plummeting
rouble and issue its own money on June 20 1992.
The Ukrainian coupon has lost its value even faster than the Russian rouble,
but Estonia has succeeded in curbing inflation from more than 500 per cent a
year last June to less than 30 per cent now.
A World Bank report on Estonia predicts that inflation will stabilise at
that level for the rest of 1993 and the International Monetary Fund is
optimistic about prospects for future growth.
The kroon has also maintained its peg of eight to the German D-Mark despite
a doubling in prices since its introduction.
This is not as remarkable an achievement as it might first appear: Estonia
operates a currency board system, whereby every kroon in circulation is
backed by foreign currency reserves, swollen by loans and aid from the west,
and 11.3 tonnes of gold, retrieved from the pre-war independent republic's
deposits in foreign central banks.
Although state companies still receive large subsidies to delay the
inevitable labour shake-out, the budget is in broad balance. The money
supply is further limited by a healthy distrust among business and ordinary
people of banks (three of the largest banks failed last November) so that
the banking system plays only a small role in money creation.
Inflation persists, however, as the money supply has been boosted by foreign
aid and investment and because gross national product slumped by more than
20 per cent last year to about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 665m). With more money
chasing fewer goods, prices have risen.
The kroon's 'hard currency' status - viewed as a symbol akin to manhood by
Estonia's inexperienced central bankers - comes at a price, however. Shops
in the capital, Tallinn, stocked full of overpriced Scandinavian luxuries,
testify to an import binge the economy can ill afford.
Although trade has been redirected from east to west, with Finland
overtaking Russia as Estonia's main trading partner last September, exports,
which had grown explosively after the introduction of the convertible kroon,
have recently fallen back. The trade account slid into a deficit of EKr83m
(Pounds 4.2m) in April, even without counting the substantial natural gas
imports through pipelines from Russia, which are difficult to measure.
Estonia is also increasingly uncompetitive for foreign investment, on which
its future development depends. Its main attraction, a relatively cheap,
skilled workforce, has faded following a doubling in wages in dollar terms
over the past year.
The privatisation programme proceeds in fits and starts. An initial
international tender of 38 large companies last November was aborted after
allegations of incompetence at the privatisation agency.
A second offer of 56 enterprises was made in May. Vouchers to be used in the
purchase of smaller companies have been distributed. But only Dollars 8.6m
of an estimated total of Dollars 500m of state assets due to be sold off
have been transferred to the private sector, and the sale of land to
foreigners is severely restricted.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Safety move starts row on whose rules rule the waves: EC
plans for safer seas have prompted concern about regional regimes on top of
globally accepted conventions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WOULD have thought nothing could be controversial about improving safety
at sea - particularly in the light of public anxiety over a spate of oil
tanker accidents in European waters.
Yet the European Commission has found itself in a row with the shipping
industry over its plans to introduce a series of measures aimed at
eliminating sub-standard vessels and crews from the Community.
Concern about safety has been triggered by three recent tanker accidents in
Community waters: the grounding of the Aegean Sea off the Spanish coast in
December, the breaking up of the Braer off the UK coast in January, and the
collision involving the British Trent off the Belgian coast earlier this
month.
As things stand, the safety rules intended to prevent accidents such as
these are laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, a United
Nations agency, through a framework of internationally accepted conventions
and protocols.
Even before the spate of European accidents began, however, the Commission
had been considering independent action to toughen up on maritime safety
within the Community: within days of the British Trent collision, EC
transport ministers had put their names to a proposed common policy on safe
seas calling for EC legislation to improve shipping standards.
Examples of the measures planned are the development of common criteria for
more thorough inspections of ships when they are in port, together with
criteria for detaining or refusing access to ships which do not meet
international standards; common standards for the classification societies
which guarantee vessels' seaworthiness; minimum standards of training for
crews; and better reporting systems for vessels carrying dangerous or
potentially polluting cargoes.
On the face of it, European shipowners might be expected to welcome the
measures. After all, EC member states tend towards the upper end of the
global league table when it comes to maritime safety, so tougher standards
will operate to the advantage of EC shipowners by hitting their low-cost,
low-standard competitors.
According to Mr David Tomlinson, secretary general of the Council of
European and Japanese National Shipowners' Associations, the measures also
come at a time when the industry is keen to improve its tarnished image.
'Responsible shipowners everywhere believe safety standards have slipped,'
Mr Tomlinson says. 'There is a recognition that things have not been as good
as they should have been, and that everybody ought to pull their socks up.'
Nevertheless, shipowners are acutely concerned over the EC safe seas policy
 -not because they are at odds with the sentiments underlying it, but
because of where it is coming from.
The shipowners stress that shipping is a global industry, not a regional or
local one, and therefore has to operate within the parameters of a
globally-agreed set of rules. If national or regional governments start
imposing their own sets of rules for vessels operating in their waters, they
say, the result will be chaos.
The International Chamber of Shipping, which speaks for the national
shipowners' associations of the world's biggest maritime nations, says it is
'desperately keen to avoid' any suggestion that a regional regulatory regime
should be interposed on a body of globally-accepted conventions.
Mr Chris Horrocks, the chamber's secretary general, says shipowners are at
present required to conform to a set of global regulations which are as
acceptable in, say, Argentina as they are in Australia. 'What they do not
want to find is that they are suddenly having to cope with marginally
different regimes which make it a matter of uncertainty as to whether they
are in compliance with the law in country A, B or C'
EC transport ministers who support the safe seas policy, such as Britain's
Mr John MacGregor, say this is to miss the point of the proposals. The idea
is not to set new standards, they say, but to introduce more rigorous
enforcement of the existing ones. The policy goes out of its way to stress
the importance of operating within the framework laid down by the
International Maritime Organisation, the commission says.
The shipowners, however, are far from convinced. Mr Horrocks detects the
hand of ambitious 'Eurocrats'. 'It's an attitude of mind coming down from
Brussels that we find extremely worrying.'
The commission is hoping to get its policy enshrined in legislation by the
end of the year, but it has already had to tone the contents down in
response to the shipping industry's anxieties. If shipowners get their way,
the policy will be torpedoed.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Oilmen ignore Azerbaijan risks: Foreign oil companies are
taking political turmoil in their stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT foreign oil companies yesterday took Azerbaijan's political crisis in
their stride and advanced Dollars 70m (Pounds 46.6m) in good faith money to
keep negotiating for the right to develop the Caspian Sea republic's oil
fields.
The advance adds to the tens of millions of dollars which the companies,
including British Petroleum, Amoco and Pennzoil, have already paid out to
the Azeri government in cash and in kind for the right to negotiate to
exploit the country's estimated recoverable offshore oil reserves of at
least 4bn barrels. Pennzoil, for instance, has already given the Azeri
government the equivalent of about Dollars 90m in natural gas production
equipment and pipeline.
Senior oil company executives began meeting Azeri officials in London this
week for what they hope will be the advanced stages of talks on exploitation
rights which have dragged out for more than a year.
By proceeding with the talks and paying out the collective ante, the
companies - after long reflection - have implicitly decided that the
economic risks of staying in Azerbaijan were outweighed by the potential
billions to be earned in oil fields already proven to be substantial and
easy to exploit.
'Seventy million dollars is a lot to you and me, but it's not that much to
the companies,' said one executive. 'The real money is the billions it will
take to actually develop the fields.' Another oil company executive said:
'The potential here is so high. There's never been a hole sunk here that
didn't hit oil.'
Azerbaijan's latest bout of political instability began on June 4 when a
rebel military warlord, Mr Surat Husseinov, seized the country's
second-largest city, Gyanja, and demanded President Abulfaz Elchebey's
resignation.
The president has since fled the capital and taken political refuge in his
home village and some of Mr Husseinov's men have entered the capital, Baku,
while others have dug in outside the city.
Mr Husseinov has declared that he is ready to step into Azerbaijan's
political vacuum to run the country.
This power vacuum leaves the oil companies with no-one with enough authority
to sign a deal. As the eventual contracts must be ratified by parliament,
the political chaos also makes it unclear whether or when there will be an
effective legislative body to endorse the deals.
The companies have not taken the situation lightly. Pennzoil, for example,
has sent 85 of its 88 expatriate employees out of the republic, and many of
the other companies have followed suit. But the overall belief seems to be
that, in the long term, the Azeri republic will stabilise and that, with
hard currency infusions from foreign investors such as themselves, economic
prosperity will calm the situation further.
Yesterday's payment represents one-third of Dollars 210m that the companies
must eventually pay up as a signing bonus to the cash-poor former Soviet
republic.
The money is the companies' financial contribution to a new Azeri oil
development plan that was announced in the capital last month.
Originally Amoco, Pennzoil and BP were negotiating to develop three of
Azerbaijan's oil fields individually, with respective partners Ramco Energy,
McDermott International, Statoil and Union Oil of California. Now, however,
all the oil companies have decided to negotiate as a group to develop the
three fields.
Although the details of a work plan have not been finalised, each company
has been awarded a percentage of the 'unitised' group, which will comprise
its portion of development costs and its eventual profit.
BP-Statoil has the largest share (36 per cent) and had to pay out Dollars
25m yesterday. Amoco, which contributed Dollars 17m, has the next highest
investment which totals 24.3 per cent.
Pennzoil has 14 per cent and paid Dollars 9.8m and Unico paid Dollars 11.2m
for its 16 per cent share.
Besides their own individual projects, the companies have an additional
large expense to consider - a pipeline they must build to carry some 800,000
barrels of oil a day to the west.
The companies have considered several pipeline routes, but appear to have
all but decided on one passing through Turkey with a terminal on the
Mediterranean, according to executives at two of the companies.
The Dollars 1.4bn pipeline would go through Azerbaijan and split into two at
the border with Iran.
One loop would then go through northern Iran and another through Armenia
before joining again in the ex-Soviet Nakhichdvan region and finally
entering Turkey.
'That way neither Iran nor Armenia can hold us hostage,' an oil company
official said.
At Erzurum, the pipeline would lead into an existing Iraqi pipeline that was
closed because of the 1990 Kuwaiti invasion.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Reformers in Russia seek new identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Russian reformers are trying to create a broad alliance of reformist
parties to counter-balance the reinvigorated Communist party ahead of
elections in the autumn.
Despite impressive permutations of western words such as 'republican',
'democratic', and 'liberal', most of Russia's 105 registered parties are
little more than the expression of individual politicians' personal
ambitions to lead parties.
This has made it virtually impossible for them to merge over shared ideas.
In contrast, the Communist party, strengthened by 70 years of tradition, has
been quick to rebuild itself after its unbanning by the constitutional
court.
Some of President Boris Yeltsin's close colleagues announced the formation
of a political bloc called Russia's Choice last week in an attempt to
compensate for their failure to produce a long-promised presidential party.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who launched radical reforms last
year, is trying to build a power base around the Association of Privatised
and Private Enterprises which he heads. Its aim is to help organise and
finance candidates for a 'reformist anti-inflationary parliament' as well to
defend the interests of privatised enterprises on a day-to-day basis.
'The idea is to unite people who have been disagreeing with each other even
though they share the same interests,' said Mr Gaidar, whose association is
likely to join the pro-Yeltsin bloc. Its political and economic programme is
due to be published next month.
However, not all the groups will necessarily pull together. At the weekend,
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist, presided at the founding of a
group called 'Entrepreneurs for the Renewal of Russia' at which he presented
a list of demands for changes to make the government's market reforms more
credible.
What all three groups have in common is their reliance on Russia's newly
powerful entrepreneurs for money and support.
Where members include factory directors, their influence is seen as crucial
in obtaining the votes of their workers. The leaders' ultimate goal is to
have their own political base when the time comes to replace President
Yeltsin in presidential elections further along the road.
Many entrepreneurs and managers now being wooed are naturally keen that the
new parliament should be pro-business and pro-private property. But Mr
Viktor Korovin, the 40-year-old director of Uralmash, a recently privatised
flagship of heavy industry which is a member of Mr Gaidar's association,
summed up a widespread scepticism about the politicians.
'I want the new parliament to be as depoliticised as possible,' he said,
referring to the over-politicised nature of Russian life.
For the time being, there appears to be no limit to what can be turned into
a party. One of the stranger offshoots of the new trend was the announcement
by the deputy prime minister, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, that he was setting up a
party to represent regional interests and press for the creation of a
genuine federal state.
As President Yeltsin's adviser on nationalities, he has set himself the
impossible task of rallying 89 regions and republics whose only common aim
is to extract as much cash and power from Moscow as possible.
Although the constitutional convention, which reconvenes on Saturday, is
unlikely to finalise a new democratic constitution, politicians are
expecting it to at least come up with an electoral law.
This is because new elections are seen as a panacea for Russia's troubles,
ushering in a new parliament which would both actively support radical
reforms and approve a new constitution.
Although it is not yet clear whether Russia will opt for a
first-past-the-post electoral rule or a mixed system involving some
proportional representation, the main obstacle faced by reformist forces is
the absence of strong parties to fill the vacuum left by the once-monolithic
Communist party.

US plans for a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) privatisation fund for Russia will
be scaled back to about Dollars 500m at the Tokyo summit of the Group of
Seven leading industrialised countries, Mr Kabun Muto, the Japanese foreign
minister, said yesterday, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. The US
launched the idea, without warning, at the April meeting of G7 foreign and
finance ministers in Tokyo. Since then, US officials had suggested they were
making headway in persuading other members of the G7 to contribute to the
fund in spite of the deep scepticism among Japan, Germany and Britain.
Mr Muto said in a speech in Tokyo that the idea of a Dollars 4bn fund was
preposterous. He added that Japan would not contribute any new money to a
smaller fund because of its territorial dispute with Russia over the four
Kurile islands.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Bundesbank more upbeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday tried to ease pressure on the D-Mark with an upbeat
assessment of German economic prospects. There were also some favourable
indicators in the key factors influencing the bank's monetary policy, Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank's vice-president, told bankers in Munster.
But he tempered his optimism with a warning that if the government came up
with wrong or unconvincing solutions to the country's deficit difficulties,
the currency might suffer from 'over-reactions' in money markets.
The economic situation was serious, but there was evidence that the pace of
decline was over-stated, he said. 'Free fall' was out of the question.
Although output fell 3 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, there
were now signs the situation was stabilising, he claimed. Industrial
production had not fallen further, and foreign orders had risen.
Meanwhile, growth in the M3 money supply measure was 'rather flatter' than a
little while ago, and there were signs that inflation would slacken as the
year continued, he said. Nevertheless, the bank had to assess these
developments carefully, and proceed cautiously with further monetary
relaxation. Money supply must remain the dominant factor in its
deliberations, Mr Tietmeyer added.
Mr Tietmeyer made plain that the key to resolving Germany's dilemma lay
outside the Bundesbank. 'The limited recent weakening of the D-Mark should
be read as an indication of the need for convincing solutions to Germany's
home-made problems.'

FT  23 JUN 93 / French push franc's status: 'Anchor' role sought in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday repeated its desire to see the franc as one
anchor for the European exchange rate mechanism.
Speaking at a seminar in London to senior economists and central bank
officials yesterday, Mr Andre Icard, the head of research at the Banque de
France, said: 'The French franc is sharing the duty of anchoring the
(European exchange rate) mechanism. . . the D-Mark is impossible to avoid as
an anchor but other currencies will share the responsibility.'
His comments follow the steady decline in French short-term interest rates,
which on Monday fell below those in Germany for the first time in 26 years.
Mr Icard said of the franc: 'I am not saying it will become the anchor but
it will become one anchor among others. The most important thing to me is
that our interest rates are below those in Germany.'
In Copenhagen, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
agreed that the franc along with other 'hard-core' EC currencies might take
over temporarily the D-Mark's anchor role inside the ERM.
Mr Delors said recent cuts in French, Dutch and Belgian interest rates,
which occurred independently of the German Bundesbank relaxing monetary
policy, was a comforting example of European co-operation. 'It shows that
the system is not dominated by one single country or currency. But it should
not be an excuse to sing The Marseillaise,' he said at the EC summit.
EC officials acknowledged that German interest rates remained the most
important long-term influence on the rest of the Community, and expressed
hope that the Bundesbank might resume its cautious programme of rate cuts.
One Brussels official predicted a move on July 1, ahead of the G7 summit in
Tokyo.
Mr Icard's comments were interpreted by some economists as confirmation that
the French government is keen to use the franc's strength to promote Paris
as a European financial centre and possible site for a European central
bank.
'The strength of the franc within the ERM is a further development of Paris
as a financial centre,' said Mr Icard. 'The future of Paris is closely
related to the soundness of the franc.'
It was only when the present conservative administration took power that the
government was able to generate enough confidence among international
investors to cut interest rates without the franc suffering.
Official interest rates have now been lowered nine times in two months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday confirmed that it planned to start its
privatisation programme in early September and announced that it might sell
minority stakes in a number of state-controlled companies before the
full-scale sales got under way.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said after a parliamentary meeting
that he planned to float between three and six companies in the first round
of privatisations. These sales, he said, would start in the final months of
1993 but would continue in 1994.
France's new centre-right government, which needs capital to reduce the
budget deficit, recently unveiled plans for a radical privatisation drive
involving up to 21 companies. The candidates for sale include Banque
Nationale de Paris, the Renault motor group, the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals
concern and Air France.
The value of the privatisations has been estimated by analysts at between
FFr280bn and FFr360bn (Pounds 33.2bn-Pounds 42.6bn). The partial
privatisation programme before September would involve selling minority
holdings in other public sector concerns along the lines of this month's
flotation of a 35 per cent stake in the Credit Local de France banking
group. Mr Alphandery said he planned to raise around FFr40bn from
privatisations before the end of this year.

IG METALL, Germany's most powerful union, has offered to abandon its
traditional negotiating stance, based on demands for higher wages, in return
for more worker participation in industry.
The proposal for a complete overhaul of pay and conditions strategies was
presented yesterday by Mr Klaus Zwickel, incoming IG Metall president, as
the union's contribution to overcoming Germany's economic crisis. His offer
represents a belated attempt by the union to stem the tide of one-off
in-house deals eroding its influence over the engineering and metalworking
industries.
It also follows a persistent campaign from employers, government and the
Bundesbank for longer working hours, non-inflationary pay deals, weekend
work, fewer holidays and less lavish fringe benefits to combat German
industry's fast-fading competitiveness.
IG Metall members at a Stuttgart bus factory recently agreed to return to
working a 40-hour week, while national policy remains the institution of a
35-hour week. Bosch, the electronics group, has won agreement for Sunday
working in a new plant after threatening to build the factory outside
Germany. According to the latest estimates, there are about 2,000
plant-level agreements in operation, many with better conditions than those
offered in national settlements.
Mr Zwickel told a conference that the union would give up its demands for
high pay rises 'in the coming years' in exchange for improved working and
performance-related conditions and more say in the running of companies.
The new character of industrial work in a high-wage country such as Germany
demanded a qualified workforce with more scope for taking responsibility and
working constructively in teams.
'The reform of agreements should increase humanity and efficiency and also
help preserve jobs,' Mr Zwickel claimed.
Employers had to accept new arrangements, but only within the framework of
national pay and conditions agreements, and not in piecemeal deals, he
added.
His proposals mark a radical change in thinking which has been fiercely
debated for months within the union's headquarters.
The offer follows a less refined proposal from Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the
former union president who resigned over an insider trading scandal. Mr
Steinkuhler said last year that the union was prepared conditionally to
accept five years of pay settlements which did no more than preserve
members' purchasing power.

THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern
German industry, is setting up a department aimed at tightening control and
supervision over the implementation of purchase contracts.
Mr Hero Brahms, vice-president of the Treuhand, who will oversee a
department of 350 to 550 accountants and lawyers, said it was crucial to
introduce greater accountability into contracts signed between the Treuhand
and investors since it was set up in late 1990.
'We have to make sure that the investments the Treuhand have earmarked for
environment clean-up, for instance, are honoured by these enterprises,' he
said at a press conference in Berlin yesterday.
'Moreover, we have to monitor that investment commitments and job guarantees
undertaken by purchasers are also implemented.'
Since late 1990, the Treuhand has signed more than 40,000 contracts,
including sales of real estate. Most of the contracts are anchored on two
principles: guaranteeing a certain number of jobs coupled with investment
programmes spread over several years by the purchaser. Under these
contracts, the Treuhand has secured DM179bn (Pounds 71.8bn) investment
commitments, and 1.46m job guarantees. Privatisation receipts are less than
DM50bn.
Few Treuhand officials, however, are prepared to forecast how many workers
will lose their jobs in these privatised industries once the contracts end.
The proportion of unemployed, including those in part-time work, or on job
creation and training schemes is more than 30 per cent in each of the five
east German states.

SPAIN'S loss-making public sector industrial holding company claimed
yesterday it had signed a breakthrough agreement with unions that will
control inflationary wage agreements and break down rigid job
classifications.
The three-year agreement negotiated by the Instituto Nacional de Industria
(INI) comes in the wake of a surprisingly strong stand at the EC's
Copenhagen summit by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, in favour of
salary moderation and of deregulating labour markets to combat economic
recession.
INI's agreement with the unions holds 1993 wage increases for some 70,000
steel workers below the inflation rate and pegs them to the rise in the cost
of living for the next two years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday tried to ease pressure on the D-Mark with an upbeat
assessment of German economic prospects. There were also some favourable
indicators in the key factors influencing the bank's monetary policy, Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank's vice-president, told bankers in Munster.
But he tempered his optimism with a warning that if the government came up
with wrong or unconvincing solutions to the country's deficit difficulties,
the currency might suffer from 'over-reactions' in money markets.
The economic situation was serious, but there was evidence that the pace of
decline was over-stated, he said. 'Free fall' was out of the question.
Although output fell 3 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, there
were now signs that the situation was stabilising, he claimed. Industrial
production had not fallen further, and foreign orders had risen.
Meanwhile, growth in the M3 money supply measure was 'rather flatter' than a
little while ago, and there were signs that inflation would slacken as the
year continued, he said.
Nevertheless, the bank had to assess these developments carefully, and
proceed cautiously with further monetary relaxation. Money supply must
remain the dominant factor in its deliberations, Mr Tietmeyer added.
His speech reflected the dilemma facing the central bank's policymakers. On
the one hand, the weakening of the German currency - partly as a result of
the recession - militates against interest rate cuts. On the other, the bank
appears to believe that conditions which will allow a resumption of its
monetary easing - to aid economic recovery - are improving.
But Mr Tietmeyer made plain that the key to resolving the dilemma lay
outside the Bundesbank. 'The limited recent weakening of the D-Mark should
be read as an indication of the need for convincing solutions to Germany's
home-made problems,' he said.
The bank's 'stringent' policies had helped prompt a re-thinking process.
'The more this process produces concrete and binding decisions, the greater
the room to manoeuvre on monetary policy,' Mr Tietmeyer added.
The Bundesbank is studiously monitoring the government's attempts to cut
public spending. Over-blown deficits and public sector borrowing
requirements are now among the main causes of excessive growth in money
supply, which the bank sees as the prime source of future inflation.
A series of small 'dribbling' interest rate cuts came to a sudden stop last
month after M3 was found to have lurched through the bank's upper target
range in April. Growth slowed slightly again in May to 6.7 per cent
annualised, and if it is found to have fallen within the 4.5 per cent to 6.5
per cent range this month, the bank's main condition for more cuts will have
been met.
However, if there are no signs of spending restraint, economic data worsens
and the D-Mark weakens, further progress will be put in doubt. The Bonn
cabinet is due to finalise a package of spending cuts by the end of this
month.

THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern

commitments, and 1.46m job guarantees. Privatisation receipts are less than
DM50bn.
Few Treuhand officials, however, are prepared to forecast how many workers
will lose their jobs in these privatised industries once the contracts end.
The proportion of unemployed, including those in part-time work, or on job
creation and training schemes is more than 30 per cent in each of the five
east German states.
So far, 3,000 enterprises have asked the Treuhand to amend the contracts.
But Mr Brahms said most of these amendments were minor. 'Some investors
found that they had to retrospectively deal with outstanding claims on
property rights, and others have asked for reductions of guaranteed work
places of between one and 10 employees. The contracts were unclear. These
problems are manageable,' he said.
Of that number the Treuhand yesterday said it was renegotiating 400
contracts, or 1 per cent of the agency's total amount. Some involve
non-payment by German and foreign companies, mismanagement of Treuhand
grants, corruption, and enterprises facing difficulties caused by the
collapse of the markets in eastern Europe.
But Mr Brahms insisted that the Treuhand would not take back any of the
enterprises. 'Our job is to privatise. Taking back any enterprise would set
a very bad precedent,' an agency official said.
The Treuhand has already started monitoring 6,405 job guarantee contracts
concluded in 1992, which secure 411,519 jobs.
Of those, Mr Brahms thought fewer than 8,000 jobs would not have been
honoured.
However, the system of penalties whereby the enterprise would have to
compensate any job losses outweighed any short-term advantage in cutting the
workforce.

THE German government and the United Nations' top official in Europe joined
forces yesterday to counter an attempt in the country's constitutional court
to order an immediate withdrawal of German troops from UN operations in
Somalia.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said such a move would cause
grievous damage to Germany's international reputation. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the
foreign minister, said it would have 'catastrophic effects' on the morale of
the German soldiers.
They were backed by Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the former Soviet deputy foreign
minister, who is now UN under-secretary general in Geneva. He declared that
the involvement of German troops in the Somalia operations was of the
greatest importance for the UN mission, and for the restoration of peace in
the country.
Mr Petrovsky was standing in for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary
general, who had offered to give evidence in the constitutional court when
he arrives in Germany for an official visit today. In the event, the hearing
finished last night and a ruling is expected by tomorrow. The big guns were
called up in defence of the peace-making mission, after leaders of Germany's
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday demanded the immediate
withdrawal of the German troops, on the grounds that they were part of a
military operation.
The SPD claims that such a use of the army outside the Nato area is excluded
by the constitution. The SPD has called for a ruling by the constitutional
court in Karlsruhe to recall the 250 soldiers already stationed in Somalia.
Mr Ruhe retorted that the men were in less danger than those flying supply
missions in former Yugoslavia.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EIB to receive new facility to help
smaller businesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC LEADERS yesterday approved a new Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) soft-loan
facility for the European Investment Bank to help small and medium-sized
businesses and to fund road and transport projects in Europe. It is an
extension of an Ecu5bn EIB credit line agreed at last year's Edinburgh
summit. It will remain open beyond 1994, providing an interest rate subsidy
of up to 3 per cent.
The Copenhagen summit also agreed that EC finance ministers should study a
European Commission proposal to provide an Ecu5bn bridging loan at market
rates so that states have more money to spend on infrastructure. The loan
would be available until the end of 1995, to be repaid later from structural
funds.
Commission officials expressed satisfaction that these short-term
palliatives to Europe's unemployment crisis had won approval. But UK
officials predicted they would be watered down in ministerial meetings in
the autumn.
Despite differences on how to revive growth and unemployment, EC leaders
issued a strong call for a rapid lowering of European interest rates. They
also gave a mandate to Mr Jacques Delors, to continue his study on how to
reverse Europe's decline in competitiveness.
Mr Delors will produce a white paper in time for the Brussels summit in
December. Meanwhile, member states will submit ideas on how to cure
'Eurosclerosis' to the Commission before September 1.
The Copenhagen summit signalled the opening shots in what will be a divisive
debate on why Europe is failing to create as many jobs as Asia and the US.
Britain is calling for a fundamental rethink of the EC's approach to job
creation, stressing more flexible labour markets and lower social costs for
businesses; other EC states are adamant that Europe's social net remain
intact.
Some EC officials predict the Delors white paper will be similar to that
which launched the single market in 1985, which drew up almost 300
directives or laws. The present initiative is very different: the
Commission's goal is to play a co-ordinating role rather than set detailed
rules for member states to act.
Officials believe the EC 'umbrella' provides cover for countries like Italy
and Spain to take unpopular measures; but the opposite is true for the UK,
where industrialists and politicians continue to jib at what they view as
unnecessary interference from Brussels.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Community decides it is time to roll
up its sleeves - Ian Davidson sees the acceptance by the Twelve that they
must take responsibility in Bosnia as a foreign policy watershed for the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST every expectation, the European Community this week passed a
fundamental watershed in its history, with the decision to provide men and
money to protect Moslem safe havens in Bosnia.
We do not yet know in detail how the Copenhagen declaration will work out in
practice: the real decision to send troops can only be taken individually by
each member state. But the fundamental precedent is that the EC has for the
first time moved beyond its traditional penchant for issuing wishy-washy
expressions of opinion on difficult foreign policy issues, to a commitment
to action.
In effect, the Community appears to have accepted that Bosnia is a European
responsibility. In Resolution 836, the United Nations Security Council voted
for the establishment of safe havens in Bosnia; on Friday the council
followed this up by authorising the deployment of troops by member states.
Nato ministers have met and said the organisation would implement the
policy; but they did not offer to provide the troops required to do so. The
European Community has not formally decided on the sending of troops; that
would be beyond its power. But it is now politically committed to the end
result. This is a new situation.
Sceptics will assume that this week's declaration will prove to go beyond
what the Community can deliver. Britain already has a significant contingent
in Bosnia, but yesterday the UK government declared it would send no more
men. The Germans claim to be inhibited by their constitution from sending
troops. The French already have the largest military force in ex-Yugoslavia,
and will be reluctant to send more.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said Madrid would not add to
the 1,200 troops it has in Bosnia. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary
general, has indicated that he would not welcome the deployment of troops
from Italy. Greece has said that, as a neighbour of the former Yugoslavia,
it is inhibited by UN rules from sending troops.
So, if all these Community countries do not provide the forces, it is not
obvious which of the other six will be ready to come up with the 7,500 men
needed to protect the safe havens.
And yet, in one way or another, the Bosnian tragedy and the European
Community have both crossed some kind of Rubicon. The choice in Bosnia has
become quite stark: either the Community will mobilise, by itself or with
others, the troops necessary to protect the safe havens; or else it will be
driven back on to the strategy preferred by President Bill Clinton, to lift
the arms embargo and (probably) start bombing the Serbs.
On Monday, indeed, under pressure from Mr Clinton, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
actually started canvassing his Community colleagues with the case for the
preferred US policy. In the event, his canvassing backfired, because
President Francois Mitterrand succeeded in persuading his partners that the
EC must not only stand by its agreed safe havens policy, but must take the
practical steps to implement it.
Those two alternative options remain; but in effect the Community has moved
into point position for determining which of them is activated. If the
Twelve succeed in mustering the minimum forces required, they will be
responsible for the military enforcement of a ceasefire and a negotiation;
and they may find themselves inextricably embroiled in a conflict which may
yet demand further troop reinforcements for an indeterminate period.
If they fail to muster the minimum force required, the Community's
pretensions will be immediately exposed, and they will be forced to switch
track. This choice will have to be faced very quickly, such is the
precariousness of the situation in Bosnia. According to the Danish president
of this week's summit, prime minister Poul Rasmussen, the decisions will
have to be taken in days rather than weeks.
It is quite difficult to understand how we got here. The Community is
manifestly ill-equipped for handling any kind of operational foreign policy,
let alone the military containment of a foreign war. The Maastricht treaty
claims to aim at the eventual development of a common foreign and security
policy; but most people rightly regard the treaty's formal provisions with
amused derision.
Large countries like France and Britain would prefer to cling nostalgically
to essentially national foreign policies, as well as to their special
privileges as nuclear powers, even if they admit the occasional case for
'co-operation'. Small countries like Denmark and Portugal would rather not
have any foreign policy at all. It is difficult to imagine what possessed
the Twelve collectively this week, to come out with a declaration which
effectively commits them to common action of the most demanding kind.
No doubt it is partly a response to the realisation that, on this occasion
and for this problem, the Americans are simply not going to take the lead,
let alone take charge. In other words, Bosnia is in practice Europe's
problem; if the outside world is to exert any effective influence on it,
Europe must take the lead.
After so much savagery and so much suffering in Europe's back yard, this
long-delayed reaction of shame does not come too soon.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EC fears grow on high cost of
creating jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE summit revealed that there is a consensus emerging among the Twelve that
the cost of creating jobs in the Community is too high, and that Europe's
competitiveness is suffering so badly that it is in danger of exporting jobs
rather than goods.
But there is little to indicate that governments are preparing to tear down
Europe's traditional welfare systems. In spite of British crowing that the
debate is moving 'inexorably in the direction we have been advocating for
some time,' as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, concluded, Britain's
partners are not about to rip up the EC's social charter.
'No monster or dragon has been slain by the British delegation,' insisted a
senior European Commission official.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the social democrat prime minister of Denmark who
chaired the summit, went out of his way to stress that the 12 had begun a
debate on jobs and competitiveness 'without questioning the basic principles
of our social welfare system.'
But what has started is a radical rethink on labour costs and flexibility,
and on ways the EC can regain competitive advantage and restore growth. This
debate will certainly reshape thinking on EC social policy, a debate likely
to be complicated by sharp differences over whether the EC should develop an
industrial strategy.
Behind the fuzzy outline of Mr Delors' presentation on jobs and
competitiveness is the conviction that Europe cannot compete with Japan and
the US, let alone, with eastern Europe and China, simply by driving down
wage and non-wage costs.
Part of Mr Delors' solution is that the EC must 'trade up' into ever higher
added value activity. This means much more spending on infrastructure,
research and development and training.
Liberal member states, with the UK in the vanguard, see a disguised
industrial policy behind such prescriptions, which Mr Delors failed to
insert in the Maastricht treaty, and in the seven-year EC finance package
agreed at the Edinburgh summit.
The UK has already objected to Brussels plans to reform the Ecu6bn (Pounds
4.71bn) EC social fund, by siphoning off funds targeted on young and
long-term unemployed to allow companies undergoing restructuring to retrain
their workers.
Other parts of the Delors prescription, like more spending on active labour
market policies, more job-sharing, and switching taxes on labour to
eco-taxes on energy and natural resources, reflect a shift in emphasis
towards those without jobs and away from setting terms for those in work.
A green paper on the future of social policy, due from the Commission in the
autumn, will confirm the shift. But neither Brussels nor the UK's partners
are likely to abandon outstanding draft laws derived from the Social
Charter.
Mr Major singled out the recently passed working time directive, and
Brussels proposals to protect part-time and young workers and acquired
employment rights, as particularly 'muddle-headed meddling', and argued that
all proposals should be screened for their impact on costs and
competitiveness. This is likely to happen more and more.
Despite the opt-out, the UK has had to fight hard to dilute measures it
abhors, like the working time directive. It is having to negotiate
assiduously on measures its partners may introduce under the social chapter.
Nevertheless the UK is right in believing costs have moved up the social
agenda of all its partners. When the working time directive was finalised
this month, a so-called no-regression clause - a pledge by the 11 not to use
concessions designed for the British to backslide on their own working time
conditions - was struck out without demur.

THIS WAS not a summit that settled anything. But from Mr John Major's
perspective that perhaps was no bad thing.
With the final act of the Maastricht drama now drawing to a close in the UK
parliament, the prime minister had two well-defined objectives.
The first was to persuade sceptical European counterparts that Britain -
stranded outside the ERM, dismissive of Emu and disparaging of the social
chapter - can still make a significant contribution to the debate on
Europe's future.
The second, and more immediate, aim was to persuade a rather different brand
of sceptic in his own Conservative party - the Europhobes - that he is being
listened to, that Europe might yet forsake its obsession with internal
institutional change in favour of a liberal, free-market, outward-looking
agenda.
Mr Major half-succeeded. Copenhagen provided the evidence of post-Maastricht
exhaustion among Europe's leaders.
British officials could claim that federalism was a word scarcely uttered at
the summit table. 'Reality has broken in,' declared Mr Major. With 17m
unemployed across the Community and the total rising there was grudging
admission that the biggest challenge facing Europe was to reverse the
decline in its competitiveness.
But his partners still cannot understand his antagonism to the social
dimension and are less than amused by UK boasts that its more flexible
labour market acts as a magnet for inward investment.
The realities, though, of large budget deficits, of inexorable increases in
social security budgets and of rising jobless totals have had an impact. Mr
Major still faces battles over several planned directives, the part-time
work and young persons employment proposals among them. But it was hard to
detect any enthusiasm for another wave of social harmonisation.
With the Dutch, the Spanish, the Portuguese and one or two others ready to
use phrases like 'flexible labour markets' and 'social priorities', Mr Major
claimed the summit marked a breakthrough.
He did not agree with the prescription of some of his partners for restoring
Europe's ailing economies, but at least the Community had agreed on the need
to confront the hard realities. It was now 'addressing today's needs and not
tomorrow's dreams'.
There was hyberbole in much of this. At these summits Britain still looks
the reluctant partner. But Mr Major played his cards well. He has had much
worse summits.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Communique stresses unemployment and
security issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE following are extracts from the final summit declaration:
The European Council gave special attention to, on the one hand, action
aimed at tackling the economic and social problems faced by the Community
and particularly the unacceptably high level of unemployment and, on the
other hand, to the wide range of issues relating to peace and security in
Europe.
Growth, competitiveness and unemployment: The European Council is deeply
concerned about the present unemployment situation and the grave dangers
inherent in a development where an increasing number of people in the
Community are becoming permanently detached from the labour market. The
European Council pledged the determination of the Community and its member
states to restore confidence through the implementation of a clear strategy
 -covering both the short term and medium-to-long term - to restore
sustainable growth, reinforce the competitiveness of European industry and
reduce unemployment.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: The European Council agreed on the
overriding importance of creating the budgetary and economic conditions for
rapidly bringing interest rates in Europe down, thereby narrowing the
existing gap between interest rates in Europe and interest rates in other
major industrial countries.
The European Council recalled that the exchange rate policy of all member
states is a matter of common interest. It underlined the essential role to
be played by the European Monetary Institute in this area. It invited the
Commission to present proposals on all the necessary implementing measures
relating to the second stage of economic and monetary union, so that they
can be adopted by the Council as soon as possible after entry into force of
the treaty and before 1 January 1994.
Gatt: The European Council underlined the need for the Community to continue
to play an active part in achieving further progress while preserving the
European identity throughout the negotiations.
The European Council stressed that it was essential to relaunch the
multilateral process in Geneva as soon as possible on all topics, including
agriculture, in order to complete a comprehensive, durable and balanced
agreement before the end of the year.
Early identification of the main elements of a large market access component
and real progress on services and intellectual property, including
contributions from all Gatt partners, would help to maintain momentum and
pave the way for the conclusion in time of the final package.
Enlargement: The European Council took note of progress in the enlargement
negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. It recalled that the
negotiations will, to the extent possible, be conducted in parallel, while
dealing with each candidate on its own merit.
The European Council is determined that the objective of the first
enlargement of the European Union laid down by the Lisbon and Edinburgh
European Councils should become a reality by January 1 1995.
Relations with the associated countries of central and eastern Europe: The
European Council welcomed the courageous efforts undertaken by the
associated countries to modernise their economies, which have been weakened
by 40 years of central planning, and to ensure a rapid transition to a
market economy. The Community and its member states pledge their support to
this reform process.
The European Council today agreed that the associated countries in central
and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European
Union. Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to
assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and
political conditions required.
Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of
institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and
respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning
market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and
market forces within the Union.
Russia: The European Council is looking forward to continuing the close
co-operation with Russia in the political field and to jointly contributing
to the solution of international crises. This is seen as an essential
contribution to peace and stability in Europe and the world.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Refusal to attend peace talks puts
future of Izetbegovic in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Bosnia's collective presidency will attend peace talks in Geneva
today without their leader, President Alija Izetbegovic, after failing to
persuade him to participate in the negotiations.
Mr Izetbegovic's absence reflects a serious split in the presidency over
whether proposals put forward by the Serbs and Croats for the creation of
three ethnic mini-states in Bosnia, linked only by very loose confederal
ties, could serve as the basis of a peace settlement.
It is likely, sooner or later, to lead to the replacement of Mr Izetbegovic,
whose term of office in the rotating presidency was extended last December
for the duration of the war in Bosnia. However, Mr Fikret Abdic, a moderate
Moslem member of the presidency, yesterday strongly denied suggestions that
he was trying to unseat Mr Izetbegovic.
The leader of the Bosnian delegation at the Geneva talks would be Mr Franjo
Boras, a Croat member of the presidency, and not himself, Mr Abdic said. 'I
do not want the central issue to be Mr Izetbegovic's replacement. The
central issue is peace in Bosnia.'
Mr Izetbegovic flew straight to Zagreb from Copenhagen on Monday night,
after failing to persuade European Community leaders to support the lifting
of the United Nations embargo on arms sales to Bosnia, in spite of West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's backing for such a move.
By the time Mr Izetbegovic arrived in the Croatian capital, the other eight
members of the presidency had already voted 7-1 in favour of participation
in the Geneva talks today. Only vice president Ejup Ganic, joined later by
Mr Izetbegovic, opposed such a step, and refused to go.
The other members of the Bosnian presidency, who have been invited to the
talks by Lord Owen, one of the two international mediators, are joining
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
in Geneva to hear more details of their proposals, unveiled in outline last
week. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his
Croat opposite number, are also expected to attend the talks.
Mr Tudjman has indicated that the Serbian-Croat proposals, due to be
presented separately but after co-ordination of the two sides' positions,
will consist of a division of Bosnia into three largely homogeneous ethnic
cantons, similar to an earlier EC plan drawn up by Mr Jose Cutileiro of
Portugal. However, both the Bosnian Moslem and Croatian parts of the country
would be divided into two separate geographical areas, making five regions
altogether.
The general assumption in EC capitals is that, while the Bosnian Serbs will
have to withdraw from some of the territory occupied by them since the
outbreak of the conflict 14 months ago, they will not have to give up as
much as under the now defunct Vance-Owen plan.

FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: States fail to meet ideal of openness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Twelve's proclaimed ideal of a more open and accountable Community made
only halting progress at the Copenhagen summit, disappointing the Danish
presidency, which had championed the cause of transparency and pioneered the
televising of parts of EC Council of Ministers meetings.
The Council and the European Commission were enjoined to put in place
promised measures on access to EC information and subsidiarity -
decision-making at the lowest practicable level - by the end of the year.
The Commission wants to give the public right of access to all EC
information, except where commercial confidentiality, relations with non-EC
countries, privacy, monetary stability or national security would be
endangered.
However, a row between the member states and the European parliament over
categorising sensitive information, and the lack of enthusiasm of members
such as the UK, Belgium and Portugal on openness, are holding up the
much-vaunted plan for 'a Community close to its citizens'.
Countries like the UK and Germany are more interested in subsidiarity, in
devolving rather than opening up EC decision-making. 'Nothing is more
dangerous for the image of the EC than the impression that it is encroaching
on the competence of member states,' Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign
minister, told the summit.
The Commission is to complete a review of 45,000 pages of EC laws and
regulations in the light of subsidiarity by December's Brussels summit, and
won praise from the Twelve for 'submitting proposals only when it feels they
fulfil the subsidiarity criteria'.
But the commitment in the summit's conclusions to provide 'the fullest
possible access to information' was the sort of compromise which advertised
that there is still a long way to go before the EC as a whole will accept
much closer scrutiny of its operations.

Serb and Croat forces yesterday jointly attacked Konjic in central Bosnia,
according to Bosnian radio, Laura Silber reports from Belgrade. Bosnian
radio appealed to the United Nations to send food to nearly 60,000 people
trapped in the town. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, appealed
on radio to keep Bosnia as a 'common homeland for Moslems and Croats' and
urged Croats to stay at home rather than flee to Croat-held territory. In
Gorazde, the last Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, a relief convoy was
finally able to cross Serb lines into the UN-designated safe area. Serbs had
launched a month-long offensive on Gorazde banning passage of aid despite
its protected status. Ten trucks carrying 80 tonnes of aid and their
armoured escort were waved through the besieging Bosnian Serb army's front
lines.

FT  23 JUN 93 / EC promises more troops for Bosnia peacekeeping role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders pledged yesterday to provide more troops and
money for the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
The decision defuses an internal row over whether to support a US-German
call for lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems.
The Community goal is to reinforce protection for the Bosnian Moslem
civilian population stranded in six UN-designated 'safe areas'. However, it
is unclear which countries will send the troops, as none of the principal
Community members came forward with fresh commitments.
At the end of a two-day EC summit in Copenhagen dominated by Bosnia and the
Community's unemployment and economic growth crisis, Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, declared that the meeting would end a long
period of uncertainty over the direction of Europe.
Mr Rasmussen, who chaired the summit, described the commitment to send money
and troops as a 'decent reply' to the escalation of fighting in Bosnia. He
predicted that commitments from EC and other governments to supply about
7,500 troops could be met within a matter of days or weeks.
EC diplomats expressed hope that the imminent dispatch of reinforcements
could encourage the Serbs, Croats and Moslems to narrow their differences in
the Geneva peace talks which resume today.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany expressed disappointment that other EC
leaders had rejected his plea for a partial lifting of the arms embargo
against former Yugoslavia during a tense session on Monday night.
Mr Kohl's intense lobbying effort followed contacts with US president Bill
Clinton, who has long advocated a policy of arming the Moslems and possibly
launching air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to force them to accept
international peace plans.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, Germany's closest ally, said if the
EC was not ready to send troops 'within the next few days' then the arms
embargo should be lifted.
Mr Mitterrand's intervention galvanised the Twelve into making a fresh
commitment to provide ground forces. But it revived the dormant debate over
whether to lift the arms embargo.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, ruled out arming the Moslems 'at present',
calling the policy a 'counsel of despair'. But echoing other leaders'
reservations, he ruled out dispatching more British troops to Bosnia.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister of Spain, which also has troops in
Bosnia, opposed any increase in the Spanish contingent.
The impression that EC leaders were lukewarm about their compromise was
strengthened when Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the main
proportion of new troops for Bosnia should come from outside the Community.
'But the EC must make a gesture,' he said.
Mr Kohl made little effort to disguise his outrage that nothing was being
done to prevent the Serbs and Croats from hanging on to their territorial
gains in Bosnia-Hercegovina, a state recognised by the EC in the early
phases of the civil war in former Yugoslavia.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Rosyth in cut-price Trident bid: Fife yard offers submarine
refit deal Pounds 70m lower than previous estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROSYTH naval dockyard in Fife yesterday made an unexpected 11th-hour bid
to swing the government decision on Trident refit work with a radical new
cut-price scheme.
Its new plan, designed to stop the crucial nuclear submarine refit business
going to Plymouth's Devonport yard, would require Ministry of Defence
investment of just Pounds 60m - half the cost of Devonport's latest bid and
Pounds 70m less than Rosyth's previous bid of Pounds 130m. Rosyth's
managers, Babcock Thorn, announced the proposal just two days before the
cabinet was expected to make its long-delayed decision on which yard should
become the sole UK site for refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered
submarines.
Thousands of jobs hang on the verdict. Although the loser is expected to
receive guarantees of other naval work, its long-term survival will be in
doubt.
Rosyth's latest proposal produced an explosive reaction at Devonport, which
dismissed it as 'a special last-minute one-day-sale offer'.
Devonport Management Limited (DML) said it believed it had come ahead in all
four stages of bidding over the past 11 months.
'What credibility can an offer of this kind at this stage possibly have?' Mr
Peter Whitehouse, DML's business development manager, said. 'What do they
think this is, a blasted supermarket sale of toilet rolls?'
The MoD said last night it was not clear whether the latest bid would be
considered admissible.
A decision was postponed last December after Babcock Thorn offered a project
similar to Devonport's, adapting existing docks. Its bid was previously
based on completing a more expensive purpose-built dock complex, on which
more than Pounds 120m has been spent.
The new proposal submitted to the MoD involves using a dock recently
upgraded at a cost of Pounds 20m as an emergency facility for Trident.
Radioactive fuel would be removed at this dock early in the refit, allowing
most of the work to be done in existing docks, which would not need to be
upgraded. The emergency dock would then be used for fuel loading at the end
of the refit.
Rosyth said the scheme would enable it to accommodate all refits and
decommissioning of nuclear submarines from July 1994 and to take the first
Trident submarine for refit in September 1999.
Mr Allan Smith, Babcock Thorn's managing director, said he was confident the
savings offered by the scheme 'must be taken into consideration'.
Together with proposals to use the original Trident project site for
disposal of old submarines, the scheme would allow the MoD to make use of
all the capital investment it had undertaken at Rosyth, he added.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Mates refuses to resign over links with Nadir: Major
infuriated by claims about funding of Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced a fresh test of his authority when the
minister at the centre of the row over Tory links with fugitive businessman
Mr Asil Nadir made clear he would not resign.
As the prime minister and Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, reacted
angrily to the latest allegations over undisclosed donations to the Tory
party, Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, said: 'I have done
nothing wrong.'
Signalling that he hoped to brazen out calls to resign, Mr Mates said the
prime minister had expressed 'full confidence' in him - though Mr Major's
support has been less than wholehearted.
At the European Community summit in Copenhagen, Mr Major gave the impression
he would be ready to accept Mr Mates' resignation but was reluctant to sack
him. The prime minister stuck to the line that Mr Mates had been guilty of
misjudgment but not 'a hanging offence'.
The reaction of senior Tory MPs today and tomorrow is likely to determine Mr
Mates' fate. Many had been urging him to resign after revelations about a
watch he gave to Mr Nadir and the loan of a car by a public relations
adviser working for the head of the collapsed Polly Peck business empire.
However the 1922 committee executive of backbench Tories could decide to
rally behind Mr Mates in an attempt to avoid undermining Mr Major's
leadership or leaving him vulnerable to charges of indecision.
In Copenhagen, Mr Major denounced as 'fantasy' reports that the
Conservatives had accepted contributions from the Saudi royal family and
rejected calls from opposition MPs that the party reveal the names of
donors.
Last night, a Labour MP used parliamentary privilege to quote from a letter
naming Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, as having met a
Saudi prince before the last election to discuss aid to the Tories.
But earlier Mr Major did little to disguise his anger at allegations about
contributors to Tory funds. Newspapers should provide evidence for the
charges or 'stop printing them', he said.
Referring to a Guardian report that a Saudi royal family member had
contributed several million pounds to the Tories just before the last
election, he insisted: 'The Conservative party does not accept money from
foreign governments or from royal families and has not done so.'
Clearly enraged about the continuing suggestions that the party was funded
through much of the 1980s from questionable sources, Mr Major offered
another hint that it was preparing to pay back money given to the Tories by
Mr Nadir.
Mr Major rejected the principle of state funding of political parties, as
urged by the Labour party. But he insisted: 'In the event that any money
handed to us is found to be tainted we will return that money.'
Separately, Sir Norman used a Commons debate on financing of political
parties to attack Touche Ross, liquidators to Polly Peck, for taking two
years to reply to a letter from Conservative Central Office on Mr Nadir's
Pounds 440,000 of donations and for leaking information to Sunday
newspapers.
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the US, said he was
considering legal action against The Guardian for a report yesterday that he
authorised a Pounds 7m donation to Tory funds.

FT  23 JUN 93 / UK is living beyond its means, warns Bank governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England,
yesterday warned that Britain, like other countries, was living beyond its
means and had to take action to cut its fiscal deficit, writes Peter Norman.
In an interview, Mr Leigh-Pemberton told the Financial Times that inflation
worldwide was now largely under control.
'So it would be very sad if, having almost defeated inflation, the world
drifted into an era of fiscal deficits, which reflect not so much cyclical
problems as structural elements which suggest that the industrial countries
are living beyond their means,' he said.
Britain was one such country where 'welfare payments and benefit systems are
so expensive that they are probably beyond the normal annual revenue tax
base', he said.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he had no quarrel with Mr Norman Lamont's March
Budget, which set out a series of tax increases to reduce the deficit but
largely postponed their implementation for at least a year.
However, he stressed that Britain had to 'get back on course to balancing
the budget over the medium term'.

FT  23 JUN 93 / World News In Brief: Union proposes pay overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, Germany's biggest and most powerful union, has proposed a
complete overhaul of pay and conditions strategies as its contribution to
overcoming the country's economic crisis. The union would give up its
demands for high pay rises 'in the coming years' in exchange for improved
working and performance-related conditions and more say in the running of
companies.

FT  23 JUN 93 / Warning to Names as Lloyd's records Pounds 2.9bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday reported losses of Pounds 2.91bn - its highest
ever - and warned that resources to compensate thousands of its worst-hit
Names were limited.
At the insurance market's annual meeting Mr David Rowland, chairman, told
1,200 Names - individuals whose assets support Lloyd's - that the losses for
1990 represented a 'low point' in its 305-year history.
The figures reflected 'an overall level of performance' which was
'unacceptable and must never be repeated', he said.
The loss is the third in succession for Lloyd's, which reports results three
years in arrears. It follows a deficit of Pounds 2.06bn in 1989 and Pounds
510m in 1988. Several thousand Names trading at the time of the losses face
financial ruin as a result and are suing the agents who handled their
affairs and managed syndicates.
Mr Rowland said he wanted 'to see that proper recompense is made to any who
have been wronged by their agents or others'. However, he urged Names to
support Lloyd's in its efforts to achieve out-of-court settlements to these
disputes.
'The prospect of years of costly litigation for some pot of gold seems to me
to have virtue for but a few,' he said.
Mr Rowland also warned that moves by some Names to press new corporate
investors to pay for past losses through high introductory fees were neither
'practical nor timely'.
Lloyd's announced in a business plan, published in April, aimed at restoring
market profitability that it hoped to attract companies to participate as
'incorporated Names' next year.
'I have no intention of selling participation in the society at a foolish
price (but) if we want new capital we have to compete for it with other
attractive investments which do not carry with them the same track record,'
added Mr Rowland. 'It is dangerous rubbish to portray any other
possibility.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) The FT Review of Business Books (20): Salty
Scottish tales - Industry

Correction (published 26th June 1993) appended to this article.
THE BEN LINE 1825-1982: AN ANECDOTAL HISTORY by Michael Strachan Michael
Russell Pounds 17.95, 248 pages
THE Ben Line will have first swum into some people's consciousness from
books about the Battle of Atlantic in which Ben Line ships were frequently
sunk by German U-boats. They may have asked: what was the Ben Line, and why
did it have that strange name?
The answer is that the Ben Line was a medium-sized Scottish shipping line,
based in Edinburgh, and it named its ships after Scottish mountains, such as
Benlomond. The past tense is deliberate: last year Ben Line sold its last
three container ships and mothballed its drilling ships. It is now largely a
shipping agency business.
This book is mainly about the post-war heyday of the Ben Line. Michael
Strachan, who devoted his career to the line and became its chairman and
chief executive, compresses the period from 1825 to 1945 into 19 pages, and
lays down his pen at 1982 when he retired. As he says, he has not written
the 'business history' a dispassionate economist might have produced. There
are few figures, sparse mention of profit and loss, and little second
guessing.
What he has written is a fine, detailed description of a how the Ben Line
worked both at sea and on land in the days when ships had their bridge
located satisfyingly halfway between bow and stern, and when British trade
was carried in British-owned ships built in British shipyards. The story is
enriched by countless anecdotes that only an insider could provide, as well
as photographs, and a good index. It sounds great fun.
Ben Line sailed mainly to the Far East. It was owned by the Thomson family
who had founded it: the key members for much of Strachan's time were Edward
(Mr Ted) and Sir Douglas. It maintained a Scottish aloofness from the grand
London-based shipping lines: when Sir Donald Anderson, chairman of P &amp; O,
paid a visit to the company in the early 1960s and lunched in 'our poky
dining room' it was unprecedented.
After years of conservatism, Ben Line accepted the case for container ships
and in 1970 formed Ben Line Containers, with Ellerman Lines taking 20 per
cent. Three vessels were built in Germany and were very successful. As this
book finishes, Ben Line had survived the mergers and alliances of the
shipping industry with its independence and identity intact. Unfortunately,
that act became impossible to sustain. It would be nice to know more.
CORRECTION
In Tuesday's FT Review of Business Books, in the story headlined Salty
Scottish tales on Page X, the correct title of Michael Strachan's history of
the Ben Line shipping group is The Ben Line 1825-1982: An Anecdotal History,
published by Michael Russell, Pounds 17.95, 248 pages.

FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Two leading Japanese groups
consider tie-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAISON Group and the Seibu Railway Group, two of Japan's largest
conglomerates, are considering a business tie-up ranging from satellite
television to credit cards.
The negotiations also come as Saison's flagship company Seibu Department
Stores is hit by the sharp fall in consumer confidence, especially in
top-of-the-range items.
The retailer recently started a restructuring programme, including the
demotion of all board members. Seibu Department, which is not stock market
listed, is understood to have posted a pre-tax loss for the year to last
February.
Saison is led by Mr Seiji Tsutsumi, while his half-brother, Mr Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi, who regularly features in lists of the world's richest men, heads
Seibu Railway Group, the railways and leisure empire.
The business tie-up is seen as a reconciliation between the two men, who for
years have been portrayed in the Japanese press as bitter rivals.
The two groups are looking to establish a new satellite television channel,
using a new BS-4 satellite, where Seibu Railway, which holds a pro-baseball
team, will supply sports software, while Saison will provide entertainment
and arts information.
Seibu Railway and Saison are looking to combine each others' credit card
business. Saison's credit card currently has some 10m holders, while Seibu
Railway has a credit card network for its hotels.
The groups may consider integrating their hotel businesses. The Seibu
Railway Group owns Japan's largest hotel network, while Saison bought a
stake in Inter-ontinental Hotels in 1988.
Seibu Department Stores plans to reorganise operations. The move highlights
the severe problems Japanese retailers are facing as the current economic
downturn is affecting consumer spending.
Seibu, the core operation of the Saison group, which includes Seiyu, the
supermarket chain, currently has debts of around Y320bn (Dollars 2.93bn).
It said it was considering postponing future openings of new outlets and
reorganising its affiliates.

HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation has opened its fifth branch in
China in a further sign of foreign banks extending their presence on the
mainland to take advantage of booming trade and investment opportunities,
writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
HSBC's latest branch is located in Tianjin and will complement its branches
in Shanghai and in southern China. Standard Chartered Bank and Banque
National de Paris are among foreign banks in the north-eastern port city.
The People Bank of China, the country's central bank, has also approved
applications by Credit Lyonnais and Societe General to establish branches in
Tianjin. China's strategy is to open coastal trading cities to foreign banks
as a first step towards allowing greater foreign involvement in its banking
sector.

Bula Resources, the Irish exploration company, turned in a substantially
higher loss of IPounds 2.57m (Pounds 2.5m) in 1992, compared with IPounds
201,000.
Some IPounds 2.3m of that was attributable to exceptional costs.
Turnover fell to IPounds 1.58m (IPounds 2.2m) following a fall in US oil
production.
Costs of sales were also reduced, from IPounds 1.73m to IPounds 1.37m.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Rhone-Poulenc seeks FFr4.5bn through sale of Roussel stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group, hopes to raise FFr4.5bn (Pounds
530m) by next month through the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Roussel
Uclaf, the bioscience company.
The deal will give Hoechst greater control of Roussel, in which it holds a
54.5 per cent stake. The German company felt restricted by the stake of
Rhone-Poulenc, in which the French government has a 43.4 per cent interest.
The disposal will be made through an open offer on the Paris stock market
and an international private placing.
It will enable Rhone-Poulenc to reduce borrowings of between FFr33bn and
FFr35bn. This will enhance its chances of being chosen as one of the first
targets of the new centre-right French government's privatisation programme.
Roussel's share structure will be simplified. After the sale, preferred
non-voting shares will be swapped for ordinary voting shares on a
three-for-two basis.
Roussel plans to increase its capital by FFr1.1bn, thereby raising the
controlling holding of Hoechst, the German chemicals group, from 54.4 per
cent to 57 per cent.
The new shares, worth about FFr1.2bn, will pay Hoechst for the transfer of
Laboratoires Hoechst, its French pharmaceuticals business, to Roussel and
for giving the latter a 50 per cent interest in Albert Roussel Pharma, a
German marketing company in which it already held 25.1 per cent.
The share sale is in two parts, an international book-building exercise, and
a public share offering on the Paris stock exchange.
Early bids for the international offering are being asked at between FFr550
and FFr575. The price for the international offer will be struck on July 5,
while the book-building is scheduled to close on July 12 when trading in the
shares will resume. The shares were suspended at FFr575 yesterday.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is the global co-ordinator. The Paris offering is
managed by Banque National de Paris. An international road-show starts in
Switzerland tomorrow.

FT  22 JUN 93 / People: . . . but loses top-rated media analyst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, James Capel has lost another top-rated analyst as Neil Blackley,
whose specialty is the media, leaves to join Goldman Sachs from the
beginning of September.
'Goldman may not have the same distribution and research capabilities in the
UK as Capel, but it has the strength in corporate finance throughout
Europe,' says Blackley, who will be looking at all of Europe.
At Capel, Blackley became well known for his early bearish stance on Maxwell
Communications Corporation, so it is ironic that he should be moving to a
firm that has just been fined Pounds 160,000 by the regulatory authorities
for its activities in relation to the late Robert Maxwell. 'Capel got
offered the MCC brokership twice and turned it down,' says Blackley who
acknowledges Goldman's association was a concern initially.
'But I am now convinced that Goldman is a very ethical firm and that this
was an aberration occurring as the company was developing in a new area.'
Blackley, 36, says one of the attractions is the prospect of working, in
conjunction with the telecommunications analyst, on a study similar to one
already produced for the US on the effects of digital compression on the
media and other aligned industries.
'I have had quite a few offers over the years (though not from Goldman) but
I had not felt inclined to leave until now,' adds Blackley, who has been at
Capel for the last decade.
Having sustained the number one slot for research in the Extel survey for 11
years, Capel has slipped in the last two years and now stands at number
three.

FT  22 JUN 93 / People: James Capel finds chief strategist . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Chambers, head of international institutional equity management at
Citibank Global Asset Management, is crossing the fence to become broker
James Capel's chief investment strategist.
Alastair Ross Goobey and Martin Paling, Capel's strategy duo, both left
earlier this year, and both for fund management jobs. Ross Goobey went to
become the boss of Postel, running the country's largest pool of pension
fund money; Paling, who then briefly stepped into his shoes as chief
investment strategist, moved to Baring in May, and will be in charge of
asset allocation in the Pacific and South East Asia based in Hong Kong.
Keith Skeoch, Capel's chief economist, points out: 'A lot of clients do not
think that strategy is done that well at brokers, which is why we wanted
someone from the other side of the fence. Peter also has a much more
up-to-date knowledge of the latest investment techniques from the coal
face.' Capel, meanwhile, offers Chambers 'a bit more time to think' than he
would have in daily charge of a large investment portfolio, as well as the
chance to develop a much higher public profile, according to Skeoch.
In line management terms, Chambers will report to Skeoch but the latter says
that the relationship will essentially be 'primus inter pares' with the two
on the road together making presentations.
At Citibank, Chambers had established a particularly consistent record in
European equities. According to sources elsewhere in the market, important
clients included the Sultan of Brunei.
He came to the City in 1981, after taking an MBA at Manchester Business
School, to join Lazard Brothers, initially as a manager of UK pension funds
and charities, and has been a Capel client ever since.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (14): A shareholding workforce -
Privatisation has altered the corporate culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALK INTO the headquarters of the 16 privatised electricity generating and
distribution companies in the UK and you will soon see a television screen
relaying the latest share prices in the sector.
The information on the screens is in constant demand from senior executives
to the humblest employees, nearly all of whom still have shares in their
company bought at privatisation.
Employees tend to know how their company and its rivals are faring on the
stock market.
According to industry executives the screens and the interest shown in them
symbolise a cultural transformation which is producing a more competitive
atmosphere than before privatisation.
The claims are exaggerated but there have been significant changes.
Electricity companies have become more outward looking and more focused on
what they should and should not be doing.
Although they are constantly attacked for making excessive profits - or
rather the government is attacked for permitting them to do so - the
standard of their service has not become a significant issue as it did for
BT, after the telephone system was privatised.
According to Mr Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, companies have
more than met the standards he has laid down. These include guaranteeing
that electricity must be restored within 24 hours of a supply fault and
replacing a company fuse within four hours.
A source of friction with poorer customers has been reduced by the 62 per
cent drop in the number of disconnections in Britain.
The City approves such improvements - largely because it means there is also
less friction with the regulator - but it is much more interested in how the
companies are raising their efficiency to influence profits.
Critics of privatisation feel that job cutting is viewed in the City almost
as a virility symbol.
Thus Eastern Electricity, the largest company, was marked down until
recently because some analysts viewed its management as too slow to reduce
its workforce. Its shares perked up this year following a job shedding
announcement.
Few companies have matched the job cutting rate of National Power. Staff
numbers there have been reduced from 17,000 at privatisation three years ago
to less than 7,400 today.
The effect on profits has been dramatic, according to Mr John Baker, chief
executive.
Productivity in the last year, when jobs have been reduced by 4,000, has
risen by 25 per cent and salary costs by 12 per cent.
Mr Baker says this would not have been achievable if the company was still
in the public sector.
'Management would have been invited to back pedal in the interests of
political stability. In the new climate the unions have been exceedingly
constructive. It is a different culture.'
PowerGen, the other generator, is down to 4,900 staff from 9,000 three years
ago. Regional companies have been cutting too but less savagely, they argue,
because they had less fat. Midlands Electricity is typical having cut about
800 jobs from more than 8,000.
In cutting such large numbers electricity companies have taken active steps
to avoid alienating those that are left.
South West Electricity, for example, hired Charles Smith Associates, a
management consultancy which helped Rover improve its staff morale.
Performance related pay is also being introduced.
For example, Seeboard recently concluded a deal for more flexible working
and performance pay with retail staff.
Some companies are also hoping to motivate staff by making down-line
managers more profit-oriented.
East Midlands electricity recently rationalised 13 so-called cost centres
into seven 'profit centres'. Headquarters staff is being cut accordingly.
In introducing all of these changes companies have been helped by a stream
of healthy profits - some recs almost doubled profits in 1991-2 and are
showing healthy rises last year. This in turn has enabled salaries to remain
high.
The exceptions are retail and electrical contracting employees who have seen
their salaries fall as management have brought salary structures in line
with the market. Elsewhere higher than average salary rises have been
common. This year, at a time when public sector rises have been restricted
to 1.5 per cent, electricity workers have enjoyed rises above that, and in
some cases above 4 per cent.
But the biggest financial gainers have been the senior executives.
Most chairmen and chief executives of regional electricity companies earned
between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 before privatisation and between
Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000 a year later and significant increases
have followed.
If the rises continued last year - they will be revealed in annual reports
in the next few months - the Labour Party, which opposed privatisation, and
others are likely to make political capital.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Deficit, not ideology, drives French sell-off: David Buchan
outlines the likely course and timetable of the new conservative
government's privatisation programme - French Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE's new wave of privatisations is primarily a matter of money, in
contrast to those started seven years ago which were driven as much by
politics. On their return to power in 1986, France's conservatives were
determined to show that by pushing privatisation through under the nose of a
defiant President Francois Mitterrand, they could roll back the
nationalisations that were one of the main Socialist achievements of the
early 1980s.
Today, however, the conservatives have no such need to prove their political
virility. In parliamentary elections in March they routed a Socialist
government which, far from trying to re-nationalise companies in the late
1980s, partly conceded the case for private ownership by half-heartedly
selling off a few state assets themselves.
Some die-hard Socialists still rail about 'the cream of French industry
being flogged off to foreign predators'. But, as Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
economy minister in charge of privatisation, told the senate, 'the
ideological debate is over'.
The government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has a pressing need to get
a lot of money from privatisation. It cannot squeeze any more out of a
budget in which spending will outstrip revenue by FFr317bn (Pounds 38bn)
this year. So it is raising FFr40bn in a special 'Balladur bond' issue,
which it wants to finance with privatisation proceeds this autumn, rather
than by further increasing the deficit.
In theory, that should not be difficult. The government has put 21 companies
on the auction block (see table), in what will be Europe's largest
privatisation. Some of them are confirmed money-losers, such as Air France
and Bull, the computer company, which have been put on the sell-off list
probably more as a jolt to their managements than in the realistic hope of
finding early buyers. Others, though, are stars in their sectors -
Elf-Aquitaine in oil or Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals.
One big sale would do the trick this year. Selling the state's 50 per cent
stake in Elf would, according to Baring Securities, bring in between FFr38bn
and FFr47bn.
But the relatively small domestic stock market remains in frail health,
while many of the foreign investors who already hold about 30 per cent of
the shares on the Paris bourse believe Gallic protectionism will prevent
them getting much more.
The government has done away with the 20 per cent ceiling it put on foreign
purchases of the 1986-88 privatisation issues. But, taking a leaf out of the
UK government's book, it has said it would retain a golden share in
strategic companies such as Elf, Air France and the two big defence
contractors, Aerospatiale and Thomson.
If and when such companies reach private hands, the state would still retain
'very strong prerogatives' in their management 'when essential national
interests are at stake', Mr Alphandery assured anxious senators.
With pledges like this, the government will have little problem getting
privatisation through parliament. It hopes to celebrate Bastille Day (July
14) with the framework legislation on the statute book. Two weeks later it
will establish the new privatisation committee, and give it something to
work on immediately by announcing the first batch of companies to be sold.
The privatisation committee will value the companies to be sold and conduct
tenders among companies wanting to buy into the privatised entities as part
of a ring of core shareholders, or noyaux durs. Last time around, Mr Edouard
Balladur, then finance minister, took the decision himself on the noyaux
durs and came in for considerable criticism that he was rewarding political
and business cronies. To be above such suspicion, the government will now in
effect farm out the forming of the noyaux durs to the privatisation
committee.
The first batch, probably two to five companies, will cover several sectors
of the economy. The idea is to get started on a broad front on the valuing
of companies, arranging for the conversion of any non-voting certificats
d'investissement into shares and choosing banking advisers, and at the same
time to give the government some flexibility to advance or delay a sale
depending on the market.
What criteria will the government use in choosing which sales should go
forward? 'Above all, it will be the health of the companies themselves,'
says a senior economy ministry official. 'This obviously includes the state
of the sector in which it operates. We will not, for instance, offer to the
market companies which happen to be making cyclical losses, even if they are
basically sound.'
A key question for investors will be the management of the company they are
buying into. The government has inherited a bevy of managers largely
appointed by the Socialists in 1991 for three years. It has decided that
there should be no general chopping off of heads until at least 1994. But,
in the case of companies slated for privatisation before then, it has said
it may make changes.
'Experience has shown that a management must be comfortable with
privatisation for it to succeed,' the economy ministry official says.
'Privatisation involves a big publicity campaign, and it is impossible for
that to be carried out by someone who is not convinced of its merits and who
does not have a good chance of staying on after the change'.
One appointment, with privatisation clearly in mind, has already been made -
Mr Michel Pebereau moved last month from Credit Commercial de France, which
he took private with great elan in 1987, to head Banque Nationale de Paris.
From all this, it is possible to guess that the first group of companies put
on the slipway to privatisation might include BNP among the banks, AGF among
the three insurance companies, and one of the two sound and big industrial
concerns, Elf or Rhone-Poulenc.
Rhone Poulenc said yesterday it would sell its 35 per cent stake in
Roussel-Uclaf, the pharmaceutical company, for about FFr4.5bn, so reducing
its debt and making itself more attractive for privatisation.
The other guessing game centres on which companies might want to join in the
noyaux durs, which Mr Alphandery says will henceforth be open to foreign,
especially European, investors. Up to now the noyaux durs have been almost
entirely French. But many French institutional investors got a poor return
on the earlier privatisations; their shares in Paribas are worth little more
than what they paid for them in 1987 and their shares in Suez are worth
less.
Because of the cross-holdings arranged under the Socialists, some
privatisation candidates already come with their own noyaux durs. Credit
Lyonnais, whose own sale will have to wait until it moves out of the red,
has been very active, taking stakes in Rhone-Poulenc, Aerospatiale and
Usinor, the steel company. BNP has a link up with UAP, the insurance
company, and has an agreement with Dresdner bank for a 10 per cent equity
swap.
Mr Alphandery has said that noyaux durs should stay where they already
exist. But some investors are clearly keen to expand. Societe Generale, the
bank privatised in 1987, has said it would like to take equity in its
long-standing customer, Rhone-Poulenc, while St Gobain, the glass company
privatised in 1986, has been rumoured to want to link up with Pechiney, the
metals group, with which it has common interests in packaging.
The programme is clearly appetising to professional investors. It has,
however, not so far excited the small punter. According to a recent Sofres
opinion poll, only 4 per cent of the French said they were 'certainly
interested' in buying shares in the newly-privatised companies.
The government is offering a variety of incentives to entice the small
investor. These include allowing employees to buy shares in privatised
companies at a 20 per cent discount, investors to pay by instalments on some
big issues, and holders of 'Balladur bonds' to convert their bonds into
shares of privatised companies. An early test, therefore, of privatisation's
prospects will be the level of interest in the Balladur bond issue, to be
launched on Friday.
Further articles on the French privatisation programme will appear in coming
weeks

FT  22 JUN 93 / Seoul calls for peace at Hyundai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN officials yesterday appealed for an end to escalating labour
disputes at Hyundai, the nation's largest business conglomerate, which
threaten to derail the government's economic recovery programme.
A partial walkout that began more than two weeks ago at Hyundai Precision, a
container and jeep manufacturer, has since spread to six other Hyundai
companies located at the group's huge industrial complex in Ulsan.
Among the subsidiaries affected by the production slowdown is Hyundai Motor,
Korea's largest car maker. Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the nation's
biggest shipyard, are threatening to join the industrial action this week.
The well-organised trade unions at Hyundai have usually set the pace for
labour negotiations throughout the country in past years.
Government officials fear that widespread industrial action at Hyundai,
including the possibility of full-scale strikes or lockouts by the end of
the week, could spread to other industrial groups and end the government's
attempt to curb wage growth this year.
Sharp rises in wages over the past five years, which have averaged almost 20
per cent annually, have seriously harmed the country's competitiveness.
Prospects for wage moderation initially appeared encouraging this year. In
an unprecedented accord in April, the Korea Employers' Federation and the
Korea Federation of Trade Unions agreed to limit wage growth to between 4.7
and 8.9 per cent against 16 per cent in 1992.
This coincided with a sttep fall in labour disputes during the first five
months of 1993. But the number of industrial disputes has risen sharply this
month.
Vehicles are one of Korea's leading exports, with Hyundai Motors normally
accounting for two-thirds of such shipments abroad.

THE HEAD of Amnesty International said yesterday that the United Nations
World Conference on Human Rights had been a flop and called the first half
of the meeting 'a week of shame', Reuter reports from Vienna.
'This is a total flop, a sham and a week of shame,' said Mr Pierre Sane of
Senegal, the secretary general of the London-based human rights
organisation. 'While delegates were talking people were being killed,
tortured, executed or threatened all over the world.'
Mr Sane's assessment was disputed by many official delegates at the
conference of more than 160 UN member states.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHARISMA alone was enough to persuade seven former General Motors managers
to follow Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to new jobs at Volkswagen, a
Frankfurt court said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
Rejecting claims from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, that VW's hiring
the men breached fair competition rules, the court said in a written ruling
that Mr Lopez's colleagues had tried to persuade him to stay with GM.
In the event they needed no urging, having already told him before he
decided to go that they wanted to continue working with him whatever
happened. The court also said that Opel had failed to convince it that any
knowledge its former employees took with them was confidential and could not
be transferred to VW.
Opel still plans to proceed with a full hearing on the case, and, meanwhile,
investigations are continuing into possible charges of industrial espionage
against Mr Lopez and his associates.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Car bombs kill seven in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE experts examine the scene after the second of two car bombs exploded
during the morning rush hour in central Madrid yesterday. The first, four
blocks away and 45 minutes earlier, killed five senior military officers, a
sergeant and a civilian driver who were travelling in an unmarked minibus to
general staff headquarters. More than 25 people were injured in the two
blasts. The second went off near the American embassy and both bombs bore
the hallmarks of the Basque separatist Eta guerrillas, a group widely
believed to have been cornered and disarmed. Eta suffered a setback in
elections this month when its political front organisation, Herri Batasuna,
lost two of the four seats it had held in parliament.

FT  22 JUN 93 / MPs hear of missing Gulf war equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMMUNITION and other military supplies shipped out for British troops in the
Gulf may have been sold off by profiteers, the Commons public accounts
committee heard yesterday.
However, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, chief of defence procurement, said he would be
'very surprised' if large high technology equipment had found its way on to
the black market.
He was referring to 80 containers of supplies which were unaccounted for
after the 1991 Gulf war. Dr McIntosh said the loss rate, just over 1 per
cent, was 'about the commercial average'.
A recent National Audit Office report revealed that 228 metal aircraft
pallets, worth Pounds 680,000, were also lost. Dr McIntosh told the
committee these were often used to build troop shelters and were now
'probably just sitting in the sand.'
The committee's inquiry into Gulf shipments coincided with police
investigations into possible fraud in the arrangements of charter shipping
for the British military operation.
Dr McIntosh contested the NAO's estimate that the Ministry of Defence
overpaid shippers by Pounds 38m. He said the figure was unrealistically
based on rates for normal peace time activities.
The MoD believes the premium it paid for shipping supplies was 'closer to
zero', Dr McIntosh said.
He agreed, however, that brokerage fees of up to 8 per cent were excessive
and that the ministry would not normally be expected to pay more than 5 per
cent. 'That's not something we would like to see again at all.'
The reason British ships made up only 3 per cent of the vessels used was
that many were already engaged on contracts and others were com-paratively
expensive, he said.

LABOUR'S determination to exploit Tory embarrassment over the donations from
Mr Asil Nadir was underlined last night as a group of Labour MPs tabled two
Commons motions relating to MPs' acceptance of expenses-paid trips to
Turkish Cyprus. One of the motions expressed concern at one Conservative
MP's admission that he was 'involved in accepting' all-expenses paid trips
to 'the illegally occupied areas of Cyprus'. The other referred to 'recent
revelations' showing the involvement of a significant number of MPs in

FT  22 JUN 93 / Continental fund raising open to abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is one of the few European countries where political parties have no
general recourse to public finance. Labour has been urging for some time
that UK parties should be given public cash to avoid undue dependence on
outside donors, claiming that the opaque UK system is 'an open invitation to
corruption'.
Most other industrialised countries have more rigorous rules on disclosure
of political donations than those in force in Britain, but rigour is often
conspicuously absent from their application.
In Japan political parties and organisations have to make an annual report
of income and spending. Contributors who provide annual amounts of more than
a certain limit - normally Y1m - must be named. The report is also supposed
to name recipients of political spending of more than Y50,000 a year, but
there are many loopholes.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, former paymaster of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
party, was charged earlier this year with evading taxes linked to receipt of
funds from construction companies. Yesterday an official report in Tokyo
said he failed to declare Y1.85bn (Dollars 16.7m) he received in kickbacks
and donations from companies seeking favours.
Germany has taken many initiatives in the past 30 years to quell illicit
corporate financing of parties. In 1954 it became the first European country
to introduce public financing for political parties. After scandals in the
early 1980s, surrounding clandestine donations by companies led by the Flick
industrial group, German parties are required by law to publish annual
reports listing individual donors providing more than DM2,000 a year.
Italian parties are legally obliged to provide annual accounts, but these
substantially understate the true level of their financial transactions.
Italian parties' official spending of L306bn (Pounds 128m) last year - of
which more than one-third came from the public purse - is thought to
represent only about 10 per cent of expenditures of all forms of party
political activity. Most of the rest is presumed to come from clandestine
industry sources. In a referendum in April Italians voted to ban state
financing of political parties.
In France laws on disclosure have been tightened, with all parties obliged
to furnish full accounts. The Socialist party is believed to have been
involved in large-scale illicit money-raising schemes until the early 1990s
 -though such affairs are not limited to the left.
In Spain donations by individuals or corporations are subject to a ceiling
of Pta 1m. Parties rely for a big part of their funding on quarterly
payments from the state.
Evidence has surfaced of how the rules can be side-stepped. Spanish tax
inspectors have uncovered a network of dubious contributions of Pta 1bn
(Pounds 5.6m) channelled through the Barcelona-based Filesa group, some of
which appear to have been passed on to the Socialist party.

FT  22 JUN 93 / Tories have 'very strict' record of donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party has kept 'very strict' records of every donation
received for at least 23 years, a former senior Tory fundraiser has
confirmed.
Sir Bryan Wyldbore-Smith, who was director of the party's board of finance
for 22 years leading up to the last general election, said he had submitted
a statement to the cross-party home affairs select committee, which is
inquiring into the funding of political parties.
Questioned on reports citing him as saying the Conservatives received Pounds
7m of funding just before the last election from foreign backers with
business and property interests in Britain, Sir Brian said: 'I would think
it was highly inaccurate.' The figure was 'on the high side'.
In yesterday's proceedings before the home affairs select committee the
Liberal Democrats called for the provision of state funding for political
parties to ensure 'fair competition' between them and to reduce their
financial dependence on sectional interests.
Mr Graham Elson, Liberal Democrat general secretary, told the committee that
the state should fund political parties on the basis of votes gained in
general elections - even if this meant financing Sinn Fein.
State funding should go hand in hand with curbs on the national expenditure
of parties in elections.
Acceptance of state funds should be conditional on a party publishing full
audited accounts showing the sources and application of all its funding.
Meanwhile, some senior Tory backbenchers added their voices to opposition
calls for stricter rules on the disclosure of political donations.
Mr Julian Critchley, Tory MP for Aldershot, said the 'sensible' thing for
the Conservative party to do would be to 'come clean' and have its accounts
published annually.
Senior Labour officials, including Mr Larry Whitty, general secretary, are
due to appear before the home affairs committee tomorrow as its inquiry into
funding con-tinues.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, last night attacked Labour
over its links with the unions, saying its 'unprincipled campaign of smear
and unsubstantiated allegation' was 'a smokescreen for its own
embarrassments'.
He said at the Dulwich Conservative Association that Labour's real aim was
to force the taxpayer to fund political parties. 'State funding of political
parties . . . would be one of the least justified and most unpopular pieces
of public expenditure conceivable,' he said.
Sir Norman added: 'The real issue surrounding the funding of political
parties in this country is simple. It is the undemocratic way in which the
Labour party sells itself to the highest trade union bidder.'

FT  22 JUN 93 / Clinton renews call to open Japanese markets
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that whoever headed the next
government in Tokyo would still have to ensure that Japan pursues
market-opening policies.
In a radio interview given just two weeks before he is due to leave for the
Group of Seven economic summit and for bilateral talks in Tokyo, Mr Clinton
expressed little sympathy for Japan's government turmoil, putting it down to
a long legacy of political scandal and corruption.
'It's pretty clear to me', he said, 'that no matter who winds up being prime
minister of Japan, or whatever faction that person comes from, they're going
to have to continue to open their economy to our products.'
He added, echoing a consistent theme of US policy over recent weeks:
'They're going to have to continue to stimulate their economy because they
don't have a budget deficit.'
In an apparent attempt to encourage the internationalist strain among
Japanese politicians, he went on: 'They can't withdraw from the world or
shut us out now. They've got too much at stake in expanding into China and
other countries and in doing business in a very complicated world.'
He expected his bilateral talks to be 'challenging' but 'successful, simply
because of the limits on their economic options'.
Senior officials from both governments are due to hold the second round of
negotiations on the proposed new bilateral 'framework' in Tokyo this
weekend, following the first session in Washington 10 days ago.
That produced no breakthrough, and US officials had not expected one, but
the collapse of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government has raised new doubts about
whether the whole process will now be able to go through on schedule.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EC cool to calls for end to arms ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APPEALS to lift the Bosnian arms embargo found little sympathy among
European Community leaders and foreign ministers in Copenhagen last night.
President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia made an urgent plea to the EC to lift
the United Nations arms embargo so that the Bosnian Moslems could better
defend themselves against Serbs and Croats.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl later tried to win over other EC leaders to the idea
at a dinner of EC leaders, after he was reported to have received a letter
from US President Bill Clinton reiterating US sympathy for such a move.
Mr Izetbegovic, who flew to Copenhagen on the opening day of the EC summit,
renewed his often-sounded appeal on the arms embargo at a meeting with a
'troika' of EC foreign ministers. But he received no encouragement from the
'troika' - the foreign ministers of Britain, Denmark and Belgium
representing the former, present and next presidency of the EC.
Chancellor Kohl pressed his fellow EC leaders on the subject in what
diplomats described as tense and heated debate as the EC struggled with the
failure so far of its efforts to resolve the war in war in Bosnia.
Mr Kohl was reported to have run into tough opposition from countries such
as Britain and France which are worried about the safety of their troops
serving with the UN humanitarian mission in Bosnia.
Diplomats said Mr Kohl had received a letter in Copenhagen from President
Clinton reviving White House suggestions that the UN arms embargo should be
lifted so the Bosnian Moslems could defend themselves.
Mr Izetbegovic said: 'We request that the arms embargo be lifted to import a
limited quantity of defensive weapons.'
But Mr Niels Petersen, Danish foreign minister, said: 'In my view it is not
a sound idea to lift the weapons embargo; it would require a Security
Council resolution, which is not forthcoming, it would lead to more
fighting, and there would be great danger that United Nations forces would
have to be withdrawn.'

<TEXT>
VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, said yesterday that an offer for
its ferry business had been lowered by NKr100m to NKr1.1bn (Dollars 155.2m)
and that it was seeking to retain a 20 per cent stake in the unit.
The reduction of the offer - made three months ago by Union Bank of
Switzerland, on behalf of Mr Trygve Hegnar, a Vard board member, and a group
of investors - reflected an adjustment for the level of assets, an
assessment of the outlook for 1993 and other factors, Vard said.
In Vard's 1992 accounts, the three ferries which make up the fleet of the
Scandi and Larvik lines were booked, partly for tax purposes, at a value of
NKr455m - a symbolic figure which does not reflect the value of the business
as a going concern.
Vard is also less optimistic about development of the ferry business. Last
year, the addition of a new ferry increased capacity between Norway and
Denmark, but volume this year has been below expectations.
The group is uncertain about when the disposal can be concluded. It is
aiming for mid-August, although the sale would be retroactive from June 1.
In addition to approval from the Norwegian authorities, any deal would have
to be approved by Vard's creditors.

J ARTHUR RANK AND THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY by Geoffrey Macnab Routledge
Pounds 30, 270 pages
THE BRITISH film industry, to the extent that it exists at all as a separate
entity, has been in a state of crisis as long as anyone can remember. Every
decade or so the sense of doom gives way to exhilaration as the Brits invade
the Oscars or a modest-budget picture unexpectedly takes off in the US
market.
Geoffrey Macnab's study shows just how consistent the pattern of boom and
bust has been and how the pursuit of the Holy Grail - the lucrative US
market - has usually stayed just that.
The resulting dilemmas have continued to exercise committees of inquiry as
well as film makers. Should the British concentrate on low-budget movies
aimed at the domestic market, or risk more lavish productions that have to
break into the US market to have any chance of recouping their costs?
There were high points. In the early 1930s there was an unprecedented period
of expansion, with 200 British films being made in 1936 alone - until the
financiers found they were being fleeced and retired hurt. But perhaps the
highest point of all, and the most extraordinary, was how the heir to a
flour fortune, because he wanted to make projectors available to Methodist
halls to spread the good word, turned for a time into the saviour - or to
some the monopolist - of the British film industry.
In nine years from 1933 to 1942 Rank created the largest integrated film
industry empire in British history, owning both the Odean and Gaumont cinema
chains and Pinewood and Denham studios.
Rank professed not to understand the medium of film and seemed concerned
with trade and profits but not exclusively so.
'He does not talk of British films in cultural or aesthetic terms. He alone
is in a position to effect a turn-around in British film's fortune because
he alone is powerful enough to trade on level terms with the Americans,'
Macnab argues.
Red Shoes may have taken Dollars 5m at the US box office but Rank still
found the US market impenetrable. The audience couldn't understand the
British accents and anyway were only good for 'class houses.'
Macnab recounts how Rank tried everything to create an integrated successful
industry. His projects included Independent Frame, the attempt to
revolutionise production methods, Independent Producers Ltd, which gave
producers money and creative freedom, the notorious Charm School and G-B
Animation, the move into cartoons. Most ended in acrimony; cartoon
characters like Corny the Crow, Ginger Nutt and Dusty the Mole did not stand
a prayer against Mickey Mouse.
Reality intervened in 1949 in the shape of a Pounds 16m overdraft and John
Davis, the hatchet-wielding accountant. J. Arthur Rank became more and more
remote from the film scene, Davis was in control and the Rank Organisation
had a different kind of film success - the Doctor films, the Carry On series
and the comedies of Norman Wisdom.
This closely focused study is a useful addition to the history of the
British cinema. More about Rank the man and the Rank the business would have
been welcome.
Geoffrey Macnab's conclusion is necessarily pessimistic. 'In hindsight, it
seems half comic, half tragic, that all Rank's efforts to set the British
industry on its feet should spawn nothing more than a photocopying company
and a leisure conglomerate. Bingo halls and casinos help prop up a company
which emerged from Methodist halls and Sunday schools.'

<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE dislike offering or receiving criticism. So the current fad for
performance appraisal and performance management cannot be explained by any
populism. The only explanation for their popularity is that they are
perceived as techniques for improving performance at a time when improved
performance is crucial for survival.
How then to make it work? How can one offer criticism without hurting the
feelings of the other party? Criticism and Performance Appraisal (Viewtech,
Pounds 325 each plus p&amp;p) tackles these subjects. Though produced for and
aimed at the American market, and though they occasionally do not recognise
the basic insecurity which is the root of the problem, they do offer
guidelines which can make both processes easier and more acceptable.

If you have heard of Tony Buzan, you will know that he is associated with a
technique known as Mind Maps. This is difficult to describe briefly in mere
words, since its whole nature and purpose is to get away from linear
arrangement of words, so as to arrange information in non-linear manner by
graphic as well as verbal means. Mind maps can be used for collecting,
organising and visualising to-do lists and action plans, planning and
recording meetings, problem-solving and brainstorming, arranging information
in non-linear fashion for lecture notes, etc.
Users of Mind Maps will be pleased to hear that it is now possible to buy a
computer software programme called InfoMap (CoCo Systems, Pounds 119.99 plus
p/p). For various reasons, some people may prefer to continue using Mind
Maps with pencil and paper, but the main advantage of using InfoMap is that
it makes it possible to save quite a bit of time in using the technique.
InfoMap also makes it possible to integrate the use of Mind Maps with other
computer applications such as word processing, and enables three or four
pages of notes to be attached to each branch or link in a Mind Map.
There are two disadvantages to InfoMap at present. Buzan and CoCo Systems
have lost an opportunity of making more converts to Mind Maps by neglecting
to include an on-screen introduction to the technique. Readers wanting a
proper introduction to the technique can find any of Buzan's numerous books
on the subject, or get hold of Tony Buzan's video presentation of the
technique, sold under the title Mindpower (BBC Enterprises, Pounds 299).
Second, my version of InfoMap is programmed in a way that makes it possible
for me to see only part of a whole map, and I need to use my direction keys
to access other parts of it; there is, moreover, no necessary indication
that there is non-visible portion of a map sitting on the side. No doubt
these are aspects they will remedy in future upgrades of the programme.

On computer-disk too is The Art of Negotiation (Experience in Software Inc.,
USA). This also uses the medium intelligently, in that it is designed to
help managers not merely to acquire information about the subject in general
terms, but also to prepare for any specific real-world negotiation.
However, negotiation-related information is available too, and it is
reviewed in detail. The programme is somewhat inflexible in that, on
subsequent use of the programme, it insists that the user go through the
preparation in the precise sequence laid out. This is not ideal for
experienced negotiators, though even they may find it helpful. Negotiators
who are not very experienced, however, will find it helpful to learn the
discipline of going through the stages step by step. On the other hand,
though one can skip through the information, it may be irritating to be
slowed down by having to skip through the material each time one wants to
prepare for a negotiation.

usual from Prism International which has a new telephone number,

PAPER TIGERS by Nicholas Coleridge Heinemann Pounds 17.95, 592 pages
PAPER TIGERS - if you are interested in newspapers - is a perfectly
readable, rather over-long collection of pieces about some of the people who
own the world's press. Nicholas Coleridge, formerly editor of Harpers and
Queen magazine and now managing director of Conde Nast in London, is an
accomplished feature writer. This book is in effect a collection of
interlinked articles about a selection of media tycoons, some of whom (not
all) have given him an interview. It is - to repeat - readable stuff; it is
a very superior form of gossip-columnery.
The choice of subjects is rather odd, and never satisfactorily explained.
There is a heavy initial emphasis on the US (no doubt for sound commercial
reasons) - the Sulzbergers of the New York Times, the Grahams of the
Washington Post, Otis Chandler of the Los Angeles Times, of course, but does
the non-American reader care so very much about Dean Singleton in Texas or
Jim Cox Kennedy in Atlanta?
There is an interesting chapter on the three media families of India; a
double-bite at the (uninterviewed) Warwick Fairfax, who caused such disaster
in Australia; a non-piece about the absent Robert Hersant of Le Figaro; a
section on Sally Aw Sian in Hong Kong and the mysterious and sinister
Kamphol in Thailand; an absurd and unilluminating inclusion of Asil Nadir in
Turkey; and a misguided attempt to portray the Aga Khan as a significant
newspaper tycoon on the basis of his East African operation.
Then there is the real meat of the book - Conrad Black, Rupert Murdoch, Lord
Rothermere, Lord Stevens, Tony O'Reilly, all of whom make an excellent but
deeply unsatisfying read; Robert Maxwell is not attempted seriously, which
makes sense because he would need an obituary. These chapters might interest
the European reader. (Be it noted, again, that the selection is absurdly
arbitrary: no Thomson, no Italian or German, no Japanese, no Arab, no South
African or South American.)
So what does Coleridge have to say of his chosen handful? Not very much
beyond the tittle-tattle of their lives. He is interesting on the underlying
differences between British and US papers - the UK's distinction between
quality and popular national papers as against the importance in America of
very high penetration by monopolist local newspapers (which raises the
associated issue of increasingly precise targeting of ever-smaller - and
therefore more parochial? - district or regional markets.)
He argues that proprietors are still all-powerful, though fewer in number,
and by implication greater in clout. He discusses this point with a few of
them and is promised that he need not worry. When challenged by public
perceptions, Coleridge is usually reassured by his interviewee. He admits,
for example, that Murdoch has many critics, but concludes that: 'The culture
of his newspapers, particularly the tabloids, may indeed be brutal and
chauvinistic and downmarket, but that is not quite the same thing as
invariably moving the paper downmarket.'
Conrad Black of the Telegraph, Sydney Morning Herald, Jerusalem Post and
North Bay Nugget comes out of this book as the most interesting of the
UK-oriented tigers, perhaps because he is the least known and also the big
mover at present. Lord Rothermere of the Mail, the Standard and the Spilsby
and Skegness Target is the most cuddly ('He is probably the only one who
devotes any time to introspection'). Rupert Murdoch - who owns almost
everything else - turns on the charm and Coleridge laps it up.
This is, I hope it is clear, an unashamedly soft-centered portrait of
various Streets of Shame. My objection is that there is no attempt to
report, let alone analyse, the business operations of these people. Mr
Coleridge may modestly feel that he is unqualified to attempt the task, but
the snag is that the important part of the story is indeed their business
deals.
It is all very well to know that Murdoch denies being a 'born again'
Christian (merely 'practising') or that Rothermere has a Korean lady
companion, but the heart of the book should be something different: how, for
instance, did Murdoch manage to roll over his debt burden at a moment when
he faced disaster? What was the breakthrough point for the Mail on Sunday?
In such terms, Paper Tigers is not a serious book - and, fair enough, it
probably was not intended to be.
There is a curious omission. The FT does not figure in these pages -
surprising, since we surely have a role in the world more influential than
Mr Nadir's Ekonomik Bulteno. Is it because we are not 'controlled' by a
single proprietor, whatever that means? I would have thought that the
effective control of a one-armed polo-playing peer - whom, in 30 years as an
FT journalist I have never seen, nor expected to - would have been the stuff
of Mr Coleridge's dreams. It goes to show that the Cowdray family has a
genius for keeping out of the gossip columns.

FOR GOD, COUNTRY AND COCA-COLA by Mark Pendergrast Charles
Scribner's/Maxwell Macmillan International Dollars 27.50, 556pp
WHO WOULD have ever believed that a fizzy, sugary water could become the
world's most ubiquitous consumer product and turn the company that makes it
into a gold mine? That is the question that underlies Mark Pendergrast's
book.
His answer, like authors before him, is that Coca-Cola's leaders have been
shrewder than most for seeing the power of innovative, often ground-breaking
advertising to hype this soft drink to its exalted status of world brand.
But what distinguishes Pendergrast's account is that it is painstakingly
well-researched and, for the most part, cleverly written. The book has
touched off some controversy because of Pendergrast's claim that he
inadvertently found the original Coca-Cola formula, an invention of Georgia
pharmacist John Pemberton in the 1880s. Given that the formula is one of the
world's best-kept commercial secrets, Pendergrast's discovery of the formula
in an old file in the company's own library seems an extraordinary coup. The
company, naturally, suggests that the recipe he found is not genuine.
The book is full of telling anecdotes about Coke's inventor and early
leaders, Asa Candler and Robert Woodruff. It seems that Pemberton concocted
the drink, with a small amount of cocaine and a greater dose of caffeine,
largely as a remedy for his morphine habit. Candler, a miserly Atlanta
entrepreneur, was the first to see the potential of what was then just a
patent medicine that gave a lift to the consumer and relieved Candler's own
headaches. By 1888, he acquired the rights to it, not entirely honestly,
from the many parties to whom these were dispersed by Pemberton. He quickly
transformed the medicine into a popular soft drink. But its popularity soon
had a price. Public campaigns against products with cocaine forced Candler
to take the kick out of the drink by 1903.
Robert Woodruff, a crackerjack salesman and Coca-Cola's leader until the
early 1980s, is the man who made it a worldwide phenomenon. In his greatest
move, Woodruff manoeuvered to obtain Washington's blessing to manufacture
Coke around the globe for American soldiers during the second world war,
thus laying the groundwork for Coke's empire today.
But the book is lamentably shorter on insightful details about Coca-Cola's
current chairman, Roberto Goizueta, the Cuban-born chemical engineer who
took over in 1981. He shares the same limitless vision for Coke as his
predecessors; he once mused: 'Perhaps coming years will see a time when
consumers will have Coca-Cola taps in their homes.'
Goizueta was responsible for the biggest gaff in the company's history, the
attempt in the mid-1980s to alter Coke's formula. Yet Goizueta emerged
unscathed from the New Coke disaster, perhaps not least because he had
enlivened the company's performance for its shareholders.
The book is not all dinner party fodder and praise for Coke. It evenhandedly
reveals the seamier episodes of the company's history, including its
accommodation to Hitler, apartheid and Guatemalan death squads as well as
its shoddy treatment of its migrant workers. It is worth reading for those
who want a history, in Pendergrast's words, of the 'modern American attempt
to package pleasure.'

STRATEGIC BENCHMARKING by Gregory Watson John Wiley Dollars 29.95 pages
BENCHMARKING is one of those management practices which has taken time to
take root on both sides of the Atlantic. US companies were systematically
studying, and learning from, the processes of outstanding competitors, and
even non-competitors, in the early and mid-1980s. But only in the current
decade has this quality improvement technique become a hot topic for the
consultants.
One reason is that pundits initially likened benchmarking to 'industrial
espionage', maintaining that the concept of sharing information and
experiences was contrary to the principles of the free market.
Watson argues persuasively that there need be no conflict, though he betrays
a somewhat evangelistic streak when describing benchmarking as part of a
coherent (American) national challenge for continuous productivity
improvement. 'There is a more efficient use of 'society's resources' than
requiring every company to invest in relearning the lessons of the
marketplace.'
As vice president, Quality, of the Office Documents Division of the Xerox
Corporation - the company widely credited with inventing benchmarking - the
author is at his best discussing its implementation as a business process
improvement strategy rather than philosophising.
It hammers home the important point that exceptional performance is achieved
not just by measuring other people's results but by applying the lessons (or
identifying what he calls 'process enablers'). If sometimes a shade
repetitive the book is full of useful practical observations.

VISIONS OF THE FUTURE: ART, TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTING IN THE TWENTY-FIRST
CENTURY edited by Clifford A. Pickover Science Reviews, 212 pages
THE JOURNAL Popular Mechanics in 1949 tentatively predicted 'computers in
the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and perhaps only weigh 1.5
tons.' Now Visions of the Future, a catholic congregation of essays on
technology and computing over the next decade, is suggesting that we may
soon have computers floating in our bloodstream. They are already in the
palm of our hand.
The book's faults are understandable: it spreads itself thinly over
Artificial Intelligence, electronic storytelling, weather mapping, Virtual
Reality and even the Global Enneper-Weierstrauss representation for Minimal
Surfaces. This loose gathering of tentative technology should be balanced by
reading an account of changes in computing such as Technology 2001: The
Future of Computing and Communications (MIT Press, 1991).
However, Visions of the Future maps out a variety of roles for computer
technologies and applications, ranging from golf to traffic control via
molecular biology and prehistory. Amid this diversity, three unifying themes
emerge. The first is the interdisciplinary nature of the new technology.
Computing as a technical process may be electronic, but as a human procedure
it is eclectic. Here are essays on visualising numbers, on teaching writing
to groups of students, and on a model career as a computer sculptor.
The second theme is the matter of how changes in computer design will affect
how we communicate with each other over the next 20 years. Electronic mail
and computer conferencing are still teenagers at IBM, but the pace of change
itself will quicken as computer hardware improves.
Here, Davis Albert Foulger of IBM's TJ Watson Research Center at Yorktown
Heights has a fascinating essay on computer communication which runs from
Marshall McLuhan through Star Trek. He presents a three-dimensional model
media space, showing the relations between types of communication: film, TV,
animation, letters, telephone. Computer communications, being so adaptable,
create links between other media to produce programmes of text, pictures,
voiceovers and direct contact between users, what Foulger calls
'voice-into-text concurrent interaction.'
The third theme should be a comfort: as computers advance, humans can feel
more satisfied with their own brains. Granted, computers now surpass us in
technical logical skills; rational thinking, around 100,000 years old, is a
still relatively new, and serious competition arrived only with the
computer. But human survival (and that of our ancestors) has for millions of
years depended on skills which computers cannot perform: seeing and moving
in the physical world. A computer which can model fractal geometry and
Mandelbrot Sets at millions of calculations per second still cannot
recognise itself in a mirror.
Computers can search a database, but only when instructed to look for data
or patterns of data already present. The success of books as forms of
information storage - robust, browsable, accessible, - has yet to be
surpassed. The look and feel of books are better for half-remembered
information, that paragraph at the foot of a left-hand page beginning with a
part-remembered line, or that name rhyming with 'orange'.
Behind the 20 essays in Visions of The Future lies an unexpressed question.
If, as some claim, human identity (rather than personal identity) can be
reduced to the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, in what sense can computers -
reduced to strings of programmes - be said to have identity? The answer
hangs on the difference between carbon-based and silicon-based units.

THE FEAR of speaking in public can turn otherwise sensible people into
quivering lumps of jelly. Worse still, attempting to help people overcome
their fears can turn otherwise rational publishers and writers into
promoters of quack remedies.
Few areas of human activity can have produced quite as much wishful thinking
masquerading as serious advice as the field of presentation skills. The
unfortunate result is that even half-way sensible suggestions for overcoming
stage fright provoke mistrust and scepticism in the reader.
High Impact Business Presentations (by Lee Bowman with Andrew Crofts.
Century Business Pounds 9.99, 245 pages) makes a serious attempt to address
the problems created by presentation nerves. At its core is an essentially
simple technique on which the author has built an apparently successful
consultancy advising top executives.
The Bowman technique allows the speaker to read from a prepared text yet
give the impression, by the naturalness of his or her delivery, to suggest
that he is only making use of notes. The trick lies in slowing down the
speed of delivery to a point where effective use can be made of the text and
in sticking to natural speech.
Natural conversation does not consist of perfect grammar and immaculate
syntax but of broken sentences and incomplete clauses. The closer the
speaker delivery can approximate to normal conversation the better it will
come over and the more likely the audience will be to remember the message.
By attempting to polish natural speech otherwise witty people can appear
wooden and dull.
Mastering this technique allows the speaker to be much more natural than the
other artificial techniques propounded for public speaking, Bowman asserts.
He dismisses the idea that the would-be public speaker should learn to
breathe properly. This merely introduces a further distraction. He suggests
that speakers forget about the techniques adopted by actors, since the actor
is trying to pretend to be someone else. The whole essence of the Bowman
technique is to allow the speaker to remain himself.
There appears to be a lot of good sense in the Bowman technique though the
reader may well be irritated by the underlying sales pitch for the
consultancy.
For the reader fresh from the Bowman book, The Perfect Presentation (by
Andrew Leigh and Michael Maynard. Century Business. Pounds 5.99, 102 pages)
may appear to offer a somewhat low-impact alternative.
Leigh and Maynard, who run a management development and consultancy service,
cling doggedly to the traditional techniques - deep breathing, practising in
front of a mirror - which Bowman has dismissed as impossible naive. They do
not strengthen their case by their fondness for aphorisms such as 'Everyone
has butterflies - it's the professional who gets them to fly in formation.'
Leigh and Maynard's suggestions on the techniques of presentation are not
their strongest suit. 'Emotions are an amazing resource and are usually the
key to making a real impact,' does not sound the most helpful of suggestions
for the nervous platform speaker.
Fortunately, they make up only a part of this pocket-sized guide which makes
some otherwise useful comments on the mechanics of speaking to an audience.
On practical matters such as handling visual aids and assessing venues they
offer commendably practical advice which far too many public speakers
ignore. Do not let your slides and your overheads dominate your
presentation; make sure people at the back can read your visuals, and keep
them simple.
Spontaneity needs to be prepared well in advance, they suggest, and speakers
should only use jokes or humour if they feel comfortable with them.
Anecdotes drawn from the speaker's own personal experience are more telling
than a string of unconnected one-liners.
For all but a gifted minority, mastering the art of public speaking depends
on practice. A careful selection from the ideas contained in some of the
guide books may shorten this process.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): The never-ending quest
for quality - Management / Charles Batchelor on why the new BS5750 standard
is vital to commercial success

<TEXT>
IMPLEMENTING QUALITY THROUGH BS5750 (ISO 9000) by Peter Jackson and David
Ashton Kogan Page Pounds 25, 226 pages
WE MAY NOT know exactly what we mean by quality but few would argue with the
premise that is a good thing. Britain, with the poor reputation many of its
products acquired during in the 1960s and 1970s, is surely in need of it
more than most.
How can we explain, then, the controversy which has arisen over BS5750, a
quality management standard which has been adopted by some 20,000 UK
companies? (And overseas, in its international equivalent ISO9000, by
several thousand more.)
BS5750 has been criticised for being expensive, bureaucratic and not
actually guaranteeing product or service quality.
Small businesses in particular have complained that their large customers
are using BS5750 as a crude mechanism for discriminating against suppliers.
Large companies are increasingly demanding that all their suppliers meet
BS5750 even if they have previously had no complaints about the quality of
deliveries.
Part of the problem is due to the inevitable pains of moving from the
informal quality systems present in many small firms to the more formal
procedures required by BS5750. There is also no doubt that the British
Standards Institution could have done a better job of explaining the
principles behind the standard. BSI and industry are familiar with narrow,
industry-specific standards but 'horizontal' standards, covering issues such
as quality and environmental management and relevant across a broad swathe
of industry, are a relatively new idea.
Implementing Quality does not directly tackle these broader questions, being
more concerned with providing practical guidance to companies seeking to
register for BS5750. But it inevitably touches on some of the issues which
have been raised.
There is often a substantial cost involved in obtaining and maintaining
registration, but this will normally be exceeded many times by the benefits
from holding on to existing customers and winning new ones, the authors
state.
Gearing up for BS5750 can result in 'culture shock' for businesses used to
informal quality controls. The need to record business activities so that
mistakes can be traced and corrected may increase the volume of paperwork,
though not to an unacceptable degree. Increased formality has its
advantages, argue the authors, respectively a manager who has introduced
BS5750 and a consultant. Staff will be more willing to accept tighter
controls if they know they are part of a coherent quality system and not
just the result of managerial whim.
Before describing in detail how to implement BS5750, this guide begins with
a useful discussion of what is meant by quality. The conventional view is
that it represents 'the best' and by implication the most expensive. In
fact, quality should mean 'the meeting of customer requirements', whether
this is for an expensive watch which enhances the wearer's prestige and
lasts a lifetime or for an inexpensive one which keeps accurate time.
Quality, in this sense, can be achieved by the many thousands of existing
quality and service standards which have been devised over the years.
Quality systems go beyond this to ensure that the process of manufacture or
service delivery are carried out with maximum efficiency and minimum cost.
In the past quality control has consisted of weeding out faulty products at
the end of the production line. But this can be costly and in the case of
many services - a restaurant meal, legal advice - impossible to check before
the customer has discovered the fault. Quality systems, by contrast, analyse
the process by which a product is made or service delivered, identify the
correct methods and attempt to systematise them. Faulty procedures are
detected and designed out of the system.
An example quoted is of a company which had continual problems with a new
plating machine. The consultants found that each new shift was re-adjusting
the machine because operators had misunderstood their original operating
instructions. A manual setting down the correct adjustment would have
eliminated this sort of misunderstanding.
For the businessman considering registering for BS5750 this book provides a
valuable guide, clarifying the sometimes confusing detail of the standard.
When BS5750 first came to prominence, business owners asked themselves
whether they could afford to have it. Increasingly they are having to decide
whether they can afford not to have it.

THE HUMAN TOUCH by Bill Arnold and Jeanne Plas John Wiley, Dollars 22.95 272
pages
WHEN Bill Arnold became president of Centennial Medical Centre in Nashville,
Tennessee, he turned the corporate pyramid upside down by announcing an
'open door' policy.
Everyone thought it was just another management slogan - until he had his
door taken off the hinges and hung in the lobby as a monument to an outdated
leadership style.
He called it 'person-centred leadership' - a simple management philosophy
based on listening, helping people to work together, to build self-esteem
and mutual respect, and spreading decision making right through the
organisation.
He proved that allowing people to develop actually led to lower running
costs, dramatically higher sales and profits, improved cash flow and a 50
per cent reduction in staff turnover.
Centennial is the largest commercial medical centre in the US, the flagship
of the giant Hospital Corporation of America. Some 3,000 staff and 900 house
physicians run three large hospitals and seven medical office buildings,
dealing with around 116,000 'customers' and 360,000 worried/relieved
visitors a year.
Employees, or 'associates' as they became known, began to enjoy coming to
work. When other chief executives argued that running a hospital is rather
different from most large scale businesses Bill Arnold pointed out the
problems were not so different since they also involved providing
services/products and dealing with government regulations, budgeting,
management, customer satisfaction, market share and the 'bottom line'.
If person-centred management can work in a for-profit medical centre of this
size and complexity, he argues, it probably can work anywhere.
Arnold's 'hard-nosed, humanistic' principles are concerned with listening to
gripes, resolving personal frustrations, promoting honesty, an open-door
policy, encouraging new ideas, the use of brief, hand-written memos and
creating a shared vision.
How these principles were implemented, including the expected initial round
of errors, is chronicled by Bill Arnold, the doer, and by his collaborator,
Jeanne Plas, a distinguished academic who took a close interest in all
stages of the transformation.
The reason person-centred leadership took off so dramatically within this
complicated corporate environment, she suggests, 'is that it is compatible
with basic human needs. Bill insisted that his organisation had to start
from scratch. It had to get rid of some outdated dysfunctional ways of
operating and ineffective ways of thinking . . . begin with what people
need; marry those ideas to the needs of the organisation. Encourage people
to care about one another and the enterprise. Have some fun.'
It sounds deceptively simple, but The Human Touch is a remarkable account of
its effective implementation.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN POLITICS: THE NEW WASHINGTON AND THE RISE OF
THE THINK TANKS by David M Ricci Yale Pounds 25, 310 pages
SYSTEMS OF SURVIVAL: A DIALOGUE ON THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF COMMERCE AND
POLITICS by Jane Jacobs Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 16.99, 238 pages
DIAL 'M' for Political Theorist: Machiavelli, Madison, Mandeville, Marx,
Mill, Montaigne, Montesquieu, More; and the middle name of David M. Ricci,
who has written a stimulating academic account of the Washington Think Tank.
This amounts to a book about how ideas enter into public life as data,
speeches, or public policy research. The pluralism in Washington which makes
President Clinton appear indecisive results from the rise of non-government
lobby and public policy organisations at a time when the Washington
professional was becoming a manipulator of information rather than an
interpreter of moral or spiritual certainties.
While WASP ideals and the Eastern establishment (such as the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York) held sway in the 1970s, the thinkers emerging
from institutions like Harvard's Kennedy School simply took the train south
and plied their trade in Washington. In England, Oxford graduates became
civil servants and Cambridge graduates professional spies. In America, Ivy
League professional schools fed the equivalent of their own Washington
bureaux, pro or contra government. Bored lawyers, tired of government
contracts, had the opportunity for pro-bono work in social or political
causes to remind them why they became lawyers in the first place. There was
plenty of excess capacity: membership of the DC Bar trebled between 1973 and
1981 (to 34,000); you were more likely to be sued than mugged on the Metro.
The Think Tanks grew on this supply of expertise. The Brookings Institution
(1927), the Institute for Policy Studies (1963), the Heritage Foundation
(1973) and countless Political Action Committees provided the jobs and the
environment for informed debate adjacent to the academy and to government.
Alongside them, professional research organisations also prospered in the
1970s and 1980s; by 1981 there were 80,000 private research association
staff in Washington.
'Anyone who can raise enough money and hire the right sort of experts,' says
Ricci, 'can establish a think tank and start churning out books,
newsletters, briefing, conferences, and the like. The really acute questions
are who will pay attention to these sorts of things, if at all, and why.'
But the book fails to answer those acute questions. He interviews few people
in power, and decides not to chart specific legislative measures which flow
like pulses of energy through the Washington medium.
Ricci focuses too narrowly on Washington. After all, Messrs Bradley,
Woodward and Bernstein were to be found in the Hamptons in the 1980s, mixing
with New York media people on Long Island. He also mentions but ignores the
impact of that American institution, the Op-Ed page, a much more catholic
gathering of voices than its counterpart in the UK.
The book periodically returns to the question of 'how things get done on the
Potomac', as if Wall Street finance houses or Mid-Town public relations
agencies (the new Madison Avenue after advertising's decline in the late
1980s) have no purchase on power. Already in the mid-1980s public relations
firms in New York were retained by foreign governments to manipulate
information outside Washington - a form of privatised diplomacy.
It may be that the National Journal (January 1986) correctly identified the
150 men and women in Washington 'who made a difference', but the technique
of identifying and contacting opinion formers by direct means was part of
John Scanlon's brilliant campaign for CBS in the Westmorland Trial during
1985 in New York. In other words, Washington has no monopoly on either
influence or sophisticated information management.
This is not Hedrick Smith's gossipy, informed Washington case study, The
Power Game, because Ricci determines to deliver history rather than
information. The essence of Washington flavours books like Zbigniew
Brzezinski's 1983 Power and Principle, Stephen Hess's The Ultimate Insiders
(published by The Brookings Institute, 1986) or even Garry Wills's Reagan's
America: Innocents At Home (1987). Read these, alongside Walter Isaacson's
superb recent biography of Kissinger, for full Washington exposure.
The strengths of Ricci's book lie in his history and his allusiveness. He
holds Francis Bacon responsible, in The New Atlantis (1624) for creating the
idea of a clearing house for the wise, an apolitical symposium of ideas
called Salomon's House. The early Constitutional notion of an equilibrium of
opinions found expression in the 1960s and 1970s when the expertise, the
marketing and the need for multiplied opinions led to the formation and
growth of the Think Tank.
Ricci writes excellently on the growth and scientification of American
higher education since 1865, on the arrival of what he calls Big Government
after the New Deal, on the decline of WASP ideals and the rise of a cultural
and political pluralism, and on the increasing privatisation of government
such that Jimmy Carter said in 1978: 'Government cannot solve our problems .
. . eliminate poverty, or provide a bountiful economy, or reduce inflation,
or save our cities.'
Alongside Ricci's detailed polemic, Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the
Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics by Jane Jacobs is a difficult,
coded dinner-table symposium rather like Castiglione's Book of the Courtier
or one of Thomas Love Peacock's novels. Jacobs maintains that human systems
devolve into Commercial or Guardian syndromes, the former relying on
contractual and collaborative patterns of behaviour, the latter on hierarchy
and individuality. Fundamental questions emerge, but the format drains them
of seriousness: the diners interrupt each other with 'This is a mite
far-fetched' or 'Stop right there. I've heard about leveraged buyouts - who
hasn't - but I don't understand them.'
Legal and social theorists such as Judith Schklar or Robert Nozick or Martha
Nussbaum patrol the same beat, but have the advantage of citing the sources.
Jacobs's notes should be more integrated into the text, not excised from it.
The range of reference is both wide and enthusiastic: from Stephen Jay
Gould's 'co-opted epiphenomena' back to Machiavelli the political theorist.

TIME AND MONEY: THE MAKING OF CONSUMER CULTURE by Gary Cross Routledge
Pounds 13.99, 294 pages
THE RISE AND FALL OF MASS MARKETING edited by Richard S Tedlow and Geoffrey
Jones Routledge Pounds 35, 239 pages
SOMEWHERE in the recent past humanity decided it would forgo the pleasures
of the sloth in order to enjoy those of the international computer salesman,
a decision not entirely to the liking of all those not party to its making.
Time and Money is about that decision, how in the last two centuries we have
reached the point where increased consumption, rather than increased
leisure, has become the central goal of economic activity. Cross has written
a worthy if somewhat academically dry text which details the pros and cons
of the debate.
There are some grimly entertaining moments, not the least being those where
it is evident that some of the earliest feminists unwittingly colluded in a
version of reinforced self-enslavement. Their arguments that they should be
granted as much right to a full working week in abysmal factories as men now
seem a trifle absurd, rather like pleading to endure more discomfort to
prove equality. But perhaps that itself was progress?
In the end though the book ducks the real issue - how, in a complex and
increasingly global economy, can the temptations of Mammon be balanced
against the seductions of Bacchus, without being excessively tied to either?
If Time and Money is slightly disappointing, then The Rise and Fall of Mass
Marketing is a suitable candidate for investigation by the Advertising
Standards Authority; the title promises much but the cupboard sometimes
seems a little bare.
The 11 essays - on topics as varied as the marketing of motor cars in the UK
before 1950 and wheat marketing since 1945 - are essentially retrospectives,
attempts to grapple with the history of certain aspects of marketing rather
than bring light to bear on contemporary marketing problems by using past
experience.
One of the central problems for marketing is its lack of a stable,
universally agreed definition. 'Is one discussing advertising, brand
building, warehousing, transportation, pricing, consumer research, or a
combination of the above?' ask the editors in their introduction.
They have opted for most of the contributors to concentrate on issues of
distribution, and some of the pieces - such as Geoffrey Tweedale's essay on
the development of mass marketing of computers - are unexpectedly absorbing.
But the overall use of the volume is very classroom bound, though as an
attempt to create an academic credibility for marketing - certainly one of
the more surprising growth areas in the UK's new polyversities - the book as
a whole makes advances.

FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): The very nuts and
bolts of change - Management / Christopher Lorenz on the management world's
most fashionable fad, process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have just parachuted from Mars, or flown in from a six-month sojourn
in the Seychelles, the term 'process re-engineering' may conjure up nothing
more than the pipework of a chemical plant, or something equally obscure.
If, on the other hand, you have skimmed the occasional business newspaper or
magazine, you will know that 're-engineering' promises some sort of
revolution, and has burst with a vengeance on to the management scene since
Christmas. It has hit America especially hard, becoming the most instant
fashion since 'excellence' a decade ago.
If you have been reading more carefully, you will know that the reason for
the craze is that re-engineering promises productivity miracles in virtually
every industry through the complete redesign of white-collar 'business
processes.'
The last fad to grip the executive world, total quality management, took as
many years to gather momentum as it does, through 'continuous improvement,'
to accumulate dramatic pay-offs in cost, quality, and productivity. In
contrast, re-engineering promises in just a year or two to squeeze at least
ten-fold the time taken to complete many processes. This is achieved by
replacing their traditionally fragmented, poorly connected processes, which
operate within narrow, separate and steeply hierarchical 'functional'
departments.
In their place, a growing canon of US and European companies has installed
single processes which span their organisations from side to side. A typical
one will embrace sales, ordering, installation, billing and cash collection
in one single stream of activity undertaken by multi-disciplinary teams.
Another will link the design, development, engineering and production of new
products and services.
Beneath the detail, the most revolutionary aspect of re-engineering is that
it challenges a prime principle on which 20th century organisations have
been based: the maxims of 'Taylorism' (after Frederick Taylor) and 'Fordism'
(after Henry Ford), that work should be broken into narrow, specialised
activities and departments so that it can be supervised and controlled.
It is the impact of re-engineering on the social and authority structures of
organisations which makes it so difficult to achieve. It requires not only
the redesign of the 'hard' elements of an enterprise - the processes
themselves, and the systems which 'enable' them - but also considerable
change in the organisation's 'soft' aspects: its people, their skills,
behaviour, values and culture.
With so much at stake - plus hefty publishing royalties and consulting fees
 -it is not surprising that the past six months have seen a flood of books
on the subject.
The most hyped by far is Re-engineering the Corporation, by Michael Hammer
and James Champy (Nicholas Brealey Pounds 16.99, 223 pages). These two
consultants have done more to define the 'hard' side of re-engineering than
anyone else; Hammer runs his own firm, while Champy heads CSC Index.
The virtue of their book is its brevity, readibility and - for the most part
 -clarity. It certainly explains the nuts and bolts of re-engineering and
illustrates them well with packaged case studies. But it suffers from
several drawbacks. Most important are its lack of detail on several key
issues and its inconsistent approach to the cultural changes which are
needed if re-engineering is not to run into a brick wall, or be undermined.
Having declared in a surprising slip on page three that 'business
re-engineering doesn't try to change the behaviour of American workers and
managers,' by chapter four Hammer and Champy are exemplifying the very
opposite: the vast changes in attitudes, values and behaviour that must be
associated with re-engineering.
They are also inconsistent about whether they think behavioural and cultural
change - 'empowerment,' teamwork and so on - are an automatic result of the
re-engineering of business processes, or whether such 'soft' change needs to
be launched in parallel or even beforehand. Controversially, much of the
book suggests that soft follows hard automatically, yet at Bell Atlantic,
one of their prime case study companies, a culture change programme was
launched two years ahead of re-engineering. This is not explained in the
book.
Surprisingly in view of its subtitle, which focuses on information
technology, Thomas Davenport's Process Innovation (HBS Press/McGraw Hill
Pounds 26.95, 337 pages) does a better but less readable job of relating all
the hard and soft elements of re-engineering to each other. This is partly
because Davenport made his book 50 per cent longer, but also because he sees
re-engineering as only part of his universe, rather than its core.
Davenport, a partner at Ernst and Young, underlines that re-engineering is
only part of what has to be done when processes are changed radically.
Refreshingly, he uses the term to refer purely to the actual design of the
new processes. Far tougher and more 'wrenching,' he rightly says, are the
human and organisational dimensions of change. He is also clear that
behaviour and culture changes are necessary bedfellows of re-engineering,
rather than its automatic progeny. For companies setting out on the
re-engineering trail, this is a critical distinction.
In a different and equally useful sense, Business Process Re-engineering
(John Wiley Pounds 24.95, 241 pages) by Henry J Johansson and three other
consultants from Coopers and Lybrand, also takes a refreshingly broad
approach. For one thing, it is not entirely American. For another, its USP
is to make re-engineering less inward-looking by setting it in the context
of marketing and business strategy.
Like others, Johansson and Co distinguish between two types of
re-engineering: first, that which creates dramatic cost, time and
productivity improvements in rather narrow business processes, such as Dun
and Bradstreet's establishment of credit-rating contracts; second, that
which helps a company achieve parity, or 'best in class,' in an entire
'core' process, such as the design-to-delivery cycle within AT&amp;T.
But the Coopers team also adds a third type: the occasional process
revolution which enables a company to leapfrog way ahead of its rivals by
changing the rules of an entire market or industry. Wal-Mart re-engineered
its 'supply chain' by replacing its own warehouses and distribution centres
with point of sale systems linked instantly through to key suppliers. As a
result it could offer its retail customers constantly refilled shelves of
branded products at considerably cut prices. Its competitors reeled.
Gluttons for jargon like all consultants, the Coopers team calls this the
achievement of a strategic 'BreakPoint.' This is defined as when market
share 'moves disproportionately upward' as a result of customers perceiving
a dramatic improvement in cost, quality, service or lead time, or in all
four.
Compared with the first three books, Re-engineering Your Business (McGraw
Hill Pounds 21.95, 247 pages) by Daniel Morris and Joel Brandon, will be
more of a minority taste. It is far drier and much more of a hands-on guide
to particular methods of re-engineering. But it also gives some useful
general reminders: for instance, that processes should not be re-engineered
in an internal vacuum, but only after the competitive advantage to be
achieved in each situation has been analysed.
Not really a book, but more of a study - and much more expensive - is one of
the first publications to appear last winter on the subject, Business
Re-engineering, by Peter Bartram (Business Intelligence, tel: 081-544-1830.
Pounds 395, 296 pages). Though some of its contents have been outdated, it
still provides a very welcome, plain person's guide to the field. It is
unusually rich in case studies, especially of companies in Britain. It also
contains a useful list of consultants in the field.

MINTON: THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF DESIGN &amp; PRODUCTION By Joan Jones
Swan Hill Press Pounds 70 391 pages
ON APRIL 30 1851 Queen Victoria enjoyed a preview of the Great Exhibition in
London's Hyde Park. She noted in her diary: 'We walked the whole round of
the galleries. We saw beautiful china from Minton's factory and beautiful
designs.' The Queen also maintained her well-established patronage of her
favoured Staffordshire pottery by purchasing an extravagant Minton dessert
service.
In many ways the Great Exhibition represented the coming of age of Herbert
Minton's company. His spectacular display was widely acclaimed for the
quality and diversity of his products and the new ranges, parian porcelain
figures and colourful majolica glazed earthenwares for example, provoked
excited comment.
International fame, business success and a clutch of medals were the fitting
rewards for a manufacturer who had been deeply involved in the planning of
this great event. Minton's enthusiasm for the venture was underlined by his
sponsoring it to the tune of Pounds 10,000, a risky investment that, in the
event, paid off handsomely.
Herbert Minton, that prime example of the Victorian enlightened
entrepreneur, died in 1858 but the company founded by his father Thomas in
1793 lived on, and is now celebrating its bicentenary. The event has been
marked by the publication of Joan Jones' history of this remarkable company,
a book that makes it seem extraordinary that this great pottery should be,
in relative terms, so little known.
Minton has been poorly served by history. This is only the third major book
written about the factory while Wedgwood has inspired over 50. Yet, in its
day, Minton was by far the better company whose products, more exciting and
more diverse, were respected worldwide.
This book is a rich survey of what Mrs Jones, curator of the Minton Museum,
optimistically calls Minton's 'first two hundred years' but the emphasis is
clearly on the Victorian period and this fills the bulk of the book.
The early Thomas Minton years of fine tableware production, in spite of
their obvious appeal to collectors, merely set the scene for the dramatic
expansion that followed, first with Herbert Minton and then in the hands of
his nephew, Colin Minton Campbell. These two showed how inspired leadership,
the pursuit of individuality and the willingness to take risks, backed by
adventurous design, were the perfect way to guide a business and keep its
products at the forefront of the international marketplace for over 60
years.
Even after they had gone, the impetus they had built up kept Minton at the
top of the pile for some time before the inevitable decline set in, a slow
downward spiral that led to Minton becoming a part of the Royal Doulton
Group in 1968. It has to be said that, from the evidence of this book,
Minton's second century, to 1993, does not look nearly as good as its first,
and it takes up only a fraction of the pages. Whether anyone will find
anything interesting to say in 2093 remains to be seen, but the signs are
not all that promising
What makes this book unique is the quality, and quantity of its colour
plates, and these are a constant seduction away from Mrs Jones' excellent
text. However, the point made again and again by both text and plates is the
power of design as a marketing tool.
Minton's strength in the past, and its commercial success, was due to a
series of remarkable marriages between art and industry. Some brides were
well known, the sculptors John Bell and Baron Marochetti for example, or key
figures such as AWN Pugin and Dr Christopher Dresser, along with Minton's
French imports, notably Leon Arnoux, their part director throughout their
most dynamic period. Others are little known today, unjustly buried in the
backyards of ceramic history.
The prime example is John Wadsworth, an inspired designer whose distinctive
style spans the Art Nouveau, Art Deco and post-war periods, a man whose
rightful place is with the great names of 20th century design.
Wadsworth also seems to have been the last outpouring from that
extraordinary well of creativity that made Minton what it was in the
Victorian period. What remains is, sadly, a glorious past of originality and
dynamic leadership submerged in modern concepts of brand name management.

GAME OVER: HOW NINTENDO ZAPPED AN AMERICAN INDUSTRY, CAPTURED YOUR DOLLARS,
AND ENSLAVED YOUR CHILDREN by David Sheff Random House, Dollars 25 480 pages
DURING 1990 the unthinkable happened. For the first time 'Q' ratings in the
US, derived from surveys to indicate the popularity of politicians, film
stars and other public figures, showed that Super Mario, Nintendo's
electronic game mascot, was more recognised by American children than Mickey
Mouse.
'The idea that Mario had become more popular than Mickey was to some a
travesty that signaled the next phase of the Japanese invasion,' writes
California-based author David Sheff.
Sheff's book, researched over two years on the basis of interviews with
Nintendo executives and its rivals, charts the rise and rise of the Japanese
electronic games company through the late 1980s. In the process it provides
a vivid but critical insight into the Kyoto-based company and its autocratic
founder, Hiroshi Yamauchi.
This is not a video games technical manual but an eminently readable
business book which explains how, after a rocky start, Nintendo came to
dominate a multi-billion-dollar industry in less than a decade. As many
parents know, Nintendo is a force to be reckoned with. But anyone who has
trouble taking seriously a company which built its success around an
electronic cartoon character - a Brooklyn plumber supercharged with
mushrooms who battles bomb-hurling mice, waltzing cacti and turtles - need
only read some of the statistics in the first chapter.
Nintendo is an astonishing success. By the end of the 1980s, just five years
after the launch of the first Super Mario game, profits earned from its
video games and the Nintendo Entertainment System hardware had transformed
it into one of the world's most profitable companies. By 1991 it had
replaced Toyota as Japan's most successful company.
In 1991 the company earned about Dollars 1.5m for each of its 4,000
worldwide employees. Sony, with 10 times as many employees, earned Dollars
400m less. Last year Nintendo's pre-tax profits topped Dollars 1bn on sales
of Dollars 5.75bn. There are as many Nintendo machines in the world - 50m to
60m - as personal computers. About a third of all US and Japanese homes now
have a Nintendo-games playing machine. How has this been achieved?
The key, argues Sheff, is that 'Nintendo had predicated its entire strategy
on the control of both hardware and software.' Nintendo has kept tight
control over the games cartridges, and extracting royalties for each of the
170m cartridges sold last year. In addition, Nintendo has pursued its
strategy with single-minded determination, taking whatever action necessary
to secure and maintain its dominant market position. As Sheff points out
this has included a 'scorched earth' policy towards competitors, exclusive
pacts with game developers and chip manufacturers, and a readiness to do
battle with governments on three continents.
Nevertheless, Sheff argues that Nintendo made a serious mistake when it
delayed releasing a more advanced 16-bit machine - a lapse which allowed
Sega, its arch rival, to secure a foothold in the market.
Sheff, like his Nintendo-addicted son, is a video games fan, but his study
is far from uncritical. If the book has a weakness it is when it looks to
the future. Otherwise this book explains why Nintendo and video games are
more than just kids' stuff.
