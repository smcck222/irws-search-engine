FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (5): Industry boosts
its image - Seven years of Responsible Care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the mid-1980s, when the US was governed by a president who believed trees
were a source of pollution, north America's chemical industry realised
stricter environmental regulations were looming and started to modify its
behaviour.
The result was the Responsible Care programme, launched by the Chemical
Manufacturers Association in 1988 to improve the industry's image, reduce
its impact on the environment and circumvent the threat of harsher
regulations. Now that Mr Al Gore, an outspoken environmentalist, is
vice-president of the US, the industry's decision to implement environmental
guidelines may prove fortunate.
'Bhopal was the wake-up call,' says Mr Dave Buzzelli, Dow Chemical's vice
president for environment, health and safety. 'It brought home to everybody
that we could have the best performance in the world but if another company
had an accident, all of us would be hurt, so we started to work together.'
The initiative which led to Responsible Care in the US started in Canada in
1986, after a survey of public opinion found that the chemical industry was
widely distrusted. 'The industry is smaller in Canada, and there are fewer
large companies,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'It's easier to get things started with
a smaller group.'
The concepts were then brought south of the border by companies with
Canadian operations, and the CMA, which represents about 90 per cent of
basic industrial production capacity in the US, adopted its own principles
and codes of management in 1988. This was followed by the launch of a public
outreach campaign in 1991, which included an impressive advertising effort.
The industry has made significant strides since the programme was launched,
but Responsible Care is still in its infancy. According to the CMA, only
about 60 per cent of industry workers are 'somewhat aware' of Responsible
Care, and under 40 per cent are fully aware of the scheme.
Responsible Care is based on the premise that the industry can steadily
improve its performance in health, safety and the environment and that it
can regain public trust by improving its response to public concerns about
products and operations. The aim is continuous improvement: there is no
target end date.
Mr Buzzelli explains: 'Responsible Care isn't designed for the industry to
duck regulations. If it results in people feeling there is less of a need to
regulate, then it's a double win.'
Companies are not legally bound to comply with the tenets of Responsible
Care, but membership of the CMA is conditional on participating in the
programme.
While it was quickly accepted by the bigger chemical producers, many smaller
companies initially resisted the scheme because they feared they lacked the
resources to make the changes necessary to comply with the codes.
The most radical aspect of Responsible Care was the decision to open the
doors of an industry that has a long tradition of being secretive and wary
of public scrutiny. 'The biggest shift here is the willingness to share our
historic secrets,' says Mr Gerry Faigle, Dupont's corporate responsible care
co-ordinator. 'The communities want to know how our activities affect the
environment, and we're telling them that we release this much of that
material into the air, and inject this much of that material into the
ground. Without this dialogue we are going to get regulated out of
existence.'
Mr Faigle's views are shared by other industry leaders. 'The public
component of any job in the chemical industry is higher than it ever has
been. The need to listen is critical today,' says Mr Buzzelli.
Community advisory panels provide the main forum for dialogue between
companies and the public. There are now about 200 of these panels in the US
and more will be formed this year. Their advocates say they help companies
learn about local concerns which they can address by making changes or
providing enough information about operations to quell local fears.
While environmental groups applaud the industry's efforts to be more open
and communicative, the panels have not met with absolute approval. Critics
say the panels lack access to sufficient information and independent
experts. There are also concerns that local communities are economically
dependent on chemical companies and are thus less likely to be critical of
the industry.
'There is some concern that the advisory groups are really attempts to get
local citizens to serve as mouthpieces for the company rather than
consulting well-informed groups with some expertise to assess what companies
are doing,' says Mr Hillel Gray, toxics policy director at the National
Environmental Law Center.
Another area of concern is the lack of outside verification for the
environmental achievements that companies claim to have made under
Responsible Care. There is also no consistency in reporting formats, data
bases or even definitions, making it difficult accurately to measure or
compare results.
There is a consistency issue,' says Mr Ron Pingel, Dow's director of
environmental affairs and responsible care. 'How do we know that everybody
is evaluating in the same way? Ultimately, there will probably be a
component of third party involvement in terms of evaluation,' he adds.
'Responsible Care is the velvet glove around the iron fist of the chemical
industry,' says Mr Fred Millar, director of the toxics project at Friends of
the Earth. Mr Millar bases his charge on a CMA effort to defeat a 'Right to
Know More' bill which would have added chemicals and sectors to the
government's toxics inventory list. 'The CMA rounded up about 50 trade
associations and sent a letter to every member of congress saying the
proposal was 'radical' and would harm the economy.'
Most Americans seem to think that the chemical industry is neither
responsible nor caring. A CMA survey in 1992 found fewer than 30 per cent of
the public look favourably on the sector. Only the tobacco industry was less
popular; even nuclear power was more favourably viewed.
The CMA hopes to placate some of its critics by acting on the
recommendations of its responsible care committee.
One of the recommendations looks at verification of the processes that
companies are using for responsible care. 'This would involve some form of
third party or public involvement,' says Mr Richard Doyle, CMA's director of
Responsible Care. 'It is important to note that we're not at this juncture
ready to recommend any one type of verification process.'
Mr Gray of the National Environmental Law Center has not been won over.
'There's a lot more that all the chemical companies could be doing,' he
says. 'If they spent less time fighting Right to Know and issuing public
pronouncements and more time trying to provide meaningful information, it
would turn round public opinion which is very low in spite of what has been
put into Responsible Care advertising.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (4): Airlines'
problems fail to deter newcomers - Transport, Karen Zagor explains rail's
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We travel by plane, oftener than not, and yet the spirit of our country
seems to have remained a country of railroads' - John Cheever.
IF THE quintessential American Wasp author of Bullet Park were alive today,
he might be gratified to see how literally the spirit of the railroads has
been resuscitated in the US, after nearly being smothered by the
predominance of airplanes.
Thanks to the vast distances between cities in North America, air travel
began to take over from railroads as the main means of transport during the
1960s.
In recent years, a business traveller would be almost as likely to ride a
camel to a meeting as travel by train in most parts of the US, Canada and
Mexico. But with the advent of high-speed trains, there are signs of a rail
revival, at least in the US.
On the popular New York City to Washington DC route, a high-speed Metroliner
train has competed successfully with the airlines for many years. Although
the journey by Metroliner takes just under three hours and is considerably
slower than the half-hour flight, it is popular with business travellers who
enjoy circumventing airport traffic.
In addition, trains are rarely delayed by bad weather. According to Amtrak,
which runs the passenger rail service, the company accounts for 45 per cent
of all rail and air passengers travelling from New York to Washington.
Amtrak is now testing trains for a high-speed service from Boston to New
York. By 1997, it hopes to have trains operating at 150mph along the Boston
to Washington corridor. These would cut nearly two hours from the standard
Boston to New York service, and shave about 40 minutes from the regular
Metroliner time.
Extensive rail projects have sprung up in many metropolitan areas, including
Los Angeles. In Texas, plans for a high-speed rail service are on the
drawing boards, but opposition from local airlines, fearful that they will
lose too many customers to the trains, may ultimately kill the project.
For the moment, competition from the railroads is the least of the airline
industry's worries. The combined forces of high fuel costs, fewer travellers
and the recent series of crippling fare wars have left the industry badly
bruised and deeply in the red. In the past three years, the biggest US
airlines lost more than Dollars 10bn.
Some of the biggest US carriers, including Pan Am, Eastern, Midway and
Braniff, have not survived. TWA is a shadow of its former self, and
Continental has only recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Instead of the Pan Am and Eastern shuttle from New York's La Guardia to
Washington's National airport, passengers must now look to USAir and Delta,
although planes still depart every half-hour with every passenger guaranteed
a seat.
Yet tough times have not discouraged newcomers from entering the fray. They
include: Kiwi, which recently started flying from New York's Newark airport;
Reno Air (which operates out of Reno, Nevada); Morris Air, which flies from
Salt Lake City; Private Jet, which is based in Atlanta; and Ultrair, a
Houston-based carrier which offers up-scale services at full-fare economy
prices.
Although the airlines have suffered tremendously from their own fare wars,
there are no signs that the days of the cut-price ticket have ended. Indeed,
before the official start of summer this year, Northwest Airlines launched a
bout of price-slashing by offering discounts of up to 33 per cent on
domestic flights.
The terms and conditions of these deeply-discounted fares can make it
difficult for a business traveller to take advantage of them, especially
since most discounts require advance purchase and a Saturday night stay.
Some carriers offer corporate discounts to big companies. Others, such as
Air Canada, offer special discounts for business meetings and conventions on
full-fare economy and business class fares when companies make bookings for
at least 10 people travelling to the same destination.
If working to a tight schedule, it is worth checking with the Department of
Transportation, which publishes detailed information of on-time performances
for regularly scheduled flights. For example, Delta's flight from Miami to
Atlanta at 2:15pm arrived 27 minutes late more than 80 per cent of the time
in April. Travel agents and airline ticketing offices also have access to
on-time performance for specific flights, thanks to the advent of
computerised reservation systems.
A travel agent should also provide information on the type of aircraft being
flown. This is essential for those who would rather walk barefoot across the
country than get on a turbo prop plane. Many of the smaller cities and towns
in the US and Canada are connected to larger cities by regional airlines.
The planes used by these smaller carriers are most accurately described by
their former name - 'scheduled air taxis'. Since most regional airlines now
share computer codes with the major airlines, a computer might not recognise
the difference between American Airlines, which has a fleet of jets, and
American Eagle, which uses turbo props.
Travellers who plan to work on portable computers during a flight should
note that many airlines now ban laptops, as well as compact-disc players and
cellular telephones during take-off and landing. Some, responding to
concerns about possible interference with navigation equipment, have banned
the use of electronic devices altogether on flights.
There are no such restrictions on trains. Yet, regardless of the 'spirit of
the country' and the revival of train service in the US, until a train is
invented that can cover about 3,000 miles in under six hours, most business
people will continue to do most of their travelling in North America on a
plane.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (2): Cost-cutting
by stealth - Hotels, the choice is widening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS returning to the US after several years' absence are unlikely to
notice that some 70 per cent of hotels could now be considered financially
distressed.
Nor are they likely to observe that financial institutions have become
America's biggest hotel owners.
What they are likely to notice is the wider choice of accommodation, the
bargains and the eagerness of hoteliers to please patrons.
There is enough choice to satisfy every taste and budget, thanks largely to
a glut of hotel rooms - the legacy of the booming 1980s when the industry
expanded into the arms of a recession. In Chicago alone, 5,000 of the city's
23,000 downtown rooms were added after 1987. As a result of this untimely
expansion, room-rate increases have lagged inflation since 1987.
In their efforts to survive this painful period, hotel chains have tried to
make their cost-cutting measures invisible to their customers. Hyatt, for
example, trimmed 10 per cent from its annual bed-linen bills by switching to
white sheets from beige. Other cost-saving measures include offering
optional bed turn-down service and reducing the number of hand towels.
Other moves have been more visible. In recent years, chains have introduced
frequent-stay programmes to cultivate customer loyalty. Many groups also
offer weekend packages and off-peak promotions to boost depressed occupancy
rates.
For example, the Inter-Continental group is wooing customers with a summer
'options' programme. This includes offering a choice of room upgrade to a
suite, free overnight parking, a daily credit of Dollars 25 towards food and
drink, an adjoining room for half the summer rate or 1,000 bonus
frequent-flier miles towards American or United Airlines frequent-flier
plans.
At the chain's Manhattan hotel, guests will automatically get the bonus
airline miles and a Dollars 20 discount on Friday and Saturday nights, in
addition to a choice of other 'options'.
Other hotel chains are offering similar lures to attract customers in a
competitive environment. Although Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
has found that more than half the hotels in the US were profitable in 1992,
for the firs time since 1989, last year's occupancy rate of about 62 per
cent is still significantly below the 68 per cent considered necessary for
sustained profitability. Things are even worse in Canada, where last year's
average room occupancy was 57 per cent compared with 69 per cent in 1988.
As a result, the type of haggling usually associated with an Arab souk is
not unusual at a hotel front desk in North America. Any big company which
discovers that it is regularly paying the published 'rack' rate for rooms
should get a new travel agent. A good travel agent should be able to
negotiate a discounted corporate rate ahead of arrival. Even individual
travellers without the clout of a big company can often get reduced rates in
slower markets just by asking.
The extended-stay segment, catering for travellers who stay five or more
days, is one of the few growth areas in the North American hotel market. In
the US, the sector had an average occupancy rate of 80 per cent last year.
Some chains, such as Marriott's Residence Inns, cater almost exclusively to
extended-stay travellers (and families) with rooms that include separate
kitchens, bedrooms and living areas. Prices average Dollars 75 a night,
about Dollars 15 higher than the average hotel room.
Consumer Reports gave Residence Inns a top rating in its last hotel survey
in 1990, and this year's Zagat survey of US Hotels, Resorts and Spas
confirms the endorsement with a room rating for the chain on a par with more
expensive hotels. Zagat, which is known for the pithy comments which
accompany its ratings on US restaurants and hotels, also recommended
Radisson, Guest Quarters, Embassy Suites and Doubletree among the
moderately-priced chains.
Among the least expensive chains, Zagat gave higher room ratings to
Fairfield Inns, Hampton Inn and La Quinta.
At the top end, the Four Seasons hotel chain has maintained its leading
position since the 1990 Consumer Reports survey, with top ratings from Zagat
across the board - for rooms, service, dining and public facilities.
Ritz-Carlton had similarly high marks, while Loews, Inter-Continental,
Westin and Hyatt were all recommended.
Unfortunately, in spite of increasing efforts to please patrons, there are
no guarantees of a perfect stay. At some of the more impecunious chains,
carpets and furnishing is often threadbare. And a common complaint across
the board centres on advance reservations. It is still not unusual to
discover at check-in that all traces of a reservation have disappeared from
the computer system. In addition, there are often discrepancies between
rates quoted by a chain's central reservation system and those offered at
the front desk.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (3): Special
services matter now - New patterns in car rentals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE war among US rental car companies is over, at least for now.
During the past year rates have been rising, and rental companies are now
relying more on providing drivers with special services and unusual extras,
rather than on competitive pricing, to attract customers.
The main reason for the increase in rental rates is that the big three US
auto manufacturers have cut back on the discounts they offer rental
companies. This means they now have to pay as much as 25 per cent to 35 per
cent more for their new cars.
Although not all of the extra cost has been immediately passed on to the
renter, it eventually will. Already, rates have been going up by significant
amounts. Hertz has said that its nationwide rates this year are up about 14
per cent on a year ago, while Avis estimates its rates are between 13 per
cent and 16 per cent higher than in 1992.
There is some evidence, however, that rates are actually rising faster than
that. In Boston, for example, the average of the daily rates for renting
midsize cars charged by the big four rental companies (Avis, Alamo, Budget
and Hertz) last June was Dollars 32.49. This June, the average charge has
gone up to Dollars 39.98, a 23 per cent hike.
To make matters worse, auto manufacturers have been reducing the number of
cars they sell to rental companies, preferring instead to focus on selling
to the retail market. Consequently, rental fleets are shrinking, which could
leave business and other travellers facing shortages at peak times,
especially at busy metropolitan airports.
Additionally, the car manufacturers have changed their policy on buying back
cars from rental companies. Seeking to avoid undermining their sales of new
cars by flooding the retail market with almost-new ex-rental cars, the
manufacturers are now agreeing to buy cars back from the rental companies
after six or nine months, instead of as little as four months a year ago.
This change, combined with the fact that rental companies are keeping their
cars on the road longer, to offset their higher-purchase costs, means
renters are not only paying more for cars now, they are also driving around
older models with higher mileage and a greater risk of breakdown.
Despite the higher rates and older models, renting a car in the US is still
inexpensive compared with other countries, thanks to the relatively low
purchase cost of cars, lower maintenance costs, cheaper petrol and, above
all, intense competition between the main rental companies.
While rates may be going up, competition remains strong in areas other than
price - no more so than when it comes to the quality and speed of service to
renters, especially business travellers. Rental companies are focusing their
efforts on reducing the time it takes to provide a car to a customer who has
just disembarked from a plane.
Most now have efficient airport service counters, where cars can be picked
up relatively quickly; but the best solution for the business traveller in a
hurry is to sign up for one of the companies' special membership cards or
clubs. These allow members to walk straight from the airport to their
vehicle without having to queue up at a busy counter.
These special memberships are less of a bonus when it comes to dropping-off
rental cars at the airport, because at most big airports companies have
systems that allow the renter to leave the car, pay for it, and head for the
terminal, all in a few minutes.
At the high end of the market, rental companies are also competing to offer
business travellers special extras, such as car phones or mobile cellular
phones. There has even been talk of providing renters with computerised maps
to help them find their way around unfamiliar cities.
The issue of providing renters with reliable directions and maps of the
local area is an important one, in the wake of recent highly-publicised
incidents. The Miami area, for example, has been the scene of a number of
attacks on people, especially foreigners, who had rented their cars at
airports but had subsequently lost their way in high-crime neighbourhoods.
There is a real concern now that criminals are preying specifically on
people in rental cars.
To counter this threat, most US rental companies are beginning to strip
their cars of number plates and other signs that identify the car as a
rented vehicle. Last month, Hertz said it had embarked on a programme aimed
at 'turning the rental car from one that's identifiable into one that's
virtually unidentifiable'.
Also, companies have stepped up warnings to customers about where they
should, and should not, drive when they leave the airport; and have
introduced clearer road directions for renters. Much of this advice is now
available in safety brochures provided by rental companies at big city
locations.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (7): Almost like
taking the office with you - Business services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNOVATIONS in cellular communications, microcomputers, and even the old
stand-by, the telephone credit card, have made the business traveller's
chore of keeping in touch with the office a relatively painless one.
However, despite the invention and mass-marketing of briefcase-sized
portable printers and facsimile machines, and the advent of electronic
'personal assistants,' trying to duplicate the office while on the road can
be a headache.
International travellers find that reliable and compatible power sources and
data ports for all the electronic gadgetry are not always available.
Computer checks, even within North America, slow travellers down at airport
security stations. And, the truth be told, the gear is awkward to carry and
often lacks the one feature you need in a pinch.
It is often more efficient to hire office services once you've arrived at
your destination, provided you have a clear view of what's available ahead
of time. In North America, overbuilding has put most business-class hotels
in sharp competition for customers, and led them all to provide basics like
copy and fax machines in-house.
More elaborate services like typing and meeting planning are also available,
for a price, at most full-service hotels. Inquire when arranging
accommodation, and be sure to determine what hours the services are
available. While convenient, hotel services can be expensive. Simply making
a local telephone call from an in-room phone, for example, can add charges
of 25 cents to as much as a dollar per call to your bill.
If you are pinching your business budget, try looking beyond the hotel.
While there are few nationwide chains, a host of small businesses thrive in
every city by providing competitively-priced fax, duplicating, instant
printing, typing services and other stand-bys. Look for them in the
telephone book Yellow Pages under 'office services' or 'copying.' Many of
them will pick-up and deliver to the hotel.
Kinko's Copy Centers has carved out a niche as a nationwide chain that has
24-hour service at most stores - a boon for time-pressed business
travellers. It has 650 stores with locations in all 50 states, as well as
Toronto, Vancouver, Waterloo and London, Ontario, in Canada.
In addition to typing, copying, instant printing and faxes, Kinkos offers
colour copying, makes overhead transparencies and other presentation
materials, has self-service and full-service desk-top publishing, and does
packaging and mailing. Many of its stores have rent-by-the hour Apple and
IBM-compatible computers with a choice of software. Their toll-free number,
1-800-743-Copy, will help locate the nearest one.
For frequent travellers who require office or conference space, particularly
those who prefer not to conduct interviews in their hotel room, a workable
choice is to join an airline club. The perks more than compensate for the
cost.
American Airlines' Admirals Club, and United Air's Red Carpet Club, for
example, rent conference rooms for Dollars 25 per hour at all their airport
locations. The clubs also let you make local telephone calls free, offer
free copying, have fax machines, and even check cashing services.
The clubs are designed to provide sanctuary from the airport frenzy, and
most do a good job at this. The Admiral's Club has a Dollars 100 initiation
fee and a Dollars 150 annual membership charge, while the Red Carpet Club is
a few dollars more. Nearly every airline, national or regional, that
operates in the US offers club services. Ask your travel agent for
specifics, including a list of cities where clubs are located.
International travellers may find away-from-office aid is already in their
briefcase. American Express has long been known for providing mail drops in
faraway cities to card holders. It also has a service centre in the US that
can provide telephone help to customers in 60 different languages. For a
fee, American Express can arrange office services, meeting planning, and a
variety of other assistance to executive cardholders in nearly any North
American location.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (6): Americans may
also be provincials - Some tips for a happier and safer visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE COMFORTABLY ensconced at the home office, be it London, Bonn, Tokyo or
Paris, and looking at a map of North America, your business travel can look
easy. Don't be fooled. But here are some tips to bear in mind to make it
less vexing and safer.
First, remember that the distances are always bigger than you think. If you
believe that Minneapolis is just up the road from Chicago, think again. It
is roughly a 1 1/2 -hour flight, and because there is less airline
competition on the route the fare probably costs more than many
transatlantic flights. And while Austin, Texas looks like just a short drive
from Houston, it is 3 1/2 hours of solid freeway.
Be prepared for a language barrier in the United States. Americans tend to
believe that everyone should speak English and, outside major cities,
relatively few speak a foreign language. Moreover, American regional accents
can confound even English speakers.
However, Spanish is widely spoken in the US South-west and Florida; and, of
course, French rules in Quebec. AT&amp;T offers a special language line with a
toll-free '800' number, which can be used for third-party interpreting by
phone or translation of documents.
Don't expect Americans to be cosmopolitan. Although the US is a world power,
Americans can be shockingly provincial. As Joe Brancatelli, the executive
editor of Frequent Flyer magazine, says: 'Good luck finding the World
Service in St Louis.'
Even at major hotels, staff may only vaguely know what the BBC is, and will
not have the foggiest idea about its frequencies. American insularity can
also make a mess of your trip. If in Atlanta, for example, and in need of
sending a fax to Rome, be careful that it doesn't land in the small
north-western Georgia city of the same name.
Regarding travel arrangements, try to plan carefully, and make them in
advance if you don't want to break your company's travel budget. Reasonable
air fares can be had with some advance planning. But if your head office
suddenly wants you to grab the next flight to Vancouver or Miami, they must
be prepared for a huge bill. According to a 1992 survey of Frequent Flyer
readers, most of whom travel for their jobs, some 42 per cent usually used
discounted, advance-purchase coach tickets.
Security is always a concern for travellers, but recently in the US it has
become a serious issue. The most well known problems were in the Miami area,
where several foreign tourists driving rental cars have been killed and
attacked.
If you hire a car, be sure to have clear directions and a map of how to
arrive at your destination or hotel. Lock your car doors while driving, and
do not stop for strangers or cars flashing theirs lights or bumping your
fenders.
If you need to stop for directions or for car trouble, go to a well-lighted
public place, such as a gasoline station or a store. If you must leave
suitcases or briefcases in the car while on the road, place them in the
trunk (boot) and lock it.
Also, do not wear expensive jewellery; do not display large amounts of cash
or your hotel keys; use the main entrance of your hotel; and never open your
room's door to someone unless you have verified with the desk who it is.
Bring some type of health insurance certificate for international use. The
US health care system is notoriously expensive, and even a brief stay in
hospital will mean astronomical bills. A bed at a large hospital costs
roughly Dollars 1,500 per day. If you should decide to take a holiday while
in the US, perhaps extending your business trip, buy a special limited-time
policy for travellers. The rate may seem high, but it is worth it.
Carry a telephone credit card that is valid in North America. Hotels can
tack on a very high surcharge for long-distance calls placed without one.
If your plans require travel between New York and Washington or
Philadelphia, take the train. It is faster, cheaper and more convenient than
flying.
Tipping is customary. Taxi drivers and waiters expect a minimum of 15 per
cent, and 20 per cent or more would signal appreciation for a good job. Some
restaurants include service, however, so be sure to check your bill.
Smoking is prohibited in most US and Canadian public places and office
buildings. If you smoke, it is best to check on where it is allowed. Most
restaurants still have smoking sections, and some hotels divide their rooms
into smoking and non-smoking. Smoking is prohibited on all US domestic
flights.
Try to pack light, and use a carry-on garment bag. If checking luggage, take
a cautionary set of underwear, medications if you take them, a toothbrush,
personal hygiene items and clean shirt or blouse in your hand luggage.
Suitcases are too often lost or delayed.
In late autumn, winter and early spring, going north to south in North
America can unfortunately require two sets of clothes, for hot and cold
climates.
For business services, such as secretarial help, your hotel should be able
to assist you with referrals. But for these practical business chores, as
well as recommendations for restaurants and hotels, a travel guide-book such
as Birnbaum's United States 1993 for Business Travellers is useful.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (5): The industry
takes notice - Women travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS INCREASING numbers of women occupy executive suites in companies around
the world, more are travelling for the job. But until recently, their
special needs and preferences had largely been ignored by the travel
industry.
Once upon a time in hotels, it was hard to find a skirt-hanger. After-shave
was more likely to be provided than body moisturiser. And dining alone meant
being shunted to a table no one else would take. That has begun to change.
Sheer numbers have obliged the travel industry to take notice of women. Over
the last two decades, women have become the fastest growing segment of the
travelling public.
In 1970, they accounted for just 1 per cent of domestic US business travel.
Since then the figure has shot up to 39 per cent. By the end of the 1990s,
the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association (AHMA) expects women to account for
half of all US business travel.
Although surveys show that women pay attention to such amenities in hotels
as the quality of toiletry products, soaps, shampoos, their principal
concern is safety.
The National Organisation for Women warns that a rape is reported every
three minutes in the US and that, while they should not feel inhibited about
travel to America, foreign women need to be aware of such violence.
Security comes in many forms. Foremost is feeling safe in the hotel itself.
Many high-quality establishments, such as the Ritz-Carlton, have private
floors, which are accessible only with a pass-key.
Barring that option, many women prefer to be in rooms on upper floors, to
minimise unwanted encounters with passers-by, which are more frequent on
lower floors. They also tend to have a preference for rooms near lifts, to
avoid long walks down empty hallways.
Hotels staffs are now also being trained to be security conscious,
particularly regarding women. Holiday Inn Worldwide, for instance, instructs
its front-desk staff never to announce a room number, so that anyone nearby
shall not overhear it. Nor will they give room numbers over the telephone.
Many hotels no longer put room numbers on their keys. In addition, the AHMA
suggests that its members put peepholes on room doors, so that guests can
see who is knocking. But it is considered wiser to check with the front desk
before allowing anyone to enter the room.
Women also like to avoid lonely garages and car parks. It is helpful for a
hotel to have valet parking.
One important piece of advice from travel professionals to women on the road
is that they dress appropriately, but as inconspicuously as possible.
Handbags should always be carried close to the body. And when in doubt about
potentially dangerous areas in a strange city, they should consult the hotel
concierge.
Eating out in an unfamiliar place is always a problem for business
travellers, who are usually pressed for time and unable to make a leisurely
hunt for an interesting restaurant. The solution preferred by most women is
room service. This saves them from the awkwardness of arriving unescorted at
a restaurant and being treated ungraciously, which is too often still the
case. Women also tend to stay away from hotel bars, to avoid unwanted
advances.
Those who must drive for their business trips face special safety problems.
Carjacking and other attacks on women travellers in rental cars have become
common in the US.
It is crucial to keep car doors locked at all times and be certain of
directions. If you are lost or having mechanical trouble, go to a well-lit
public place to ask for help.
Despite their special concerns about security, women 'basically don't want
to be treated differently,' said a spokesperson for Holiday Inn Worldwide.
According to the company's surveys of travellers, women enjoy their business
travel and do not want hotel staffs to be over attentive.
Their top choices for amenities are in fact the same as those of their male
colleagues: a coffee-pot in the room, a comfortable lounge chair and a daily
complimentary newspaper at the door.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (4): Green hurdle
has added to costs - The impact of environmental legislation on the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL regulation has saddled the chemical industry with a
competitive disadvantage, chemical companies say, even though environmental
groups remain sceptical that companies' behaviour has changed for the
better. The effect on the industry's cost structure raises questions of
whether indus- trialised countries should attempt to manufacture bulk
chemicals if they are seriously committed to rising 'green' standards.
The chemical industry was one of the first to be targeted by the
environmental regul- ation which has built up in layers in the past two
decades in industrialised countries. Rules have ratcheted down the
permissible level of emissions, and some - such as the UK's 1990
Environmental Protection Act and parts of the US environmental legislation -
have begun to insist as well on installation of the best available
technology.
Meanwhile, the growing popular support for 'green' issues, which reached a
peak across much of Europe at the end of the 1980s, has made it harder and
less predictable for chemical companies to get approval for expansion.
More rules are in the pipeline. The European Commission is working on
directives to restrict the emissions of solvents used in wood treatment and
paints, and to make companies integrate control of pollution and
accident-prevention.
The ambitious and much publicised response from the industry was the
worldwide 'Responsible Care' programme for voluntary monitoring of
emissions. But even if that has helped to improve the industry's public
image - a point contested by pressure groups such as Greenpeace - it is
clear that new rules have added to some manufacturing costs.
Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, estimates that environmental
spending within European chemical companies is running at about the level of
R&amp;D spending, although it lacks firm figures or an historical comparison. Mr
Louis Jourdan, Cefic's director of technical affairs, says: 'Of course (the
rules) cause some competitive problems, although our innovation remains
better than that of India or Indonesia.'
He points to the problem for European companies of competing with cheap
imports of caprolactam, the raw material for nylon fibres, or with imports
from eastern Europe. But he adds: 'It is not just environmental regulation
that causes the problem, it is differences in salary levels and energy
prices too.'
He agrees that there is a debate on whether Europe should produce bulk
chemicals, though he argues that declining European production of aluminium
and fertilisers is due more to the high cost of European energy.
Ms Tamar Posner, director of the UK Chemical Industries Association,
believes the handicap stems from uncertainty as much as from higher costs,
even though the association estimates that spending on environmental
protection has risen from 9 per cent of operational costs to 14 per cent
between 1990 and 1992. 'Uncertainty is the killer - opportunity is missed
waiting for authorisation,' she says.
The 1990 Act has been exceptionally difficult to implement, in her view,
because so little consultation with the industry was carried out, unlike the
previous year's Act on the control of substances hazardous to health.
The association and the Department of the Environment have had complaints
about the Environmental Protection Act from speciality chemicals companies
which want to be allowed to receive different, one-off orders from a whole
range of customers. After struggling to define what constitutes the best
affordable technology for each applicant, the pollution inspectorate now
appears to be moving towards a definition at industry level, even if some
plants then become uneconomic.
The industry associations' talk of consultation and co-operation with
government departments is likely to do little to pacify the environmental
groups. Ms Madeleine Cobbing, of Greenpeace UK, says: 'We haven't seen any
positive results from the responsible care programme. There's been a change
in what is being said, but whether companies are really changing how they
behave is another matter.'
Greenpeace has been heavily criticised by government departments and
industrialists recently for its 'No legal pollution' campaign, in which it
argued that companies should not be given licences that allowed them to
pollute rivers and estuaries. However the campaign, not judged to be one of
Greenpeace's best even by its supporters, ranked companies on their alleged
pollution by the quantities shown in their discharge permits. But companies
promptly retaliated that the actual, unpublished, levels were much lower.
Environmentalists' response is that there is not enough
systematically-gathered public information. Ms Cobbing says: 'There is no
way of measuring the real emissions unless the companies give out the data,'
which many decline to do on grounds of commercial confidentiality. Releasing
this data would be a sign that the chemical industry was 'really prepared to
be open,' she adds.
Environmental groups long ago decided that the chemical industry was one of
the biggest villains on the green landscape. They played a prominent part in
alerting the public to the issue and - it must be deduced - in triggering
some of the legislation. But they may find it harder in future to keep such
a central role in the debate even if they make a practice of bringing
pollution prosecutions themselves, as Greenpeace has done against ICI.
The pages of legislation on the statute books have taken some pressure off
politicians who were being urged by environmentalists and constituents to
'do something'. In turn, the chemical industry's new talk of co-operation
and bridge-building has changed the tone of the debate - it no longer
appears to be at loggerheads with the government.
More time - and, as the environmentalists rightly point out, more data  - is
needed to establish how far industry behaviour has changed. Those figures
may also show, more clearly than is yet possible, whether companies are
handicapped as a result and whether the right balance between
competitiveness and green standards has been struck.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (3): The need for a
culture shock - The problems of implementing Responsible Care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rhetoric behind Responsible Care is all very laudable, but actually
implementing the programme is far from easy. Implementation involves far
more than just investing in technology and plant. Rather, it requires a
change in an organisation's very culture.
'Top-down edicts have a place. But if people believe you are serious, things
happen far more quickly,' argues Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman of
Monsanto.
Changing an organisation's culture is not always easy, however. Many
companies experience resistance from their own employees.
Mr Roger Papp, head of safety and environment at Elf-Atochem, admits: 'It's
difficult to convince all employees that you are serious about the
environment. One of our most fundamental roles is to convince people that
the issue is important.'
Researchers are most difficult to convince because they are most confident
about their work, he argues. For many years, chemical engineers were
primarily concerned about reducing costs and increasing volume. Now they
must also consider the environment.
'One of the problems is that the heads of business units tend to be more
worried about costs than the environment,' says Mr Jacques Salamitou,
director of environment at Rhone-Poulenc. 'Site managers are fine, because
they have to deal with the local communities. The problem is business
managers because they are not so exposed to the public.'
To counter this problem, health, safety and environment must be the
responsibility of line management, insists Mr Jurgen Muller, an executive
director at Sandoz.
At Ciba, Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment,
says that the environment has changed from a specialised discipline whose
role was essentially defensive, to a more integrated approach in which every
member of the company is involved.
Mr Muller agrees: 'It must not be the province of experts, with the line
manager responsible for maximising production and another responsible for
safety and environment. That is sub-optimal and dangerous because it leads
to mixed priorities within the organisation.'
In most companies, progress in reducing emissions has come in a number of
stages. 'We started with end of pipe solutions,' says Mr Hans Kunzi,
director, corporate safety and environmental protection, at Roche. 'That was
important because it was direct and effective. We built incinerators and
effluent plants to treat the waste we produced.'
Some groups have been forced to close plants because investing in the
necessary environmental protection would not generate a return on capital.
In France, Elf-Atochem stopped production of some fine chemicals in the
department of the Lande because it was impossible to achieve a return given
the additional investment required. Similarly, Monsanto closed its phosphate
plant at Colombia, Tennessee, because of environmental costs.
Now companies are moving towards waste minimisation, improving processes so
less waste is created during manufacturing.
'The next step will be to integrate environmental controls into production.
This is difficult. If you take a pharmaceutical product, it can take 20
steps to manufacture it. If only 90 per cent is converted each time, it
leads to enormous waste. We try to reduce the steps and the waste each
time,' says Mr Kunzi.
'We have to make sure we manufacture in a decent way,' he says. 'What was
good enough 20 years ago is not good enough now. Development goes on all the
time. We have to integrate environmental control into production. We have a
long way to go.'
Mr Papp at Atochem points to the example of the group's plant at Lavera near
Marseille, where the process to manufacture vinyl-chloride was modified to
carry out the reactions at high pressure. A system for photo-chlorination
using glass lamps capable of operating at high pressure had to be developed.
By investing in the process, the waste stream was minimised, and the excess
hydrochloric acid could be recycled for use in a neighbouring plant.
Waste minimisation can, on occasions, quickly pay back the investment. At
Rhone-Poulenc's site at Pont-de-Claix in the Rhone-Alpes, waste minimisation
and plant closures meant a new FFr150m hazardous waste incinerator was being
used only at half its 30,000 tonnes capacity. This meant the company was
able to use the incinerator for commercial uses.
Although waste minimisation normally increases yields, the costs can be
considerable and the financial benefits are not always demonstrable. 'It
would be naive to say that reducing pollution always pays. Not all
investments for the environment are productive,' says Mr Jean-Jacques
Salzmann, senior vice-president, corporate safety and environment, at
Sandoz.
'If waste minimisation is not cost-effective, we simply won't do it,' says
Mr Salamitou at Rhone-Poulenc. 'We have closed plants in the US because
there was no point in investing to bring them up to standard.'
Mr Papp says: 'Waste minimisation is cost- effective when it improves total
efficiency. But it isn't always easy. If there hadn't been a plant at Lavera
capable of using hydrochloric acid, there would have been no point in
investing. Just because something is clean doesn't mean it's always
cost-effective.'
Improving environmental practice involves reducing not only emissions, but
also energy consumption, argues Dr Hans Jorg Henne, president for
environmental industrial safety and energy at BASF. At Ciba, energy
consumption per tonne has fallen by 50 per cent over the last 20 years,
although the group admits it has risen over the last two or three years.
While historic performances have improved at most groups, there are
divergences between companies about the usefulness of setting future targets
for emissions. Some targets are impressive.
However, as a programme for action, such targets can be misleading, says Mr
Eigenmann at Ciba. 'There's no point in announcing a 10 per cent target and
then asking every plant to cut by 10 per cent. You have to look where the
worst performance is and improve that - the reduction in emissions could be,
say, 50 per cent of a large figure, and cost far less than cutting 5 per
cent of very little small amount at another plant. That way the group can
tackle the problem in an efficient way.'
In spite of past improvements, there is still some way to go, warns Mr
Thomas Riggert, director of European chemical activities at Arthur Andersen,
the consultants. He points out that process control systems are not well
integrated in many companies which often have little idea of implications of
a potential accident at any one time.
Meanwhile, companies are moving towards environmentally friendly products.
'Frankly, looking at the total product life-cycle has a lot of merit,' says
Mr Reding at Monsanto. He argues that companies must look at their
suppliers' waste streams as well as its downstream use. Groups are talking
about 'product stewardship'.
Roche set up a special section to look at the ecological compatibility of
products and processes in 1978 with one person. Since then it has expanded
significantly, and has checked out the 40 largest volume products at the
company.
'Sometimes you have to eliminate products,' says Mr Salzmann at Sandoz. For
example, the company has cut out all products containing mercury at its
Basle site. Similarly, Ciba has cut products. The company ceased production
of Galicrom insecticide during the mid-1980s because it could not be
produced in an environmentally-friendly way.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (2): The facts, the
figures and the feedback - How the industry is trying to get across the
message of its improvement in environmental performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO REPAIR its damaged reputation, the chemical industry must not only
improve its environmental performance; it must also communicate that
improve- ment in a credible manner.
The issue of credibility is the key. It depends foremost on the quality of
environmental reporting. However, the sector is still at sixes and sevens
about the issue.
While some groups, such as BP Chemicals, have taken to publishing all their
emissions, others, such as Ciba and Rhone-Poulenc, prefer to publish
indices. Yet others refuse to publish group figures.
'Providing group emission statistics does not help the communication
process,' argues Mr Jean-Jacques Salzmann, senior vice-president of
corporate safety and environment at Sandoz, whose board is debating the
merits of whether to provide such figures.
Sandoz's group sulphur dioxide figures are distorted by a plant in Pakistan
which uses local oil high in sulphur. The company would like to use imported
low-sulphur oil, but that is not permitted. Giving overall figures would
show the company in a unjustifiably poor light, it believes.
At Sandoz, Mr Salzmann argues naked figures are difficult to understand, and
that the important thing is the trend. 'You have to explain the context if
misint- erpretation is to be prevented,' he argues. 'Many groups have been
frustrated, publishing raw figures and getting no feedback,' he says.
The company argues that information should be provided locally according to
individual communities' demands. 'Neighbourhoods are not interested in group
trends. They want site figures,' says Mr Salzmann.
However, Mr Hans Kunzi, director of corporate safety and environmental
protection at Roche, argues it is important not to patronise the public.
'Rather than publish ecotrends, we will report group figures. We're working
on that at the moment and should release the figures this summer. All of the
subsidiary companies will report and each division or major site will have
its own page. Energy consumption, environmental spending, emissions to air
and water and landfill, and safety records will all be given. So, too, will
the financial performance. It's a pain to do, but it's important,' says Mr
Kunzi.
At Monsanto, Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman, admits he had worries when
the company started publishing its entire emission figures because they
might provide ammunition for environmental groups.
'In fact, the external reaction has generally been pretty good, even if we
have a long way to go to reduce our emissions,' he says.
Any figures have to be linked to production. Closing a factory can be a
highly effective way of improving environmental figures, but gives little
indication of how the group is performing. Not all companies publish
production figures.
Most groups remain anxious that their environmental performance should not
be compared with that of other groups. Different chemical concerns have
different product mixes which makes comparisons tricky, they claim.
Mr Kunzi at Roche explains: 'It's very difficult to relate one company's
performance with another. If you are manufacturing 100,000 tonnes of
ethylene, then 0.1 per cent waste is a hell of a lot of waste.
'A pharmaceutical product can require 50 to 60 steps for manufacture and
generate 80 per cent waste - that's a really dirty product but it might be
only a few kilos a year. One is a bulk commodity and one a highly complex
molecule. You can't compare them kilo by kilo. You can compare polyethylene
against polyethylene, of course. You could measure added value per kilo, but
whatever measure you use is problematic. The important thing is to compare
the company's results with previous years. The important measure is relative
rather than absolute.'
Few groups are likely to lie about their emissions. 'Communication of
performance is not a public relations exercise. You have to be honest and
open, giving the warts and all,' says Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals' manager
for health, safety and the environment.
If anything, there is a tendency for companies to exaggerate their
environmental impact. In France, Mr Pierre Siefridt, from the Le Havre
office of the direction regionale de l'industrie, de la recherche et de
d'environnement, says that on occasions companies have a tendency to
exaggerate emissions. This gives them a high pollution base to work with and
allows them to appear to improve much more quickly.
Another difficult issue is that of measuring spending on environment. Mr Joe
Draper, health, safety and environment manager at Shell Chemicals, argues
that it is almost impossible to separate expenditure between safety, health
and environment. 'We used to make estimates or guesses, but there is no way
of consistently assessing the number,' he explains.
'Although you can allocate an end of pipeline investment to the environment,
what are you supposed to do with integrated pollution control in a new
plant?' he asks.
At Ciba, Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment,
believes it is right only to count investment in end of pipe technology,
otherwise the figures become meaningless. Other companies have far wider
definitions of environmental spending. Mr Draper argues that issues of
definition create huge inexactitudes, and make comparisons between different
groups invidious.
Target audiences for environmental communication are both external and
internal. 'Young employees no longer accept a change of mind-set between
work and home. They want to be able to justify what the company is doing. We
have to convince them that we are acting responsibly,' says Dr Hans Kindler,
Ciba's executive committee member for the environment.
'We ask our employees to carry out propaganda for us,' says Mr Francis
Bazile, director in charge of environment at Elf-Atochem. Similarly, at
Ciba's Basle plants, retired employees help put across the company's
message.
Externally, most companies are now opening their doors to the surrounding
communities. Visits from schools and local media, as well as local
government representatives and communities have become widespread. Pressure
groups are also increasingly asked for their views.
In the US and elsewhere, community advisory panels have been set to help
rebuild the relationship between sites and the nearby population.
Admittedly, open days are not always a success. Mr Reding at Monsanto says
that after the Bhophal tragedy, the company set up some open days, but
nobody turned up. Each Monsanto plant now has a specially-tailored community
plan.
Mr LaGraff at BP Chemicals says there is no point targeting everybody in the
local community. 'About 20 per cent will always be positive, and 10 per cent
always hostile, no matter what your performance. The important audience is
the undecided 70 per cent.'
At a corporate level, chemical companies are trying to convince legislators,
environmental pressure groups, customers and internal management about their
performance. Shareholders are also an important constituency, given they are
likely to want to know why so much money is being spent on environmental
projects.
Such individual projects may bear some fruit, but the overall impact on the
reputation of the industry as a whole can be limited. 'National opinion
polls and local ones show it's almost impossible to differentiate an
individual company from the industry,' says Mr Kunzi at Roche.
The answer is to explain the benefits as well as risks of chemicals to
society, argues Mr Bazile at Atochem. 'There's still a belief that chemicals
are intrinsically dangerous. There's no difference between natural and
synthetic chemicals,' he says.
The efforts by some sections of the industry may be beginning to pay off. Mr
Reding at Monsanto tells the story of a member of a community advisory panel
who complained about the company's deep-well policy. When she was given the
option of using deep-well or cutting jobs, she said Monsanto was too good a
company to offer only two options.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (1): Bargains in
the short term - If the US Congress ratifies the North American Free Trade
Agreement, creating a common market of 357m people, it will have a profound
impact on the way business is done
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE waning days of the recession, business travellers to North America
are already starting to look back with nostalgia to a time when air fares
were cheap and hotels offered first-class pampering at steerage prices.
In Canada and the United States, all that remains of the recession is a
state of mind.
Canada's growth rate is among the highest of the Group of Seven, the world's
largest industrial democracies; while in the US, the recession ended
technically more than a year ago, when economic output stopped shrinking.
But the recovery, apart from a brief surge in growth at the end of last
year, has been meagre. As a consequence of poor demand at home, prices have
remained weak and competition for business is as fierce as ever.
The threat of higher travel costs looms on the horizon, with signs that air
fares and car rental rates are already on the rise. For the moment, however,
North America remains a bargain destination, especially by world standards.
This is borne out by the average per diem for a typical business traveller
to New York of Dollars 297, including three meals and accommodation. A
comparable business trip to Paris would set a company back Dollars 404,
while expenses in London run to Dollars 316, according to studies by
Runzheimer International, a specialist travel consultancy.
And New York is the most expensive city in North America. An overnight trip
to Chicago averages Dollars 218, slightly above Mexico City's Dollars 202.
Costs in San Francisco and Los Angeles will run to Dollars 194, using summer
rates. Atlanta is a more modest Dollars 165, while Canadian cities are
downright cheap, with per diem costs of Dollars 155 for Vancouver and
Dollars 150 for Toronto.
Indeed, returning visitors to New York will find costs have risen by only
Dollars 15-a-day since 1990, and other US cities have seen similarly modest
cost increases.
This is good news for business travellers, who can still expect to find
bargains in lodging, food and car rental. In the 12 months to March 1993,
Runzheimer found meal prices had edged 2 per cent higher, while lodging
costs rose 1.9 per cent. Furthermore, average car rental prices dropped 10.7
per cent in the US in the same period and are now below 1988 levels.
The bad news is that there are already signs of rising travel costs. At the
four biggest car rental agencies, summer rates in general are running above
last year's levels. Furthermore, air fares appear to be stabilising at
higher levels. The US airline industry, which has haemorrhaged about Dollars
10bn in losses in the past three years, is making a concerted effort to
staunch its losses by ending the vicious fare wars which helped push the
industry into the red.
According to Runzheimer, unrestricted coach-class fares jumped 38.7 per cent
when analysed over 12 months to the end of this year's first quarter.
Business discount fares were up only 0.6 per cent, while the lowest
published adult fares rose 15 per cent.
An early round of bargain summer fares led to some speculation that the
higher fares wouldn't hold, but so far these cuts have been skirmishes
rather than fare wars, and the discounts have not been as deep as in
previous years. There is reason to believe that the days of inexpensive
travel are over.
To make matters worse, service on most airlines has suffered as a result of
cost-cutting measures. Meals, in particular, have shrunk in recent years.
While most carriers skimp on lettuce leaves and other trimmings (which can
save an airline millions of dollars each year), some carriers are cutting
back on their total meal service.
Breakfast on a morning Northwest flight from New York to Detroit, for
example, is a lone poppy-seed muffin, presented on a plate in its plastic
wrapping.
Until recently, North America was often used as a synonym for the United
States, with Canada sometimes perceived as the 51st state. Mexico, with its
more obvious cultural and linguistic differences, was often considered part
of South America.
This distorted view of the continent did a disservice both to the very real
cultural differences between Canada and the US, and to the important
connection between the three countries comprising the northernmost continent
of the western hemisphere.
First-time visitors to Toronto are often surprised to find that its spirit
is closer to London than to neighbouring Detroit. Torontians shop at Marks
and Spencer, drink their tea with milk, have access to a national healthcare
system and abide by strict gun control laws. In Detroit, tea is served with
lemon, and the lack of restrictions on gun ownership helps to account for
one of the highest urban murder rates in the world. Similarly, Montreal,
with its cafes and well-heeled women, seems closer to Paris than to the
mingled French and Caribbean culture of New Orleans.
Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US,
Canada and Mexico, the world's perception of the continent may have changed
for good.
Although Nafta was signed last December by the trade ministers of Mexico,
Canada and the US, it has yet to be ratified by Congress in the US. It is
possible that political opposition in Canada and the US could still kill the
agreement, but strong trade and investment ties have been forged already
among the member nations.
Canada and Mexico signed an earlier pact in 1990 to strengthen trade and
investment ties. This has already engendered a number of agreements in areas
ranging from forestry and agriculture to taxation and drugs. Canadian
exports to Mexico are expected to approach the Dollars 1bn level this year,
from about Dollars 780m a year ago. Moreover, the two countries are now
negotiating a bilateral agreement on science and technology.
A recent study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young found that Canada and Mexico
receive a disproportionate amount of US projects in the fabricated metal,
plastic and furniture sectors, compared with the rest of the world. In
addition, food and paper industry investments tend to gravitate towards
Canada; while Mexico attracts a disproportionate share of electrical,
transportation equipment, clothing and glass projects.
'We expect these investments to increase at an even faster pace if the Nafta
is enacted,' says James Buchanan, trade consultant at Ernst &amp; Young.
If Nafta survives, next year may see the start of a common market with a
population of 357m and a gross domestic product of Dollars 6,400bn. This
compares with the European Community's population of 345m and gross domestic
product of Dollars 3,000bn.
Clearly, Nafta, if ratified, is likely have a profound impact on the way
business is done in the region.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (1): Stark choice -
clean up or be wiped out - If the chemical industry fails to respond to
environmental pressure, legislation in the developed world could impose
further curbs. So it has launched a global initiative called Responsible
Care to regain public confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Seveso in 1976, Bhopal in 1984, Basle in 1986. The litany of chemical
companies' accidents makes doleful reading. The sector's poor environmental
performance has been directly responsible for its reputation ebbing to an
all-time low. In the UK, approval for the chemical industry has declined
from more than 50 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s to less than 20 per
cent last year. The declining popularity of its chemical companies has been
mirrored by that of its counterparts around the globe.
'The chemical sector is rightfully cast among the problem industries,'
concedes Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman of Monsanto.
A consensus has formed that the industry must boost both its performance and
image. 'It must improve its environmental performance not because it is
being altruistic - although as corporate citizens we do care. It must
improve out of self-interest,' says Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals manager
for health, safety and the environment.
If the industry fails to clean up its act, it runs the risk of being
legislated out of existence, argues Mr David Buzzelli, director responsible
for the environment at Dow Chemical.
'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive.
Planning approvals for investment will be refused, making sites uneconomic.
Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, adding further to
costs. The chemicals industry could be legislated to the point of economic
non-viability,' he says.
Ever-increasing volumes of environmentally-related legislation and
bureaucracy are adding to costs at a time when chemicals groups can least
afford them. Yet the groups plead that legislation is seldom the most
effective or appropriate way of improving the sector's environmental
performance.
'The answer to the problem is not more regulation. Command and control will
fail because regulations seldom achieve what they set out to accomplish. All
that happens is that lawyers become involved, taking up time and money,
without solving the problem,' says Mr Reding at Monsanto.
The industry's riposte is corporate environmentalism. 'We must move from a
command and control phase to a voluntary phase,' argues Mr Reding.
'Self-regulation is best because each company knows its own processes and
the most effective way of reducing emissions,' says Mr Jacques Puechal,
president of Cefic, the European Council of the Chemical Industry, and chief
executive of Elf-Atochem. 'That is the most practical approach and the least
costly to the business. That also means the consumer will not have to pay
more and more for stupid legislation. We have to prove to society that the
best way to solve a problem is before it hits the table of the bureaucrats.
'We are trying to be pro-active. We have to show that the sector can make
progress by itself,' says Mr Puechal.
Around the world, the industry is trying to add some shine to its tarnished
image and regain public trust through its programme of Responsible Care.
This involves measuring emissions in a credible way, improving environmental
performance and then communicating that performance, warts and all, to the
public. The programme was initially created by the Canadian chemical
industry, was adopted by the US, migrated over the Atlantic to Europe, and
has now proliferated worldwide.
The path to Responsible Care has not been easy, however. Convincing
companies in the industry that it was worth the effort and often
considerable expense was far from simple. 'It was agony for the first two
years,' admits Mr John Cox, director-general of the UK's Chemical Industries
Association. 'But I think the UK is now leading the global movement both on
performance indicators and management standards.'
The key to the process is measuring and then improving environmental
performance. 'We don't want to put out propaganda. There is no point
communicating, if you don't have anything of substance to communicate,'
warns Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment at
Ciba.
Most companies responded to increasing environmental pressure during the
1970s by investing in end-of-pipe technologies. Now they are moving towards
waste-minimisation. 'Treating waste is expensive. We are trying to avoid the
expense of generating the waste and the cost in the first place,' says Mr
Eigenmann. Some groups have adopted the concept as their mantra. Dow, for
example, has a programme called Wrap - waste reduction always pays.
Such measures are not always remunerative, however. 'It would be naive to
say that reducing pollution always pays,' says Mr Jurgen Muller, executive
board member for the environment at Sandoz.
Responsible Care also requires changes in organisational culture. 'It is not
just a question of following a set of rules. It's like driving a car. There
are a lot of regulations about how to drive, but we still have bad drivers.
In the same way you can have companies that comply with regulations, but are
not environmentally sound. An integral part of Responsible Care is a change
in culture within the organisation,' says Mr Puechal.
'This cultural leap is the biggest problem that companies face,' argues Mr
Jacques Salamitou, director of environment at Rhone-Poulenc. 'Site managers
are fine because they have to deal with the local community. The problem is
the business managers because they are not so exposed to the public.'
Much of this historically secretive industry is now trying to become more
open in its communications with local communities and the general public. At
the end of this month, the Chemical Industries Association will launch a
spectacular publicity campaign, highlighting the progress it believes it has
made at 400 sites around the UK. The initiative has been cited as a model
for other sectors. Indeed, the association believes other industries will
have to follow the example of the chemicals industry.
However, many groups are still struggling with the amount of information to
provide on an individual company basis. BP Chemicals has taken a lead,
publishing details of the group's entire emissions. Others, such as ICI,
provide details of what they consider the most significant emissions. A few
publish only indices of their emissions, insisting that trends rather than
absolute figures provide a better indication of performance. Many still do
not publish any details at all.
The consequences of full disclosure may be less bad than many groups think.
'There were some doubts that we would provide environmental groups with
information, but the external reaction has been generally good,' says Mr
Reding at Monsanto.
Many groups still grapple with how much information to provide on their
environmental spending. Mr Joe Draper, health, safety and environment
manager at Shell Chemicals in the UK, argues that defining what is related
to the environment in a new plant and what is merely best practice is almost
impossible. Some groups do not differentiate between spending on health,
safety and the environment.
'It's difficult internally to arrive at consistent numbers, but comparing
one group's spending with another there's a great deal of inexactitude,' he
explains.
Compiling such data is useful (see table, next page) because it demonstrates
the extent of the industry's spending on the environment. It is far from
clear whether present levels of spending are sustainable, given the
financial plight afflicting the industry. Even at the beginning of last
year, before the full impact of the slowdown of the German economy had
become apparent, the three chemicals giants, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, warned
the cost of domestic environmental legislation threatened to cripple the
German industry.
At Ciba in Switzerland, Mr Eigenmann says: 'I think the high-point - at
about 25 per cent of all capital expenditure - has been reached. We can't
repeat what we have just done. It may be feasible technically, but
financially it's just not possible. We will now probably settle at about 15
per cent.'
The problem for the industry is that the environmental goalposts continue to
move. That is partly because the sector has failed to correct
misunderstandings about chemicals.
'People are unfamiliar with chemicals. They call for the banning of
chemicals - not even toxic chemicals. We have not done enough to show the
contribution of the industry to society,' says Mr LaGraff at BP Chemicals.
Given that much of the population perceives only the risk of chemicals and
fails to balance that risk with their benefits, every accident brings the
threat of yet more legislation, adding costs and aggravating still further
the financial crisis gripping the sector. In spite of the cost of improving
environmental performance, the industry cannot afford not to clean up its
act.
There is little doubt that the chemical industry has a long haul before it.
'It's frustrating. There are no overnight solutions,' says Mr Cox at the
CIA. 'We have to show that the chemical industry is a responsible part of
the community. We still have a long way to go.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares easier ahead of futures expiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of essentially favourable statistics on the domestic economy did
little yesterday to help a UK stock market overshadowed by the prospect of
the expiry this morning in several important global derivatives markets.
Base rate hopes receded as the Bundesbank made no move and a further fall in
UK unemployment in May appeared to reduce political pressure for a rate cut.
Share prices, which had moved firmly as the financial markets awaited the
economic data, refused to follow government bonds higher in the second half
of the session. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which takes
over as the market leader when the June contract expires this morning,
dipped below 2,900 and shares began to wilt. Today also brings Triple
Witching Hours, or important derivatives expiries, in US and German markets.
At best, the FT-SE 100 touched 2,889.2, strengthening hopes that the market
is about to break out on the upside of its present range. By the close,
however, the index had turned down to register a net decline of 7.3 at
2,875.7.
Strategists ascribed the market's dull close entirely to pressures linked to
the impending expiry of the June contract on the Footsie. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, covering a range of second line issues, scraped through to a new
closing peak of 3,213.5, up 1.5, just under the best of the session.
Trading volume was unimpressive at 555.4m shares, with the proportion of
non-Footsie business, at around 59 per cent, again restrained by the
futures-related activity in the blue chips. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of
607.3m shares reflected retail business worth Pounds 1.39bn, which was at
the higher end of the healthy business levels of the past nine months.
The largely unexpected fall to 10.4 per cent in domestic unemployment in May
was regarded as good news for the UK government, as was the sustained
annualised inflation rate of 1.3 per cent. In the near term, these
statistics may have disappointed equity market hopes for a base rate
reduction but the wider implications for the recovery in the domestic
economy are likely to help the stock market.
There were few features among equities yesterday and the leading securities
houses were preoccupied with the futures settlement. Pharmaceutical stocks
attracted support on the back of currency factors, but interest faded when
Wall Street made a slow opening to the new session, shedding 2.21 Dow points
in London hours. Both ICI and Zeneca were friendless.
Disappointment with the 0.2 per cent fall in UK April retail sales,
announced earlier this week, cast a cloud over the store and retail sector,
which also reflected the waning of interest rate hopes. But brewery stocks
attracted buyers.
The London stock market appeared last night to have successfully survived a
week featured by a series of potential pitfalls, in the shape of the
important speech by the new chancellor of the exchequer in the City of
London and also the list of economic data.
Today also brings the latest statistics on UK money supply. Equity
strategists appeared satisfied last night with forecasts that money supply
M4 will continue to show a minor gain and that the rise in M4 bank lending
will moderate.

FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Victaulic shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Victaulic, the industrial products group, tumbled 62 to 253p after
it warned that first-half profits would be 20 per cent lower than a year
earlier.
The company, due to address analysts next week, cited delays in the
publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the future
structure of British Gas, a major customer, and lower than expected demand
from the water industry.
Williams Holdings added 7 at 309p after Strauss Turnbull advised investors
to switch out of TI Group, 7 lower at 338p.
The leading pharmaceutical issues made a bold attempt to move ahead during
the early part of the day, helped by the strong performance of Wall Street
overnight, but quickly ran into pockets of resistance as the London market
got under way.
The two Zeneca stocks, strong performers in London late on Wednesday when
the Fleming buy note impacted on the market, initially edged higher before
slipping to close marginally easier on the day. The 'old' lost 2 at 621p and
the 'new' nil-paid 1 1/2 at 21p. Turnover in the 'old' was 5.2m shares and
in the 'new' 8m.
The constant takeover speculation in Fisons, which has picked up since the
official launch of the company's anti-ashtma drug Tilade earlier this week,
drove the stock up to 177p before closing at 175p, up 3 on balance.
SmithKline Beecham put on 5 at 451p and Glaxo managed to stay in positive
territory, rising marginally to 595p.
Another series of excellent results from the utilities ensured renewed
strong interest in the sub-sectors.
Water stocks were again heavily traded, with the second liners initially
taking up the running after being left behind by the FT-SE 100 contituents.
Of the smaller stocks, Northumbrian was the best performer, closing 4 harder
at 581p. Southern eased 4 to 505p in spite of the 9.2 per cent increase in
the dividend total, at the top end of expectations.
Towards the close the sector retreated. Severn Trent Water, at 483p, gave up
13 of its recent advance: the preliminary figures, including the 9.3 per
cent rise in the dividend, were close to best expectations.
North West Water lost 7 to 467p, Anglian 8 to 476p and Thames 10 to 466p.
The electricity sector's 'dividend race' hotted up as South Wales
Electricity topped East Midland's 14 per cent payout with a 14.9 per cent
increase. But profit-taking in the electricity sector kept the lid on the
shares, which settled 2 easier at 546p.
An early rally ahead of a September dividend was said to be behind the
changing fortune of Dalgety, which strengthened 6 to 462p. Bensons Crisps
advanced 8 to 76p in anticipation of favourable comment and Booker
registered a rise of 13 at 381p on the appointment of a new chief executive.
Investor faith continued for Guinness after a presentation in London by
LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer with whom Guinness has a 24 per
cent cross-shareholding. It moved up 6 to close at 495p in a volume of 3.2m.
Bass firmed 2 to 484p but Allied- Lyons slipped 5 to 532p.
A heavy two-way business was seen in Burton Group, which edged up  3/4 to 86
3/4 p as 17m shares were traded.
In a continued show of confidence following the better than expected interim
results, Granada Group added 5 at 420p.
Feeling in the market strengthened that Forte may be close to making an
acquisitive move for Savoy Hotel, whose 'A' stock climbed 30 to 835p while
Forte's share price slipped a penny to 219p.
The government's moves to amend the new Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) regime
was seen as good news for the smaller exploration companies by the leading
broking houses.
Mr Simon Flowers, exploration and production analyst at NatWest Securities,
said the news was 'particularly bullish for companies planning to spend up
to Pounds 10m on exploration over the next two years and which stand to pay
PRT in the near term'.
NatWest said virtually all smaller explorers will see their net asset values
boosted, and mentioned the clearest winners as Aran, Hardy and Goal. The
broker added that Lasmo and Enterprise would gain from the changes but that
their exploration budgets would be too large for the changes to be material.
Other brokers took the view that the changes were moderately positive.
Hardy Oil rose 6 to 168p, additionally helped by the results. Aran held at
33p and Goal edged up a penny to 64p.

FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Clayform doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts were quick to pour scorn on rumours about Clayform Properties, the
company that has seen its share price leap this week after Mr Martin
Landau's arrival as a significant stakeholder raised suggestions that he may
use Clayform as a bid vehicle for a larger group.
Clayform has gone from 16p last Friday to its present price of 37p, having
gained 4 yesterday as its name was linked to possible moves on Slough
Estates or MEPC. But property specialists refused to be stirred, one
describing the proposition as 'completely implausible'.
The company has a market capitalisation of Pounds 11.6m, compared with
Pounds 792.3m for Slough Estates and Pounds 1.54bn for MEPC. One analyst
said the only ace in Clayform's hand was its exposure to retailing through
Stead and Simpson, but that could not be expected to sway shareholders.
Slough Estates moved up 3 to 209p amid the speculation but that was broadly
in line with a firm property sector. British Land rose 4 to 313p. Hammerson
put on 3 at 369p and the 'A' stock 9 at 338p.
Derwent Valley announced a Pounds 10.3m property portfolio acquisition on
the back of a Pounds 16.9m placing of shares on open offer. Its price held
at 493p.

Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce continued to attract overseas interest
and edged forward a halfpenny to 150p in an otherwise poor day for the
market. Volume was 3.2m shares.
US investment bank Lehman Brothers is among those institutions which have
moved to satisfy continuing demand from overseas investors, following last
week's company announcement that the foreign share ownership level had
reached the maximum permitted of 29.5 per cent.
Lehman said it has issued 5m call warrants with a maturity date of December
1994 with the specific aim of satisfying European and US demand for
Rolls-Royce.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was said earlier this week to be
looking to make a similar move. Currently any further direct purchases by
non-UK investors would have to be relinquished or transferred to UK
ownership as soon as the company confirms the purchases, a move dictated by
its articles of association.

SHARES in engineering group Lucas Industries dived after analysts attending
a dinner hosted by the company on Wednesday evening at the Paris Air Show
came away with a bleak view of trading prospects across the company's
markets.
The shares fell 7 to 129p early in the session, with Credit Lyonnais Laing
said to have been among the sellers, and NatWest Securities reiterating its
cautious stance on the stock.
There were suggestions from some quarters that the final dividend may be cut
and that a restructuring of the company may have to take place. Several
brokers moved to downgrade profit estimates and one said: 'Trading remains
gloomy and there may even be provisions to be made.'
Nerves later steadied and the shares closed 5 off at 131p after volume of
6m. Market watchers are to meet the company next week.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FADING hopes of a reduction in interest rates dominated the day's trading in
Footsie futures, ahead of today's expiry, writes Joel Kibazo.
On its last full day of trading, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index
opened strongly at 2,890, just above Wednesday's closing level. A rally to
2,897 in the first hour soon ran out of steam as traders concentrated
instead on today's expiry and the rolling forward of positions into the
September contract, which becomes the market leader on Monday.
The late-morning release of favourable economic data on employment and
inflation should have cheered the market but was instead seen as indicating
that there would be no reduction in rates - at least in the UK.
June continued to decline and fell further when there was no rate cut
announcement from the Bundesbank early in the afternoon.
The continued drift of the contract brought it to the day's low of 2,874 at
around 3.30pm, when it traded at a discount to the cash market.
The June contract ended at 2,878, down 11 from its previous close and at a
three-point premium to cash. Volume in the June future was 7,876 lots and in
the September contract 4,688.
In traded options, total turnover was 29,158, slightly below Wednesday's
figure. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,141 lots and the Euro FT-SE 1,844.

FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines unloaded for second
straight day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range yesterday, finishing slightly
higher as airline stocks took a battering for the second consecutive day,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.24 up at 3,521.89. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 put on 1.11 at 448.54, while the Nasdaq composite was a slight
0.31 easier at 695.94. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 239.8m
shares.
The mood of the markets remained clouded by uncertainty over the outlook for
the economy. Yesterday's economic news was mostly bearish for equities: the
April trade deficit widened to Dollars 10.49bn because exports fell amid a
weakening in overseas economies; weekly unemployment claims were unchanged;
and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported a sharp deterioration in local
business conditions.
Although the data cheered bond investors, stocks mostly remained stuck at
opening values. As well as the murky economic picture, equity markets have
to contend with uncertainty over President Bill Clinton's economic package,
which is currently undergoing a considerable overhaul as it makes its way
through Congress.
Among individual sectors, airlines were hammered after the second major
carrier in two days issued a warning about its quarterly earnings outlook.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, said second-quarter profits would come in
well below analysts' forecasts of Dollars 1 a share. At the same stage last
year AMR made a profit of Dollars 2.21 a share. After a delayed opening due
to an order imbalance, AMR dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/2 in volume
of 3.1m shares.
Other airline stocks tumbled: USAir, which on Wednesday issued its own
profits warning, fell a further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16, Delta declined
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 and UAL weakened Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars
121 1/2 .
Although Hewlett-Packard claimed that Wednesday's reports of a downbeat
earnings forecast from the company's chairman were a misrepresentation, the
stock continued to run into heavy selling, falling a further Dollars 2 3/8
to Dollars 81.
Other stocks in the technology sector were lower, with Digital Equipment
losing Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 40 3/4 and IBM Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 49
5/8 .
Pepsico continued to do well in spite of reports of syringes apparently
being discovered in cans and bottles of Pepsi. The shares rose Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 36 7/8 amid a growing belief among investors that the syringes
may be the work of hoaxers, rather than criminal product-tamperers.
On the Nasdaq market, Adobe Systems dropped Dollars 3 3/4 in the morning
after the company reported second-quarter earnings below Wall Street
forecasts, but rallied strongly later to end a net Dollars  3/8 up at
Dollars 69 3/8 .
Canada
TORONTO gained ground in active trading, the TSE 300 index closing 11.3
ahead at a 1993 high of 3,903.7. Rises outscored falls by 423 to 287 after
volume of 61.9m shares.
Ten of the 14 stock groups were higher, led by the paper and forestry group,
which gained 2.49 per cent. Mining, energy, golds and industrial products
were up, and consumer products and financial services were flat. Real estate
stocks fell 2.16 per cent.

FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentina fails to please an
international audience - A lack of vigour in Buenos Aires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina, recently, has disappointed international investors who expected
to profit from exposure to one of Latin America's new miracle economies.
After quintupling in 1991 the equity market dropped 48 per cent in the
second half of 1992; and 1993, so far, has given punters no cause for
celebration.
The Buenos Aires stock market's Merval index has dipped by 5 per cent this
year, yet the economy is expanding by 5 per cent, after 8.5 per cent growth
in 1992. Brokers, optimistic as ever, are predicting that the bear phase is
over. For once, they may be right.
They are hoping that the simultaneous flotation and partial privatisation on
July 8 of YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil giant, will kick-start the
equities market.
The government has earmarked a maximum of 35 per cent of YPF for the local
and international investment market. YPF is to be floated in Buenos Aires,
New York and London. Federal and local governments, pensioners and unions
will own the remaining 65 per cent of the equity.
The government, conscious of its responsibility for helping torpedo the
stock market last year with a viciously overpriced telecoms flotation, has
decided to float YPF at a relatively competitive price. Mr Domingo Cavallo,
the economy minister, aims to place YPF at only 10 times earnings. In
comparison, the market values Astra, a small independent oil producer, on a
p/e ratio of 11.
Enthusiastic brokers are saying YPF could well be oversubscribed. If all
goes well, a resurgent stock market would soon start attracting investors
and prices would recover.
However, a successful gamble on YPF is not going to solve all the market's
problems. Mr Pedro Lacoste, a partner of Alpha, a consulting firm, says:
'There are few companies that are in a good (market) sector, which have a
good management strategy, which are well run, with transparent accounts and
good dividend policies.'
He reckons that there are perhaps no more than five such stocks among the
market's actively traded companies. They include two privatised telephone
stocks, two banks and the textile company Alpargatas. Smaller, possibly more
interesting, companies are plagued by illiquidity.
This is why an increasing number of observers are saying that the future of
the market depends less on the performance of existing stocks and more on an
infusion of new blood. Low share prices have discouraged more than a handful
of companies from taking the plunge and going public, even though about 30
have already won regulatory approval for a listing. A strong performance by
YPF would help overcome their doubts and tempt them to enter the market.
Price and liquidity are not the only problems. Foreign investors also
complain bitterly about the lack of transparency in company accounts and
suspect even blue chip firms of concealing profits from minority
shareholders.
Then there is the problem of absorbing a huge overhang of shares bought by
highly leveraged players during the 1992 boom. These speculators, mostly
small investors, dump shares bought at the top of the market at any sign of
price recovery.
The most notorious victim is Telecom Argentina, the privatised telephone
company floated in 1992, whose share price nosedived by one-third soon after
its market debut. Telecom's dreadful performance helped bring last year's
bull run to a grinding halt. Another casualty is CIADEA, a car company which
makes Renault models under licence. Mr Manuel Antelo, CIADEA's president,
reckons his company is worth about USDollars 50 per share - against Dollars
27 now. Last year CIADEA shares were changing hands at above Dollars 70.
The narrow Buenos Aires market is highly susceptible to speculative plays by
a small clique of well-informed insiders. More listings are unlikely to make
much difference to this casino mentality.
Foreigners and locals alike say Argentina badly lacks strong institutional
investors such as insurance companies or investment funds to give the market
liquidity, breadth and stability. Government draft legislation, which would
introduce a private pension fund system, has been bogged down for almost a
year in Congress, where politicians are gradually watering down the original
proposals.

FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises despite
fears of early election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES moved within a narrow range on fears that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, may have to call a snap election, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
Late afternoon support by public funds, however, helped to prop up the
Nikkei average, which rose by 23.09 to 19,925.51 after a day's low of
19,647.42 and high of 19,950.01.
The index initially weakened on reports that opposition parties had
submitted a motion of no confidence against Mr Miyazawa. However, it
rebounded on buying by public funds, triggering index-linked demand from
investment trusts.
Volume fell to 300m shares from 368m. Declines led advances by 593 to 383,
with 173 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
6.55 at 1,593.59, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to
1,208.90.
The lower house will vote on the no confidence motion today and, if it is
passed, Mr Miyazawa must resign within 10 days or call a general election.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of international trade and industry, voiced
his concern yesterday over the current political situation. He acknowledged
that the recent fall in the stock market stemmed from political uncertainty,
adding that the business community was worried about the effect it might
have on the economy.
The political developments affected the yen as investors sold the Japanese
currency against the dollar, which closed Y0.65 firmer at Y107.
Leading exporters were higher on the yen's fall: Matsushita appreciated Y40
to Y1,250 and Honda Motor by Y20 to Y1,390. However, electric power
utilities were lower on the currency movements, with Tokyo Electric Power
retreating Y40 to Y3,690.
Foreigners took profits on bank holdings: Chugoku Bank receded Y90 to Y1,570
and Kita Nippon Bank dipped Y300 to Y5,600.
Communications were the day's top losers, falling 2.15 per cent. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone shed Y14,000 to Y905,000 on profit-taking.

Roundup
THERE WAS considerable activity among the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG ended sharply lower on disappointment over the lack of progress in
the Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index declined 115.73, or 1.6 per
cent, to 7,189.10 in moderate turnover of HKDollars 4.75bn.
Prices lost ground throughout the day, with the fall accelerated in the
afternoon by rumours that mainland companies might sell assets in Hong Kong
to repatriate funds and boost the yuan. The Chinese currency reached a low
of Yn10.9 to the US dollar on the Shanghai swap market.
Among the actives, new listing Shangri-la Asia closed at HKDollars 6.00, up
HKDollars 1.10 from the issue price, on its first day of trading. HSBC
relinquished HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 73.
KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly weaker, although light bargain hunting in the
last hour lifted prices from the day's lows. The composite index was finally
16.05, or 2.2 per cent, down at 720.46, the lowest level since May 17.
Some brokers said the market was undergoing a correction and that a further
retracement was likely after the bull run which had started in April.
Volume was 299.8m shares, against Wednesday's 385.9m.
SEOUL was higher for the second consecutive day, with buying interest
concentrated on low-priced shares. The composite index rose 3.28 to 762.54
in turnover of Won814.6bn.
TAIWAN finished lower on disappointment following comments from the central
bank that there would be no further easing in interest rates. The weighted
index fell 59.05, or 1.4 per cent, to 4,129.85 in turnover of TDollars
16.7bn.
MANILA saw bargain hunting lift the composite index 7.90 to 1,576.30 in
turnover of 105m pesos.
BANGKOK remained firm, the SET index moving forward 7.27 to 880.66 amid
turnover of Bt9.2bn.
Finance and securities firms led the gains in the afternoon, while property
stocks eased.
AUSTRALIA was led higher by gold issues and selected blue chips. The All
Ordinaries index ended 2.5 up at 1,727.2 in turnover of ADollars 279m, and
the gold shares index put on 26.1 at 1,743.2. Plutonic advanced 39 cents to
ADollars 5.40.
BOMBAY moved lower on the kerb on rumours that Prime Minister P V Narasimha
Rao may resign.
This followed allegations made by Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the
centre of the securities scandal, that he had made a Rs10m payment to Mr
Rao.
The BSE index closed 62.65 lower at 2,229.00.
KARACHI was higher, helped by strength in the car sector after the
government said it would review new taxes on vehicles. The KSE index rose
4.38 to 1,205.31.

FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatility attributed to
options expiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INACTION was expected from the Bundesbank, but the pending expiry of options
brought volatility to the German and Swiss equity markets, while France saw
a couple of weak profits forecasts, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose fractionally on the session but dropped later, after the
Bundesbank kept interest rates unchanged and in advance of the expiry of DTB
options contracts this morning. The DAX index, up 2.73 to 1,692.29 at the
official close, was indicated 10 points lower on the Ibis screen-based
trading system after hours.
Earlier, a gentle downtrend in most banks, and in Siemens, was offset by
strength in carmakers after Daimler's finance director forecast doubled net
profits in 1994 following a drop of a third in 1993. In London, brokers
James Capel, bearish of the shares, estimated that this put them on a 1992
p/e of 60.7 falling to 37.9 in 1994; more bullish, Mr Michael Geiger of
NatWest Securities put the ratios at 60.2, and 24.0 respectively.
Daimler moved from a rise of DM7.10 at the close to finish DM3.60 better at
DM606 after hours, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, and
other carmakers eased accordingly. Siemens was down DM5.70 to DM614.50 in
the post bourse, and Deutsche Bank DM5.90 lower at DM692.10.
Turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM5.4bn. Mr Longley noted that the DTB DAX
contracts expiry will be measured on the first quoted DAX index of today,
and forecast an interesting morning.
MILAN was encouraged on news, which came out after Wednesday's close, that
Ferruzzi creditor banks had agreed to support the group during its
restructuring process. The Comit index closed up 13.95 or 2.75 per cent at
521.96.
Ferruzzi and Montedison shares recovered by 14 per cent and 13 per cent
respectively, rising L68.00 to L562.80 and by L96 to L846.
Commenting on the announcement, one analyst in Milan said that the banks
would have a much bigger influence on the group than hitherto, with the
Ferruzzi family's responsibilities cut back. An early sale of Fondiaria is
to be expected, he said.
Among the banks, Mediobanca gained L500 to L15,200 and rose further to
L15,375 on the kerb; BCI rose L191 to L5,090 and Credito Italiano by L160 to
L2,690.
There was strong activity in Fiat, up L330 at L5,720, on a variety of
rumours, while the telecoms stocks, strong in recent weeks, eased, Stet
losing L85 to L3,180.
ZURICH advanced by 1.3 per cent, the SMI index closing 29.1 higher at
2,323.1, a tenth of a point below its all-time high.
Nestle, and Roche certificates surged in active late trade. gaining SFr17 to
SFr1,123, and SFr110 to SFr4,830 respectively. Dealers said that the late
upturn could be related to tomorrow's expiry of contracts on the Soffex
options and futures exchange.
PARIS came off the day's high but just held the 1,900 level, the CAC-40
index ending 18.50 lower at 1,900.31. Turnover also slipped, to FFr2.8bn
from Wednesday's FFr3.3bn.
Havas featured with a fall of FFr11.40 to FFr414.10 after Mr Pierre Dauzier,
the chairman, downgraded 1993 profit forecasts and warned, in addition, that
1994 may not bring much relief.
Further evidence of the worsening economic picture was given by St Gobain,
off FFr12.10 to FFr476.70. In a letter to shareholders, the group forecast a
bad first half, said that 1993 will be even worse than 1992, and warned that
further job cuts might be necessary.
Docks de France built on Wednesday's gains following news of an acquisition,
rising FFr17 to FFr498.
ISTANBUL put on another 2.7 per cent as coalition talks between the True
Path party and the Populist Party made progress. The market index gained
261.8 to 9,921.97 in turnover estimated at TL1,000bn.
TEL AVIV dropped after two days of gains on renewed fears of a tax on stock
market profits. The Mishtanim index lost 3.9 to 200.28.
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said on Tuesday that there would
be no capital gains tax imposed on stock profits in the near future; but an
influential Israeli newspaper reported yesterday that the finance ministry
was still considering this option.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Day for rate bears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for cuts in short-term rates in the UK and Germany dampened
yesterday following another set of very good British economic indicators and
a decision from the Bundesbank to leave its official rates unchanged, writes
James Blitz.
For most dealers the Bundesbank's decision was the focus of the day. But the
biggest price action yesterday was in short sterling interest rate futures,
which fell back very sharply at the front end, reflecting a growing view
that base rates will remain unchanged this year.
The trigger for the setback in sterling futures was a very surprising set of
jobless figures, showing a net drop of 26,100 on the month when a 7,000 rise
had been expected. This was the fourth successive drop in unemployment and
another sign that the government was under no pressure to ease monetary
policy.
The news led to a sharp fall in the September contract from 94.25 to 94.14.
The contract moved down further to close at 94.11 after the Bundesbank left
policy unchanged.
However, rate cut bulls could find some pickings in the late 1994 contracts,
which rose yesterday after the retail price index came in as expected at 1.3
per cent for May.
The news on inflation led to a substantial advance in the gilt-edged market
and this helped the June 1994 contract to record a rise of 4 basis points on
the day at 93.79, as dealers took the view that a sharp upward movement in
interest rates might not be needed to prevent the economy overheating.
The cash market was less volatile, with three-month money rising  1/16
percentage point on the day to 5 15/16 per cent. The Bank of England
appeared highly accommod-ative in the removal of a Pounds 1bn daily
shortage, offering a repo in the early round.
The Bank may have wanted to compensate for the upward slope in rates later
in the day. But one dealer dared to wonder yesterday whether a 25
basis-point cut in base rates might be in the offing, as sterling closed at
DM2.51.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its official rates unchanged was a source
of disappointment although, in the absence of the M3 money supply figures
for May, the reasoning was hard to divine. The September Euromark contract
slipped back 2 basis points to close at 93.25.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: German rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS continued to speculate that the dollar could break through important
new levels against the D-Mark yesterday, despite a host of data and events
that ought to have softened the US currency a great deal, writes James
Blitz.
The Bundesbank surprised some market participants by keeping its official
interest rates on hold yesterday. But that did not stop the dollar rising
1/2 pfennig in the wake of the news, to peak at DM1.6650 against the German
currency.
Later, in early US trading, the dollar lost much ground against the D-Mark
after the release of poorer than expected US economic data.
The US trade deficit grew to Dollars 10.49bn in April, its biggest total for
more than four years. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of business
activity also showed signs of stagnation in the economy, with the index
falling to minus 6.5 per cent in June from plus 11.3 per cent in May.
Nevertheless, the dollar was not swayed too far off course by this data,
ending only  1/4 pfennig down on the day at DM1.6555. In New York it later
rallied to close at DM1.6594. 'The dollar is still on track for a convincing
break through the DM1.67 level,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency
strategist at Citibank in London. 'The market is taking a positive view
towards the dollar, as is the fund manager community.' He believes that if
the dollar/D-Mark rate closes at or above DM1.67, that will be followed by a
strong push up to DM1.80.
The dissenters from this view remain strong. Mr Marc Hendricks, an economist
at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, said the dollar would remain under
pressure from weak economic data in the US. But he acknowledged, too, that
the German currency was facing significant weakness. 'If the dollar is to
break through to new ranges, then it will have to happen now,' he said.
Trading in European currencies was dominated by the growing weakness of the
D-Mark, which fell to minus 25 against its divergence indicator in the
European exchange rate mechanism. This is the lowest level that it has been
at in the recent cycle of weakness.
The German currency was softer against the French franc for much of the day,
but finished unchanged at FFr3.361. The Italian lira closed a little firmer
at L908.4 per D-Mark from a previous L908.6.
Sterling was the strongest performer against the German currency yesterday,
helped by indications that the UK economy was recovering. The pound rose 1
1/4 pfennigs immediately following the release of figures showing the fourth
successive monthly drop in UK unemployment and inflation staying at a
29-year low. It closed at DM2.5100, an increase of 1 1/2 pfennigs on the
day.
The yen softened against the dollar yesterday amid speculation that Japan
could be thrown into a new political crisis. It closed at Y106.65 from a
previous Y106.60, and finished at Y107.27 in New York.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bleak outlook seen for New
Zealand's kiwi fruit growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR the New Zealand kiwi fruit industry are bleak and questions
need to be asked to establish whether it has any future at all, the Ministry
of Agriculture says in its annual report - The Outlook for New Zealand
Agriculture.
The report notes that in the 1992 season returns from kiwi fruit fell to a
record low of NZDollars 3.85 (Pounds 1.40) a tray, and this led to the sole
supplier, the Kiwifruit Marketing Board running up a debt of NZDollars 85m
because of its inability to sell its total export crop.
New Zealand successfully developed kiwi fruit as an international commodity,
turning it into an industry with NZDollars 1bn worth of exports in 1991.
That fell to about NZDollars 500m last year. The report notes that New
Zealand is now competing with soaring production from Italy, now the world's
biggest producer, as well as supplies from France and Chile.
The report says New Zealand's kiwi fruit production will fall by about 25
per cent this season as restructuring continues and growers remove vines. It
says the international outlook is poor, with supplies of the fruit rising
and no increase in demand.
However the ministry believes that New Zealand will be best be served in its
international marketing by the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, rather than by
individual marketers. It says abolishing the debt ridden board and returning
to multiple marketing will cost the industry even more, adding that one
disastrous season is not a good basis for making a change.
The report shows that New Zealand's gross agricultural production rose by
nearly 8 per cent in the year to March 1993 to about NZDollars 9.7b. Total
farm output rose by 8 per cent in 1992-93 and further growth of 4 per cent
is expected in the year to June 1994.
Commenting on the report, Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, said
the achievement in the past year was significant as agriculture had had a
difficult year. He thought the outlook was promising in view of the
country's increasing competitiveness.
The report says prospects for dairy and sheepmeat exports are good, while
for venison, wine and well-organised horticultural products they were
encouraging.
Not so good, however, is the short term outlook for wool, with prices and
demand down and the Wool Board still holding 360,000 bales. The ministry
says that recovery in world economic growth is needed for there to be any
significant upturn in the wool market.
It sees better prospects for sheepmeat, with lamb prices in Europe higher.
Payments for all grades of lamb will rise by more than 25 per cent a head
this season, it estimates. The report warns, however, that sheep numbers in
Europe are increasing.
It says the outlook is good for all dairy products, except butter, where
prices are likely to remain depressed.
Export returns from deer products, such as venison and antler velvet, in
demand in Asia as a supposed sexual stimulant, continue to rise and prices
are expected to remain stable.
New Zealand pigmeat production rose 10 per cent, reflecting lower feed
costs, the ministry says. Chicken's share of the domestic food market rose
from 14.5 to 20 per cent. The country's beef cattle herd rose 1.7 per cent
to 4.75m, and is expected to continue growing over the next two years.

PALLADIUM hit its fourth 38-month high fixing since June 10 at Dollars
128.50 a troy ounce yesterday afternoon on the London bullion market. The
rise was based on tight supply, steady physical off-take and strong charts,
dealers and analysts said. They are now looking to Dollars 130 in the short
term with Dollars 140 pencilled in as a medium term target. Prices have
increased by around 35 per cent from around Dollars 95 in early December,
analysts said. 'Physical demand has been generally good for several months,
especially from Japan and the US but palladium is now finding a bit of
speculative interest coming in,' one dealer said. Meanwhile dealers deemed
Russian sales to the market as 'orderly.' Other precious metals remained in
relatively tight ranges. But on New York's Comex GOLD futures were higher in
late trading after local traders succeeded in triggering buy stop orders
above Dollars 372 a troy ounce for the August contract. On the LME TIN
continued to recover from its recent slide to 20-year lows, although market
sentiment remained shaky, as all the signs were that producers would boost
exports. Three-month metal closed at Dollars 5,142.50 a tonne, up Dollars
30.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT aims to boost its
international appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PATRICK Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade said late on
Wednesday that the exchange would develop more commodity products with
international appeal and proceed with a Dollars 9.3m project to upgrade its
financial futures trading floor.
Citing the need to expand the market for the CBoT's agricultural products,
Mr Arbor praised the exchange's decision to open its cereals and soya
products an hour earlier, beginning July 6. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange
and the Kansas City Board of Trade will also adopt the 8.30 am CDT opening,
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this week said it would shift its
livestock futures openings to 8.25 am.
'This exchange has at times been criticised as being stodgy, reluctant to
change,' Mr Arbor told members in a mid-term address. 'However, the members
of this exchange have proven the critics wrong by voting for an earlier
ag(ricultural futures) opening. And I intend for us to prove the critics
wrong again by redesigning our ag contracts to better meet the needs of
customers the world over.'
Being more specific, the chairman said the CBoT would launch its
international edible oils index contract in the first quarter of 1994, and
that contracts on soyabeans and canola (oilseed rape) with Rotterdam
delivery are under development. The exchange is also planning to dust off
and revise a futures contract on plywood, in a bid to capitalise on
volatility in US wood prices.
Noting that 81 per cent of the exchange's volume was now comprised of
financial futures and options, Mr Arbor encouraged all the exchange's
members to support the Dollars 9.3m interim plan to upgrade the financial
futures trading floor.
CBoT members who trade agricultural products have their own trading floor
and some have resisted expenditures to renovate the financials floor. The
upgrade will relieve trading congestion until the exchange can construct a
badly-needed new trading facility. Mr Arbor said he would present members
with a plan for a new building in four to six weeks.
Noting that the CBoT's share of world futures markets had dropped to 20.6
per cent from 21.5 per cent last year, he said the new building was
necessary to keep the exchange competitive. 'If we don't build a new trading
facility, we will remain the world's oldest futures exchange, but we might
not remain the largest,' he said.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York exchange makes time
for night shift - The launch of an after-hours electronic trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy market,
launches its after-hours electronic trading system next Thursday it will
bring something novel to the crowded field of computer markets. Instead of
flashing bids and offers for securities, Nymex's Access screens will list a
unique menu of commodity derivatives.
Access (an acronym for American computerised commodity exchange system and
services) will initially offer futures and options on Nymex crude oil,
heating oil and New York Harbor unleaded gasoline and platinum futures.
Operating from 5.00 pm to 8.00 am (New York time), Sunday to Thursday, the
system will intensify competition between the New York products and those
traded on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
The energy markets in New York and London already compete head-to-head. The
IPE's regular trading day is a marathon 11 hours, overlapping with Nymex's
8.20 am to 3.10 pm floor session. Mr Patrick Thompson, the Nymex president,
dismisses suggestions that Access will draw business away from the IPE. He
says both markets could see volume increase if arbitrage between their
respective contracts expands.
A crucial factor in the success of Access is whether there is
round-the-clock demand for commodity derivatives. Computer-traded financial
derivatives like Eurodollars and foreign exchange have continuous cash
markets. Spot trading in commodities is usually specific to one time zone,
with traders rarely 'passing the book' across continents overnight. Pricing
futures and options without a 'live' spot market is treacherous, traders
acknowledge.
Most of Nymex's cash market trades in Texas, during US business hours.
Ironically, the night computer session covers Asian business hours - a slow
period for energy trading - but misses an important chunk of the busy US
spot trading day. Nymex officials say they are working to narrow the gap
between the 3.10 pm trading floor close and the 5.00 pm Access opening, at
the behest of Houston, Texas, and US west coast oil traders.
The Access launch comes just a year after a partnership between the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters turned on
Globex, an elaborate overnight electronic trading system with global
ambitions for derivative products. Globex lists financial products from the
two Chicago exchanges and the French futures exchange, Matif. Globex trading
has been sluggish, boosted only recently by local interest in Matif products
in France.
For now, Access and Globex have no competing products, and many US brokerage
houses will operate Globex and Access terminals side-by-side. Having Globex
pioneer the process was useful for Nymex. 'We watched very carefully what
happened to Globex. We watched every pot hole they stepped in, regulatory
and technical, and tried to avoid it,' says Mr Thompson.
Nymex officials say their strategy for Access is much more modest than
Globex. 'We aren't traveling around the globe trying to sign up other
exchanges,' says Mr Thompson. Access terminals will be installed only in the
US, although the exchange has had sufficient interest from London to seek
regulatory approval to put Access work stations there.
Volume ambitions are also modest. A Dollars 20m system, Access was developed
in partnership with AT &amp; T, the giant American telephone company, and the
Chicago software firm, Task Management. Nymex has guaranteed AT &amp; T
substantial revenue from Access, though officials decline to name the
amount. Market observers estimate that it would have to trade about 8,000
contracts a night to meet the guarantee, though Access officials say they
will be satisfied with a nightly turnover of 1,000 to 1,500 contracts in the
first year.
Partly because of the financial pressures, Nymex hopes to open Access as a
sort of daytime bulletin board for low volume products and cash derivatives,
like natural gas swaps, sometime next year.
Long-term plans for Access are much less modest. Mr Thompson expects the
system to have international penetration within three years, and nightly
volume of over 15,000 contracts. If the Nymex's proposed merger with the New
York Commodity Exchange goes ahead Comex's precious metals contracts would
quickly be listed on Access.
While Nymex officials are playing down the plans, direct challenges to
Globex financial products are also in the works. Negotiations are under way
with Finex (an arm of the New York Cotton Exchange) to list its dollar index
future, and with Simex, the Singapore futures exchange, to list its energy
and financial products, including its growing franchise in Eurodollar
futures.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana regime faces European
Court challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's controversial new regime for banana imports could
be suspended if complaints by Germany are upheld by the European Court of
Justice, which hears the case today in Luxembourg.
A judgment may take another 10 days, but will have to be reached before July
1, when the new quota and tariff system comes into effect.
The new regime, agreed in February after almost five years of wrangling,
sets a quota of 2m tonnes on cheap Latin American banana imports. This quota
would attract a uniform duty of 20 per cent, but imports above this level
face a tariff of Ecu850 (Pounds 670) a tonne, or roughly 170 per cent.
The Latin American exporters have already had a challenge to the current
regime upheld by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and yesterday
got the Gatt to set up a panel to investigate the new regime.
The new regime's object is to set up a single market for bananas now that EC
border controls have gone; to meet Uruguay Round requirements for tariffs on
all farm produce, which then can gradually be reduced; and to protect the
EC's traditional but high-cost suppliers in its outlying territories and
former colonies.
Germany previously had no duty on bananas, and in 1991 consumed more than
half of the 2.4m tonnes of so-called 'dollar bananas' from Latin America,
which dominate the 3.7m tonnes EC market. Supported by Belgium and the
Netherlands, Bonn sought to block the regime in February but was outvoted.
The European Commission and the majority of the member states say the EC is
bound by undertakings in the Lome Convention with 69 African, Caribbean and
Pacific states to protect their banana industries. Officials in Brussels
were confident yesterday that the court would uphold this treaty
undertaking.
But Germany says it is protected by a 'banana protocol' in the EC's Treaty
of Rome, guaranteeing it unimpeded access to the fruit. German banana
importers, who have launched a separate legal action, claim they stand to
lose half their business, because 30 per cent of dollar fruit import
licences will be allocated to traditional importers from the ACP countries.
Mr Gerrit Schohe, a lawyer for the German importers, describes this as
'public intervention to shift market share'. The damage will be irreparable,
all opponents of the regime argue, and they are asking the court to suspend
it.
Mr Schohe says the Court's suspension last year of Germany's unilaterally
introduced road user charges on foreign trucks, in part because they would
irreversibly redistribute market share in the road haulage industry, offers
the complainant importers their most hopeful precedent.
If the regime were suspended, some officials in Brussels fear, not only
chaos in the banana market would result. A failure to set tariffs on bananas
could complicate the Uruguay Round outcome, one said, providing an argument
for Japan to take its rice out of the tariffs package.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US soya prices leap as rain
holds up planting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOYABEAN FUTURES prices at the Chicago Board of Trade exploded yesterday as
rain continued to delay plantings in important midwest growing regions and
talk of strengthening export sales inspired buyers.
The November delivery position hit Dollars 6.03 a bushel, and was up 17 3/4
cents at Dollars 5.99 at the close of trading. November delivery reflects
prices for the new crop harvest. Futures for July delivery were up 15 1/4
cents at Dollars 6.01 1/4 .
Statistics released earlier this week showed soyabean planting in Iowa, the
second largest soyabean producing state after Illinois, was well behind
annual averages. Only 60 per cent of the planned area had been planted and
continuing rains this week have led traders to conclude the 3.5m unseeded
acres will not produce high-quality beans once they are planted.
Forecasts for another three to six inches of rain in the key soyabean
growing regions by Saturday helped prices to move higher.
Mr Dick Lowey, soyabean analyst for Chicago-based AgResouces, said that
acreage not planted by the first week in July would suffer low yields.
'Traders are beginning to realise that the old adage 'rain makes grain' does
not apply here,' he said. 'We may be looking at severe acreage loss on one
hand, and if the ground gets planted, we could see a dramatic loss in
yields.'
Analysts were busy reducing yield estimates for the new crop, and with them
the surplus from next year's crop. The US Department of Agriculture has
forecast that 310m bushels of the last US soyabean crop will remain in
storage after exports and domestic use at the end of the crop year. Next
year, analysts put the carry-over at a meagre 210m bushels.
On a 2.2bn bushel crop, 'that doesn't leave much room for serious crop
problems in July and August,' one soyabean trader noted.
Traders rarely factor a weather premium into soyabean prices this early in
the season. However, international trends are at work. Three weeks of
flooding in soyabean growing regions of Argentina have caused private
forecasters to drop their crop estimates there to 10m tonnes, from the
official 11.4m-tonne forecast. The Argentine rains could also result in poor
crop quality and a delayed harvest.
Traders expected an export sales report to be released after the market
closed Thursday to show additional US sales to Europe. 'This is export
business we haven't counted on,' said Mr Lowey. 'We didn't expect any
European sales for the next eight weeks.'
Brazil, which has usually begun new crop soya exports by this time, has been
watching the Argentine situation and might play it to advantage, analysts
said. 'Brazil doesn't seem compelled to market its crop as quickly this
year. Farmers are receiving better subsidies, and will wait until prices
rise,' one trader explained.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Long gilts surge as UK inflation stays at
33-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-DATED UK government bonds shot ahead yesterday on a combination of
encouraging inflation data and the yield attractions for overseas investors.
The benchmark 25-year gilt lifted  13/16 to 103 3/4 and dragged up the other
long-dated maturities. Investors were inspired by the latest economic data
showing retail inflation at its lowest for 33 years.
However, it was a different story for short-dated gilts as the announcement
of the latest unemployment figures pushed back hopes of an interest rate
cut. The market had expected a reversal of the recent encouraging trend, and
was presented with a fall of 26,000 in the month-on-month jobless level.
The latest figure prompted investors to sell short-dated bonds and move out
along the yield curve, which continued to flatten out. Since the beginning
of the year, long gilt yields have fallen by around half a percentage point,
while the short end has eased by only 20 to 40 basis points. This reflects
the growing optimism for low inflation and the international perception of
sterling's attractions.
Economists said the UK offered the highest yield for very long-dated issues.
They were sufficiently liquid to trade viably and 'duration' was
increasingly the buzz word as investors moved to long-dated issues for the
high returns.
There are widely-held expectations of a gilts auction announcement today,
probably of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 3.5bn of stock in the 2000-2003
maturity range, but possibly with a longer maturity considering the current
trend.
FRENCH government bond trading was enlivened by continuing interest rate cut
optimism and a well-received auction.
A belief that France will once again reduce short-term lending rates
independently of Germany enabled dealers to shrug off any disappointment at
the Bundesbank's inaction yesterday. Consequently, the yield curve steepened
with two-year maturities firming slightly and the longer maturities easing.
Dealers said an auction for FFr16.4bn of two-year and five-year paper
yesterday was 'very aggressively bid'. There were FFr8.4bn of two-year bonds
on offer, against FFr37bn of bids, and the auction for five-year paper was
covered more than 3.5 times.
GERMAN government bonds fell after the Bundesbank failed to cut its key
interest rates. However, hopes had already been eroded before the close of
dealing on Wednesday. Yesterday's reaction was perhaps more a petulant
gesture than a heart-felt reaction.
There was also an acknowledgment that the continuing strength of the dollar
against the D-Mark had tied the Bundesbank's hands and rendered unfeasible a
reduction in the Lombard and discount rates.
On Liffe, September bunds ended the day only 7 basis points lower, at 94.83,
with turnover relatively thin at 53,500 contracts.
SPANISH government bonds saw early gains, but ticked back later on
disappointment that the Bundesbank did not ease. Ten-year bond futures on
the Meff traded as high as 91.50 at one stage, as Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
prime minister, offered Catalonia's main nationalist party a place in a
coalition government, thus easing worries of political in-fighting.
However, the contract slipped back to close only 9 basis points higher at
91.24.
US Treasury prices firmed at the long end in the wake of a downbeat report
on economic conditions from the Phila-delphia Federal Reserve.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 104
3/32 , yielding 6.799 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent.
Buying of longer-dated securities by both retail and dealer accounts was
sparked by the Philadelphia Fed's report that business activity in its
region declined sharply in June. The report indicated that the economy had
slowed significantly from the end of 1992.
The day's other economic data was also broadly bullish for bonds. Weekly
unemployment claims were unchanged and the April trade deficit widened to
Dollars 10.49bn, a substantially larger trade gap than expected. The
widening in the deficit reflects the weakness of overseas economies, which
means the US economy can not rely on expanding exports as a source of growth
over the year.

THE Mexican government is to sell 70 per cent of Aseguradora Mexicana
(Asemex), the state insurance group, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
An initial package of 2.55m 'A' shares, 51 per cent of the insurer's equity,
is to be sold into the private sector. A further 19 per cent is to be
offered as an option to whoever wins the first tranche of shares.
The finance ministry said the government would retain a minority 30 per cent
stake in the company.
Parties interested in buying Asemex would be required to deposit 75m new
pesos in Mexican treasury bills, known as Cetes. Bids have to be in by
September 10 and the result of the auction will be announced by September
27.
Foreign investors can not hold more than 30 per cent of Asemex.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Lively trade welcomes new
Matif contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FUTURES contract for five-year French government bonds began trading
yesterday on the Matif, the French futures exchange. The move follows the
recent launch of two five-year contracts: a German government bond (BOBL)
contract on Liffe in London and an Italian government bond (BTP) contract on
Italy's Mif.
The bond contract, established to allow dealers to trade against its German
equivalent as well as five-year underlying French bonds, saw some lively
business, with around 6,800 lots dealt by the close of official business.
Although volume was well below that of the comparable German contract,
dealers said it was a healthy beginning.
The Matif already lists a three-month Pibor interest rate contract, a seven
to 10-year bond contract, and a 15 to 30-year bond contract. However, the
30-year contract, launched on January 28, is hardly traded.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: China steps up efforts to
clear bonds backlog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has intensified its campaign to rid itself of a large backlog of
unsold treasury bonds after initial attempts to interest the public in a
Yuan30bn (Dollars 5.2bn) issue met with limited response.
China's State Council, or cabinet, this week urged provincial governments to
redouble their efforts to clear the backlog. It also repeated its ruling
banning localities from issuing securities, including equities and debt,
before quotas of state treasury bills were sold.
The latest instruction to provinces follows a disappointing public response
to a decision taken in May to raise interest rates on three- and five-year
treasury bills by 2.5 per cent to 12.52 per cent and by 3 per cent to 14.06
per cent respectively.
China's finance ministry reports that only Yuan8.3bn, or 28 per cent of the
total treasury bonds on offer, was sold by the end of May.
'The target for state bonds must be met, as funds raised from the bonds will
be used mainly for the construction of key state projects . . . and had been
included in the 1993 state budget,' an official said.
With inflation running in China's larger cities at around 20 per cent, and
with investors attracted by the prospect of speculative gains from China's
fledgling stock markets, government paper has held little appeal.
The weakness of the yuan is another factor against bond sales. The yuan has
depreciated against the US dollar by more than 40 per cent in the past year
or so, prompting a rush to buy dollars on the black market. People have also
been buying gold as a hedge against the depreciating yuan.
China's efforts to establish a free market in treasury bills by ending
compulsory purchase requirements for individuals and enterprises in 1991
appears to have suffered a setback. Pension funds are now being obliged to
buy bonds. Private businesses are also being pressured to do so.
Mr Liu Zhongli, the finance minister, is planning to go on television to
urge citizens to buy bonds as part of their contribution to China's
development.
He said China was considering an overhaul of its system of distributing
bonds, which at the moment relies on a fairly unsophisticated system of
underwriting. It also planned to devote more effort to marketing new issues
and would adopt a system of public auction in due course.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Forte leads action with Pounds 100m,
10-year deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurosterling sector of the international bond market saw plenty of
action yesterday, with three substantial offerings: from Forte, WestLB
Finance Curacao, and Bayerische Landesbank. Borrowers were keen to exploit
the strong demand from investors for sterling-denominated paper, especially
on the back of yesterday's inflation and unemployment figures.
Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, launched a Pounds 100m, 10-year
deal intended to help lengthen the group's maturity profile. The proceeds
were swapped into floating-rate sterling, substantially reducing the cost of
borrowing.
Mr Morris Grossfeld, group treasurer, said Forte's recent borrowings in the
international bond markets would be used to help pay off an existing Pounds
350m syndicated loan and a Dollars 200m Eurobond issue, both maturing in
1994.
'Our plan was to lengthen our debt maturity and the 10-year area was the
maturity we were missing,' Mr Grossfeld said. Forte recently launched a
Pounds 90m, 15-year convertible bond issue and a Pounds 200m, 25-year bond
issue.
The 10-year bonds were launched at a yield spread of 135 basis points over
the gilt, tightening to 133 basis points. Bond market participants said the
group's credit rating of A-/BAA1 was not especially attractive, but pointed
out that there was good demand for 10-year Eurosterling paper at the moment.
The deal was bought mainly by UK institutions, although Samuel Montagu,
joint-bookrunner with JP Morgan, said European investors looking for a good
yield spread over gilts had bought paper.
In the Eurodollar sector, City of Yokohama launched a Dollars 190m, 10-year
deal. The bonds were launched at a yield spread of 29 basis points over the
US Treasury bond, which the lead manager said was in line with a recent
offering from City of Kobe. The proceeds were swapped into fixed-rate yen.
A Dollars 50m Eurobond from Banco Itamarati of Brazil attracted some
attention as it coincided with the announcement of changes to the
withholding tax rules applying to Brazilian Eurobonds.
Dealers said Brazil had increased the minimum maturity period for Eurobond
withholding tax exemption to 36 months from 30 months. The change affects
fixed- and floating-rate notes and certificates of deposit.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: American Airlines warning
depresses shares in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in the US airline sector fell heavily yesterday after American
Airlines, one of the nation's 'big three' carriers, warned that
second-quarter earnings would be 'significantly' below market expectations.
Most analysts had been predicting a small profit - perhaps Dollars 75m - in
the three-month period to end-June. This would have represented a
significant improvement on the same period of 1992, when AMR, American
Airlines' parent company, made an after-tax loss of Dollars 166m.
Even excluding one-off charges from this figure still left last year with an
underlying Dollars 48m deficit.
Yesterday, however, American said that it had experienced slightly
lower-than-anticipated traffic in May, and found that this trend was
continuing into June. 'International performance continues to be very weak,'
added the carrier. 'Yields are consistent with prior assumptions, so they
are not offsetting the updated lower traffic estimates.'
American's warning comes one day after USAir, the smaller US carrier in
which British Airways holds a minority stake, warned that it would show
after-tax losses for both the second quarter and for 1993 overall.
Earlier this year, there had been hopes that the heavily loss-making airline
sector was finally turning the corner, and airline shares took the latest
news badly.
AMR fell Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/2, Delta lost Dollars 1 3/4 at
Dollars 48 1/8, and UAL, parent of Chicago-based United Airlines, shed
Dollars 5 1/4 at Dollars 121 1/2 at the close. USAir, which had suffered on
Wednesday, fell a further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: HK alters exchange listing rules

<TEXT>
HONG KONG yesterday moved closer to securing its role as one of China's most
important financial centres when the British colony's stock exchange
released a package of amendments to its listing requirements, paving the way
for the flotation of nine Chinese state companies over the coming 12 months.
The publication of the amendments, which are designed to enable the nine to
list while seeking to protect the interests of minority shareholders, comes
ahead of the signing in Beijing tomorrow of a 'memorandum of regulatory
co-operation' between Hong Kong and Chinese securities market regulators.
The memorandum will embody a set of principles for the regulation of
securities markets on the mainland, including a commitment to the operation
of fair, orderly and efficient markets which are informed by the timely
disclosure of material information.
The agreement between the Hong Kong stock exchange, the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, and the two regulatory authorities - the China
Securities Regulation Commission and the Securities and Futures Commission
of Hong Kong - marks a significant development in co-operation between the
colony and China,
The amendments will allow the nine to issue a minimum of 10 per cent of
their shares - denominated in yuan, quoted in Hong Kong dollars, and defined
as 'H' shares - for quotation on the Hong Kong exchange. Up to 15 per cent
of a company's equity will be listed on one of China's two exchanges in 'A'
shares.
To strengthen investor protection, the nine will report results according to
western standards; appoint at least two independent directors; and retain a
foreign investment adviser for three years.
Mr Robert Nottle, chairman of the SFC, said that the distinct markets for
'A' and 'H' shares presented 'novel regulatory issues' for Hong Kong.
Once listed, a mainland company would come under the jurisdiction of
relevant Hong Kong laws and non-statutory requirements, Mr Nottle said.
Hang Seng Bank, which is controlled by HSBC Holdings, yesterday appointed Mr
Alexander Au as its chief executive officer with effect from October 1,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Au is the bank's managing director and
deputy chief executive officer.

<TEXT>
HOLLINGER, the Canadian holding company for Mr Conrad Black's international
publishing interests, is considering offering shares to the public in its US
newspaper chain, as well as one of its Canadian subsidiaries.
Mr Black also told Hollinger's annual meeting yesterday that the 68 per
cent-owned Telegraph group is hoping that the Australian government will
lift its limit on its ownership of John Fairfax Holdings beyond the present
25 per cent ceiling. The Telegraph recently boosted its stake in Fairfax
from the previous limit of 15 per cent to 24 per cent.
Mr Black said that Hollinger may spin off up to a third of its stakes in
American Publishing Company and UniMedia.
He said the 'real value' of these companies had not been reflected in
Hollinger's share price, and that 'the best way of doing this is through a
share offering.'
Although Mr Black said that his faith in newspapers remains undiminished, he
raised the possibility of Hollinger broadening its base to include more
technologically advanced types of media.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Earnings plummet at Japanese
brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE brokerages yesterday reported a sharp fall in consolidated earnings
generally in line with their poor parent company results, while Kokusai
Securities, a medium-sized broker, announced that it would close a
Singaporean subsidiary today.
The decision by Kokusai to close Kokusai Singapore Merchant Banking, which
reported a pre-tax loss of Y127m (Dollars 1.2m) last year, reflected the
attempts of most of the securities houses to reduce their costs.
Kokusai has already closed offices in Geneva, Vienna and Frankfurt.
Each of the 'Big Four' houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities - turned in bleak consolidated results
for the year ended in March.
The companies blamed the results on weak turnover and prices on the Tokyo
stock market.
Nomura announced an 87.7 per cent decline in net profit to Y3.6bn.
Daiwa had a particularly bad year, reporting a pre-tax loss of Y6.5bn,
compared with a profit of Y20.3bn in the previous year.
While Nomura's revenue fell 12.2 per cent, Daiwa's revenue slumped 27 per
cent.
Nikko reported a pre-tax profit of Y1.9bn, down 77 per cent, and a net loss
of Y8.1bn, which was an improvement on the Y26.7bn loss of a year earlier.
Yamaichi reported another large pre-tax loss of Y32.6bn, compared with
Y30.5bn in the previous year, but managed to reduce its net loss to Y42.3bn
from Y51.9bn.
Its revenue during the year fell 19.6 per cent to Y267.8bn.
The poor results highlight the pressure on Japanese houses to cut costs and
streamline or close unprofitable operations. The pressure is particularly
acute on the second-tier brokerages, which rapidly expanded their operations
during the bubble years of the late 1980s.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: New Daf truck companies see
profitability this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the Dutch and UK truck-making companies formed out of DAF, which went
into receivership earlier this year, yesterday asserted that they would be
profitable this year with a combined production of 12,000-12,500 vehicles.
Daf Trucks NV, formed on March 2 with Pounds 370m (Dollars 555m) in equity
and loan backing from the Dutch and Flemish regional governments, banks and
institutional investors, expected to capture around 7 per cent of the west
European truck market, said Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the new Dutch-based
company.
Mr Baan, who acknowledged that 'some very hard lessons' had been learnt from
the problems of the old Daf group, said his company faced a viable future as
a producer of around 10,000 heavy trucks annually. He expected an annual
turnover of some Pounds 740m a year, once normal trading had been
re-established. This year it expected to sell 7,500-8,000 trucks, although
about 1,000 of these would be from existing stocks.
These output and sales projections are less than half the peaks achieved by
Daf in the late 1980s. However, it now has only half its previous Dutch and
Belgian workforce of 6,500.
The projections exclude production from Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the
new name for the former Leyland Daf truck-making subsidiary. The UK company
was bought from the UK receivers last week by a management team led by chief
executive Mr John Gilchrist.
Mr Gilchrist, who refused yesterday to disclose either the price paid for
the company or the structure of its shareholdings, said the new Leyland
company expected to produce 5,500 trucks this year, rising to 8,000 a year
in 1995.
Most of these are expected to be the medium-weight 45 Series truck, of which
up to 6,000 a year were being sold through Daf dealers on mainland Europe
prior to the receiverships.
Following last week's management buy-out, the Dutch and British companies
said yesterday they had signed a long-term contract under which the
Leyland-built trucks would continue to be sold through 'new' Daf's
continental outlets.
Mr Baan acknowledged that Daf had lost an undisclosed number of mainland
dealers. However, he insisted that Daf had not been badly hit, and in any
case needed fewer dealers because vans had been deleted from its product
line-up.
'Only a minority have stepped over to other makes, especially Iveco and
Renault,' Mr Baan said.
The UK dealer network has fallen by only seven outlets - to 118 from 125 -
despite 'transfer fees' being offered by rival manufacturers, according to
Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf Trucks, the company which
will control the UK sales and marketing of both manufacturers.
This company was acquired by the Dutch group last week, and will market and
sell both the Leyland and mainland-built trucks through the UK dealer
network.
The steep fall in UK truck demand in 1990 was held largely responsible for
the collapse of the old Daf group, as the UK had been accounting for 40 per
cent of all sales. Mr Gill forecast yesterday that the market would grow
this year by between 5 per cent and 9 per cent from last year's 31,400
trucks.
He said Leyland Daf's share would recover from its current 18 per cent level
to nearer the more than 23 per cent it held last year.

<TEXT>
JOHN LABATT, the Canadian brewing and consumer products group, posted a loss
of CDollars 204m (USDollars 159.3m) on revenues of CDollars 446m in the
fourth quarter ended April. A year earlier, Labatt posted a loss of CDollars
23m on revenues of CDollars 379m.
The latest loss stems mainly from continuing problems with Labatt's US dairy
business. The loss included a CDollars 173m write-down in the value of this
operation.
For the whole of 1992-93 the loss was CDollars 70m against a profit of
CDollars 101m a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 2.1bn against CDollars
1.7bn.
Brewing had an operating profit of CDollars 218m for the year, up from
CDollars 178m.
Labatt recently spun off its Canadian dairy products operations and
classified its US dairy business as a discontinued operation while attempts
are made to sell it.

BRADFORD &amp; Bingley has become the latest UK building society to tap the
syndicated credits market.
It has completed a Pounds 250m (Dollars 375m) revolving credit facility,
increased from an initial Pounds 150m after the facility was oversubscribed,
according to arrangers Swiss Bank Corporation and Westdeutsche Landesbank. A
third of the facility will be drawn by the borrower after next week's
signing.
The five-year facility incorporates a US dollar swing-line option, allowing
the borrower to receive immediate dollar funds in the US market at half a
point above the US prime rate.
The commitment fee on the facility is 17 basis points. The margin, if funds
are drawn, is 32 1/2 basis points, unless more than 50 per cent of the
facility is drawn, in which case a further 2 1/2 basis points is added.

managers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISGRUNTLED Royal Trustco shareholders will today confront managers of the
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family over the
circumstances which have led to the near-collapse of Canada's second-biggest
trust and loan company.
A committee, which claims to represent over 1,000 shareholders and
subordinated debt holders in North America, Europe and Australia, has
circulated a long list of questions which it plans to ask at Trustco's
annual meeting in Toronto this morning.
The meeting is likely to be Trustco's last. Royal Bank of Canada is in the
final stages of negotiations to rescue Trustco's operations.
The parent company will be left with a CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.1bn) loan
portfolio. It plans to change its name to Gentra.
Trustco's problems stem partly from the slump in the North American property
market.
They were exacerbated, however, by write-offs which flowed from the
mishandled acquisition of Dow Chemical's financial services arm and a string
of US west-coast savings and loan institutions.
Trustco's shares have tumbled from a peak of CDollars 18.25 in 1990 to 35
cents yesterday.
The losses suffered by shareholders have made Trustco a focal point of
criticism levelled by the investment community against the Bronfman group's
disclosure standards and corporate governance.
Mr Raymond Budd, chairman of the public shareholders committee, said in a
letter to the chairman of an independent committee of Trustco's board
examining the deal that shareholders are in essence seeking an answer to the
question: 'How can a company that in the late autumn of 1992 professes to be
liquid, solvent, healthy and profitable . . . announce just a few months
later a loss for the 1992 fiscal year of over CDollars 850m and the need to
sell substantially all of its profitable assets?'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM has announced that Mr Robert Ripp, the company treasurer, has opted for
early retirement and will leave the company at the end of October.
Mr Ripp's departure is the latest of several senior management changes at
IBM following the appointment of Mr Louis Gerstner as chairman and chief
executive in April.
Last month, IBM appointed Mr Jerome York, formerly of Chrysler, as its new
chief financial officer.
Mr Ripp had previously been seen as a likely candidate for that position.
After 29 years at IBM, Mr Ripp plans to 'pursue several entrepreneurial
business opportunities,' the company said. His successor at IBM has yet to
be identified.
'We do not have a successor ready to name,' an IBM spokesman said. The
search for a new treasurer is expected to include potential candidates
within IBM as well as outsiders.
'Bob Ripp played a key role in IBM's restructuring efforts over the last
several years. He also has provided innovative treasury leadership, and
recently managed the issuance of the company's first-ever preferred stock
offering as part of a nearly Dollars 3bn IBM corporate financing package,'
said Mr Gerstner, commenting on Mr Ripp's retirement and praising his long
service to the company.

The company, which recently gained approval from creditors to write off
DM1.4bn of its DM2.7bn net debt, refused to comment on the size of its
operational losses. In the steel divisions, analysts estimate losses at more

Group sales in Germany fell by 9.7 per cent while sales abroad went down by
a modest 0.2 per cent. However, in the machinery divisions sales for the six

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo in talks on
merger
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSIVE talks are under way between Renault, the state-owned French car
and truck maker, and Volvo of Sweden on turning their three-year-old
alliance into a merger, it emerged yesterday.
The negotiations have been accelerated by the new French government's
privatisation policy and the resolution earlier this month of an 18-month
dispute between Volvo and the Swedish government over the future of
Procordia, a drugs and food group jointly controlled by Volvo and the state.
The companies and the French finance ministry yesterday refused public
comment on a report in Liberation, the French newspaper, that the French
finance and industry ministries had given their agreement in principle to
the structure of a merger.
But a Renault spokesman said: 'We have always said we want to work ever
closer with Volvo, with a possible merger one day.'
According to Liberation, Renault and Volvo would form a joint holding
company, which in turn would take 55 per cent of a publicly quoted
Renault-Volvo manufacturing company. The rest of the latter joint company's
equity would be held directly by AB Volvo and a new company, Renault
Investissement. At present, Renault holds 8 per cent of Volvo and Volvo has
20 per cent of Renault, and both companies have cross-holdings in their
respective car and truck divisions.
Renault's refusal yesterday to comment on the report was in marked contrast
to its repeated denials of reports from Italy that it was preparing to take
a 40 per cent stake in Fiat.
Renault is on the list of 21 companies which the Balladur government plans
to privatise but is unlikely to be the first to be sold. A finance ministry
official said this week that the question of Renault's capital structure had
to be settled.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Banks warn of Ferruzzi rescue
delay

<TEXT>
THE FIVE main creditor banks to Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group yesterday
warned they would need at least 40 days to prepare a detailed examination of
its accounts before progress could be made on a rescue plan.
The report, on a leading Italian news agency, followed a meeting yesterday
of Ferruzzi's five main creditor banks, led by Mediobanca. A Ferruzzi
official declined to comment on the news.
The report also said the creditor banks had decided not to appoint a new
executive to run the group, as had been expected, but to alter the boards of
directors of Ferruzzi's subsidiaries at their forthcoming general meetings.
The suggestion that a rescue will take much longer than expected looks set
to depress the value of Ferruzzi group shares, just as they rebounded in
Milan yesterday as dealers reacted positively to a terse statement by a
broader group of Ferruzzi's leading bankers on Wednesday night that they
would stand by the company.
The banks' declaration, which followed talks at the Bank of Italy, was
enough to trigger a rise of almost 14 per cent in the share price of the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company to L562.8 from L494.8. Shares
in Montedison, the group's main industrial operation, also recovered by
almost 14 per cent to close at L846.
Dealers remain confused by plans for the company and by conflicting reports
of the exposure of Ferfin's five main lenders. Shares in the banks had
fallen sharply as brokers expected problems with their credits to affect
earnings. Last week, Ferfin admitted it had been unable to meet some of its
financial commitments since the end of last month.
Wednesday night's statement confirmed the readiness of Ferruzzi's main bank
creditors to support the group during its restructuring. In an indication
that an outright dismemberment was not imminent, the statement said the
objective was 'to safeguard the basic integrity of the strategic activities
of Italy's second-biggest private sector group'.
It did not indicate what were considered to be the strategic activities of
the far-flung Ferruzzi empire, whose businesses include agro-industrial
operations, energy, and cement and building materials, as well as financial
services.
The statement also boosted shares in the Fondiaria insurance operation,
which this week announced plans for a rights issue underwritten by the five
creditor banks. The deal for the company, controlled by Ferruzzi through a
joint venture, is likely to spell the effective transfer of control of
Fondiaria to the creditor banks.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Microsoft to focus on software
over support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the world's big-gest personal computer software supplier, has
taken a strategically critical decision to remain a developer of technically
advanced software, rather than diversify into support services.
The decision will reassure investors concerned that the company's
profitability could have been damaged by an excursion into a complex area
where Microsoft has little expertise.
It will also open the likelihood of the growth of a new computing sector
providing third party services to Microsoft's large corporate customers.
Microsoft will in future rely on alliances forged with distributors, dealers
and consultancies to provide support and services to its large customers. In
the UK, for example, it might rely on computing services companies like
Hoskyns or ACT to support large customers in the finance sector.
Yesterday, in the first of a series of measures paving the way for these new
relationships, Microsoft announced that from July 1 it was abandoning
suggested retail prices for its software products in Europe while
standardising terms and conditions to enable customers to sign pan-European
contracts more easily.
Microsoft's profits before tax at the nine-month mark in April this year
were Dollars 688m on sales of Dollars 2.71bn. The company competes in most
areas of the PC software market, but its success is chiefly due to the
MS/DOS and Windows operating systems, which are standard on virtually all
IBM-style personal computers.
This year it announced a new operating system called Windows NT designed to
run on networks of PCs rather than stand-alone systems. Corporate customers
are increasingly developing PC networks for new applications, arguing they
are less expensive than mainframe computers. Windows NT, however, is a large
piece of software, bigger than some mainframe operating systems, and it
requires the kind of support typically provided by large computer companies
like IBM or Digital Equipment.
According to Mr John Leftwich, director of marketing for Microsoft in the
UK, the decision to abandon suggested retail prices is unlikely to result in
price changes for customers. Most software packages are already heavily
discounted by dealers and retailers.
There was now little difference between the cost of Microsoft software in
Europe and the US, he said.
English-language software typically cost 10-20 per cent more in Europe than
in the US. Software translated into local languages cost about 60 per cent
more than the US equivalent.

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Oil and gas side props Kvaerner
at four months

KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering group which recently won two big
shipbuilding and offshore platform orders, yesterday announced pre-tax
profits ahead at NKr434m (Dollars 62m) in the first four months, compared
with NKr424m the year previously.
The improvement was due to sharply increased profits in its oil and gas
division, which rose to NKr135m from NKr87m, offsetting reverses in
shipbuilding, pulping technologies and shipping, and a loss in mechanical
engineering. Net earnings per share slipped from NKr8.15 to NKr7.24.
Group sales rose 25 per cent to NKr7.8bn from NKr6.2bn, fuelled by a steep
rise in oil and gas division sales, from NKr1.67bn to NKr2.33bn, and the
acquisition of the German shipyard Kvaerner Warnow Werft.
Kvaerner, Norway's biggest private company, was buoyed in April by its
biggest-ever orders - one worth NKr6.5bn for four liquefied natural gas
carriers from Abu Dhabi and a NKr1bn contract for engineering and
construction work on a new North Sea gas platform. These lifted orders in
the four months to NKr14.02bn from NKr6.54bn in the same period last year.
Group order backlog at end-April was NKr33bn.
Kvaerner expects full-year profits to be in line with last year's pre-tax
result of NKr932m.
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, said yesterday it had increased its
share issue launched last week to 3.25m shares from 3m following heavy
over-subscription for what is one of the chief international issues by a
Finnish company since the country slumped into recession two years ago. The
total raised was FM542.75m (Dollars 100.5m).

FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Poised for a US investor catwalk
 -Daimler-Benz's new stock market strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week, the finance director of Germany's biggest industrial company
appeared as part of an unusual double bill.
Mr Gerhard Liener, finance chief at Daimler-Benz, appeared on stage with Mr
Wolfgang Ley, managing director of the Escada women's fashion chain. The two
men spent the day expounding the attractions of their shares to more than
1,000 investors from Baden-Wurttemberg in south-west Germany.
Mr Liener will soon get further opportunities to parade the merits of the
Daimler-Benz group on the investor relations catwalk. Later this year,
Daimler will become the first German company to obtain a full listing on the
New York stock exchange. Mr Liener's performance before US investors will be
solo as no other German company has made the concessions, primarily on
accounting requirements, required by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission
(SEC) before permission to list is granted.
Mr Liener says the move is part of a fundamental reorientation of the
group's approach to the world's equity markets. This complements a
rethinking of its manufacturing policies.
In the last three years, Daimler has listed its shares in Tokyo, London,
Paris and Vienna, adding to listings in Germany and Switzerland. Next year,
it hopes to debut on the fledgling Shanghai stock exchange and may list
shares in Singapore.
The strategy is partly motivated by the desire for pure publicity. Daimler
knows that it will score a public relations coup if it becomes the first
European company to get a listing in China. 'But the main practical
consequence will be that when we proceed to a new rights issue, our shares
will be picked up in a much more international way,' Mr Liener says.
Daimler last held a rights issue in 1989. It planned another for last year
but this had to be postponed because of poor conditions in the German stock
market as well as deteriorating profits - group net profits fell 25 per cent
to DM1.45bn (Dollars 906m) last year. They are likely to fall further to
DM1bn this year before, Mr Liener says, bouncing back next year mainly as a
result of recovery at Mercedes-Benz, the group's luxury car subsidiary.
He says the next rights issue will raise between DM2bn and DM3bn and will
probably take place next year, depending on group profitability and the
Daimler share price.
The aim will be to distribute the shares as widely as possible. Thus the
line-up of advisory banks will be broader than the last rights issue. It
will include a number of US institutions and banks from other parts of the
world.
The issue will be made easier by Daimler's decision earlier this year to
disband Mercedes Holding (MAH), a holding company set up in December 1975 to
prevent Daimler being taken over by the Shah of Iran. This will increase the
'free float' of Daimler shares from 33 per cent to 45 per cent. It will, for
technical reasons, make it cheaper for Daimler to issue its equity: the
discount to the Daimler share price is likely to be 20 per cent rather than
40 per cent in 1989.
If cheaper equity and good publicity are the main reasons behind Daimler's
new approach to shareholders, Mr Liener says that it must do more to keep
ordinary shareholders 'happy, informed and interested'.
One way of doing this is to enhance the group's communications effort, but
more important - especially for the US investors whom Daimler will be wooing
later this year - is financial performance. This does not look good: last
month the group reported a profit of just DM20m for the first three months
of the year, down from DM480m in the same period last year.
Mr Liener concedes the pressure to generate earnings will increase as a
result of coming into closer contact with non-German investors.
Producing figures according to non-German rules will make it much easier for
analysts to scrutinise details of performance.
This pressure is partly to be welcomed: 'It increases the awareness of
management in the group that to be profitable and to increase profitability
is one of the most important priorities of being in business.
'But we will not change our attitude from long-term to short-term thinking,'
Mr Liener insists. 'If we do that we will lose something which is very
important and very valuable, American managers deplore that they are the
slaves of investors' short-term thinking.'
He hopes that he will be able to tell US investors a very positive story
when it comes to the rights issue next year. 'Profits as of 1994 will be
considerably increased from current levels - the second half of the nineties
is going to be very good for Daimler-Benz.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: DTI inquiry focuses mainly on finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's 545-page report into Astra focuses
primarily on financial issues and largely ignores several external factors
which some, especially former directors, blame for the group's demise.
The company became very publicly embroiled in the Iraqi 'supergun' affair in
September 1989 when directors Mr Gerald James, Mr Christopher Gumbley, Mr
Stephan Kock and Mr John Pike discovered that propellant to be supplied to
Jordan by PRB, Astra's newly acquired Belgian subsidiary, was destined for a
large gun in Iraq.
The contract was stopped in spite of considerable opposition from the
management of PRB, who feared that the company's future business in the area
would be seriously undermined. The Astra directors informed British
intelligence of their suspicions, and last year provided evidence to that
effect to the Department of Trade and Industry's select committee inquiry
into the supergun affair.
Astra's warning came a full five months before government ministers claimed
that they knew of the gun's existence.
According to Mr James, many of PRB's problems in meeting its future targets
were related to this decision and the subsequent change in climate towards
the export of defence equipment to Iraq or any of its conduit countries.
This issue is barely dealt with in the report.
Mr Gumbley, the company's former chief executive, who served four and a half
months in prison on two corruption offences, yesterday said that the loss of
the propellant contract caused the company 'grave damage'.
He added that 'we thought it was better to be legal than illegal.' He said
that prior to his departure from Astra he had tried to investigate
allegations of large commission payments to PRB employees which were
seriously affecting that company's profit margins. This issue is barely
looked at in the report.
PRB's problems cannot be blamed entirely on events after Astra's
acquisition. Its very poor financial condition was not entirely clear to
Astra at the time of purchase.
The report does not refer either to a controversial explosives agreement
struck between the Ministry of Defence and Royal Ordnance which effectively
cut Astra out of the Pounds 400m a year ammunition market. This caused the
company's 1988 acquisition of BMARC to look seriously overvalued and led to
financial problems ahead of the ill-fated acquisition of PRB.
The inspectors say that Mr James's evidence to them covered a wide range of
subjects, certain of which apparently had little or no direct connection
with Astra.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Few emerge unscathed from Astra fall-out -
The findings of the DTI investigation into the failed munitions group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST revelation to emerge from the Department of Trade and Industry
report into Astra Holdings, the collapsed munitions group, is that its
existence as a publicly quoted company was based on a lie.
A falsified invoice in 1986 allowed Astra to meet a profits forecast that in
turn allowed it to reverse into the publicly quoted Sumner group.
This gave Astra its foothold on the 1980s acquisition path that led to its
fateful purchase of PRB, the Belgian munitions company and a footnote in
history as a supplier to Iraq's 'supergun' project.
The cast of characters caught up in Astra's rapid rise and fall were quick
to clutch at this new information yesterday. If, as appeared, Astra
directors were prepared to perpetrate a fraud from day one, normal City and
accounting regulations would never have prevented them, one close observer
said.
But the fact remains that few of the cast emerged unscathed from the
investigation. The Stock Exchange, auditor Stoy Hayward, Astra's financial
adviser PaineWebber, Mr Gerald James, Astra chairman, Mr Christopher
Gumbley, managing director, and other directors are all criticised.
After three years of research, the report describes how Astra was
transformed from a small southern England fireworks manufacturer into a
multinational munitions company.
It shows how the 'disastrous' 1989 acquisition of PRB - culminating in a
complete write-off of the investment in March 1990 - may have been a
necessary fig leaf to cover up Astra's underlying cash flow problems. And it
reveals a string of sloppy accounting controls, rash management decisions
and deliberately misleading statements from at least one Astra director, Mr
John Anderson.
Stoy Hayward, Astra's auditor, pointed out some of the risks of the PRB
transaction. But the report criticises the exchange for allowing the
circular concerning the Pounds 20.8m acquisition and the accompanying Pounds
36m rights issue to be issued without the normal 5.15 letter that confirms
the health of a company's working capital. This should have been provided by
PaineWebber.
The report implies that Astra may not have been saved from collapse had it
not made the PRB acquisition. But at least shareholders, who had financed
most of the group's apparent growth, would have been saved from pitching the
last Pounds 36m into the pot.
Stoy Hayward in particular is criticised over Astra's cash flow situation
ahead of the acquisition. The firm knew Astra would only have enough working
capital if it effected its proposed asset sales by the summer of 1990. But,
the DTI says, Stoy Hayward did not explore how realistic was the disposal
programme.
'Stoy Hayward did not do so, but simply accepted that the proposed asset
disposal programme could and would enable the group to raise sufficient cash
by the summer of 1990.'
Stoy Hayward said yesterday that it had been willing to discuss the working
capital letter at if it had been asked to.
Also criticised in the main section of the DTI report is PaineWebber, which
acted as financial adviser to Astra and brought the PRB acquisition to Mr
James. PaineWebber's initial draft of the chairman's statement to
shareholders at the time of the PRB rights issue 'was manifestly inadequate.
'PaineWebber wholly failed to take any steps towards the production and
signing of the paragraph 5.15 letter,' which concerned the working capital
situation. The omission was 'inexcusable,' the DTI said.
PaineWebber also should not have allowed Astra to say that the board
'advised by PaineWebber' considered the rights issue and the PRB acquisition
to be in the interests of Astra and its shareholders. The DTI accepted that
PaineWebber had not intended the use of its name to be misleading.
The DTI is perhaps most revealing about Astra's arrival on the public scene.
In 1985 Hichens Harrison, Astra's stockbroker, raised Pounds 611,000 through
a share placing to expand the equity base and provide working capital for
the expansion of 'military, marine and commercial pyrotechnics.'
The placing and the subsequent reverse takeover of Sumner were based on
Astra's profit forecast of Pounds 300,000 for the year ending March 1986.
In fact Astra reported Pounds 340,024 of profit. But the DTI said Pounds
240,000 of that arose from a false invoice allegedly created by Mr James and
Mr Anderson.
The report said Mr Anderson and perhaps other individuals 'subsequently
provided funds of their own . . . for the settlement of the invoice.'
Mr Anderson, denied all knowledge of the false invoice. But the DTI said his
evidence was 'throughout untruthful and that he was deliberately intending
to mislead us.'
The investigators said they were 'unable to make any finding as to whether
Mr James was involved in the creation and/or subsequent settlement of the
invoice.' He did however know about it, but was unprepared to tell the DTI.
The DTI says of the auditors at the time that 'there is no evidence at all
to suggest that Stoy Hayward either were, or should reasonably have been
aware of the fact that the invoice was a false one.'
Some of the DTI's most damning conclusions are reserved for accounting
issues, comments that underline the laxity of some public company reporting.
The inspectors said Astra's 1988 and 1989 published accounts gave little
indication of the importance of acquisitions to profit growth.
In fact Walters Group and Gilgore, acquired in 1988, contributed more than
100 per cent of Astra's recorded pre-tax profits. The next year the acquired
British Manufacture and Research Company also made more than 100 per cent of
group profit.
'Without the two acquisitions the Astra group would have reported losses for
each of those two years,' the report said. The accounts gave no indication
of this.
The report adds that Stoy Hayward was also partly responsible for the fact
that Astra's 1987 accounts did not show a true and fair view. And it says
Stoy Hayward shared responsibility with Mr James and Mr James Miller (former
finance director) for failing to disclose Astra's default under a
multi-currency facility agreement during 1989.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Adrian Martin, Stoy Hayward's managing partner,
rejected these two DTI conclusions. The two points relating to 1987 and 1989
accounts 'were concerned with interpretational or judgmental conclusions
drawn at the time.'

MMI, the financial and corp-orate communication company, has announced two
acquisitions and increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 473,000 in the year to
February 28. Losses last time were Pounds 383,000.
It is buying Pelham, the marketing company, and Mediamix, the publishing
services company. The consideration is being satisfied by the issue of 9.72m
shares, of which all but 1.65m have been conditionally placed at 22.5p. Some
4.22m shares are subject to an open offer to shareholders.
MMI's shares were suspended at 25p in May.
A further profit-related payment for Pelham to a maximum of Pounds 621,000
is to be paid and a profit-related payment to a maximum of Pounds 1.1m is
due to the management of Park Avenue, Pelham's main operating company.
The results were affected by a decline in the core BES business where
turnover declined to Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 689,000). There were also start
up costs and initial trading losses of an offshoot and the settlement of
litigation.

<TEXT>
Reduced overhead costs helped Greenwich Resources, the gold and minerals
producer, cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 558,000 to Pounds 92,000 for the
half year to March 31.
Mr Colin Phipps, the chairman, said the group now had all its main projects
financed by joint ventures and other agreements.
Since the end of the half year, the company's working capital had been
increased by the consideration paid by Bard for the option to participate in
Venezuela and the second half would benefit from the receipt of the Bard
payment, he said.
Although operating income halved to Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 74,000)
administrative expenses and exceptionals fell to Pounds 131,000 (Pounds
651,000).
After tax of Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 81,000) losses per share dropped to 0.1p
(0.9p).

Pre-tax profits at GEI, the specialist engineer, fell to Pounds 2.1m for the

About half the turnover and the majority of operating profits was achieved
overseas. This has resulted in difficulties with the short term recovery of
advance corporation tax and the company has written off Pounds 1.5m of ACT

That has resulted in retained losses of Pounds 2.42m (Pounds 540,000).

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Net assets show 14.7% improvement at
Electra Investment Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRA Investment Trust yesterday announced a 4.5 per cent increase in
interim dividend and a 14.7 per cent rise in net assets over the six months
to March 31.
The trust mainly invests in unquoted equities, which have suffered badly in
the recession. The end-March net assets per share, at 318.65p, were still
below their September 1989 level.
However, Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said in his statement to
shareholders that 'I believe that the worst is over. The majority of
companies in our portfolio look to be set for better times and we should
start to see a gradual increase in the underlying values.
'All in all, while maintaining a cautious approach to the US and UK
economies, I do believe that the outlook for your company is more
encouraging than it has been for some time.'
Mr Hugh Mumford, a director of Electra, said that the asset increase was
prompted by three factors: an increase in smaller company share prices since
Black Wednes-day; an increase in the valuation of the UK port-folio, as
unquoted com-panies gained listings; and a revival in the fortunes of some
of the UK unquoted holdings, as lower interest rates helped their operating
profits.
The trust's portfolio is now split as to one-third listed and two-thirds
unlisted companies.
Of the quoted portfolio, 75 per cent is in the UK. Of the unquoted, 40 per
cent is in the US and 60 per cent in the UK.
The total net assets of the trust at end-March were Pounds 551.4m. The
trust's pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.43m, up from Pounds 8.78m in the first
half of last year.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.45p (3.3p), payable from earnings per
share of 3.5p (4.23p).

REGALIAN Properties incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83.5m for the year

The dividend is passed; previously there was an interim of 1.5p. Net asset

Mr David Goldstone, chairman, brushed aside the losses and said he 'took a
very positive approach' to the future. 'We must have turned the corner,' he
said.
Further reductions of borrowings this year would 'enable the company to
exploit its expertise in inner city residential projects,' he said.
Net bank debt has been reduced from Pounds 130m to Pounds 42m since March
1992. Regalian's banks have extended its facilities to December 1994.
As well as taking Pounds 52.9m provisions against stock, the company made
Pounds 22.1m of exceptional items including a Pounds 7.2m loss on the sale
of a Southwark office building.
About half of the Pounds 44.9m provisions against residential property were
against Kensington Palace Gardens, the luxury block of flats near Kensington
Palace. Regalian has now sold nine out of the 20 flats.
Provisions of Pounds 14.8m were made against development sites to reduce the
carrying value to Pounds 4.5m.
Mr Goldstone said that the office development market showed 'very little, if
any improvement.' Regalian was rethinking its scheme at Bishopsbridge in
Paddington, which is a joint venture with NFC. It was prudent to consider
'an alternative form of development, primarily residential where there would
be an immediate demand, with offices in the later phases,' it said. It has
taken a Pounds 5.4m provision against the site.
A Pounds 2.7m provision was made against a site in Cardiff, which will not
be developed until the market improves.
Turnover fell from Pounds 98.9m to Pounds 55.4m. Losses per share increased
from 19.74p to 68.29p. The 1991-92 figures have been adjusted for FRS 3.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help AAH to Pounds 37.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS costing Pounds 84m helped to boost AAH, the pharmaceuticals
distribution group, which yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in
annual profits before tax and exceptionals to Pounds 37.3m.
The profits, struck on sales ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds
1.26bn), benefited from a Pounds 4.5m contribution from new businesses.
These included the purchase of 65 pharmacies, with a further 13 since the
end of the year, for a total of 224, and the inclusion for four months of a
drugs wholesaler in the Irish Republic.
The previous year's profits had been enhanced by a Pounds 6.6m exceptional
gain on the sale of a business. In the absence of this gain, pre-tax profits
under the FRS 3 accounting standard fell from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 37.3m
for the year to March 31.
Mr John Padovan, who took over as chairman in December from Mr Bill Pybus,
the incumbent for the previous 25 years, said the group had achieved growth
in spite of a 'generally tough climate.'
Efforts had been directed at cutting costs, such as closing four of the 27
depots, and improving efficiency.
The greatest growth was in the healthcare division, which saw trading
profits rise from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 31.3m on sales up from Pounds 1bn
to Pounds 1.2bn.
AAH had successfully integrated the Dutch drugs wholesaler Medicopharma, the
acquisition of which was the subject of an MMC inquiry last year, and had
entered the Irish market with the IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.5m) purchase of
Cahill May Roberts.
Recession hit consumer products distribution and builders supplies, where
profits fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 800,00 and from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds
2.3m respectively.
A shift in focus at the distribution business to contract work and the
higher value food market helped profits jump from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds
2.8m.
Environmental services reported a 9 per cent increase in profits to Pounds
4.7m on sales 37 per cent ahead to Pounds 69.1m.
The dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 11.5p for a total of 17.3p
(16.35p). Earnings came to 32.8p (31.8p).
AAH finished the year with gearing of 14 per cent, after paying for the
acquisitions and Pounds 24m in capital expenditure.
COMMENT
The healthcare division continues to forge ahead, with little sign of any
significant slowdown. Proposed changes to the NHS are more likely to affect
manufacturers than the middlemen. In the current year, AAH is likely to
benefit from a steadier performance in Ireland and the purchase of more
pharmacies. In its other businesses, the group will have to wait for
economic recovery like everyone else. Forecasts for the current year are for
Pounds 45.5m, with a prospective p/e of about 14 times. This, combined with
the yield of 4.6 per cent, leaves the shares looking somewhat undervalued.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Safeland advances 45% to Pounds 242,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Safeland, the property group, advanced by 45 per cent,
from Pounds 167,000 to Pounds 242,000, in the year to March 31.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 13.8m and
after reduced interest payable of Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 923,000).
A final dividend of 0.44p (0.14p) makes an improved 0.5p (0.28p) total,
payable from earnings per share of 1p (0.6p).
Mr Raymond Lipman, chairman, said there were now signs of greater activity
within the property market, but there was still a degree of uncertainty.
The chairman added that since the year end Safeland had formed a new
subsidiary, Heritage Insurance Services, which would specialise in property
insurance for the group's own portfolio.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Devro float gives Pounds 224m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVRO, the Scotland-based company which claims to be the world's leading
maker of sausage casings made from the natural protein collagen, is valued
at Pounds 224m in a flotation in which the issue price is 170p. It will
raise Pounds 76.6m for the company.
The flotation, sponsored by Charterhouse with NatWest Wood Mackenzie as
brokers, involves placing 52m ordinary shares, primarily with UK
institutions, and offering 28m shares to the public. Dealings begin on June
30.
On the basis of pro-forma earnings of 10.5p and a dividend of 5.5p for 1992,
the shares have an historic p/e of 16.2 and yield of 4 per cent.
Devro made operating profits of Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds 82.7m last
year.
COMMENT
This flotation offers investors the chance to buy a niche company with the
market and technological power of a multinational. It has a commanding
position in a world that few people think about, or even care to. But
investors need not squirm. With a share of its main market three times that
of its nearest international competitor (and there are only three of them)
Devro's operating ratios and cash flow are astonishingly robust. Barriers to
entry by competitors are high. Any downside includes exposure to EC
legislation on food, developing country risk and continuing competition from
cheaper gut which is dominant in Germany. The offer is finely priced exactly
in line with the rest of the food sector with a prospective p/e of 13,
assuming pre-tax profits for the full year of about Pounds 25m. It should be
popular with institutions. Retail investors may require more education. The
shares should go to a premium.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil welcomes PRT transitional relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY OIL &amp; Gas, the North Sea oil explorer, showed the effects of the
government's proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes yesterday when it
recommended a flat dividend in spite of a jump in profits.
But Mr Peter Elwes, Hardy's managing director, welcomed the government's
offer of transitional aid to help smaller companies to cushion them from the
immediate effects of the tax changes.
'This is very significant for us and I'm feeling very happy about it,' Mr
Elwes said.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 3.07m) on
turnover of Pounds 50.7m (Pounds 41m). Earnings per share were 11.3p (8.3p)
and an unchanged dividend of 1p is proposed.
There were petroleum revenue tax credits of Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 4.4m),
pushing up retained profits to Pounds 9.28m (Pounds 6.33m).
The profit rise came from a rise in volumes of oil and gas produced which
rose by 8 per cent. Gas production in the US more than doubled and there
were exploration successes in the US, Canada and Australia. Production is
expected to be by 20 per cent up this year.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cater Allen at Pounds 11.7m and has good
start to year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATER ALLEN, the financial services company which owns London's second
biggest discount house, yesterday reported net profits of Pounds 11.7m for
the year ended April, against Pounds 8.13m a year earlier.
It also disclosed for the first time full details of profits and reserves at
its discount house and Jersey bank, anticipating compliance with the
European Community's second banking directive this year.
On the new basis, pro-forma pre-tax profits were Pounds 18.78m (Pounds
13.44m). Shareholders' funds of Pounds 83.3m were boosted by the transfer of
previously hidden reserves of Pounds 2.15m and of Pounds 5.41m 'rebate'
representing the excess of market value over carrying cost of its trading
assets.
On the old accounting basis, the discount house, about half the group's
business, had profits after tax and rebate of Pounds 5.33m (Pounds 3.5m).
The discount house did not make or lose 'a great deal' following Britain's
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn and subsequent falls
in exchange rates.
Losses at Lloyd's agencies deepened from Pounds 473,000 to Pounds 1.26m due
to the lack of profit commission on the 1990 year of account and to the
reduction in its agencies' fee income for the current year.
The board, which said trading had started well this year, proposed a
maintained final dividend of 20p, giving a total for the year of 27p (26p).
Directors currently intend to raise the next interim dividend by 1p to 8p.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Way cleared for another media deal for
Pearson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE completion of Pearson's Pounds 99m acquisition of Thames Television
clears the way for another potentially large media deal by the publishing,
industrial and banking group.
Mr Frank Barlow, the managing director of Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, is interested in the consortium now being put together to bid for the
film interests of the Rank Organisation.
Mr John Whitney, former director general of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority and Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, have put
together a small company called Premier Media to raise between Pounds 300m
and Pounds 400m to bid for Rank's film businesses.
These range from an important film library and film distribution business to
Pinewood studios, the Odeon cinema chain and video duplication.
Rank executives have denied their film businesses are for sale although the
company has debt of around Pounds 1bn.
In the past few months Pearson has been preoccupied with completing the
Thames deal which went unconditional on Wednesday. Premier Media now expects
talks with Pearson to get more serious.
Both Lord Blakenham, the Pearson chairman and Mr Barlow have made it clear
recently that they want to create a major television division for the
company.
Nothing has been agreed between Pearson and Premier, but one possibility
looked at would envisage the publishing group taking a majority stake in the
consortium.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Interest costs hold back Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT, the Birmingham-based water and sewage company, yesterday
reported a slight fall in profits due to rising interest costs and pre-tax
losses at its waste management arm, Biffa.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said Biffa had achieved some price rises,
but operating profits fell Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 12m, leading to a Pounds
10m loss after interest costs. 'It's about market pressures. It's been a
tough year,' he said.
Severn Trent's results were poorly received by analysts, who also criticised
a sudden switch of accounting policy on the company's underground assets.
The change, which lifted pre-tax profits by Pounds 15.9m, conforms to
accounting rules but was not announced in advance. The company's shares fell
13p to 486p.
Group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 274m to Pounds 270m, although the
prior year figure was restated under FRS 3 from Pounds 265m. At the interim
stage, profits increased 3 per cent to Pounds 140.8m.
Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 904.6m, helped by price rises and
acquisitions, while operating profits on continuing operations increased 11
per cent to Pounds 299.6m. Profits from water and sewerage businesses
increased 15 per cent to Pounds 293m.
Excluding Biffa, other non-regulated activities saw profits drop from Pounds
6.2m to Pounds 1.4m. Mr Paul said the fall was due to restructuring costs
and weak economic conditions in the UK and US.
Interest costs increased sharply to Pounds 28.9m as net borrowings increased
Pounds 252m to Pounds 422.4m, giving gearing of 21 per cent. Borrowings are
expected to increase by a further Pounds 200m this year, the company said.
The company disconnected 1,215 customers during the year, a slight fall from
the previous period, although there was no change in disconnection policy.
The bad debt provision fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 8m.
Earnings fell from a restated 70.6p to 69.9p. Excluding exceptional disposal
profits of Pounds 8.6m in the prior year, earnings increased 2.5 per cent.
A final dividend of 14.1p was recommended to make a total of 21.1p, an
increase of 9.3 per cent. The company said it looked at offering an enhanced
scrip alternative, but decided it was against shareholders' longer-term
interests.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US side curbs growth at Dawson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 36 PER cent fall in US profits for Dawson International, Britain's third
biggest textiles company, almost wiped out gains made in luxury clothing
brands such as Pringle and Ballantyne. The company plans to close more US
factories in an attempt to reverse its fortunes.
For the year to March 27 1993, turnover rose 4 per cent from Pounds 415m to
Pounds 431.7m.
Pre-tax profits increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 32.1m against Pounds
23.2m, restated in accordance with FRS 3.
On the old accounting basis, pre-tax profits rose 6 per cent. US profits
fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 11.8m.
These figures were flattered by the strength of the dollar. If currency
translation effects are stripped out, sales and profits were almost
unchanged in real terms.
Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, said that the improvement seen in trading a
year ago 'had evaporated as the recession regained its grip in the UK and
gained momentum in the important continental European and Japanese markets.'
The company's mainly US-based Consumer Products division saw sales fall in
dollar terms.
West Fleece, which makes garments such as jogging suits, lost 'a
seven-figure sum' after price competition and technical problems hit
supplies to one of its largest customers, US retailer K-Mart.
Consumer Products' operating profits fell 30 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. It
closed three North Carolina plants last year with the loss of 300 jobs, and
is planning further closures, probably in knitting and dyeing.
Dawson's other division, Premier Brands, which includes its mostly
cashmere-based luxury goods business, saw gains in sales and market share.
Dollar strength helped both, and the division reported operating profits 60
per cent up at Pounds 21.56m (Pounds 13.52m).
Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of Premier Brands, said that order books
were 'quite good, but shorter than we would like them to be.'
Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (11.5p) and the dividend is held at 9p via
a proposed unchanged final of 6.1p.
Dawson shares fell 6p to 215p.
COMMENT
Dawson's good businesses are very good and its bad ones are appalling. Can
the company turn the failures round while insulating the successes from
recession? It will not be easy. The problems in the US are more structural
than cyclical: retailers learn to use just-in-time delivery to force
suppliers to carry the risk of holding stocks, while the North American Free
Trade Agreement threatens to increase competition from low labour cost
plants in Mexico. The prospects for the luxury garment are better thanks to
the strength of the brands, but still depend on the willingness of the
wealthy to splash out. Even with the help of a stronger dollar, the company
will do well to make Pounds 36m in pre-tax profits this year. The p/e ratio
should be a little more than 15 1/2 , a 10 per cent plus premium to the
industrials which seems hard to justify.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: S Wales Electricity dividend rise
reinforces industry trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WALES Electricity (SWALEC) announced a 14.9 per cent dividend increase
yesterday, reinforcing the trend towards high pay-outs in the regional
electricity indus-try.
The Cardiff-based utility is recommending a final dividend per share of
15.7p, bringing the total for the year up to 22.3p. The increase came with a
19.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 87m, equivalent to an 18.3
per cent rise in earnings per share to 60p.
Mr Wynford Evans,the chairman, said: 'The strategy we have consistently
implemented since flotation is reflected again in this year's very
satisfactory results. Cost reduction targets are being achieved, customers
are benefiting from lower prices and we are maintaining a progressive
dividend policy for shareholders.'
Comparisons with the previous year's result were complicated by earlier
losses in the retail unit and its subsequent disposal. But SWALEC said that
ongoing businesses increased their overall profit contribution by 1.6 per
cent despite tariff reductions totalling 3 per cent.
The total amount of electricity distributed increased by 0.4 per cent, led
by the commercial market, and costs in this segment of the business were
reduced by nearly 5 per cent.
Tariff reductions and a Pounds 4m investment in a new computer system for
customer service led to a Pounds 2m fall in operating profit to Pounds
68.5m.
The supply business contributed Pounds 5.8m, up from Pounds 3.1m the year
before. The contracting business, which was expanded with the Pounds 5.4m
acquisition of Phoenix Electrical, cut its loss to Pounds 2.3m from Pounds
3.8m after providing Pounds 1.1m for manpower reductions. During the year,
the company paid off its debt, and ended the year with Pounds 10m in cash.
The financial position was strong, and the company was unlikely to gear up
again in the short term, according to Mr David Myring, group finance
director.
The new Teesside gas-fired power station in which SWALEC has a 7.7 per cent
stake is now supplying 25 per cent of its franchise market. The company is
also entering the wind power and natural gas markets.
COMMENT
Despite the strong result, the shares shed 2p to 546p. One reason could be a
worry that SWALEC's above average rates of return will attract the
regulator's eye. The company sells some of the most expensive electricity in
the business, even allowing for the tariff cuts it made during the year, and
some analysts were suggesting yesterday that SWALEC could prudently tone
down its performance. Another strong factor is the balance sheet. With these
results, SWALEC becomes the first REC to ungear, though others will follow
before long. The result includes nearly Pounds 1m of net interest.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Water, provider of water and sewerage services to much of the
English south coast, yesterday reported a slight rise in profits, mainly due
to price increases.
Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent from a restated Pounds 115m to Pounds 119m
in the year to March 31.
At the interim stage, profits declined by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 60m after
the prior year figure was lifted by Pounds 6m upon reclassification of an
exceptional profit.
Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 319m (Pounds 291m). But control
of operating costs led to a 13 per cent increase in trading profits to
Pounds 119m.
Mr Ray King, group finance director, said measured sales and trade effluent
continued to fall because of recession, and showed 'no signs of an upturn.'
Southern's appointed water and sewerage business increased trading profits
by 12 per cent to Pounds 111m. Its unregulated arm, which includes waste
management and engineering divisions, increased profits from Pounds 7m to
Pounds 8.4m on turnover of Pounds 77.7m. However, only 26 per cent of
unregulated sales were external to the group. The company produced no
breakdown for extra-group profits.
There were interest charges of Pounds 200,000 against interest income of
Pounds 3m.
This mainly reflected lower interest rates on deposits, as the year ended
with net cash of Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 1.7m).
The company disconnected 3,700 customers during the year, compared to 2,900.
The bad debt provision rose Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 7m.
Earnings increased by 3 per cent to 66.3p (64.2p) and excluding exceptionals
66.3p (60.5p).
The final dividend of 14.2p makes a total of 21.3p (19.5p). The shares fell
4p to 505p.
COMMENT
By announcing results at the end of a draining water reporting season, on
the same day as its more glamorous cousin Severn Trent, Southern did little
to cast off its reputation as a rather dull, predictable company. Ahead of
the industry's periodic review, when regulatory risk may not bring reward,
Southern's image may be no bad thing. Nevertheless, yesterday's figures were
slightly flattered by planning and capital spending hold-ups. It is still
extremely difficult to see through Southern's non-regulated profits. And
Ofwat, as well as the company's customers, will have taken note of the high
disconnection levels. Full-year profit forecasts of Pounds 127m put the
shares on 7 times, with a yield of 6. As with the rest of the sector, only
the brave are buying now.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BAe looks to eradicate the unpleasant
surprises - The rehabilitation that has taken place since the dark days of
last September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace's rehabilitation has been almost as rapid as its fall from
grace. In the latest spurt of corporate spring cleaning, all of BAe's
operating companies will be hived down into subsidiaries from July 1 if the
company's bankers give their approval.
The move will help protect BAe's ability to pay dividends by shielding the
holding company's reserves from accidents in subsidiaries. Because the
missiles and Jetstream aircraft businesses have been split into separate
subsidiaries it should also be easier to find joint venture partners for the
businesses. Hiving down also defends BAe's tax position, allowing it to
continue to make use of previous tax losses.
That extra flexibility and security will build on the success since the dark
days of last September. At the low point BAe had to write off Pounds 1bn
pounds in the regional jet business and had to apply to the courts for a
capital reduction so that it could continue to pay dividends.
The shock of the losses was described by Mr Richard Lapthorne, the finance
director, as, 'a very expensive education which is still having an impact
throughout the company.' Since then the company has met the objectives it
set itself getting orders and selling businesses, and that has at least
partly restored the company's credibility with the City.
Yet while the sales and orders have been crucial in securing BAe's future,
the company has also had to put new systems in place to ensure that a
disaster on the scale of the regional jet losses does not happen again.
A new management information system, based on the BTR model, was introduced
by Mr John Cahill, the chairman, last year. It places emphasis on how the
monthly figures fit into the annual budget and any deviations are
immediately flagged.
'By looking at variances you can spot potential trouble spots and start a
dialogue with managers immediately,' explains Mr Lapthorne. 'If there are
good reasons for the deviation then at least you know what is going on in
the business. If there are problems you can start sorting them out. It also
helps managers think about what is happening in their own business and how
they can improve it.'
There is nothing revolutionary in the approach. Indeed, it is an indictment
of BAe's past practice that such systems were not in place before. But Mr
Lapthorne says that the objective now is to create a company which does not
produce unpleasant financial surprises - either for the operating managers
or for the City.
Because BAe is involved in very long-term projects, it has several levels of
planning. The longest view comes from the 'product life cycle' evaluation.
That tries to gauge the profitability of a project from cradle to grave -
which in the case of military aircraft can be 40 years. This forms the basis
for a rolling 5 year plan which has firmer numbers attached. Both of these
were originally developed within BAe.
The annual budget owes much to Mr Cahill's BTR background and is used as the
basis for the management information system. Board reports are based on a
model Mr Lapthorne used when he was at Courtaulds.
These tools - particularly the management information system - are expected
to form a framework for handling the business which will change the way
managers think throughout BAe. The hope is that it will help avoid
misunderstandings between senior and junior managers by creating an
unambiguous starting point for discussions. It will also be used by line
managers as the method for analysing where profits are made in a business
and where the risks lie.
By applying the lessons, local operations can improve. The system should
make BAe finances more transparent and reliable.
Mr Lapthorne says that the new structure puts greater emphasis on meeting
annual budget targets, which have in the past been subordinated to the long
view and high hopes about projects have prevailed.
The company is also looking for ways to tidy up its aircraft lease book  -
one of the areas which caused most trouble at regional jets. If current
plans are implemented, the full costs of providing for the possible early
termination of a lease will be taken at the time that the aircraft is sold.
Salesmen will thus be fully aware of the real profit on any deal
immediately.
As with the management system, it will not necessarily prevent loss leading
sales to get a new aircraft established, but it will make clear to everyone
involved the full cost of the decision.
Arguing that not all the good ideas come from new arrivals, Mr Lapthorne
points out that the lease provisions scheme was devised by the group
treasurer, Mr Tony Rice, who has been with the company for 8 years. BAe is
also suggesting the technique to its other Airbus partners.
At the heart of the new approach is the teamwork between Mr Cahill, Mr Dick
Evans the chief executive who runs the defence business directly, Mr
Lapthorne and Mr George Simpson who has responsibility for Rover. 'We are
all very different individuals,' says Mr Lapthorne, 'but we mesh together
extremely well. None of us really minds losing an argument to one of the
others.'
There is also a clear desire to steadily transform the culture of the group
and secure its position as a profitable defence and aero-structures company.
That is a long-term project and, in sharp contrast to last September, the
fear is now that the enthusiasm will get out of hand. The company has
flattered to deceive before. It seems well aware that it cannot afford to do
so again.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TV-am considers move into casinos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TV-AM, the breakfast television company, which placed a very bad bet in the
ITV franchise round is considering one final gamble.
Just as they are taking down the famous eggcups over the TV-am studios
before MTV moves in, the failed television company is thinking seriously
about going into the casino business.
TV-am is in talks to take over Crockfords, the Mayfair casino company whose
last published results show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10m for 1991. It is
not clear whether the club has done so well as the recession has deepened.
The television company, which lost out to Good Morning Television and the
Curzon Street casino, is talking about a complex deal involving a
simultaneous rights issue, Stock Exchange flotation and acquisition.
Crockfords was owned by Tiny Rowlands' Lonrho group, then by Brent Walker
before it changed hands in a management buy-out.
As far as the shareholders of TV-am were concerned the company was due to be
wound up and the money distributed. The studios had been sold for Pounds
3.5m and a 50 per cent stake in Virgin Radio was disposed of for about
Pounds 1.5m.
Instead shareholders were told about a proposal put to their board which
could lead to TV-am 'acquiring a new business and thereby continuing in
existence'.
A number of directors have stayed on at the company to explore the possible
takeover including Sir David Frost, the broadcaster, Mrs Edwina Coven,
former deputy chairman, Mr Richard Redmayne of stockbrokers Smith New Court,
and Mr Stratos Zographos, former finance director of TV-am and now finance
director of the ITV Network Centre.
TV-am still has assets of some Pounds 12m. It is not clear whether all the
directors are in favour of the casino plan.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chloride loss deepens to Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses of Chloride Group deepened from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 1.58m
in the year to March 31 but Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, was more
keen to emphasise the electronics and batteries group's improved performance
in the second half.
There is now only an African rump remaining from the once famous batteries
business and Mr Hodgkinson said that discussions for its sale were 'in
progress'.
That said, continuing activities on the batteries side were profitable,
albeit reduced to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 4.25m) on turnover down at Pounds
26.3m (Pounds 30.4m). Operating losses on the electronics side were static
at Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 2.22m) on turnover trimmed to Pounds 73.9m (Pounds
79.7m). In the second half, however, the division was Pounds 13,000 in the
black on turnover up at Pounds 39.8m, compared with the first six months'
Pounds 2.27m loss on Pounds 34.1m.
The electronics products fall in three areas: uninterruptible power supplies
for computers; emergency lighting, which relies on the construction market
but will be helped by health and safety legislation and European
harmonisation; and power conversion.
Mr Hodgkinson said it was only in the second half that management could be
'focused' on running the ongoing businesses. The annual figures included
above-the-line charges of Pounds 376,000 (dispute settlement costs), Pounds
1.11m (headquarters moving costs), and Pounds 916,000 (losses on disposals),
all of which were taken in the interim results.
Losses per share grew to 2p (1.8p) and there is no dividend.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Victaulic shares fall 20% on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market wiped 20 per cent off the value of shares in Victaulic
yesterday after the pipe and fittings supplier to British Gas warned that it
had seen a drop in its turnover in the first half of the year.
The company says it is suffering from a downturn in investment in pipeline
infrastructure at British Gas because of the uncertainty created by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the company.
'We were down last year, but the situation has deteriorated even further
this year and we're about 30 per cent off where we were in 1991,' said Mr
David Stewart, managing director.
The company said the delay in the publication of the monopolies commission's
report had cast a deeper cloud of uncertainty over the industry. The
commission is due to deliver its report by the end of July - it was granted
an extension to delay publication from April.
Victaulic said the reduction in activity levels would lead to pre-tax
profits for the half year being up to 20 per cent lower than in 1992.
In the first half of 1992, Victaulic made a profit of Pounds 6.9m on sales
of Pounds 51.2m.
The company's shares dropped yesterday from 315p to 253p.
Victaulic's experience is widespread across the gas supply industry,
according to Mr John Cull at the Society of British Gas Industries.
'Companies have seen their marketplace continue to tumble over the past year
with a dramatic effect on all parts of their business,' he said.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Hanson backs down over proposed rule changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has unexpectedly withdrawn a plan to give
its chairman greater control over the annual general meeting, following
strenuous opposition from shareholders.
Lord Hanson, chairman, said yesterday: 'My previous letter to shareholders,
asking for their permission to vary certain articles of association,
apparently gave some the impression that we were seeking to take draconian
powers over shareholders and to restrict their rights. This I regret as,
needless to say, this was not my intention.'
The changes would have eliminated the right of shareholders to nominate a
director to the board unless backers represented at least 10 per cent of the
vote. Also, shareholders would have lost the right to propose amendments to
resolutions at the meeting unless they represented 5 per cent of the
company's share capital.
Two leading shareholder groups, the Pensions Investment Advisory Council and
the National Association of Pension Funds, had organised the opposition.
Yesterday, Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the
NAPF, said: 'This decision is a very positive and responsible one from a
board which has listened to its shareholders.'
The offending proposals, contained in a broader set of suggested changes to
the articles of association, were due to have been approved at an
extraordinary general meeting on June 25.
All but one of the measures - the establishment of a new share option scheme
 -have been withdrawn. However, Hanson will call a second EGM in July at
which other measures, which were welcomed by shareholders, will be
resubmitted.
The move poses difficulties for the 20,000 Hanson shareholders who had
elected to take advantage of a scrip dividend option for the dividend
payable on July 1. Approval for Hanson to pay that dividend in shares rather
than cash is among the proposals which will not be voted on at the June 25
EGM.
Shareholders will be allowed to cancel their decision to receive their
dividends in shares, and instead earn cash to be paid on July 1. Those
wanting shares will be advised that receipt of certificates will be delayed
until after the second EGM.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Pilkington hopes for a clear recovery: The fitness regime of
UK glassmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE flow of news from Pilkington has been almost unremittingly bad since the
markets it supplies went into recession in 1990. For four years profits have
fallen, and last week the dividend was cut for only the second time in the
glassmaker's stock market history.
But Pilkington, the world's leading glass producer, is not alone in its
troubles. Mr Luc Willame, chief executive of Glaverbel, the Belgian glass
group controlled by Asahi Glass of Japan, said last month that prospects for
1993 'are frankly bad' as he predicted first-half losses.
Even so, the stock market has scented recovery at Pilkington. Its share
price has almost doubled from a low of 70p last October to close at 128p
yesterday. While last week's news of another profit fall and dividend cut
dampened the price, some feel the turning point has come. One analyst said:
'It's all so awful, it can only improve.'
But can Pilkington make the most of the upturn, having been handicapped in
the downturn, many would argue, by excess fat, over-investment and unhappy
diversification?
Pilkington suffers the fate of any large, continuous process industry with a
product that is traded internationally. Plant built at huge cost must run as
near full capacity as possible. In the upswing of the business cycle volumes
rise, capacity is filled, prices increase sharply and operators are tempted
to build new plants. Then in the downswing, that new capacity comes on
stream just as volumes weaken and a fight for market share leads to sharp
price reductions.
Pilkington has seen it all before. In the early 1980s it made losses in the
UK as the European glass market fell into disarray, amid overcapacity
created by newcomers from the US and Japan and a vicious price war.
The market recovered and by the second half of the 1980s prices shot up. The
industry responded by expanding, capacity rose again and prices are back to
their 1982 level.
Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's chief executive since last July, says: 'A
significant part of the reduction in profits from over Pounds 300m is market
driven. Given the overcapacity and price erosion, it's amazing we made a
profit at all.'
Pilkington would have fared better had it not spent Pounds 1bn on four new
float glass lines between 1987 and 1992, and Pounds 361m on diversifying
into the US contact lens market in 1987 - a deal done in the wake of BTR's
failed Pounds 1.2bn bid.
Shareholders who turned down BTR's bid, launched late in 1986 and equivalent
to 180.6p a share, have seen the price fall from more than 350p before the
October 1987 crash, and suffered a 60 per cent cut in the dividend over the
last two years.
Mr Leverton agrees that, in hindsight, the timing of its big investments was
not propitious. They have yet to make anything like a proper return. Without
them profits would be higher today, if only because the interest charge, a
crippling Pounds 75.7m in 1992-93, would be lower.
But the core business was not fighting fit on the way into the downturn.
Costs were too high and working capital control lax. Those problems have
been tackled, staff numbers cut, productivity increased and working capital
squeezed.
Mr Leverton says: 'When I arrived I did an exercise comparing Pilkington to
the competition. Pilkington was fairly comparable at the prime margin level
(after raw materials and labour, but before overheads) but it was clear
there were too many overheads. We had to drive costs out.'
After a year's work, he says: 'I believe that today we are more comparable
to PPG Industries and St Gobain (leading US and French glassmakers) on
overheads.'
Pilkington might now look forward to economic recovery. The US market is
beginning to pick up and the UK is seeing some revival with an 8 per cent
price increase imposed in February.
But mainland Europe is the black spot. Glass consumption and prices in
Germany, Pilkington's biggest market, are falling fast. Pilkington's main
customer there is the housing industry, still buoyed by German
reunification, and it had hoped to avoid the worst of recession. That turned
out to be another misjudgment.
A reduction in the automotive sector's glass purchases this year is hitting
hard. Price falls are spreading through continental Europe and could even
reverse the better outlook in the UK.
Of the hoped-for recovery, Mr Leverton says, 'a certain amount depends on
the market, but a lot of things are in our hands'. There is one happy legacy
of the late 1980s splurge of investment. 'Because of that high level of
investment, we must have the most modern plants in the industry. We have the
opportunity to be the lowest cost producer.'
While continuing the drive to cut costs, Pilkington is also going on the
offensive. In April it completed the Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams
glass distribution business, aiming to protect and expand its UK market
share.
Mr Leverton also means to tackle the balance sheet, aiming to cut gearing
from near 90 per cent to 40 per cent.
The sale of the Sola spectacle lens business is expected fairly soon, which
might raise Pounds 200m. Other disposals are planned.
While Pilkington has promised there will be no rights issue, speculation is
that it could sell new shares to Nippon Sheet Glass, the Japanese group
which owns 20 per cent of Libbey-Owens-Ford, Pilkington's North American
subsidiary.
Stockbrokers are forecasting profits recovering on a more gradual gradient
than they fell. The hope is that Pilkington will cover its dividend again by
1995 - helped by a low tax charge once UK profits revive - and perhaps reach
Pounds 200m pre-tax by 1996.
Some think, though, that the Pounds 325m peak will never be regained. 'You
will never get a combination of glass prices and volumes as crazy as that
again,' says one broker.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Futures exchanges compete for right to trade Mid 250
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO London-based futures exchanges are competing for the right to trade
futures and options contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, made up of the 250
UK stocks which rank below the FT-SE 100 index by market value.
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and
OMLX, the London-based arm of Sweden's OM Group, are both expected to submit
bids to the London Stock Exchange for the licence to trade these new
instruments in the next few months.
Interest in the Mid 250 index, created last October, has accelerated because
it has substantially outperformed the FT-SE 100 index of larger companies
over the last six months.
The creation of the Mid 250 index futures would allow fund managers to shift
their exposure between different parts of the market - a process known as
asset allocation - more easily.
But the success of new equity index products is not a foregone conclusion,
even when there is growing interest in the underlying market. Liffe launched
futures on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index of continental European stocks in
June 1991 but had to suspend the contracts last year due to low trading
volume.
Smith New Court, the integrated securities house, already quotes
over-the-counter futures on the Mid 250 index on Reuters but 'overall volume
has been disappointing,' according to Mr Gerald Freedman, director of
derivatives.
Both OMLX and Liffe are currently conducting research on the level of demand
for Mid 250 index products - in Liffe's case, in conjunction with the stock
exchange.
Liffe is the favourite to win the race, since it already trades futures and
options on the FT-SE 100 index. However, Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of
OMLX, said OMX Swedish stock index options are more heavily traded than the
FT-SE 100 options.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Booker meets Postel concern on pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food and agricultural group, has hired Mr Charles Bowen as its
new chief executive on terms designed to meet the concerns of some
institutional investors.
It is the first appointment by a large UK company since Mr Alistair Ross
Goobey, chief executive of Postel, Britain's largest pension fund, wrote to
leading companies expressing concern about rolling contracts. These can give
executives large pay-offs if they are sacked.
Mr Jonathan Taylor, who is moving from chief executive to chairman of Booker
on the retirement of Sir Michael Caine, said: 'We are abiding by the wishes
of Postel.' Mr Ralph Quartano, a former head of Postel, is a non-executive
director of Booker.
Mr Bowen will have an initial three-year fixed-term contract. After that
another fixed contract will be agreed or a rolling contract within Postel's
guidelines will be set. Mr Taylor declined to comment on the size of Mr
Bowen's salary.
Mr Bowen, who was headhunted from Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian subsidiary
of Hillsdown Holdings, said 'nothing in the remuneration package enables me
to do well if the company does badly'. He said the move to Booker was 'a
challenge, but not too daunting a one'.
Booker's shares rose 13p to 381p.

FT  18 JUN 93 / BAe reshapes to protect its dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is implementing a reorganisation of its businesses that
will protect its ability to pay dividends and give greater scope for joint
ventures.
If the necessary banking approvals are received, BAe's operating businesses
will be put into subsidiary companies and BAe plc will become an industrial
holding company. The changes are set to take effect from July 1.
The move will protect BAe's ability to pay dividends by sheltering the
company's reserves from losses in operating subsidiaries. Last September,
BAe was forced to apply to the courts for a capital reduction to allow it to
continue to pay dividends because losses in its regional jet business left
it with insufficient reserves.
BAe (Operations) Ltd will be the largest subsidiary and will contain the
defence, Airbus and aero-structures manufacturing businesses.
The Jetstream aircraft operations and Dynamics missiles division will go
into separate subsidiaries, making it easier for joint venture partners to
be found for these businesses.
BAe intends to merge its Hertfordshire-based missiles operations with the
French company Matra. The company is also thought to be talking to several
overseas regional airliner manufacturers about possible tie-ups for the
Jetstream commuter and regional turboprop business which has been
consolidated into one manufacturing site in Prestwick, Scotland.
The reorganisation was being done in a tax-efficient way, according to BAe.
The company generated significant tax losses when it wrote off Pounds 1bn
against its regional jet business last September.
Banking approvals may be required for the reorganisation, which BAe says
will not affect the security of the banks or of employees. BAe told staff
that their terms and conditions will remain unchanged.
When BAe was originally vested in 1978 all of its activities were within the
parent company, BAe plc. Acquisitions such as Rover, Royal Ordnance and
Ballast Nedam under the leadership of Professor Sir Roland Smith created
some subsidiaries.
'The hiving down of the remaining businesses will create a more rational
modern structure which should not affect banks or employees,' according to
Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Banks warn BT to cut cost of card fraud checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and credit card companies have warned BT that they may use US
telecommunications companies or Mercury, a competitor, to carry out
electronic fraud checks on card purchases unless BT cuts charges
substantially.
The credit and debit card companies have also warned that, if they do not
win lower prices for 'on-line' verification, they may install technology in
shops to allow them to check for fraud without using telecommunications
links.
The warnings have been given in joint talks between the banks, credit card
companies and BT over the price for the rapidly growing number of on-line
fraud checks, which the banks believe may reach 1bn a year by 1996.
BT emphasised yesterday that it intended to offer price reductions and
wanted a deal that would allow the market to expand.
Mr Peter Macleod, who is leading negotiations for BT, said the company was
encouraging a deal based on lower prices and higher volume. He said: 'We see
it as an attractive market.'
Mr Macleod said BT realised that the authentication business could be
offered to competitors if it did not reach a deal.
Credit and debit card companies and the banks that process card transactions
for retailers are worried at the growth of fraud, which cost the industry
Pounds 165.6m in 1991, and an estimated 10 per cent more last year.
However, fewer than one in five of last year's 1.2bn card transactions were
checked for fraud via telecommunications lines, against an 85 per cent check
rate in the US. Card companies blame that on the high cost of UK
telecommunications.
Mr Mervyn Gibson, who is leading talks for the banks and card companies,
said there was 'no indication of any impasse' with BT. He said they were
offering BT potential business volumes that deserved a 'substantial
reduction'.
Mr Gibson said the banks and card companies had 'made BT aware' of the
options. These included negotiating fresh contracts with US
telecommunications companies, and possibly offering some business to
Mercury, BT's UK rival.
BT agreed a deal with Barclays and National Westminster Bank last year that
halved the cost of fraud checks via BT's network. Barclays estimates that
each on-line check now costs a total of 4.5p in telecommunications charges.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays central retail services,
said UK telecommunications costs were 'still very high' compared with the
US, and unless they were cut, banks might opt for forms of fraud check that
avoided them.
He said card processing companies in France had opted for 'off-line' checks
such as asking customers using cards to key in a personal identification
number at the point of sale.

FT  18 JUN 93 / EBRD under fire for lack of impact on eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development's investments have made
an inadequate impact on eastern Europe's economies, according to a
confidential report commissioned by Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president.
The report - by Mr Martin Paijmans and Mr Stanley Katz, consultants who have
worked for the EBRD - says the 'bank's impact comes up short as compared to
the use of its resources'.
In the two years since the bank was created, private-sector financing 'has
been concentrated in fewer than a half-dozen recipient countries (Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia)'.
It accuses the EBRD of failing to make a 'coherent . . . contribution to the
(east European) economic transition process'. It adds that when the bank has
funded public-sector projects only a few countries have benefited and
investments have been confined to a few sectors: notably communications,
construction and energy. Of the 25 countries the EBRD can assist, 'some nine
or 10 . . . have received little or no financial assistance'.
In his preface to the report, given to the bank's 23 directors, Mr Attali
says it is 'one element' in his decision to propose a radical reorganisation
of the bank's management. The board has also received a report by Mr Attali
recommending the creation of three senior management positions, all
reporting to him.
He urges, as do Mr Katz and Mr Paijmans, that the bank's development banking
and merchant banking operations should be merged and divided into three
'operations departments', each covering a group of countries.
At the moment, merchant banking provides private-sector investments, while
development banking concentrates on financing infrastructure projects.
However, Mr Katz and Mr Paijmans say there is increasing duplication of
staffing and organisations in the two departments, which confuses potential
clients.
They say the bank's basic flaw is that its investments have been based on
the merits of individual projects, rather than the needs of a particular
economy, curbing the bank's influence on the development of the private
sectors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UN attack 'crippled' Somali warlord, Clinton says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton early today declared that the United Nations military
operation in Somalia was 'over' and a 'success'.
He told a White House press conference that General Colin Powell, chairman
of the US joint chiefs of staff, had advised him that the forces of General
Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord, had been 'crippled'.
Referring to the death of 23 Pakistani peacekeepers in an ambush on June 5,
Mr Clinton said: 'We could not let this go unpunished.' The credibility of
UN peacekeeping and the existing relief operations in Somalia had been at
stake.
Gen Aideed had not been captured, Mr Clinton said. If he were, it would be
up the UN to decide what action to take against him.
'The purpose of the operation was to undermine the ability of Aideed to
wreak military havoc in Somalia,' he said. 'The military back of Aideed has
been broken. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.'
The future of Somalia, he said, lay with the Somalis themselves and he
encouraged them to concentrate on 'nation building'.
On Bosnia, the president said that if the three warring factions - the
Serbs, Croats and Moslems - 'genuinely and honestly' agreed to a solution
different from the Vance-Owen peace plan, 'I would have to look at it very
seriously'.
Mr Clinton stoutly reaffirmed his support for Nato, arguing that, though its
enemies might be different and more diffuse, it had not lost its sense of
purpose.
On domestic issues, which took up most of the press conference, Mr Clinton
said it was probably unrealistic to expect Congress to pass healthcare
reform this year, but that there would be no excuse for ducking it next
year.
But, basking in the glow of Congressional action in the past 24 hours, he
said it was clear 'we are now putting our economic house in order'.
He had reservations about the loss of his energy tax, but took consolation
in the fact that most of his investment proposals were still intact.
Economic trends, he said, if not the current state of the economy, were
good, not least because of the expectation that interest rates would remain
low.
Using charts in the manner of Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate in
last year's presidential election, he maintained with some fluency that
deficit reduction would benefit all Americans.
There was a limit, he said, in a recession as to how far the deficit could
reasonably be contracted.
The five-year Dollars 500bn deficit reduction plan, therefore, was
appropriate to current economic circumstances.

British Aerospace's management is clearly moving on to the front foot if the
imminent corporate reorganisation is any guide. The new structure is
unlikely to upset BAe's banks or, by implication, the share price and is a
more rational basis for a modern industrial holding company. Indeed, once it
has digested the current changes, it might make sense for BAe to go further
and group its overseas subsidiaries together. The confidence to tinker with
the corporate structure clearly flows from success in tackling the problems
which led to BAe's very own Black Wednesday last September.
Yet developments since the new team took charge are also a glaring
condemnation of the past. Under Sir Roland Smith, the company grew like
topsy, but management controls were sadly lacking. Perhaps an unfortunate
coincidence of the secrecy in defence and slackness elsewhere proved an
explosive cocktail. The board will need to use management controls to spread
transparency and accountability through the group if the shock of last year
is not to fade and the risk of further mishap resurface. That will be a slow
business, as the enthusiasts in the stock market seem inclined to forget.

FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The profits of a regulated water utility can go down as well as up. Without
a timely reduction in the annual charge taken to cover the upkeep of its
sewers, Severn Trent's water business would barely have nosed ahead last
year. The impact of recession on industrial demand and higher interest costs
took a toll. Since Severn Trent's capital investment has peaked earlier than
others in the sector, the impact of gearing on the bottom line is a taste of
things to come. If that is an argument in favour of diversification, though,
yesterday's figures are a poor example of how to go about it.
Biffa lost money again after interest costs. Since the acquisition was
funded with fixed-rate money at 11.5 per cent, lower base rates have not
improved matters. While margins are under pressure, there is limited scope
for a recovery in operating profits this year. Higher prices for landfill
disposal would help. But with the government's new licensing arrangements
postponed, it is by no means clear that price increases will stick. One can
only hope that the Pounds 3.3m spent last year touting for international
business will yield a better return.
That will matter less if Severn Trent achieves a favourable outcome from
next year's regulatory review, but trying to pick winners on that score
looks a recipe for an early bath.

After the fourth monthly fall in a row it is difficult to believe that the
trend of unemployment has not turned. Doubtless Jobcentres are putting
pressure on people to leave the register, and the workforce may be shrinking
for other reasons too. But yesterday's figures also suggest employment is
increasing. The slightly worrying aspect is that the turnround comes when
average earnings are still rising at a rate as high as 4 per cent. With
settlements around 3 per cent and falling, though, it could be some while
before wage pressures resurface. Meanwhile, industry continues to reap large
productivity gains.
Coupled with encouraging retail price figures, this is good news for the
long end of the gilt market, which perceives an attractive combination of
low inflation with growth that may help reduce the PSBR. The short end has
to come to terms with the realisation that a rate cut is not imminent. After
the latest data, the chancellor need not hurry.
This is not to say that decisions on rates will be easy. The cabinet
decision to stick to existing public spending control totals next year is
fairly tough. But it may leave Mr Clarke having to resort to more tax
increases if growth turns out insufficient to revive tax revenues
significantly. At that stage, a rate cut would be a useful option. The
question is what will happen to sterling - back above DM2.50 yesterday  - if
he waits till the budget. The Bundesbank is moving at a snail's pace, but
even it will surely have lopped some more off the Lombard rate by November.

FT  18 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zero hour for Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The closing of Zeneca's rights issue on Monday ends a sequence of events
which started with Hanson's appearence on ICI's share register in May 1991.
The story so far has generated more excitement than value. Yesterday's
aggregate of ICI's and Zeneca's share prices is around 10 per cent higher
than the price Hanson paid for a stake in unified ICI. The All-Share index
has risen by 19 per cent over the same period. While the rights issue hangs
over Zeneca, such judgments may be premature. How long the issue acts as a
drag turns on how much is taken up, and whether shareholders choose to
retain their stock or sell in the market.
On most measures, the 600p rights price looks fair value. A price earnings
ratio of 11 times this year's forecast earnings - against a market average
of 14 - is doubtless a far cry from what was envisaged when the
demerger-plus-rights plan was hatched. If the scheme ever was an
opportunistic attempt to raise equity for ICI as a whole on a fancy
multiple, it must be considered a failure. But while institutions are
re-weighting their investment portfolios away from drugs stocks - as
Prudential did last week - a low multiple does not guarantee Zeneca an easy
ride.
But the process of reweighting will only run so far. Once the regulatory
climate is clearer which, given the complexities of the US political process
may not be until the autumn, the sector should rally. Drugs companies have
no divine right to trade on a multiple above the market average. Those which
make headway will have to deal imaginatively with tougher price controls. If
demerger really does allow Zeneca's management to run the business with more
drive and vision than was possible within the corporate giant, it stands at
least a fighting chance of staying with the pack.
On that basis the shares are worth holding at the rights price. As the
shake-out in the drugs industry continues, though, it would be rash to
expect a windfall gain. Having sold his stake in ICI at Pounds 14 a share
last year, Lord Hanson may have had the best of the trade.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Never let it be said that London is a graveyard of a posting these days for
aspiring foreign diplomats.
Yoav Biran, Israel's ambassador to the Court of St James these past four and
a half years, is moving on later this year to a pivotal position in his
country's foreign ministry: deputy director-general in charge of the Middle
East and the peace process.
With the peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in
Washington still making exceptionally heavy weather, the job could hardly
have come up at a more critical time in Middle Eastern affairs.
There is a hitch, though: Israel's tortuous inter-ministerial politics.
Relations between those perennial Labour party sparring partners, foreign
minister Shimon Peres and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, are as prickly as
ever.
Biran is said to have good relations with both his boss and the prime
minister. But he must be worried that he will be forced to spend less of his
time on the Middle East negotiations than on shuttle diplomacy between Peres
and Rabin.

Will the European Commission pick an insider to replace John Drew, who has
stepped down from his job as the EC's number one flag-waver in London?
Although it is a pretty well-paid post and has a nice office, the EC's
London outpost has not done a very good job of getting its message across.
It has also been slammed for its chaotic organisation. A lot is expected of
Drew's successor.
Drew was an outsider - he was director of European affairs at Touche Ross -
and this time around there is a strong lobby in Brussels for his replacement
to be an insider - someone who knows the ropes. Jeff Martin, a breezy
Irishman who was Drew's deputy, is one possibility. But it sounds as if Sir
Leon Brittan, the senior of the two UK commissioners, wants to give the task
of refurbishing the EC's dismal image in Britain to an outsider. An ideal
job, perhaps, for an out-of-work Tory MP who has given up hope of being
re-elected?
Or even Labour's ex-leader Neil Kinnock?

FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: Booker's snap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Observer would hate to sound a sour note about Booker's brand new chief
executive, Charles Bowen. But has anyone spotted the superficial
similarities between Booker's new ceo and Tate &amp; Lyle's recently departed
head honcho, Stephen Brown? Brown didn't even last a year in the job.
One thing both companies obviously have in common is Jonathan Taylor, now
chairman of Booker and a non-executive director of the sugar and sweeteners
group since 1988. Another is that both operations are in the agribusiness, a
third is that each appointee is coming from Canada. Finally, even the names
of the ceo's are only one letter different.
But that is where the similarities stop. For a start, Brown was on a luxury
three-year rolling contract, while Bowen has a fixed term. Bowen comes from
a food industry background but he has also run lots of diverse businesses
which is what Booker is all about. Brown, by contrast, was imported from
Alcan, a highly focused company making aluminium.
Further, it would be hard to find two more dissimilar chairmen than the
laid-back Taylor and the interfering Neil Shaw.

Brian Baldock, aside from being deputy chairman of Guinness, is also
chairman of the Lord's Taverners, and Wednesday's eve-of-test match dinner
was supposed to be his big night. So imagine his feelings on spotting his
former boss, ex-jail bird Ernest Saunders, not only among the guests but
bang next door to one of the two Guinness tables. The two apparently had not
met since Saunders' ignominious exit in 1986. Given that Baldock owes his

FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: Greek tug of war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian navy has just sent out an urgent SOS. Two of the biggest salvage
tugs in the world have gone missing and it wants them back. If anyone spots
them please contact V Eryomin, deputy CINC of the Russian navy in Moscow.
In fact the two tugs - Giant and Challenger - are not hard to find. They are
holed up in Greece where they are the showpieces of the Tsavliris brothers'
fast growing salvage fleet. The family announced the acquisition back in
March.
However, the Russian navy believes it still owns the tugs and has warned
international banks against taking out mortgages on the vessels. Like much
else in Russia, it is all the fault of private enterprise. To earn extra
money, the Russian navy leased the tugs to a privately-run shipping company
and matters seem to have got a bit out of hand. According to a circular that
the Russians have sent to international banks, the tugs were then
re-registered in Malta with fake documents and have now resurfaced in the
Tsavliris fleet.
Understandably, the Tsavliris family is rather upset by the broadside from
the Russian navy. 'We are bona fide operators. We cannot afford not to be,'
says George Tsavliris, adding that 'we have dotted every I and crossed every
T'. Let's hope that the Russian navy doesn't take the law into its own hands
and send one of its out-of-work battleships to settle the dispute.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BY DITHERING over the future of Rosyth and Devonport, the dockyards where
the navy's ships are overhauled, the government has only stoked up public
controversy and made its own decision harder. The search to minimise
political damage risks producing an unsatisfactory compromise.
A decision has been forced by the need for updated facilities to refuel and
refit nuclear-powered submarines, including a dock big enough for the new
Trident ballistic missile vessels. Since the ministry now envisages a fleet
of no more than 16 submarines, it wants just one site to carry out this
vital part of the yards' workload.
A strong case can be made for either of the privately managed dockyards.
Devonport is bigger, part of a larger naval complex than Rosyth's, and
argues it can achieve greater efficiency. On the other hand, Rosyth has
always looked after Britain's Polaris submarines, is not far by land from
the Trident base at Faslane, on the other side of Scotland, and was
originally earmarked for the Trident work.
Both yards are the dominant employers in unemployment blackspots. But there
is no getting around the implications of reduced defence requirements,
either in the dockyards or in the private-sector shipbuilders. The outcry
over Swan Hunter on Tyneside, in receivership after losing a contract bid
last month, cannot change the sad reality that the UK has at least one naval
shipbuilder too many. It probably also has twice the specialised refitting
capacity it needs.
The ministry wants maximum savings and as much competition as possible.
These are not as compatible as might appear. There is little doubt among top
defence officials that the greatest efficiency would be obtained by
consolidating the Pounds 500m-a-year refit programme in a single yard.
The impact on the losing region would of course have financial as well as
political implications, since it would require large-scale emergency aid. In
any event, it is a nettle the government is evidently not prepared to grasp.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has pledged to keep both yards
open, in order to maintain competition for surface ships. But the 'healthy
competitive structure' he envisages is unlikely to come about. Having
committed itself to both yards, the government will have to guarantee work
to the yard that loses the submarine contest, at least for a period.
The navy will also have lost an opportunity to change the way it handles the
servicing of its frigates and smaller warships. Nuclear submarines require
extensive periods in dock, but the modern surface vessels could be
maintained with frequent mini-refits.
The emerging compromise is designed to keep down short-term costs and share
job cuts between the two yards. But it is one in which neither of the two
communities, nor the navy, nor in the longer run the taxpayer, will be
well-served.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Reforming Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST A few weeks ago, it would have seemed implausible, to say the least,
that a Japanese government could be brought to the brink of collapse over
the question of electoral reform. The fact that it has been, with a
no-confidence motion from opposition parties being voted on today, is a sign
of how far the issue has moved up the political agenda. It is unlikely to go
away, whether the Miyazawa cabinet survives or is forced to call elections,
thus jeopardising the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's majority in the
lower house of parliament for the first time since 1955.
Cynics will say that the struggle now unfolding between conservatives and
reformers in the LDP is just another of the factional fights that are the
party's life blood. Since the mid-1970s it has been strengthened by numerous
challenges from reformist groups because it has eventually embraced their
demands and their supporters. The LDP has succeeded partly by delivering
sustained economic growth, but also by extending its reach from its original
conservative rural constituencies into urban areas. Its instincts for
survival should never be underestimated.
Yet there are three reasons for thinking that reform is now a real issue.
First, many Japanese politicians, business leaders and bureaucrats believe
reformed political institutions are needed for Japan to fulfil a larger
world role. Second, the Japanese public's disaffection with political
corruption has grown with successive scandals: it wants reforms which will
deliver less corrupt politicians. Third, neither main party is fully able to
give voice to new currents in Japanese society. The Social Democratic
Party's largely unreformed socialist ideology makes it an unelectable
opposition. The LDP's younger politicians, representing relatively
cosmopolitan urban dwellers, are constrained by older representatives of
rural constituencies bred on protectionism and pork barrel public works
spending.
Many younger politicians want reforms which will encourage a split in the
LDP and create a modernising centrist opposition party, which would promote
liberalisation of markets at home and free trade by standing up to Japanese
farming interests. In theory such an opposition could displace the
socialists, and mount a challenge to the conservatives who would remain in
the LDP.
That may not, of course, be the immediate result of the sort of electoral
reforms that have recently been mooted. The replacement of large,
multi-member constituencies by smaller, single-seat constituencies, for
example, could further strengthen the LDP at the expense of smaller parties.
Yet the case for making Japanese politics less corrupt and more transparent,
less parochial and more outward looking, is becoming irresistible. Even if
the current crisis passes, the pressure for reform is bound to arise again
in another form.

FT  18 JUN 93 / To each according to his guile: Corruption at all levels of
Russian life is impeding the reforms that could sweep it away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visitors flying into Moscow confront a sign when they present their
passports for inspection: 'It is forbidden to offer souvenirs or money to
officials.'
Bribery at airports is just one sign of Russia's endemic corruption gnawing
at the government, law enforcement, the armed forces, the banking system,
the state-owned media and business.
Russia has always been corrupt - from early Tsarist times, when officials'
wages comprised nothing but bribes, to the Soviet era, when Communist party
functionaries colluded with criminal gangs in a number of ways to exploit
the state monopoly over the economy.
But today, official corruption and embezzlement of state property are so
pervasive that Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi claims it reaches President
Boris Yeltsin's entourage and threatens the foundations of the Russian
state.
Mr Rutskoi said last Friday: 'For 72 years, first the Communist mafia robbed
the state, now the democratic mafia does it.' For Ms Ella Pamfilova, the
social welfare minister who opposed official privileges in the old Soviet
parliament, corruption is the obstacle on which market reforms 'constantly
stumble'.
In theory, the reforms should sharply reduce opportunities for corruption by
removing state controls on prices and the distribution of goods and
services. But the short-term picture is different. Corruption could stall
the reforms because too many officials have a vested interest in retaining
control of assets and economic decision-making. And, in the early days of
their implementation, the reforms, including the ambitious privatisation
programme, are creating opportunities for corruption.
Some politicians fear the extent of corruption could spark a public backlash
against change. 'People are developing fully justified discontent which
could lead to a rebellion, to the pendulum swinging back to . . . 1937 (the
height of Stalin's purges),' warns Mr Yuri Boldyrev, state inspector
responsible for rooting out corruption in the Yeltsin administration until
he was fired in March - it is widely believed to appease officials whom he
was investigating.
He may be wrong about a direct political backlash, given the resignation of
a sceptical Russian public. But once Russians realise the extent of the role
played by corruption in economic mismanagement, their attitude may change.
For instance, artificially low domestic prices for energy and other
commodities are encouraging entrepreneurs, in league with corrupt officials,
to make fortunes from exporting Russia's natural wealth - with little left
over for tax authorities.
One Russian government estimate suggests budget revenues could increase
threefold if export quotas and domestic price controls on energy were
removed. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister, is looking for
ways to remove quotas, free energy prices, and devise market mechanisms for
transferring funds where they are most needed. It is not clear he will be
allowed to succeed because of divisions in the cabinet.
In addition, corruption, along with the arbitrary behaviour of the
authorities, is discouraging new investment and the emergence of small
businesses. Foreign and local businessmen are exposed to demands for bribes
from officials who could invent reasons to hold up projects.
The banking system, at the core of Russia's efforts to move to a market
economy, is also not immune. The central bank, which controls the
distribution of large amounts of cheap credits and 90 per cent of bank
transfers, is open to corruption, according to its former chairman, Mr
Georgy Matiukhin. He says it is possible to bribe 'young female employees
with a bottle of French perfume'. Although he did not amplify, the arrest
last week of five employees, who worked in the central bank's clearing
system, on charges of diverting funds with forged transfer documents,
underlines the vulnerability of a paper-based bureaucracy.
The reasons and opportunities for corruption are clear. Demoralised
officials, impoverished by price liberalisation and unhindered by fears of
retribution from a weakened state, are grabbing what they can to secure a
comfortable future.
'The poor chinovnik (bureaucrat) . . . is left face to face with the
entrepreneur who has large amounts of money to spend,' wrote Mr Yevgeny
Savostianov, the deputy chief of the security ministry, as the KGB is now
called. 'Only spiritual giants can resist temptation in such conditions,' he
said, pleading for better pay and conditions for civil servants.
Several officials in charge of privatisation are being investigated for
abuses despite a relatively transparent system for the disposal of state
property. According to Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister,
'crime and corruption are the function of a weak state'. But he argues that
rapid progress in privatising large chunks of the state-owned economy will,
in time, reduce opportunities for corruption.
It is no surprise that the state is described in colloquial Russian as a
'kormushka' - or feeding trough - for corrupt officials.
The extent of the illegalities and mismanagement have raised fears that
western aid for Russian reforms will simply be wasted. But Mr Mario Blejer,
a senior World Bank economist and frequent visitor to the former Soviet
Union, says that corruption cannot be an argument for withholding aid. He
argues, like many others, that the west can best help by continuing to make
large-scale assistance conditional on the reduction of state controls and
other economic reforms.
The reforms would also help stem capital flight. 'When stable conditions
arise for investment in Russia, Russian businessmen will be the first to
bring their money back to Russia,' predicts Mr Blejer.
Creating the stable economic conditions which would make corruption less
attractive means a struggle on three main fronts. One is institutional
reform. A second is synchronising the different reform elements, such as
liberalisation, demonopolisation and stabilisation. The third is creating a
competent government.
Some headway is being made in building the institutions and laws needed to
combat corruption. Legislation now before parliament defines corruption for
the first time - as 'the use of an official position . . . for the illegal
gain of material and any other benefits . . . and also the offering of these
benefits'. It also requires officials to declare their revenues, place their
assets in trust while they are in office, and bans them from simultaneously
working for private companies.
But institutional reforms will fail if attempted in isolation. Mr Blejer
believes two Latin American examples are appropriate to the Russian case.
'Argentina and Mexico were corrupt from top to bottom. But the problem was
largely solved by reducing the (bureaucratic) controls that people could
exercise on others,' he says.
Having taken over the fight against corruption from his vice-president, Mr
Yeltsin has yet to demonstrate that he has the political will to tackle the
problem. General Aslanbek Aslakhanov, a former police chief who is now the
head of parliament's committee for law and order, complains: 'At least in
the old days we arrested people. Now you can even read in the newspapers
about officials giving away buildings for personal gain and nobody could
care less.' Indeed, until now, corruption allegations have been mostly used
by politicians to discredit rivals.
Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the former justice minister, wrote in Moscow News last
week that, when he told Mr Yeltsin about a deputy prime minister who had
'committed a crime in the United States', the embattled leader had replied:
'Never mind, he's one of ours and he is very energetic.'
When forced to choose, Mr Yeltsin has tended to put officials' loyalty to
him wabove their ability to deliver decisive policies and clean government.
His recent referendum victory gave him a mandate to pursue radical political
and economic reforms. But the evidence so far suggests that any success
against corruption is likely to be a result of economic improvements rather
than a result of legislation and enforcement by the government.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Ukraine control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Ukrainian government has moved to take control of many of the nuclear
weapons on its territory, so President Leonid Kravchuk has unilaterally
assumed personal command over the government, putting the reformist prime
minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, in charge of a special emergency economic
committee. But Ukraine's new team will have to act rapidly if it is to halt
the country's slide towards economic disaster and pacify an increasingly
restive population.
While the country's leaders have been locked in a bitter struggle for power,
Ukraine's planned economy has continued to disintegrate, as Russian oil
prices have jumped and inter-republican trade collapsed. Inflation has
accelerated to over 50 per cent a month while the country's currency has
depreciated this year by over 250 per cent against the US dollar.
Ukraine's political structures are equally precarious. While Ukrainians gave
an overwhelming 90 per cent endorsement to independence in the 1991
referendum, the miners' strikes, which are now engulfing the
Russian-speaking eastern regions suggest that, unless sovereignty soon
delivers the prosperity voters expect, their patience will run out.
The current political and economic instability would be worrying even
without Ukraine's status as the only non-Russian republic which possesses an
indigenous nuclear capacity. Mr Kuchma has declared that Ukraine should
retain, at least temporarily, the 46 SS-24 inter-continental ballistic
missiles on its territory, a proposal which parliament appears ready to
embrace.
The west should resist the temptation to bully and, instead, offer financial
aid in return for nuclear disarmament. The International Monetary Fund has
rightly urged Russia to move to world prices for its oil. But without
financial help to cushion the blow, the Ukrainian government's only
alternative to inflation would be rapidly to close loss-making coalmines and
heavy industry. To do so would be to court civil commotion, in which Russian
nationalist politicians might be tempted to intervene.
For now, the ball is in Mr Kravchuk's court. He must show that his
unilateral assumption of extra authority over the government is more than a
bid for greater personal power. Mr Kuchma must be allowed to accelerate
reform by assuming control over Ukraine's runaway central bank and
reaffirming the commitment to liberalisation and privatisation. IMF aid can
help prevent the dual threats of hyperinflation and confrontation in eastern
Ukraine, but only once Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma demonstrate that the money
will not be wasted.
Ukraine's new leadership is playing a risky game with the west. But it does
so in the knowledge that a heavily armed, but impoverished and unstable
Ukraine, located next door to an unfriendly Russia, is a dangerous
combination.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Personal View: Maybe not even jam for east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM ROLLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Monday in Copenhagen, the EC Commission will propose to the European
summit improvements in economic and political relations with central and
eastern Europe. This is an attempt to deal with increased dissatisfaction
with the European agreements concluded during the past 18 months with
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania.
The improvements include some rather minor acceleration in the trade
liberalisation timetable, increased political co-operation, better aid
procedures and, most importantly, a much stronger commitment to eventual EC
membership. The weaknesses of the trade concessions, however, undermine both
immediate export and growth prospects in central and eastern Europe and, in
the longer term, the very objective of EC membership.
Two categories of protection give particular cause for concern: trade in
so-called sensitive products, notably agriculture, textiles and steel; and
anti-dumping and safeguards clauses (known as contingent protection).
Agriculture, textiles and steel are significant in EC trade with eastern
Europe and current protectionist measures are long lasting. On agriculture,
Common Agricultural Policy protection is broadly equivalent to 100 per cent
tariffs and only very minor concessions are given. On textiles, multi-fibre
arrangement quotas still in place will only begin to be dismantled once the
Uruguay round is settled and there will be a special safeguard clause. Steel
is protected by the general safeguard clause plus special safeguard clauses
for the Balkan countries.
The Commission proposed speeding up cuts in some EC duties and the rate at
which reduced-levy quotas on farm goods are increased; changing some tariff
quotas to tariff ceilings with discretionary tariffs; and relaxing rules of
origin so goods from other eastern European associates and the European Free
Trade Association countries count as local content.
These are welcome, if minor, improvements, though at the Foreign Affairs
Council on June 9 they were weakened further by the removal of the proposed
shift from tariff quotas to ceilings and by putting aside relaxation of
rules of origin for later consideration.
I contend that the Commission and member states have not properly addressed
the issues in eastern Europe. Trade is what is important.
Liberalisation need not harm EC workers if accompanied by sensible
compensation policies and will in fact benefit EC export industries.
For the east Europeans the sensitive products already represent between 25
per cent and 40 per cent of exports to the EC. They are where short-term
competitive advantage lies. The contingent protection provisions will stymie
the export potential in new industries. Thus the Europe agreements help
freeze the structure of industry. This is significant because neither aid
nor private capital flows is likely to provide the foreign exchange
necessary to fund foreign capital goods needed to re-tool industry. Only
increased exports and domestic savings can do that.
Significant liberalisation of eastern European trade in sensitive products
should not cause notable damage to EC producers. Savings to EC consumers and
taxpayers are enough to compensate for producers' losses. Evidence suggests
that eastern European imports, including into the former Soviet Union, could
expand fourfold to Ecu500bn by 2010. Trade restrictions now, though, will
stop it happening. They will slow growth and hence delay and perhaps prevent
accession to the EC - the only prize the Community seems willing to offer.
What should be done? I would put forward five proposals. Increase levy-free
quotas for agricultural goods. Liberalise textile quotas and reduce the
timetable from five to three years. Make a commitment now to no new
safeguard quotas on steel. Take advantage of the east Europeans'
implementation of EC competition law by the mid-1990s and offer to suspend
anti-dumping and safeguard clauses once that is done to the Commission's
satisfaction. Finally, relax the rules of origin as proposed in the
Commission paper.
This agenda will offer immediate and long-lasting advantages to east
European traders. It increases prospects for growth in eastern European
countries and hence the probability that they will become major EC markets
as well as EC members. Without such liberalisation there is a danger that EC
membership will become an unattainable goal. The improved EC commitment to
membership without significant liberalisation is a promise of jam tomorrow
and possibly not even that.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Assault on law'n'order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new home secretary is anxious to win the confidence of the police.
There's a revelation for you. In most circumstances it would be information
of the quality of 'dog bites man'. This week, however, it is significant.
Let me explain. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the previous home secretary, is a
rumbustious fellow; his approach to police reform was naturally combative.
He was, say the constables with their celebrated tact, controversial. His
translation to chancellor has so far been a public-relations success; hired
as the best mouthpiece, or spreader of bovine fertiliser, in the government
he has been spreading away as fast as he can, to general applause. This may
assist in the process of selling the Treasury's economic policy, but it
detaches him from the delicate task of restructuring Britain's police
forces. We will therefore never know how the increasingly difficult
relationship between Kenneth the Mouth and those very forces might have
ended.
His successor, Mr Michael Howard, is a quite different character. Where Mr
Clarke is rough, Mr Howard is smooth. Where the chancellor is taken at his
word, the home secretary will ever be judged by his actions. The former
comes running at his opponents, knuckledusters rampant; the latter deploys
an equally lethal, albeit often misleading, smile. Both are ambitious, but
it is the relaxed Mr Clarke who seems to his colleagues to be acceptably so.
By the standards of the present government, both show political ability.
They fill two of the ministries collectively known as the great offices of
state. The foreign secretary, the triple-A Mr Douglas Hurd, occupies the
third. If any trio of colleagues can give the prime minister hope that his
authority might be restored, this is it.
Since the recent reshuffle much attention has been focused on Mr Clarke, who
is there to rebuild faith in the government's economic management, and some
on Mr Hurd, whose present purpose is to find a European policy around which
the Conservative party can reunite. Yet if pure politics be the touchstone,
Mr Howard's mission is also of some importance. It is, shortly stated, to
counter the extremely effective offensive on law and order mounted by the
Labour spokesman, Mr Tony Blair. Mr Blair has managed to convey the
impression that, far from being soft on crime, he knows how to deal with
thieves and thugs while the Tories do not.
The new home secretary has been set the task of recapturing this area of
policy so that it may resume its historic function as a Conservative
stronghold. He will delight in this. He throws himself into these things.
When he was environment secretary he went to Brazil and hugged a tree. I am
reminded of the late Mr George Wallace, governor of Alabama, who in his
early political life declared that he would not be 'out-segged' by any
opponent who professed an allegiance to segregation. Mr Howard is not going
to be out-law'n'ordered by anybody, not if he can help it.
He will be obliged to rely on symbolic gestures. For there is not much he
can do to reduce crime. Although he can tighten the law, in ways already
signalled by Mr Clarke, the overall effect is unpredictable. The government
may put a few young artful dodgers into 'secure accommodation' (which Mr
Blair has long demanded). It may also make it easier to tackle 'new age'
travellers. Hard professional criminals have little to fear. For the home
secretary cannot significantly increase spending on the police; Mr Clarke's
difficulty over the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement probably
requires the government to reduce it.
The rate of burglaries will therefore continue to creep gently upwards; so
will crimes of violence, albeit from a low base. I will not trouble you with
numbers. As those who follow these matters are aware, there is no hokum to
beat the pure hogwash of our national crime statistics. What counts
politically is the quantity of media scare stories, and anecdotal evidence.
Mr Howard's task, therefore, is to change the electorate's perceptions. This
suggests a strategy of playing to the public's darkest fears and prejudices.
Enter the side-handled baton. This first came to global prominence when it
was used by Los Angeles police on Mr Rodney King. Police everywhere lust
after it. We British would never contemplate such a fearsome weapon; it is
so obtrusive. Mr Howard has, however, been presented with a fold-away,
hide-away version of the cops' favourite new nightstick, and he has
announced that the police may experiment with its use. Mr Blair has not
demurred.
All of this is a preliminary to what could be a difficult summer for the
home secretary. The new chief of Scotland Yard, commissioner Paul Condon,
has warned his staff that the Yard may have to make officers redundant,
following the report of the inquiry into police responsibilities and
rewards, headed by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries. This is
expected soon. It is anticipated that Sir Patrick will propose the
decimation of the upper ranks. This will put Mr Howard to the test.
On his table will be recommendations for the greatest restructuring of
police management since the war. He may take a while to think about it, but
he will have to respond. Mr Condon has also warned of more 'market testing',
which means gradual privatisation.
There is a clash of purposes here. The home secretary's overriding task is
to show Conservative voters that he, not Mr Blair, is the true friend of the
law, the protector of safe streets and inviolate homes. His other pressing
job is to persist with the challenge to the vested interests of the police
federation and prison officers' association, two of the few remaining UK
institutions that can make real trouble for the government. He will
doubtless seek to reconcile these objectives by offering good redundancy
packages, autonomy for local police captains, local budgetary control, and
the like.
If Mr Howard was a member of a secure government operating in a good year,
the odds might be that he would make a success of the twin endeavours upon
which he has embarked. But his experience may not be enough. He must also
win the trust of both the police and the public, which means saying
different things out of each side of his mouth. Perhaps he should apply to
the chancellor for lessons in popular locution.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Pensions trustees and fiduciary duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID CARUTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many of us, particularly those involved in the law, were interested to
read the article by John Plender on the case relating to trustees and the
difficulty in pursuing them for negligence ('A question of trust and
security', June 9).
Mr John Quarrell is of the view that 'it is almost impossible to pursue a
trustee for negligence when it comes to investment'. That may indeed be so.
Should a trustee make what would appear to the layman to be a 'bad'
investment, there is almost certainly no negligence. Nevertheless,
circumstances can arise which could be just that. An example is, if expert
professional advisers have given strong advice to the effect that an
investment in X would be disastrous for stated reasons and the trustees
nevertheless go ahead and invest. In such a case there must surely be a
strong argument in favour of negligence by the trustees.
It is important, however, to look further and consider not only negligence.
Trustees may be in breach of fiduciary duty. In the Melton Medes case,
although still under review, that is nevertheless an allegation which I
should anticipate might be made.
A conflict of interest can often give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty. If
a trustee put the affairs of either himself or maybe his company before the
proper requirements of his beneficiaries, it is a breach of fiduciary duty.
For example, assume a trustee receives advice that he should invest in a
particular property development and, at the same time, his company would be
well advised to do so. If the trustee ignores the investment entirely for
his beneficiaries and invests wholly for the company, there is a distinct
risk he would be in breach of fiduciary duty. The point I wish to make is
that all is not lost for beneficiaries, and trustees still have to look to
their laurels.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Thorp backed by Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KOHJI KANEKO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Ministers set to back Thorp plant' (June 16), quoted the
advertisement by 'Japanese Citizens Concerned about Plutonium' and stated
'the group claimed that the Japanese power utilities no longer wanted the
plant to go ahead because it was accumulating too much plutonium'.
This is not a correct argument. On behalf of all the Japanese electric power
companies here, I would like to explain about our nuclear strategy.
Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and recycling plutonium is Japan's
fundamental nuclear policy. According to this policy, Japanese power
utilities, with a consensus, provide recovered plutonium for the
government's civil R&amp;D activities and at the same time we are now proceeding
with the programme to use the material in our own nuclear reactors.
The plutonium to be recovered at Thorp is an indispensable part of our
programme. We fully support Thorp. Naturally we do want the plant to go
ahead as soon as possible.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: When member states, not the United Nations, are to
blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SAUNDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Disunited nations' (June 15), rightly advises the
Security Council's five permanent members to examine their own
responsibility for some recent events, rather than blame the UN. The five
should begin to act more often as if they were members of the UN, not
detached spectators pursuing their own interests. Their reputation is not
enhanced when, for example, they complain of the inadequacies of UN security
action while never having attempted to activate the Military Staff Committee
provided for under Article 47 of the charter nearly 50 years ago.
When the UN has a defined role and support, as in Cambodia, the chances of
success are much increased. On other occasions as in Somalia and Iraq, when
member states use the UN to cover a part of their actions, but exclude it
from significant participation - and perhaps sometimes from consultation -
there are serious difficulties. In these and other cases member states
shelter behind the knowledge that the secretary-general will not name and
criticise them.
There is a pressing need to improve media coverage of the UN, and to
distinguish its role more clearly from that of member states. The aim should
be to facilitate the constructive criticism of the actions of all concerned,
which is urgently required.
Even those of us who are reasonably informed need a much clearer view of
events than we are now receiving.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Employers must show enthusiasm for offering
childcare facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KAY COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article, 'This little penny is for childcare' (June 9), it was
ludicrous to suggest that a fair and rational approach to this highly
topical and important issue would be to tax mothers (Yes] it would be mainly
the women) for using workplace nurseries and use the revenue to provide
better facilities.
For two years now my company has funded and run its own workplace nursery,
and the setting up of this by a medium-sized private company (the first to
be opened in the north-west for many years) attracted the attention of the
then secretary of state for employment, Michael Howard, who officially
performed the opening ceremony. Consistently, all places have been taken and
I must point out that our mothers do not have to 'drag' their children to
work every day. They actually find it easy and convenient to have them
looked after on the same premises where their children are in a happy and
secure atmosphere. We also offer a number of places to other local companies
to help ease the problems of finding affordable and accessible provision
close to their place of work.
We're not talking 'high-flyers' here, but ordinary working women and it
would be sheer lunacy to impose even greater barriers preventing women
taking their rightful place in the world of work by introducing tax burdens
on childcare.
The government has laid foundations by giving Pounds 45m to Training and
Enterprise Councils for after school-care pilot schemes, so let's hope that
more companies have the foresight to build on them to safeguard their
chances of attracting the best employees in the future. We cannot expect the
Treasury to keep providing funds without help and enthusiasm from employers.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: First woman PM, but others have western roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While Kim Campbell can certainly lay claim to being the first woman to
become prime minister of Canada, she is not 'the first with western roots
since Mr John Diefenbaker in the late 1950s' ('Canadian Tories take gamble
on Campbell', June 15). Mr John Turner, defeated by Mr Brian Mulroney in
1984, had a rather weak claim to western roots: he won a seat in the House
of Commons in a Vancouver by-election, after winning the leadership of the
Liberal party and becoming prime minister, and lived in that city for a time
in his youth. His term of office was the shortest in Canadian history. Mr
Joe Clark has a genuine claim to western origins as the most famous son of
High River, Alberta, and as MP for Yellowhead (Alberta) since the early
1970s.
His term in office was only slightly longer than Mr Turner's: he formed a
minority government after the 1979 election but lost another to Mr Pierre
Trudeau several months later.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: True artist of the people - Joseph Beuys's 'social
sculptures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Three artists above all define the possibilities of art today,' wrote
Norman Rosenthal in 1991, going on to name Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and
Joseph Beuys. Exhibitions of the work of Beuys are a fixture of the European
and US museum circuit. In the UK, however, there has until now been no
museum survey of his work. Praise, then, to the Tate Gallery, Liverpool for
Joseph Beuys: the Revolution is Us, an exhibition of works from its
collection, accompanied by a programme of events which seek both to place
Beuys in the context of European and international art history, and to
introduce his work to the widest possible audience by taking up its
environmental and social themes in workshops and community events of all
kinds.
Beuys believed that everyone could be an artist, because for him society
itself was the greatest and most profound work of art. In his immense range
of activities he tried both to exemplify this principle and to convey it to
as many people as he could. He did this very simply, making the most direct
use of his life experience as well as the traditional skills (drawing,
painting, sculpture) in which he received his artistic training.
His legend has become well known. Born in 1921, he flew fighter planes
during the Second World War. When he was shot down over the Crimea in 1943,
the Tatar nomads who succoured him were the source of the materials of his
subsequent artwork. The felt and fat in which they wrapped his broken body
against the cold became the materials by which, through their use in
sculptures, performances and installations, he sought to energise the
creativity of all.
His 'everyone is an artist' concept was not, however, an invitation to take
up paint daubing or mucking about with clay. It was rather a challenge, a
call to each individual, to contribute to that great 'social sculpture', the
making of a world that is humane and fulfilling for everyone.
Beuys did not just preach a doctrine, however. He put his words into action.
He was sacked from his post of Professor of Monumental Sculpture at the
Staatliche Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf in 1973, for example, for refusing to
abide by its discriminatory admissions policy. A founder member of the Green
Party, in 1979 he stood unsuccessfully for election to the European
Parliament. His latter work was increasingly involved with 'actions' to
tackle environmental problems, such as the planting of 7,000 oak trees begun
at Documenta VII in Kassel 1982. It is hard to convey the experience of
attending one of his lectures or watching his extraordinary performances in
which the slow repetition of actions, incomprehensible in themselves but the
product of profound contemplation, gradually set up a mythic resonance.
It was the description by Richard Demarco of the 'Three Pots Action'
performed in Edinburgh in 1974 which finally turned its curator, Judith
Nesbitt, too young to have seen any of the live work, and sceptical of the
legend, into what she now describes with a laugh as 'a believer'. The
exhibition, though small, is exemplary. The selected pieces from the
collection, augmented by loans, are linked by their use of Celtic themes and
locations in Scotland and Ireland, countries with close associations with
Liverpool. They include as well as the Poorhouse piece four blackboards from
a lecture at the Belfast Museum in 1974, and several vitrines. These contain
objects using Beuys' essential materials, fat and felt and various metals,
and, a link with Duchamp, dust. 'Vitrines' are a device much abused these
days and it is good to see these originals, which powerfully conjure up the
status of the museum and the authority of science to add gravitas to their
esoteric contents. Beuys' 'science' was of his own making, combining his
knowledge of history, plants and physical and chemical processes into a
symbolic alchemy developed to support his philosophical investigations.
The second room is devoted to the installation 'The End of the Twentieth
Century.' I was fortunate enough to have my first sight of it courtesy of
its maker. In the Gallery Schmela in Dusseldorf where it was first, our
interview developed into a discussion that went on long past gallery closing
time. Beuys left no plans to explain how the work, 31 basalt columns, each
with a plug drilled out, wrapped in felt and clay and replaced, was to be
displayed. Judith Nesbitt consulted his widow Eva, hoping for instructions.
Do what seems right for you, feel comfortable, sit amongst the stones and
have a cup of tea, she was told. Thus fortified, she has done a superb job.
The stones seem to delight in the ample space, the diagonal thrust of their
movement full of life and grace. For despite their weighty mass, the tumbled
columns somehow manage to convey not collapse and despair but lightness and
hope. It is a fitting summation of Beuys' philosophy that the fallen masonry
of history should contain the potential for future growth.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Open air Shakespeare in London has to triumph over cold and wet, and in New
York over humidity and noise. A successful play in the Theatre, Regent's
Park or the Delacourt, Central Park needs to be robust and expansive enough
to counter the environment. The New Shakespeare company's Romeo &amp; Juliet,
directed by Judi Dench at Regent's Park, is full of tense excitement but
never manages to catch the spirit of the play.
Shakespeare pinched the plot from a dull version published in 1562, and
wrote it in 1595, when he was 31. Because the principals are youthful, Romeo
is often taken for a play about youth. And because the fighting and feuding
happen outdoors, in the 'public haunts of men', it is taken for an open air
play. Most of the action takes place inside, in the dark chambers and
private space of house, cell and tomb.
A good production needs more subtlety than outdoor style in acting or
presentation can provide. The verse is tortuous: 'My only love sprung from
my only hate] Too early seen unknown, and known too late' cannot be shouted
like an invocation to the rear seats, but should be muttered close to.
Shakespeare conjured a disturbing mixture: bachelor banter with Mercutio,
frolics with the nurse, dense and delicate verse, botched and casual
slaughters, and a plot that falls over itself with dispatch.
The best moments of the evening come when Mercutio or Friar Lawrence
perform, in front of the other actors, irrespective of the audience. Given
the unsuitability of the play, the actors fare well enough. Rebecca Callard
as Juliet and Zubin Varla as Romeo maintain a breathy and anxious
commitment. Dench's direction favours a full stage, and the fights are lusty
and inventive. The set (Jack Notman) is a wonderful colour, perfect Veronese
masonry, and opens out nicely for the house and the tomb scenes. But the
balcony which waits patiently stage right has an air of inevitability. Soon
Romeo, not ivy, will be clinging to it.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Catalani's 'Loreley' - Opera in Genoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Italian opera has an abused step-child it is poor Alfredo Catalani
(1854-1893), whose name figures in every book on the genre while his works
remain practically unperformed and unknown, except for one pathetic aria for
soprano from his last work La Wally, 'Ebben me n'and lontana', familiar to
film-goers as the much-repeated theme-song of the Beneix movie Diva.
Catalani, however, has always had his persistent admirers (Toscanini, chief
among them, named his children after characters in his friend's operas); but
in recent years their number has been dwindling, and even La Wally, which
came closest to popularity, has vanished from the Italian opera houses
where, in the past, it was occasionally revived.
So, last year, when the theatres of Verona and Genoa announced a new
production of Catalani's Loreley considerable curiosity was aroused, and
now, as the work is being heard at the latter city's splendid Teatro Carlo
Felice, the Catalani caucus has come out in force. The conductor -
84-year-old Gianandrea Gavazzeni - long a specialist in this period, was at
the helm of the performances; and with undiminished vigour, the maestro who
led so many unforgettable Callas performances at La Scala infused his
vitality and conviction into the Genoa orchestra and made a good case for
the work itself.
Originally the opera was called Elda, and it was Catalani's first
full-length work for the theatre. Given in Turin in 1880, it had a mixed
reception. Some years later - after other theatrical ventures - Catalani
revised it extensively and it was given again (under its present title) in
Turin in 1890. Once more, it was received with more esteem than enthusiasm.
Catalani was a composer of skill and ideas, but - in a world still dominated
by Verdi, and with the star of Puccini about to rise - he was an outsider,
attached to the polemical Wagnerismo of the time. He was also dogged by
ill-health and ill-luck (and the damaging hostility of the powerful
publisher Giulio Ricordi). But, worst of all, he simply could not write good
tunes. As the critics said at the time, Loreley is full of ideas (some of
them recalling Lohengrin), but they are all short-winded. Instead of
developing, he usually just repeats.
Singers, too, misunderstand his music, singing it as if Catalani belonged to
his contemporary 'verismo' school, which he did not. In the Genoa Loreley,
for example, both the soprano Marilyn Zschau, in the title role, and the
tenor Nicola Martinucci, as her enslaved lover, bawled their way through the
first act with ear-splitting vehemence. The baritone, Alessandro Cassis, who
has a generally pleasant voice, was simply inexpressive. The first act is
the weakest; in the second, where the other soprano - the girl who loses the
man - appears, Denia Gavazzeni Mazzola sang persuasively, displaying a real
sense of style. Both the second and third acts have long instrumental
interludes, which the conductor interpreted powerfully.
The sets and costumes, by the usually sensitive Pasquale Grossi, were
coarsely coloured and badly lighted. This German legend requires a generous
amount of stage magic; here it had none, and Alberto Fassini's lacklustre
staging was no help (the wood-choppers in the opening scene might has well
have been stirring soup). So this revival of Loreley - while of unquestioned
interest to historians of Italian opera - seemed to inspire in the 1993
public much the same emotions that its first version aroused in the Torinesi
of 1880: respect, polite interest, and - to be honest - a certain amount of
boredom.

<TEXT>
It is more fun to chew on what Graeme Miller's latest piece means to say
than to sit through it, and in that sense it is not a true work of art.
Miller makes multi-media performance art; and his last major work, A Girl
Skipping, set images dancing so vividly in the mind that they then kept
adding up to fresh meanings afterwards - but the core pleasure, of course,
came in watching it. Not so with The Desire Paths, his new 90-minute piece,
which begins well but then gets bogged down in repetitious culs-de-sac of
nonsense.
There are five people onstage, stuck in a room together and surrounded by
drear images of modern urban desolation, all ready for a magical adventure;
and they get set to depart through the door in the wall. You think of Alice,
and of the kids in stories by EM Nesbit, Enid Blyton, CS Lewis. So far, so
good.
Then - ironic stroke - the door will not open. Here is Miller's one
masterstroke. There is no escape route, no path into magic, only the modern
world and the human will. It's as if The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
suddenly turned out to have no lion and no witch. Again and again, we see
different treatments of the same central image - the door that will not
open.
These five people - often so childlike - keep breaking up into separate
couples, trios, solos; and nonsense is their escapism, whether by prattling
away in methodical madness or by crawling around the room like kids playing
games. And, as their fantasies do lead them somewhere, the room does start
to change.
Soon we note how many of their fantasy paths lead to talk of the underworld,
and so we think of the paths of life that lead to death. And we note how
asexual is these 'children's' existence; one big kiss at the end stands in
startling relief to all that has gone before. Meanings, meanings. And vivid,
sure performances. But Miller's piece keeps going round and round in drab,
irritating loops. Too often, it takes a different route only to end up by
making the same point: the locked door, the bomb, the soulless cityscape.
The Desire Paths occurs currently, as part of the Barclays New Stages
Festival, in the Royal Court's main house. Meanwhile, in the Theatre
Upstairs, the two-man Man Act is presenting Call Blue Jane, a collaboration
with writer Deborah Levy. This is pop sociology tarted up as performance
art. Two men in city suits talk competitively to each other about the art of
the deal, sex, wives, children, society. They talk in minimalist cyclical
patterns; they pose, gesture, or dance in stern, masculine ways; and keep
asking each other the same questions.
As they talk and move through the encompassing mist, they reveal the paucity
of their thought, their incidental misogyny, and their dreadful
vulnerability. They need tenderness but keep rejecting it . . . Yes, well,
you know what city men are. No, I can't recommend Call Blue Jane as a work
of art - but, since I'm curious how its portrayal of city gents goes down
with FT readers, I draw it to your attention, with the approving comment
that it lasts less than 50 minutes.
Both The Desire Paths and Call Blue Jane continue at the Royal Court until
June 19

Sports fans? They consist largely of the retired, the unemployed and
insomniacs . . . or so the BBC seems to think. Having acquired the rights to
Ascot, the Australian Tests, the US Open Golf and the Eastbourne Tennis
Tournament what do they do? They show Cricket And Racing on BBC1 in the
morning starting at 10.55 - very handy for the unemployed; Cricket, Racing
And Tennis on BBC2 in the afternoon starting at 2.20 - jolly nice for the
retired; and Royal Ascot followed by Cricket: Second Test on BBC1 starting
five minutes before midnight: very suitable for insomniacs. Golfers are
luckier, they get half an hour of Golf: US Open on BBC2 at 10.00 pm and then
another 65 minutes for night owls beginning at 12.10. And having banished
sport from the hours when most people are free to watch television what does
the BBC offer instead? Right, lots of repeats. Between 7.30 and 9.30 they
repeat The Rock'n'Roll Years, Casualty, and Alas Smith And Jones. Remember
all the fuss about the end of Cheers? (hardly difficult since it was last
week). Here we go again with repeats, starting at 9.30 on C4.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Tosca revived - Opera in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever management consultants are invited into opera houses, they come
away recommending that companies should give more performances of each
production. On that score nobody can complain about the Royal Opera's Tosca,
first seen in 1964 and brought back more often since then than one would
have thought possible.
It still looks good, as long as one accepts the dated visual style. On
Wednesday it housed a decent, standard revival. The performance managed to
send a frisson of melodrama down the spine, even though the two main
principals have voices that are not quite large enough.
Looking elegant but remarkably petite in the grand costumes designed for
Callas, Catherine Malfitano has her work cut out measuring up to Tosca in
stature. At all the big vocal moments she is pushed to meet the volume and
scale required. This is regrettable, as the slim figure and refined Latin
looks make her a highly desirable heroine. There is plenty of temperament
(it is easy to understand why she wants the portrait of the Madonna to be
given dark eyes, when her own flash with jealousy so sharply) and nothing
she does is cheap. Even the lines which sopranos have traditionally spoken,
she sings as written.
In each of her scenes with Scarpia, one sensed an electric tension crackling
between them. Gregory Yurisich's Scarpia is nasty enough as the police
chief, but he manages to be more chilling still when he is playing the lover
trying to ensnare his prey. A torrent of sadistic desires seems to be
bottled up inside this perfectly controlled persona. Unfortunately, he too
has difficulty keeping a strong vocal presence over the orchestra, which
robs him of some of his authority. It is strange that a voice which has
seemed on the heavy side in lesser roles should sound underpowered when it
comes to this one.
There are no problems of that kind with the tenor, at least. Alberto Cupido
has a sturdy Puccini voice, which has enough steel for Cavaradossi's heroic
moments and a limited ability to melt at his romantic ones. The musicianship
is apt to be unimaginative, but he gives good value. This means not only
hanging on to top notes, but phrasing as long and broadly as he can. There
is also a characterful new Sacristan from Donald Adams.
The conductor is Daniel Oren, already encountered this year in Puccini at
the Royal Opera. After his La Boheme the exaggerated speeds and garish
orchestral colouring were only to be expected, but Tosca is a tougher score,
which can take the treatment more successfully. I only wish that his idea of
rubato did not run counter to my own instincts. Otherwise this is a
convincing, sometimes exciting revival, which should serve the young
audience at its three Prom performances well enough.
Tosca runs until 26 June at the Royal Opera House

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When two former Consolidated Gold Fields executives, Mr Michael Beckett and
Mr Anthony Ciali, were called in by big shareholders at the then-troubled
Monarch Resources, a small UK-quoted company, two years ago, it was always
on the cards that they would recruit some of their former colleagues to help
revitalise Monarch, which has gold assets in Venezuela.
While at Gold Fields, Mr Beckett and Mr Ciali helped to build Gold Fields
Mining Corporation into one of North America's lowest-cost and most
profitable gold producers.
Now they are welcoming Mr Jim Gourdie, until recently GFMC's vice
president-production, to Monarch where he has been appointed vice president,
operations.
Mr Gourdie will be based in Caracas and will take responsibility for
Monarch's Dollars 23m La Comorra gold project in Venezuela and its mill at
Revemin. Mr Ciali said that Mr Gourdie's 'broad background in the successful
development, operation and management of state-of-the-art gold mines will be
a tremendous asset to Monarch'.
GFMC was acquired by the Hanson Anglo-American conglomerate when it paid
Dollars 3.5bn for Consolidated Gold Fields in 1989. Hanson recently agreed
to swap GFMC, which has two gold mines, in California and Nevada, for the
coal and aggregate businesses of Sante Fe Pacific.

IBM's European personal computer business has recruited Mr Paul Cooper, aged
33, Dell Computer's direct sales manager in the UK, to lead IBM's
long-awaited move into direct PC sales.
In his new role as IBM's North European director in charge of direct
response marketing, Mr Cooper will be responsible for developing and
overseeing the implementation of a North European direct sales strategy for
IBM personal computers.
The move marks something of a coup for IBM, which has watched as rival PC
manufacturers such as Dell have grabbed market share by selling directly to
customers off computer magazine pages and via the telephone line.
Mr Cooper joined Dell in 1989 as direct sales manager and during his first
three years with Dell was part of the team that expanded Dell's direct sales
team from 10 to 50 people and increased its sales from Pounds 15m to over
Pounds 50m.
In 1991 he established Dell's main accounts operation and a year later set
up Dell's direct sales operation in Ireland. Before joining Dell he worked
for Rank Xerox, becoming district sales manager.
He joined Rank Xerox from Bradford University where he studied management
science and trained with ICL, the UK-based computer group.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology: Steps towards vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While much of the research on Aids focuses on treatment and a possible cure,
two US biotechnology companies - Chiron, in a joint venture with
Switzerland's Ciba, and Genentech - have taken important steps towards
creating a preventive vaccine.
The companies' vaccines consist of genetically engineered proteins from the
surface of the virus - an empty shell resembling HIV. Both groups have
completed trials on small numbers of healthy volunteers, who subsequently
developed antibodies against the virus.
The federal National Institutes of Health plans to launch a large-scale
clinical trial of the vaccines on about 10,000 healthy volunteers by the
beginning of next year.
A preventive vaccine is a relatively new concept in Aids research, which
until recently has concentrated on therapeutic vaccines for patients already
suffering from the disease.
Scientists are now questioning whether use of vaccines as a cure for Aids is
feasible. 'We've never been able to cure any viral infections, so a cure for
Aids may not be a realistic possibility,' says Martin Hirsch, a professor at
the Harvard Medical School. As a result, the focus is turning to prevention.
The new vaccines are promising, but by no means perfect. The Chiron vaccine
has side-effects of redness, soreness and mild flu-like symptoms. More
important, neither vaccine has been shown to have any impact after a patient
has contracted the disease.
Even if successful, the vaccines would have severe limitations. For
instance, a vaccine for the North American strains of HIV would be unlikely
to have much of an effect on Asian or African strains. The vaccine would
probably have to be altered every year to address the constantly mutating
virus.
Chiron and Genentech say they do not foresee the widespread use of the
vaccines immediately, even if they prove successful in the next set of
clinical trials.
'But among high-risk individuals, like spouses of infected people,
health-care workers and intravenous drug users,' says Chiron, 'this could be
a very welcome aid.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Technology: The search continues - There is still no
long-term treatment for HIV, despite billions of dollars of investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid spread of HIV, the virus that causes Aids, and the inability of
scientists to come up with a cure cast a pall over the annual Aids
Conference in Berlin last week.
Delegates were warned that more than 14m people have been infected by HIV,
an increase of 2.5m since the conference last year. The World Health
Organisation predicted that unless measures were taken to halt the virus, up
to 40m people would be infected by the end of the decade.
Given such grim predictions, the failure of the pharmaceuticals industry to
find a cure or vaccine for HIV - after more than 12 years and billions of
dollars of investment - was particularly depressing.
The gloom was compounded as details of an Anglo-French study were presented,
suggesting the most widely-used treatment against HIV, Wellcome's AZT, may
not be effective in HIV-positive patients without Aids-related symptoms. The
company disputes the findings of the trial, which is the largest and longest
study of AZT.
Yet in spite of the absence of any long-term treatment, the need for early
intervention was stressed in a new study presented by Frank Goebel,
professor at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat in Munich. He demonstrated
that the virus is highly active even during the apparently latent phase of
disease after infection when the virus is hardly found in the blood.
Goebel argued that during the latent phase the virus seeds itself into the
lymph system where over a period of years it multiplies, ravaging the
system's cell structure before breaking out into the blood stream. At this
stage, the deterioration in the number of CD4 immune cells, which is
relatively slow during the latent period, accelerates rapidly leading to
Aids and Aids-related diseases.
Before this study, it had been suggested there was no point giving treatment
before Aids symptoms developed because, given its low levels in the
bloodstream, the virus was inactive.
Although it is now clear that early intervention could help, the problem for
doctors is that none of the drugs available appears to have a lasting effect
on HIV.
Scientists are looking at a number of ways of attacking the virus. But so
far most of the effort has been directed towards one particular step of the
virus' life-cycle, when the virus' genetic material (RNA) is 'reverse
transcribed' into DNA. These drugs include Wellcome's AZT, Bristol-Myers
Squibb's ddI and Roche's ddC.
The problem with such medicines is that the virus has a tendency to mutate,
developing versions resistant to particular drugs.
The efficacy of such drugs on their own is open to question. For example,
Anthony Pinching, professor at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, presented
details of a large study of ddI which suggested that a brief rise in CD4
levels generated by the drug made no difference to the onset of Aids-related
illness and death, nor improved quality of life. Another study suggested
there was little difference in the efficacy between ddI and ddC in Aids
patients intolerant to AZT.
Scientists are trying another approach with these drugs, however. Yung-Kang
Chow of Harvard University generated considerable media interest earlier
this year when he suggested these drugs could be used in combination,
preventing the virus mutating into drug-resistant strains. He called this
'convergent combination therapy'.
Most of the combinations being studied are still in test-tubes. AZT and
Bristol-Myers Squibb's d4T appear to have a similar action and will probably
be used in combination with ddI, ddC or Glaxo's 3TC.
Nearly all trials using combination therapy are presently using AZT, which
suggests the drug could experience considerable sales growth if effective
combinations are discovered. However, whether patients could afford
combination therapy depends on the prices charged and the doses required.
Scientists are looking at other possible targets. These include two proteins
called Rev and Tat which appear necessary for the virus to replicate. The
best target would be Rev, but no anti-Rev drugs are in clinical trials. The
performance of the only Tat-inhibitor to be presented at the conference,
Roche's Ro 24-7429, was highly disappointing.
In contrast, another Roche product proved far more effective. The company is
developing a protease inhibitor called Ro 31-8959. This affects production
of an enzyme called protease which is necessary for the virus to replicate
effectively. Virus particles without the enzyme appear to be malformed and
non-infectious.
An Italian clinical trial presented at the conference showed that when the
drug was used with AZT, the two together were more effective in raising CD4
levels than AZT on its own. More trials are required to see if the drug
increases life-expectancy or quality of life.
Other good news involved the effectiveness of medicines to prevent the onset
of opportunistic and often lethal Aids-related diseases. Life expectancy of
Aids patients once they have developed the disease has increased
significantly because of such medicines.
Among the most important is Wellcome's Mepron, a treatment against a form of
pneumonia called PCP (pneumoncystis carinii pneumonia) which kills a
substantial proportion of Aids patients in the developed world.
Meanwhile, the search for a vaccine continues.
There was considerable media interest in a vaccine aimed at stimulating the
immune response of patients already infected by HIV. The vaccine, developed
by Immune Response Corporation of San Diego and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, showed
promising results. Additional studies are required to see if it slows
progression to disease or death.
In spite of the high levels of investment in combination therapies and
vaccines, they are likely to prove of little use for most HIV-positive
people. About 90 per cent of those infected live in the developing world and
will be unable to afford therapy.
The most significant medium-term impact on the Aids epidemic is likely to be
made not by medicines, but by public health programmes. The WHO is calling
for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to be spent annually in developing nations
to control the transmission of HIV. Michael Merson, director of the WHO's
global programme on Aids, believes it could save Dollars 90bn in direct and
indirect costs.
The programmes would include projects such as providing Aids information and
education, promoting condoms among prostitutes and clients, maintaining a
safe blood supply for transfusions and needle-exchange programmes.
'The initiative would provide a significant return in financial terms, but
above all an incalculable yield in diminished human suffering,' said Merson.

FT  18 JUN 93 / People: Bowen headhunted for Booker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Taylor's move up from chief executive to chairman of Booker,
confirmed yesterday, has allowed the appointment of an outsider to run the
food and agribusiness group. Mr Charles Bowen (right), aged 51, has been
headhunted for the chief executive job from Maple Leaf Foods, the publicly
quoted Canadian subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings, where he was president and
chief executive officer.
When Mr Bowen found himself in the same study group as Mr Jonathan Taylor at
Harvard in January, he had no idea that he would soon be working for Booker.
But, he says, he came to like and respect Mr Taylor and that weighed with
him when the call from the headhunter came. Serious talks only started last
week and he received the draft contract last Friday. He feels he and Mr
Taylor, who is 57, can complement each other, with Mr Taylor now likely to
ease back to a three-day week while pursuing his other interests. Mr Bowen
says Mr Taylor's strengths are as a broad thinker, running a devolved style
of management, and able to 'provide guidance without interfering'.
For his part, he believes he can 'make sure all the businesses are properly
controlled, are competitive in their markets and return the profits and cash
that they should'. He plans to spend a couple of weeks reading up about the
business, and then go and look at the activities.
Mr Bowen is a genial man but there are occasional flashes of a steely
interior. 'I made a point during the selection process that I may have to
make changes and asked them are they prepared to support me. They all said
yes.' His background is largely in the food industry, with Unilever, General
Foods and Hillsdown. With a degree in economics and statistics he initially
went into marketing, including being product manager for Flora margarine,
but by his mid-30's had moved into general management, running General Foods
Puerto Rico.
He joined Hillsdown in 1988 and ran a number of its businesses, including
Premier Brands and Hillsdown's European operations. He was sent to Canada in
April last year.
Hillsdown appeared rather stunned by his departure, which takes immediate
effect. Mr Brent Ballantyne, a director of MLF and head of its agribusiness
operations, is becoming chief operating officer.

For those needing to keep up with share and commodity prices outside the

Adonis.
The pager - or 'pocket-sized dealing screen' - is not the first financial
information services pager. Nor is it the only one which bleeps when share
prices or indices pass pre-set levels. Apart from a standard database
providing an overview of financial markets, 'Pulse' offers foreign exchange,
futures, energy, world indices, equities and metals. Its coverage extends to
most of London's commuter belt.
'Pulse' costs Pounds 99 a month to rent; users get the database plus one
specific service. The pager cost Pounds 279 to buy and the monthly charge is
then Pounds 79.

labelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The easiest way for supermarkets to alter the price of goods is to use
shelf-edge labelling, in which a liquid crystal panel, fixed next to the
appropriate goods, displays the price electronically.
Now a Swedish company, Pricer, of Uppsala, has developed a shelf-edge
labelling system powered by in-store lighting, eliminating cables, which are
difficult and expensive to install, and batteries.
To alter the price of an item the store's computer sends the new information
to a ceiling-mounted infra-red transmitter which sends the data to the
light-powered labels. The computer simultaneously sends the new prices to
the check-out system.
Each shelf label has built-in memory retention to ensure it does not lose
data at night. Pricer: Sweden, 18 18 81 00.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Management: Thriving on independence - IMI has shaken off
the restrictive culture of its former parent ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an old ICI hand, Gary Allen has been watching the carving up of his
former employer with a certain fraternal interest. IMI, the engineering
group of which he is managing director, used to be an ICI division. In 1978
it was floated as an independent company. It was thus the prototype for this
month's more ambitious demerger of Zeneca, ICI's bioscience business.
Allen joined ICI's metals division - the future IMI - as an accountancy
trainee in 1965. Two months after the flotation he joined the IMI board. He
is therefore something of an authority on what it means to cut loose from
the ICI culture. His verdict is unequivocal: 'It was the making of us.'
As he describes it, life under ICI sounds uncommonly restrictive. For
example, he says, take joint ventures. In the mid-1970s, he was running a
boiler-making subsidiary of IMI. 'I had a joint venture I wanted to do with
another ICI subsidiary in Ireland. It was a feasible project and would have
made money for both of us. Then there was a head office diktat: we don't do
joint ventures this small. And that was that. After 1977, a lot of IMI's
growth was getting into joint ventures with European family-owned companies
 -taking stakes, building blocks without total ownership, then buying the
family out later.'
Or take wages. 'Under ICI, when it came to pay scales, there was always some
read-through from the centre. There was the ICI pension scheme, which
everyone had to belong to. There were joint consultative schemes. And in
1977, IMI had 30,000 employees, a lot of them ladies employed in assembly
work. When ICI negotiated a pay increase for one of their big
capital-intensive plants, labour costs were relatively low in the equation.
They were very high when it came to us making zip fasteners and ammunition.'
Or take capital investment. At the time, ICI was spending a great deal on
petrochemical plants around the world. IMI, it decreed, must live within its
own cash flow. IMI's head at the time of flotation, Eric Swainson, now
deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, says: 'IMI was very largely a UK metal
basher. Our ambition was to diversify in terms of products and outside the
UK. That was not really possible at any speed within our own cash flow. We
needed access to the markets. ICI made it clear to us that if we wanted to
live in their protected world, we couldn't change our nature. If we wanted
to grow and diversify, we could only do it outside.'
Or take research and development. 'It was regarded as essential to have a
very large central research establishment,' Allen says. 'That was very ICI.
But we felt that in many of our product areas we ought to be in process
development rather than in basic research. After demerger, we decentralised
our R&amp;D totally.'
Or even, at the extreme, take industrial relations. 'There was an ICI
message I had as a factory manager,' Allen says. 'We don't have strikes.
Once we were independent, we shut down zip fasteners in Birmingham. I think
that would have hit a block in ICI, because it involved getting rid of 3,500
ladies. In fact, there was no strike, but ICI wouldn't have taken the risk.'
In fairness, he concedes, he might have got the message wrong. 'But that's
where culture comes into play. As a manager at that time, you got the very
strong feeling that ICI didn't want any trouble. Once we were independent,
we knew we had to grasp these nettles. And why weren't they grasped before?'
At this point, one begins to ask if it was all really so one-sided. Surely
ICI provided some central services which IMI found hard to replace? Not at
all, say Allen and Swainson, if anything, the reverse.
'To be honest,' Allen says, 'we found there were a lot of professional
advisers who regarded us as a new and very desirable client.'
In purchasing, Allen says, there were positive advantages. 'One of my jobs
after the split was to re-negotiate all the big supply contracts like gas
and oil, which had previously been handled by a massive ICI organisation at
Millbank headquarters called Central Purchasing Department. We actually got
better terms from some of those suppliers, who were very concerned that we'd
go elsewhere.'
To be fair to ICI, some of these rigidities have since been abolished. The
Central Purchasing Department, for instance, was disbanded long ago. But
until the Zeneca demerger there was still central purchasing of cars and
some engineering equipment, while groups of businesses within ICI clubbed
together to buy raw materials. Central wage bargaining remained: indeed, for
the next few months both Zeneca and the new smaller ICI will still be
working off the wage settlement struck before they went their separate ways.
The rosy picture of demerger needs qualifying in one important respect. For
IMI's senior staff, Swainson says, it represented pure opportunity. But, he
concedes, 'security was a thing that bothered people down the line. There
was fear that this might be the start of a break-up or screwing down of
conditions'. Allen agrees: 'For management, it was exciting. For a lot of
people below the level of management, the great umbrella of ICI had been
taken away. And even some managers realised - hang on, we could be taken
over. The same must apply to Zeneca and ICI now. They're both more
vulnerable, simply in terms of scale.'
As a proxy for the Zeneca demerger, IMI is far from perfect. It was far
smaller than Zeneca and more self-contained. It also had a stock exchange
quotation for more than a decade before its final separation. But its
experience bears out one central contention of the ICI board in devising the
latest split: that different parts of the business should be free to manage
themselves however suits them best.
For what it is worth, there may also be a message in the share price. Over
the 11 years in which IMI was publicly quoted but still part of ICI, its
shares underperformed ICI's by around a third. Since then they have
outperformed ICI by more than 60 per cent. On that basis, Zeneca's Pounds
1.3bn rights issue - which closes on Monday - should be a snip.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Management: The uphill battle against change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Machiavelli's Florence to modern corporate America, it has always been
clear that the biggest barrier to any organisational improvement is getting
people to change. So there was little justification for the surprise
expressed last weekend at a study of 200 British manufacturing companies
which concluded that the greatest 'inhibitor' to their achievement of 'world
class' performance was not government policy, but their inability to
implement change quickly enough.
The fact that the problem is neither new nor peculiarly British is
illustrated with particular piquancy by events which have come to light at
one of the world's best-known multinationals as it wrestles with one of the
most wrenching forms of change imaginable: the political, behavioural and
organisational upheaval associated with the 're-engineering' of its
operations.
As regular readers of this page will know from a series of articles which
began last month, this involves breaking down the barriers between powerful
departments, and getting people to work in different ways in various
'business processes', from order processing to product development. It
represents a fundamental challenge to the power base of many senior
managers.
The company concerned is Xerox, the copier giant, which operates in Europe
as Rank Xerox. The piquant part of the story is that it was the UK end of
the group which was most ready to change, but which was hampered by the rest
of Xerox.
In 1987, before the term 're-engineering' had even been coined, Rank Xerox
UK launched the first stages of a comprehensive programme of what it then
called radical 'process redesign'. This was supposed to become a model for
the rest of the group; in 1990 a much-enlarged blueprint for the redesign of
all Xerox's business processes was given official blessing by the US top
management.
Yet until less than a year ago it was 'filed and forgotten' in the US and
continental Europe, says one senior international manager. 'It just didn't
engage the business managers,' says a second. A third, who left in
frustration, says: 'It hit an invisible wall of all sorts of barriers:
cultural, hierarchical, structural and functional.'
Only in the wake of poor financial results was a round of frenetic
re-engineering finally launched in Europe last autumn. In continental Europe
and the US, the programme's influence until then had been minimal, except in
'logistics' (supply and distribution).
Even in the UK the original programme had far less effect than intended; it
laid the groundwork for several projects, the most recent of which has been
the re-engineering of order processing and service calls; but these are less
all-embracing processes than those envisaged originally.
The fact that such a sophisticated company has found it so hard to turn
re-engineering from theory into practice, in spite of the apparent
commitment of top management, reinforces the change conundrum.
Like so much in any kind of history, Medici or modern, Xerox's difficulties
are open to two interpretations, depending on your vantage point - or, if
you are a 'change management' groupie, where you have been schooled.
If, like most re-engineering evangelists and a growing body of desperate top
managers, you consider radical process change to be the key to transforming
a company's productivity and commercial performance, you will interpret the
long delay in purely political terms. You will see it as the temporary but
costly triumph of Xerox's reactionary, centralist 'functional barons' (heads
of manufacturing, marketing and even 'total quality') over multidisciplinary
working by relatively independent teams, on which proper re-engineering
depends.
On the other hand, you may, like Paul Allaire, Xerox's chairman and chief
executive, take a much wider view which considers the politics of change to
be only part of the problem. Allaire has been influenced heavily by David
Nadler, an academic-turned consultant who sees business processes as just
part of an organisation's complex 'architecture' - virtually the whole of
which must be redesigned if the company is to manage change successfully.
If you are of like mind, you will consider that the 1990 re-engineering
blueprint was ahead of its time, out of context and inadequate on its own to
achieve the essential task of breaking down decades of functional dominance
and costly staff overheads in Xerox and its European offshoots.
As things have proved, the whole group has indeed needed a much broader
initiative from the very top, plus last year's poor financial results in
Europe, to begin breaking that functional stranglehold. This initiative,
launched in the US in early 1992 and now cascading uncomfortably into
Europe, treats the redesign of work processes as only one of four elements
which need to be changed if the whole of Xerox is to operate more
effectively.
The other three elements are: first, the group's formal organisation
structure; second, its people and skills; and third, its informal networks,
behaviour and 'culture'. The first was changed in wrenching fashion last
year, and a succession of measures has been launched to change the other two
 -which Allaire recognises is a far harder task.
Six long, painful years after its first stirrings, radical change is finally
under way at Xerox. As Machiavelli warned Lorenzo de Medici back in 1514,
'there is nothing more difficult . . . than to take the lead in the
introduction of a new order of things'.
Rank Xerox's current process re-engineering drive in Europe will be examined
next week.

FT  18 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Return of a deal-maker - Not everyone
will be delighted to see Martin Landau back in the UK property market after
three years' absence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market has welcomed the return to the UK property market of Mr
Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur, sending the share price of
Clayform Properties soaring this week after he announced his plans to use it
as a comeback vehicle. But not everyone will be pleased by the news. 'A lot
of people think I am a rat,' he admits cheerfully.
The Church Commissioners might be one example. Mr Landau was, until 1990,
deputy chairman of Imry Merchant Developers, which went into partnership
with the Church in an ill-starred speculative development in Ashford, Kent.
Imry offloaded some of its exposure to the project on to the Church two days
after the government turned down planning permission for the development.
'Those people do not love me,' he concedes.
Some others acquainted with Imry might be similarly alarmed by Mr Landau's
return to the property market, after three years of cooling his heels in the
south of France.
Mr Landau, after all, was responsible for Imry's Pounds 1bn development
programme. He had left the company by the time it collapsed in 1991-92,
following its ill-judged takeover by a private consortium. The company's
failure won it a place in corporate history by forcing its bank, Barclays,
to take it into ownership and make the largest single write-down in the
record books.
But some people who have followed Mr Landau's career closely would make a
different assessment. They do not blame Imry's collapse on its own
management, but on the consortium that loaded it with debt when it made a
Pounds 314m takeover in 1989.
They might accept that some of Imry's developments proved expensive mistakes
for the institutions that financed them - such as Postel's Rose Court at
Southwark, south London, which is still unoccupied. But many of Imry's other
partnerships profited both parties.
The main reason, however, why Mr Landau still commands some respect within
the industry is that his judgment of the market has, so far, been unusually
astute.
He claims that he forecast the property slump - 'I said 1989 would be
terrible; 1990 would be blood on the walls; 1991 would be jumping out of
windows'. But his reputation is based principally on his record at making
money for his shareholders - and himself - through the 1980s until Imry's
takeover in 1989.
Mr Landau, who originally trained as an accountant, became involved in
property when he was sorting out the property interests of Guinness Mahon,
the merchant bank, after the 1974 crash. The bank eventually formed a
property subsidiary, Guinness Peat Properties, to develop some of the
properties in which it was involved.
After heading this subsidiary for six years, he led a management buy-out of
most of the GPP properties in 1986. In a series of deals, he created City
Merchant Developers which was put into Rivlin, a quoted 'shell' company,
which then built up its asset base through acquisitions.
In 1988, City Merchant Developers merged with Imry International, led by Mr
Martin Myers. When Marketchief, a private consortium, offered to buy the
company for Pounds 314m in 1989, with the intention of breaking it up, Mr
Landau recommended that the board accept the offer. He left the company soon
afterwards, having earned Pounds 25m from his 8 per cent stake.
Mr Landau's record has prompted a sharp rise in the share price of Clayform,
the small, ailing property company in which he and a partner Anthony Bodie,
bought a 5 per cent stake at 14p a share. The news of their purchase sent
the company's shares up from a close of 11p on Thursday night to 37p
yesterday, as other investors followed his lead.
'There is a shortage of people in the sector who are perceived to be good,'
says Mr Chris Turner of BZW, the broker. 'When you have someone who has a
proven track record you can understand when people say they are interested
in having a bit of the action.'
The rise in Clayform's share price - which is being encouraged by Mr
Landau's talks to the press and the City about his plans - seems to be an
integral part of his strategy. He has indicated that he has a deal up his
sleeve, which will be accompanied by a large fund-raising exercise. With a
net asset value of 30p a share, Clayform's share price needed a boost in
order to issue new paper without diluting its asset value.
Mr Landau wants to build the company up quickly. 'I think we will do a
quantum leap,' he says. He is confident of his ability to attract funds. 'I
would say immodestly there are quite a few serious institutions who would
like to back us,' he says.
Mr Landau will not be drawn on details of his plans. 'The overriding
objective must be to improve net asset value, to have the company on a solid
footing and to be in a position, by being big enough, to take advantage of
situations as they occur,' he says.
His strategy has three parts. First, Clayform needs investment property. 'We
need a solid balance sheet so we have income coming in which pays the
overhead,' he says.
Second, it will engage in developments, although not yet on a speculative
basis. Rather, he envisages carrying out project management work or
developing pre-let, pre-funded buildings. 'It will always be looking at the
bottom line of limiting risk,' he says.
Third, he envisages taking over other companies in the sector, which can no
longer justify their overheads. 'A large number of people in the property
sector are earning far too much money,' he says.
He also hopes that his arrival will enhance Clayform's existing assets by
taking it off a crisis footing. Clayform has already brought its debt down
from Pounds 130m to Pounds 28m in the past two and a half years, but it
still has gearing of 200 per cent. He says an injection of Pounds 20m would
reduce gearing to 20 per cent and allow it to develop some of its sites.
'For a comparatively small amount of money we can revolutionise this
company,' says Mr Landau.
The heavily indebted Clayform might not seem the ideal shell company. But in
a market glutted with moribund companies, Mr Landau found it surprisingly
difficult to find a suitable vehicle. 'We have been stalking UK public
companies for 18 months,' he says.
He looked closely at eight or nine companies, but dismissed them because of
tax or financial complications. 'People still had overblown ideas of what
their companies are worth.' Clayform was not judged suitable until it had
disposed of Stead &amp; Simpson, its shoe chain, in April.
Mr Landau's enthusiasm for the opportunities facing Clayform seems in some
ways like a throw-back to the boom conditions of the 1980s. But he is clear
that some things have changed. 'I don't think there will be a dramatic surge
in values and activity,' he says.
Furthermore, many of the people in charge of banks and institutions have
changed. In the case of the banks there is currently a reluctance to lend
money, particularly to developers.
Mr Landau is however confident that the banks will, in time, fund his
projects. 'In five years' time the banks will be piling in,' he says. 'Banks
are very lazy. They won't lend it to farmers, they don't understand
manufacturers, they won't lend to the third world, so they come back to
lending to property . . . Bankers are definitely not very bright people.'
Mr Landau's arrogance is matched by his ambition. As a man who has already
made a fortune, his apparent motivation in returning to the property market
is the thrill of building up a large company. He dismisses the possibility
of a lifetime of 'golf and shooting and fishing' or even 'watching the vines
grow in Tuscany' with a shudder.
'You have to get to the top of the tree,' he says. 'I don't think there is
any limit if you have the ability, the desire and are honest.'

choice unless membership is limited to an occupation or skill. Unions will
no longer be able to exclude individuals because of 'no poaching'
inter-union agreements, such as the TUC Bridlington rules.
Employers will be able to pay more to individuals to secure changes in
bargaining arrangements, allowing employers to pay extra to those who sign
personal contracts and give up collective bargaining.
Deduction of dues: Employers will have to get written agreement at least
every three years from individuals if union subscriptions are to be deducted
from wages under 'check-off' arrangements. Increases in deductions will have
to be notified at least a month in advance by employers, accompanied by a
reminder that they can withdraw from check-off at any point.
Industrial action: Union industrial action ballots will have to be conducted
fully by post. Where 50 or more are voting, ballot will have to be
independently scrutinised.
Unions will have to give employers at least seven days written notice of
intention to ballot on industrial action, plus a description of which
workers are to be balloted. Employers must get a sample voting paper and
details of the result. Seven days written notice will have to be given by
unions of intended industrial action, dates of action and description of
which workers are likely to be involved.
Any individual deprived of goods or services by unlawful industrial action
will be able to bring legal proceeding to restrain the action. Maternity
leave and rights: Pregnant employees, regardless of length of service or
hours worked, will have the right to 14 weeks maternity leave. All women to
be protected against dismissal on maternity-related grounds.
Changes during passage of the bill include rules affecting the notification
required by a woman of her intention to return to work. Written employment
particulars: After two months in a job an employee must be given a written
statement of main employment particulars (currently 13 weeks after starting
job). Many particulars in collective agreements, including hours and
holidays, will have to be spelled out to individuals. Changes must be
notified within a month.
All employees working more than eight hours a week will be entitled to an
itemised pay statement. In companies with fewer than 20 employees, those
working 8-16 hours will have to complete five years' qualifying service
before entitled.
Victimisation: All employees will be able to go to an industrial tribunal if
dismissed for carrying out health and safety duties, or leaving a work area
if in imminent danger. Employees will have a new right to complain to an
industrial tribunal if dismissed for asserting statutory employment
protection rights.
Transfer and redundancy: Transfer of undertakings regulations will be
extended to include non-commercial undertakings. Any employee refusing to
transfer will be deemed to have left the job voluntarily.
Wages councils: Remaining wages councils, which fix minimum pay, are to be
abolished.
Tribunals: Chairmen will be able to sit without lay members in some
circumstances and hear breach of contract of employment. Identities of
parties in cases involving sexual misconduct are to be protected.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shake-up plan for education
department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL review of the Department for Education was launched by Mr John
Patten, the education secretary, yesterday, after claims that civil servants
had obstructed the government's reforms.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consultant, has been called in after a competitive
tender to make a thorough review of the department's role and organisation,
particularly its personnel. It must report by the end of October.
The move follows a long period of ministerial distrust of the department.
There is unease in Conservative ranks that the national curriculum may have
been deliberately sabotaged by civil servants in the department.
The review may lead to a drastic slimming down of the department's staff,
and the new-model department is likely to concentrate on 'setting clear
targets, strategy and quality assurance'.
Mr Patten said: 'The past five years have seen enormous changes in the
structure of education in this country, not least in the establishment of
new bodies with responsibilities for different parts of the system.'
The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) took over responsibility for
inspecting schools from Her Majesty's Inspectorate at the start of the year
and is administered independently of the department.
Quangos already established include the Student Loans Company and the
Further and Higher Education Funding Councils.
In September the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority will take over
the national curriculum and its tests.
The education bill before parliament would set up a Funding Agency for
Schools to distribute funds to schools that have opted out of local
education authority control - a job nowdone in the department.
The agency would also handle planning in areas where 75 per cent of schools
have opted out.
The teachers' unions were angered by the review. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general
secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women
Teachers, decribed the it as 'most disturbing'.
He added: 'It's a further politicisation of education. Mr Patten is shooting
the messenger.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the review showed 'a
failure to take responsibility'.
She said successive ministers had interfered with the work of the curriculum
council and added: 'I don't think civil servants have sabotaged these
reforms. Successive ministers have had a self-destruct button because they
thought they had a monopoly on wisdom and failed to listen to any other
viewpoints.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Legal delay to ratification of
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UK's ratification of the Maastricht treaty will be delayed
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even after the legislation has gone through parliament - because of the
threatened legal challenge to the government from the Euro-sceptics.
The delay in ratification could be until the autumn.
Although the government is confident that the challenge will be rejected by
the courts, ministers will not proceed to ratification until this final
hurdle has been cleared.
The news will encourage the Euro-sceptics, whose plan to seek judicial
review of the government's actions was seen by many Tory MPs as a futile and
last-ditch attempt to stop the treaty's implementation.
The threat of a challenge came last month after Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, led a government retreat and accepted an amendment which removed
the social protocol from the parts of the treaty incorporated into British
law.
Then, the Euro-sceptics said that they would seek judicial review of the
conflict between the legislation - which does not include the social chapter
and the UK's opt out from it - and the government's plans to ratify a treaty
that does.
Whitehall officials expect the challenge not to materialise until after
royal assent, expected in late July.
Although the government will press for an expedited hearing, some officials
recognise that it could put off ratification until September or October.
One official said yesterday: 'Since you can't de-ratify, we would not want
to be in a position where the government was in contempt of court.'
The delay will be a blow for the government's business managers, who have
set an ambitious timetable to complete the bill by late July.
Detailed discussion of the bill in the House of Lords starts on Tuesday.
About 400 amendments - including one making provision for a referendum -
have been put down for debate.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row over cuts in military reserve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH controversy over cuts in Britain's military strength was stirred up
yesterday after the government announced a reduction of more than 4,000 in
the country's volunteer reserve forces.
Measures announced in the Commons by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary,
involve cutting naval reserves by more than half, with a smaller reduction
in RAF part-time forces.
The number of volunteer reserve organisations will be reduced to five with
the scrapping of the 2,700-strong Royal Naval Auxiliary Service.
In addition, the Royal Naval Reserve, already cut from 5,900 to 4,700 under
the Options for Change programme, is to lose a further 1,200 posts. Its
squadron of River Class minesweepers, which Mr Rifkind said had been
overtaken by advances in mine technology, will be withdrawn.
The defence secretary said RNR personnel would be able to serve on more
modern minehunters and announced plans to allow more reservists to join
Royal Navy ships.
The naval cuts will affect almost 300 civilian jobs. Mr Rifkind said not all
would be found alternative work.
The RAF's 1,800-strong volunteer bodies - the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and
the smaller RAF Volunteer Reserve - are to lose about 180 posts.
Mr Rifkind - who also raised the possibility of Territorial Army soldiers
volunteering to join regular army deployments - came under fire from his own
backbenchers.
Mr Julian Brazier, Tory MP for Canterbury, said territorial soldiers would
be put in 'an impossible position' with their employers if they were asked
to volunteer for assignments rather than being called out.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, asked how much money the proposals
would save. He added: 'At the back of our mind, many of us feel that this is
not a strategic decision based on defence requirements' but was rather based
on the Treasury's decision to screw money out of the Ministry of Defence.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke stresses strategy to boost
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to stimulate investment are likely to feature in the November
Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, indicated in the Commons as Tory
MPs hailed the good set of economic figures announced yesterday.
Tory backbenchers were heartened by a confident performance by the
chancellor, who told Labour critics that they were facing a
'business-friendly' government which would take specific measures to sustain
British industry and commerce.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, provided another boost for Tory morale by
highlighting the significance of the earlier announcement that the jobless
total had fallen for the fourth successive month.
To government cheers, he said it was 'good news for the unemployed, good
news for the economy and good news for Britain'.
Mr Major's robust performance heartened Conservative MPs after a traumatic
few weeks for the government. But most recognised that difficult months lay
ahead, particularly as ministers thrash out public spending decisions.
Mr Clarke, in his first appearance dealing with Treasury questions, was
taunted by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, over his reliance on words
rather than action since taking over from Mr Norman Lamont a fortnight ago.
The chancellor said he was working closely with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and
envisaged that his next 'major contribution' would be in the November
Budget.
In response to challenges from the Labour benches, Mr Clarke said business
investment was low because the economy was just emerging from recession and
in the early stages of recovery.
But he recalled the success achieved in manufacturing and business
investment in the three years to 1989 and stressed 'obviously I will be
considering measures which will sustain that good record once recovery gets
under way'.
Acknowledging that there was also 'a balance of payments problem', Mr Clarke
welcomed the improving export performance, particularly in non-European
Community markets where demand had not been depressed to the same extent.
The government, he said, would do everything possible, through the Treasury
and the Department of Trade and Industry, to support manufacturers in their
efforts to export.
Mr Clarke hoped forecasters would take encouragement from the growth in
gross domestic product, the growth in manufacturing output, and the
announcement that unemployment figures had fallen for the fourth successive
month.
Mr David Willetts (C Havant) said it would be a remarkable achievement if
Britain could secure an economic growth rate higher than the rate of
inflation.
Agreeing, Mr Clarke emphasised: 'It is important firstly to make sure that
does happen in so far as it is within the government's power to do so, and
to make sure that this time we sustain it'.
Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, reminded the
chancellor of Mr Lamont's condemnation of interest rate cuts made to offset
some unfavourable political event.
Mr Clarke said such decisions should be taken on the best objective advice
and for good economic reasons, and he promised he would persevere with this
approach.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury to suffer in silence no
more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY's traditional pre-Budget purdah is to end, the government
announced yesterday as it accepted that Mr Kenneth Clarke's prowess as a
politician would inevitably outshine any attachment he has to monastic
ritual.
Unlike his predecessors, the chancellor will not be expected to refrain from
public appearances in the months approaching the Budget. However, the prime
minister's office expressed the hope that Mr Clarke would still be
'reticent' about tax issues until decisions were announced.
The move was unsurprising given the gradual erosion of purdah. Over recent
years Treasury ministers have been frustrated at not being able to hail good
economic news - and at allowing opposition politicians to set the political
agenda.
But Mr Clarke was also perhaps the most unlikely chancellor to observe
Treasury rules of purdah - named after an Indian tradition of keeping women
in seclusion.
He broke convention on Tuesday by trailing his Mansion House speech to the
City on Channel Four news and discussed the scope for spending cuts on BBC
television on Wednesday night, ahead of yesterday's cabinet meeting on
public expenditure.
'The idea of Kenneth Clarke and purdah is like Kelvin MacKenzie (editor of
The Sun) and the Church Times,' admitted one Downing Street official.
Like the best government conventions, purdah was never formally defined. But
the principle was that any comment from the chancellor, his junior ministers
or officials at cocktail parties, could give clues about the Treasury's
pre-Budget thinking.
When the Budget was in March, purdah supposedly ran from the Chevening
weekend summit of Treasury ministers in January. But over the years it
started at an ever later date. This year the first unified tax and spending
Budget is in November. A truncated period of purdah was due to start from
the October Tory party conference.
Mr Clarke has decided he cannot contain himself even that long.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union restrictions extended by new
law - Latest employment reform legislation continues themes of previous Tory
measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the government's eighth major piece of labour market legislation - which has
just completed its passage through parliament, is the child of a political
rather than a business agenda.
But it does continue the main themes of previous legislation - labour market
deregulation and restrictions on the behaviour of trade unions.
The most controversial piece of de-regulation is the abolition of wages
councils, which set minimum pay levels in certain sectors. The original
argument for abolition was that wages would fall and jobs would be created,
but cover for those under 21 was abolished in 1986 and neither occurred. The
argument thus switched to removing an institution which had little effect.
The bill, which will get royal assent in July and be implemented over the
following few weeks, departs from earlier legislation in two respects.
First, it contains highly detailed regulation of the daily running of
unions, which remain voluntary organisations.
Although previous legislation has required unions to change their behaviour
 -in relation to strike ballots for example - the new law includes a
requirement to notify the Certification Officer of the pay of top officials.
The justification for such interference in the financial field was provided
by the Lightman inquiry into the National Union of Mineworkers, while
further rulings on how to conduct elections arose from ballot-rigging in the
1990 TGWU executive elections.
The second main departure is found in the reversal of the long-standing
assumption that collective bargaining is to be encouraged. The requirement
of Acas, the conciliation service, to promote collective bargaining has been
dropped, and a late amendment has made it possible for employers to offer
inducements to employees to accept individual contracts.
The white paper, on which the law is based, hinted at the government's
interest in a broader framework of individual rights at work to supersede
collective bargaining. This is supported by groups such as the Institute of
Directors and Citizens Advice Bureaux. But apart from integrating EC law, it
is unlikely that any major legislation will emerge in this area for some
time.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union boost for Smith campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COHSE, the health union, yesterday agreed to remit a motion calling for no
change to the union's role in the selection of Labour MPs.
The move, recommended by the Cohse executive, was welcomed by supporters of
Labour leader Mr John Smith and means that the union will be free to press
the case for one-member-one-vote in the selection process. Only one other
large union, the AEEU craft union, has backed Mr Smith in his plan for
revising the party-union link.
Two civil service unions - the NUCPS and the CPSA - have started balloting
their Home Office members on a one - day strike against market testing,
contracting out and privatisation. The ballot ends on July 9 and a yes vote
would mean a strike on July 16.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax year change to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN DORRELL, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that
he would consider changing the start of the tax year from April 5 to January
1.
Mr Barry Field, Tory MP for the Isle of Wight, called the existing tax year
'peculiar', and recommended an amendment in time for the unified budget in
November.
But Mr Dorrell said: 'You are meddling with a very long-standing piece of
history by wanting to bring the tax system onto the same calendar everyone
else has lived on since the 1750s. But I will certainly look at it.'
The Inland Revenue said last night: 'If (the change) was easy it would have
been done a long time ago.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM hints at move on Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister yesterday strengthened expectations that the Pounds 2.8bn
Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield will be allowed to start
commercial operations.
Mr Major underlined the plant's value in employment and earning foreign
currency. Thorp would support about 3,000 jobs, and had contracts worth
Pounds 9bn, he said.
But Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said that since the decision
to build the plant, the economic prospects had collapsed and the threshold
of safe nuclear emissions had been reduced.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Property tenders to be worth Pounds
1.25bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced plans to put Pounds 1.25bn of property
management work out to tender from 1996, through the extension of compulsory
competitive tendering to the management of 4m council houses and flats in
England, John Willman writes.
The services to be put out to tender include rent collection, allocating
properties and arranging lettings, and the enforcement of tenancy
agreements. The successful bidders will also be responsible for managing
vacant properties, caretaking, cleaning, repairs and maintenance.
The government has decided to leave the administration of housing benefit,
operation of the right-to-buy regulations and housing the homeless outside
the tendering package. Councils will continue to be responsible for these
fun-ctions.
Local authorities will be expected to divide their housing stock into
management units of up to 5,000 homes for tendering purposes. However,
authorities with fewer than 7,500 homes can put them out to tender as a
single unit.
Councils will have to consult tenants in drawing up the tender
specification, and will be encouraged to involve them in selecting the
winning bid.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BES amendment withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, said yesterday
that he withdrew a controversial proposed amendment to the finance bill to
'thwart' Labour.
His proposal was that investors in a business expansion scheme where shares
were issued after December 31 1992 should lose relief on a loan taken up
after June 30 this year. It would have denied relief to 55,000 investors.
Mr Stern said he was concerned that Labour might win a vote on retrospective
legislation to ban loan-back BES schemes at committee stage since some Tory
MPs would be ineligible to vote because of their own investment in loan back
BES schemes.
He said he withdrew the proposal on Monday, at which stage it would have
been too late for Labour to table a similar proposal.
Labour said retrospective legislation would never have been acceptable,
citing its own proposals to backdate the legislation which were ruled out of
order.

The 1996 start date will encourage the development of a market in providing
housing management services, Sir George Young, the housing minister, said
yesterday. He expected chartered surveyors, management agents, housing
associations and specialist companies to be interested in bidding for the
work.
Councils will have to consult tenants in drawing up the tender
specification, and will be encouraged to involve them in selecting the
winning bid.
The government expects that compulsory competitive tendering will save up to
6 per cent of the money spent on housing management. In the London Borough
of Wandsworth, putting part of their housing management out to tender had
saved Pounds 500,000 on annual running costs.
Sir George said that he also expected that CCT would lead to more efficient
management of local authority housing stock and greater responsiveness to
tenants.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Legal delay to ratification of
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UK's ratification of the Maastricht treaty will be delayed
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even after the legislation has gone through parliament - because of the
threatened legal challenge to the government from the Euro-sceptics.
The delay in ratification could be until the autumn.
Although the government is confident that the challenge will be rejected by
the courts, ministers will not proceed to ratification until this final
hurdle has been cleared.
The news will encourage the Euro-sceptics, whose plan to seek judicial
review of the government's actions was seen by many Tory MPs as a futile and
last-ditch attempt to stop the treaty's implementation.
The threat of a challenge came last month after Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, led a government retreat and accepted an amendment which removed
the social protocol from the parts of the treaty incorporated into British
law.
Then, the Euro-sceptics said that they would seek judicial review on the
conflict between the legislation, which does not include the social chapter
and the UK's opt out from it, and the government's plans to ratify a treaty
that did.
Whitehall officials expect the challenge not to materialise until after
royal assent, expected in late July.
Although the government will press for an expedited hearing, some officials
recognise that it could put off ratification until September or October.
One official said yesterday: 'Since you can't de-ratify, we would not want
to be in a position where the government was in contempt of court.'
The delay will be a blow for the government's business managers who have set
an ambitious timetable to complete the bill by late July.
Ministers hope that the debate on the social chapter, which is required
before the treaty can come into force, will also to take place before the
Commons disperses for the summer recess.
It had been expected that this debate would be the last obstacle in the way
of ratification, enabling the UK to ratify in the summer, and leaving
Germany as the last country to ratify, probably in September.
Detailed discussion of the bill in the House of Lords begins next Tuesday,
and about 400 amendments - including one making provision for a referendum -
have been put down for debate.
In spite of the large number of amendments tabled, by agreeing to the
customary intervals between the different stages of discussion, the Lords'
business managers have built into their timetable an element of timing that
could be compressed if it emerged that the committee stage discussion was
unduly prolonged.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Warning on cost of water quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER BILLS may need to rise by 6 percentage points above annual inflation
for the next five years, Ofwat, the water industry regulator, warned
yesterday.
The rises would be needed to bring water up to new environmental standards,
water companies have told Ofwat.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, told a conference yesterday:
'Customers must come first. To tell them that water is good value may be
true, but they do not want to see their disposable income squeezed.'
Mr Byatt has argued frequently over the past year that some standards of
water may be higher than those that are necessary on health grounds, and
that they are pushing up customers' bills.
He called yesterday for ministers to consider the 'trade-off between water
quality and higher bills' when considering how stringently to set new
standards.
Their decisions, he said, would 'set the scene' for Ofwat's wide-ranging
review of the industry's pricing structure next year that will set price
rises for each company for the period 1995 to 2005.
Mr Byatt welcomed recent water company surveys to find out what standards
customers wanted. These confirmed customer anxiety about rising bills. But
several companies found customers willing to pay for the removal of lead
traces from drinking water, even though the cost could reach Pounds 8bn
nationally.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Japanese manufacturers fuel surge in car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK CAR production jumped by 23.8 per cent last month to reach the highest
total for May in 16 years.
Output rose to 130,374, from 105,234 in the same month a year ago, helped by
the rapid increase in output by Nissan, Toyota and Honda, the three Japanese
carmakers that have located their first European car plants in the UK.
The scale of the increase stems in part from the weak level of output in May
last year, but UK car production has risen strongly in the first five months
of this year with an increase of 9.1 per cent to 608,169.
The jump in output, which is both for export markets and for the domestic
market, is in stark contrast to the steep decline in car output in
continental Europe.
German car production fell by 23.5 per cent in the first four months of the
year to 1.34m, while output in France in the same period fell year-on-year
by 13.6 per cent to 1.06m. In the first quarter output in Spain was 29.9 per
cent lower than in the same period a year ago, and production in Italy fell
by 19.5 per cent.
Output in the UK for export markets in the first five months rose by 8.5 per
cent to 247,438, while output for the domestic market increased by 9.5 per
cent to 360,731, according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office.
The UK - with Ireland - is the only new-car market in western Europe where
sales are growing, with an increase of 8.9 per cent in the first five
months. Overall new-car sales in western Europe fell year-on-year by about
17.3 per cent.
UK output has been boosted by the start-up of plants by Honda and Toyota
since late last year. In the first three months of this year Japanese car
manufacturers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car production.
The optimism generated by the car sector's performance has been tempered by
the continuing fall in commercial vehicle production, which fell
year-on-year by 32.5 per cent in May and by 20.2 per cent in the first five
months to 89,032.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Braer oil tanker spill in the Shetlands in January has been less
damaging than was first feared, according to a group set up by the
government to monitor its pollution effects.
The scientists, led by Professor William Ritchie of Aberdeen University,
yesterday said their initial findings were 'most encouraging'.
They warned, however, that further monitoring was needed into the effects of
the 85,000 tonnes of light crude oil which spilled into the sea when the
Braer crashed on the rocks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
APPLICATIONS to the Universities Central Council on Admissions are a record
this year. Total applications by the end of May were 9.1 per cent higher
than at the same point last year.
Vocational courses saw the greatest leap with applications for teacher
training up 32.8 per cent and for medicine up 13.7 per cent.
Academic courses were less popular, with a fall of 4.3 per cent in
applications for history degrees.
The council, which does not handle applications for the 'new' universities -
those which converted from polytechnics last year - predicts that all offers
will be honoured but that students who narrowly miss their conditional
offers will find it much harder than usual to find a place at another
university.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Diners 'liable for tax on tips'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN DINERS who tip waiters will in theory be required to withhold the tax
and pay it to the Inland Revenue, under a controversial judgment from the
Lords yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Anyone who tips, or provides payments when there is no contractual
relationship, will become an unofficial tax collector, according to
accountants' interpretations of the law lords' ruling.
The case - Inland Revenue Commissioners vs Herd - concerned a man who had
sold shares in his employers' company back to the company. The Revenue
argued the employer should have deducted tax before making a payment to him.
But the ruling - which found against Mr Herd - suggests a very wide-ranging
definition of what constitutes an employer required to comply with the pay
as you earn tax system. It implies that anyone who pays emoluments to
another person is an employer where the transaction results in pure profit.
Those most directly affected will include employers paying termination money
or those offering introductory payments to new employees.
Ms Leslie Ferrar, a partner at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, called the
judgment 'a commercial nonsense'. She said it demonstrated the need for a
fundamental overhaul of existing PAYE regulations - only a few weeks after
the Revenue issued a consolidated version of the existing rules.
The Revenue said last night: 'We would need to consider the implications of
the judgment.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / Debt-ridden Norco faces liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTHERN Co-operative Society, north-east Scotland's biggest retailer,
applied yesterday to go into liquidation, putting 800 full-time and
part-time jobs under threat.
Norco, one of the area's biggest employers for 130 years, said last month it
was trying to save its debt-ridden business through a merger with the
Co-operative Wholesale Society, the main supplier to the whole co-operative
movement and the largest co-operative retail-er.
But a CWS board meeting on Wednesday decided not to proceed with the merger.
Norco said it had not been able to secure adequate support from its bankers
and had no choice but to go into liquida-tion.
Norco said the CWS decision was of 'immense regret' after the 'substantial
progress' Norco had made in reducing its debts in recent months.
CWS said it had considered the merger 'seriously and sympathetically' but
concluded that Norco's problems were mainly of a financial and property
nature rather than concerned with trading, and it was 'extremely late in the
day' for CWS to intervene.
Norco's 89,000 members, who have shares and savings accounts with the
society, and other investors and bondholders are partly protected by the
Co-operative Deposit Protection Scheme. The CWS pledged to provide
additional funds to ensure all investors received full repayment of their
capital. The total involved is believed to be more than Pounds 2m.
A liquidator is expected to be appointed today to investigate whether any
part of Norco can be saved. The society has a superstore in Dundee and 20
convenience stores in north-east Scotland. It employs 200 full-time and 600
part-time staff.
Norco has suffered a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes in three years. In
1990 it was Scotland's biggest co-operative society and its board approved a
Pounds 30m development plan aimed at doubling sales to Pounds 130m in 18
months.
Bank loans took gearing to 200 per cent, which proved impossible to manage
as the recession set in, and the society made a record Pounds 7.4m deficit
in the year to April 1992.
Under pressure from its bankers Norco was forced to sell assets to pay off
its debts. Newly built superstores at Westhill, on the outskirts of
Aberdeen, and at Banchory, Ellon and Elgin were sold to Argyll, owner of
Safeway, the grocery chain.
In March Norco's flagship Berryden store in Aberdeen was sold to Scottish
Co-op, the Scottish retail group of the CWS, for about Pounds 15m, and
Norco's dairy operations were sold to Kennerty Farm Dairies.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Price rises muted despite signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL INFLATION excluding food fell to a 33-year low last month, government
figures released yesterday show. The figures underline how upward pressures
on prices have remained muted in spite of signs of recovery.
The low inflation stemmed mainly from continued weakness in price pressures
in a range of goods and services including fuel, estate agents' fees,
alcoholic drink and televisions.
Some items, such as clothing and shoes, second-hand cars and fares have
registered relatively large price rises, however.
In the year to last month the retail prices index excluding food rose by 1.1
per cent, after 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to April. It was the lowest
figure since March 1960.
The year-on-year increase in the RPI last month was 1.3 per cent, the same
as in April which saw the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964. In May
the index stood at 141.1, up 0.4 per cent on the 140.6 registered in April.
Excluding mortgage payments, the RPI rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May,
after a 2.9 per cent year-on-year rise in April. That was the lowest
12-month rise since the Central Statistical Office started records in 1975.
The Treasury would like to keep the figure below 4 per cent.
Upward pressure on the RPI remained low, in spite of an increase of 4.4 per
cent in the price of seasonal food during the month. That jump - the biggest
May increase since 1982 - was mainly because of large rises in the prices of
items such as kiwi fruit, cauliflowers and apples.
In the year to last month prices of personal goods and services, alcoholic
beverages, and leisure services rose by 4.2 per cent, 4.7 per cent and 4.1
per cent respectively. In all cases the increases were the lowest 12-month
changes since 1988.
Housing costs fell 7 per cent in the 12 months to May, largely reflecting
the 23 per cent fall in mortgage payments for the average homebuyer over the
year. Charges for local taxation fell 9 per cent, mainly because of the
replacement of the poll tax by the less costly council tax and the
consequent increase in Treasury grants to local authorities.
Prices of household goods rose in the year to last month by a low 1.6 per
cent, reflecting weakness in demand for such items as furniture,
furnishings, cookers and pet food.
Inflation is thought likely to edge up in coming months, as the effects on
housing costs of cuts in mortgage rates in the early part of last year drop
out of the calculations.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Slow wage growth raises job hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAY'S SURPRISE fall in unemployment - the fourth in a row - suggests that
the UK labour market has stabilised while subdued wage and cost pressures
yesterday raised hopes that jobless numbers may fall further.
But while Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, hailed the figures as
'good news' and a 'remarkable achievement', the Department for Employment's
statisticians were in no hurry to declare that unemployment is now firmly on
the downward path.
'They don't want to have a stab at a trend,' the department said. 'We are a
bit cautious. There could still be monthly increases.'
Economists and officials are still unsure why seasonally adjusted
unemployment has declined from its January peak of 2.99m to the provisional
total of 2.91m on May 13.
Unemployment has traditionally been regarded as a lagging indicator of
economic activity. Yet its downward trend in recent months has coincided
with rising industrial production and retail sales.
The latest decline suggests that labour markets have become more responsive
to economic conditions, due in part to trade union reforms and heightened
international competition. If so, Britain is more of a hire and fire
society.
Some support for this can be found in yesterday's employment statistics.
They show that the largest number of hours lost through short-time working
in manufacturing industry in the recent recession was 1.08m in December last
year. During the previous recession, 8m hours were lost in one month in
1980, indicating that companies hoarded labour more at that time.
The figures also go some way to refuting claims that people have been
removed wholesale from the unemployment register through such means as
registering for invalidity benefit. While the UK workforce in employment
fell by 17,000 in the first quarter to 24.92m in March, the number of
employees actually rose to 21.37m from 21.35m in December. The overall drop
reflected falls in the number of self-employed, the armed forces and those
on work-related government training programmes.
Also encouraging was a seasonally-adjusted rise in Jobcentre vacancies
between April and May. Up only 100 to 123,600, the total was the highest for
more than two years.
The unemployment figures also fell in all regions last month except for the
north, where the total stayed the same. Blackspots remain, however. Greater
London's unemployed total fell only 1,600 with the jobless rate staying
unchanged at a higher than average 11.6 per cent. Unemployment in the two
worst areas - Northern Ireland and the north of England - was 13.9 and 12.1
per cent respectively against a national average of 10.4 per cent.
Figures for average earnings, productivity and unit labour costs point to
improved UK competitiveness that may result in a further pick up in the
labour market.
Average earnings rose at an underlying rate of 4 per cent in the year to
April, unchanged from March and the lowest rate of increase for 25 years.
While average earnings in manufacturing rose by an underlying 5 per cent in
April - unchanged from March's figure which was revised up by 0.25 per cent
 -earnings growth in the service sector slowed to 3.5 per cent in April from
3.75 per cent in March.
Manufacturing output per head rose by 2.5 per cent in the three months to
April compared with the previous three months and was 7.8 per cent higher
than in the three months ended April last year.
As a result unit labour costs in manufacturing fell 2.8 per cent in the
three months to April compared with the same 1992 period - the second
biggest fall since statistics were first gathered in 1970.

FT  18 JUN 93 / BP backs proposed oil tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum has written to MPs welcoming the government's proposed
changes to North Sea oil taxes.
Mr Chris Gibson-Smith, BP's head of European exploration, said in his
letter: 'It is in the national interest that these reforms are implemented
without delay.'
In an amendment to the Finance Bill, the government is proposing to cut the
rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and to abolish
tax relief on exploration work.
On Wednesday, it also suggested an amendment to extend transitional aid to
smaller companies to cushion them from the immediate effects of the tax
changes.
BP said the reforms were publicly supported by companies representing 60 per
cent of UK oil production. Smaller companies have led an outcry over the
proposed tax changes, claiming they would halve exploration work and cost up
to 30,000 jobs.

FT  18 JUN 93 / B Gas isolated in watchdog dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS and its regulator, Ofgas, clashed yesterday on how well the
regulation of the gas industry was working.
However, at the same conference on utility regulation in London, water and
electricity companies had few complaints about how the regulatory regime -
set up when they were privatised - was working.
Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas's director-general, hit back at criticism that he
had been too tough on British Gas and interfered arbitrarily in its
business. 'British Gas has blamed Ofgas for the decline in its
profitability. I suggest it should start looking into the mirror,' he said.
But Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, called for the power of
utility regulators to be diluted by the appointment of non-executive
directors to their boards, and for regulators to be required to give reasons
for their decisions.
The dispute between Ofgas and British Gas has become particularly bitter
since the company was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last
year. The commission is due to report to the government by the end of next
month.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity
regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator,
also dismissed criticism that the regulatory system was not working.
Prof Littlechild acknowledged that customers were concerned about utilities'
prices and profits but said that he was dealing with such concerns by
reviews of the regional electricity companies and the main electricity
generators.
Mr Byatt emphasised the importance of regulators explaining their judgments
but rejected the idea of more detailed rules to constrain their discretion.
The regulators received support from Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of
Yorkshire Electric. He said: 'UK regulation is less costly, less combative
and more efficient than US regulation.'

FT  18 JUN 93 / ITV takeover stance criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT shareholder in an ITV company yesterday wrote to Mr Peter
Brooke, national heritage secretary, protesting about the attitude of ITV
management to takeovers.
Mr Nicholas Berry, chairman of Stancroft Trust, which owns 10 per cent of
Grampian, the holder of the ITV franchise for northern Scotland, said ITV
chairmen and chief executives should not be campaigning against a relaxation
of the takeover rules. He said he favoured more ITV takeovers as a way of
realising shareholder value.
In his letter to Mr Brooke Mr Berry said he did not believe that Grampian's
neighbours should be prohibited from taking over the company, since this
would obviously be beneficial to shareholders.
'I believe that similar views would be expressed by shareholders in the
other companies,' said Mr Berry. He added that spokesmen for the companies
involved, often owning a minute number of shares, represented no one but
themselves.
Mr Berry raised the issue following the meeting on Monday between the ITV
chairmen and Mr Brooke to discuss whether there should be a relaxation of
the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over.
There was a majority at the meeting in favour of takeovers among the nine
if, as seems likely, the government does not intend to extend the
'moratorium' on takeovers due to run out at the end of this year.
It is already possible for any European Community company - apart from the
nine ITV groups - to take over an ITV company.
Until the end of the year the Independent Television Commission has to be
informed of a takeover move in advance and has the discretion to block it if
it is judged to be prejudicial to the ITV network. But there is not an
automatic block or moratorium.
A friendly bid from continental Europe or any British company outside the
ranks of the ITV nine would stand a better chance of success than a hostile
one. But the ITC concedes that it could be difficult to decide whether a bid
against an ITV company really was hostile if its shareholders were attracted
by the financial deal.
From January next year the ITC will merely have to check that a bid is
consistent with the rules set by parliament.

FT  18 JUN 93 / DTI will talk only to large lobby groups, Heseltine says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCESS TO government ministers is likely to be curtailed for a large number
of trade associations as a result of a policy to restrict contact to a
smaller number of 'lead associations.'
The policy, disclosed in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry
by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, would apply only
to the industry department - the main channel of government contact for most
trade associations.
The aim is to improve the poor quality of industrial lobbying and reduce the
plethora of sometimes conflicting voices demanding the attention of
ministers.
Smaller trade associations may be required to group together in loose
federations or merge with larger, more powerful organisations, or risk
losing membership.
Mr Heseltine said: 'Too many trade associations are narrowly focused, poorly
resourced and ill-equipped to help the industries they represent.
'In future, where a lead association had emerged in a sector and the subject
of the proposals is relevant to the whole sector, or wider, my officials
would refer to me only proposals from that lead associa-tion.
'Where these representations were received from elsewhere - even from other
trade associations in the sector - my officials would refer them back to the
lead association for co-ordination.' Mr Heseltine said this might create
difficulties but 'there might be no better way to build a single powerful
effective unit to represent the sector'.
He singled out the Chemical Industries Association as the kind of powerfully
resourced association ministers might prefer to deal with. Engineering
companies by comparison were represented by almost 50 associations and 'one
sometimes wonders why'.
Mr Heseltine said: 'There is a general assumption that trade associations in
Britain are weaker and less influential than their counterparts in the US
and many industrial sectors in Europe.'
In future, ministers and officials would be more frank in criticising the
quality of associations to the industrialists that paid for their services.
Mr Heseltine was particularly critical of the way many trade associations
had failed to 'have thought through the implications of the growing European
dimension' of business.
Mr Heseltine announced a new competition under which trade associations
could receive a total of Pounds 500,000. Awards will be made for the '10 or
so' best proposals for establishing 'benchmark' clubs, under which companies
pool information on the best ways of improving competitiveness in areas such
as purchasing or materials handling.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Scottish auditors press for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants of Scotland is to launch a lobbying
campaign to support its controversial proposals for the restructuring of
auditing in the UK.
In a document issued this week it suggests the creation of an audit review
panel for every quoted company, independent of management, which would
supervise the appointment of auditors, agree their remuneration and receive
their reports.
It also calls for a substantial increase in the importance of the internal
audit function in companies with the introduction of a chief internal
auditor to be appointed by a committee of non-executive directors.
The institute has submitted its conclusions to bodies including the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Auditing Practices Board. It will
be considering a series of research projects to explore issues in the report
in more detail.
Its document - Auditing into the Twenty-First Century - stresses that
directors should provide greater assurances to the public on whether their
company has adequate resources to continue operating in the future and on
action taken to minimise the risk of fraud.
It says auditors - renamed 'assessors' - should report on the reliability of
internal controls with a detailed statement signed by a named partner in an
accountancy firm.
It says the audit review panel should comprise about three members drawn
from a list held by the Stock Exchange. Members of the panel would appoint
their own successors from the list.
The institute has a reputation for making controversial and influential
recommendations. Several years ago it produced Making Corporate Reports
Valuable, which has formed the basis for many of the recommendations by the
Accounting Standards Board.
Its officials were also instrumental in establishing the Cadbury committee
on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which reported in
December.
Mr Mike Townsend, finance director of Rolls-Royce, said he believed
strengthening internal audit was inevitable, but called the suggestions to
remove power over the auditors from executive directors 'very odd'.

FT  18 JUN 93 / 82% of 16-year-olds 'stay in education or training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAREERS services yesterday revealed that 82 per cent of 16-year-olds in the
UK are remaining in full-time education or training.
A study by the National Heads of the Careers Service showed that in England
and Wales alone, 65 per cent of 16-year-olds stayed in full-time education
last year, 13.2 per cent chose youth training and 7.7 per cent employment.
In England and Wales in 1989 18.2 per cent of 16-year-olds went into
employment, while only 48.2 per cent stayed at school. Much of the increase
has been caused by job scarcity. The take-up of youth training has also
fallen, from 21.7 per cent in 1989.
In Northern Ireland 66 per cent stayed in education and 4 per cent entered
employment.
A survey of 224 employers, published yesterday by Industrial Relations
Services, the research organisation, shows that job scarcity will worsen
this year. It found that only a third of employers would definitely recruit
school leavers this summer, with a further quarter uncertain of their plans.
Nearly 40 per cent said they would not recruit school leavers - compared
with 11 per cent last year.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Timex strikers reject severance payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BITTER industrial dispute at the Timex plant in Dundee is set to
continue after sacked workers yesterday rejected the company's offer of
severance payments in exchange for a return to work by some employees and an
orderly rundown of the factory before it closes at Christmas.
A mass meeting voted overwhelmingly not to accept Timex's offer of work for
50 to 100 of the workers and subsequent negotiations on severance pay for
all 343 dismissed members of the AEEU engineering union. The offer involved
accepting what the workers see as a 27 per cent cut in wages and benefits.
Mr John Kydd, union convener at the plant, said: 'There was no way we could
accept this offer for some of our members on terms that have already been
rejected, particularly as the company has treated us like garbage for the
past 20 weeks.'
Timex said: 'An opportunity to achieve a lasting settlement to the conflict
has been lost. Our former workforce could have benefited from a settlement
negotiated with the company or through Acas which would have meant them
leaving the picket lines with dignity and a just financial settlement. Local
union officials have failed to grasp the reality of plant closure and have
again failed their own members.'
Timex faces continued picketing and an intensified campaign to have its
products boycotted.
Without a negotiated return to work the workers will receive no compensation
or redundancy pay since they are deemed to have dismissed themselves by
going on strike in January.
Mr Stuart MacIntosh, who has been with the company for 10 years, said on
leaving the meeting: 'The dispute goes on. We will fight for our jobs and
proper redundancy.'
A first step will come this weekend with a mass demonstration outside the
Timex plant. Organisers hope that 10,000 people will attend from all over
Britain.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union
Congress, said the demonstration 'was to have been a static demonstration
outside the plant but now we are going to have a march'.
Five windows were smashed at the Oslo offices of Mr Fred Olsen, the
Norwegian shipping operator, yesterday. An employee said the damage may have
been a protest against the decision to close the Timex factory in Dundee -
Timex is owned by Mr Olsen.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Bristol and Avon gain new lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARTNERSHIP between the public and private sectors in Bristol and Avon has
been set up to agree an economic strategy for the region and to promote it
in the European Community.
The partnership, to be run as a company called the Western Development
Partnership in Avon, has initial funding for the first year of Pounds
250,000 from councils, industry and the Avon Training and Enterprise
Council.
Its formation follows long negotiations amid fears that the effects of the
recession have been exacerbated in Avon and the south-west of England by the
lack of a united voice to represent the region and promote inward
investment. The partnership may eventually include neighbouring counties.
The partnership is supported by councils including Avon, Bristol and Bath,
and by companies, trade unions, professional bodies, universities and
chambers of commerce.
The chairman is Mr David Johnson, a Labour Avon county councillor, and the
vice-chairman is Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West
Building Society.
They said in a joint statement: 'Around 20,000 jobs have been lost in Avon
during the recession and a third of those won't come back even when recovery
gets under way. Avon faces stiff competition from other parts of the UK and
Europe, so we need to act swiftly and decisively to attract inward
investment. At the same time, we want to help existing local businesses to
succeed.'
Other board members include Mr Chris Geoghegan, managing director of British
Aerospace's Airbus division, Mr David Hider, regional chairman of British
Gas South West, and Mr Alfred Morris, vice-chancellor of the University of
the West of England.
Mr Chris Garcia, a strategic planning consultant, has been appointed to
devise a business plan, and a chief executive will be appointed in the
autumn.
Last week the Local Government Commission recommended that the county of

the county's future, the partnership had agreed to set up a framework to
develop Avon as an important European area.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Aid for exporters to be increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AID FOR exporters under Britain's Aid and Trade Provision is to be increased
this year, targeted mainly at China and Indonesia, the government said
yesterday after a year-long review of the future of ATP, David Dodwell
writes.
The ATP budget for 1993-94 will rise by more than 6 per cent from Pounds
110m to Pounds 117m, mainly as a result of unspent funds available for last
year being carried forward.
The decision to target China and Indonesia follows criticism that the impact
of the ATP budget had been blunted in the past because it had been spread
too thinly across projects in the developing world.
An official said yesterday: 'These are major growth markets where the best
opportunities arise for British companies to win subsequent business on
non-aided terms.'
Other eligible countries - that is creditworthy countries with annual income
per head of less than Dollars 700 (Pounds 466.60) - are India, Ghana,
Lesotho, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Possible routes for new motorway submitted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE possible routes were put forward yesterday by the Welsh Office for a
14-mile motorway to relieve traffic congestion on the M4 around Newport,
south Wales.
All three routes would run from the tolls of the second River Severn
crossing and cross the river Usk, south of Newport, to link with the M4 at
Castleton, east of Cardiff. Construction of the motorway is not expected to
start before the turn of the century.
The options have been drawn up by Ove Arup, consulting engineers, and will
go to public consultation. They all cross the low-lying Gwent Levels, which
include sites of special scientific interest.
There is likely to be opposition from environmental groups but Sir Wyn
Roberts, Welsh Office minister, said the road would add to the significant
benefits that the M4 corridor had brought to south Wales. No decision had
been taken on how the motorway would be financed, he said.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiators yesterday appeared to have averted
a serious crisis after the government and the African National Congress made
concessions to permit the Inkatha Freedom party and its allies to return to
talks.
Inkatha and five of its conservative allies stormed out of the 26-party
negotiating council on Tuesday, raising fears that the conservative bloc
known as the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) would boycott the talks
permanently.
Cosag returned to the talks after the council accepted its demand that the
merits of a federal versus a unitary state should be considered, as well as
different forms of transition to democracy - whether a constitution is
written by elected or appointed representatives.
The walk-out provoked a test of strength between the conservative bloc
headed by Inkatha, and blocs led by the ANC and the government, which often
act together in the talks. The ANC and government clearly decided to give in
to Inkatha's demands rather than provoke a permanent withdrawal.
But the solution - to refer to a technical committee the questions of form
of state and transition - does no more than postpone the crisis. The council
must decide on the two issues within the next few weeks. At that point,
those who disagree may again walk-out.
Some members of the Cosag group - notably, the white right-wing Conservative
party - seem likely to withdraw permanently once the form of state is
finally decided. The Conservative party demands a separate homeland for
Afrikaners within a confederal state.
Inkatha's participation remains in the balance.

FT  18 JUN 93 / UN orders Somali warlord arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations yesterday ordered the arrest and detention of General
Mohammed Farah Aideed after an attack on the Somali warlord's headquarters
in which five peacekeepers and an unknown number of Somalis died.
A UN spokesman in New York said Gen Aideed's militia had been driven from
its base and that the casualties occurred during 'really fierce battles
raging in the streets' of the capital, Mogadishu.
The whereabouts of Gen Aideed remained a mystery although it was reported he
was holed up in a hospital. Admiral Jonathan Howe, the UN special
representative in Somalia, said that safeguarding Somali civilians as well
as UN personnel required Gen Aideed's detention. French, Italian and
Pakistani UN forces were to undertake the operation, with the US providing
air support.
The move draws the UN forces further into the conflict which has ravaged the
African country. The UN said Gen Aideed's arrest was necessary pending an
investigation into an attack on Pakistani troops in Mogadishu on June 5 that
left 23 dead and many wounded. However, UN lawyers are unsure where and
under what law Gen Aideed, who has been accused of directing the attack,
would be prosecuted.
Early yesterday Gen Aideed's villa and the houses of two chief henchmen were
stormed by UN soldiers. Four Moroccans and one Pakistani were killed while
37 Moroccans, three Frenchmen, three Pakistanis and one American were
wounded.
The UN spokesman accused armed Somalis of hiding behind civilians and said
the Moroccans came under fire when confronted with a demonstration. The
city's two main hospitals said more than 60 people had been killed yesterday
and a further 100 wounded.
A representative of Action Internationale Contre la Faim, (AICF), a French
aid organisation, told France-Info radio from Mogadishu that a US Cobra
helicopter had fired two rockets into its office in the city, killing a
local employee and wounding six others.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party was scrambling last night to muster
the numbers to stave off defeat in a no-confidence vote, scheduled for
today, that could force Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to call a snap
election.
The no-confidence motion was proposed yesterday by three opposition parties,
which are confident that defections from the ruling party will swing the
vote their way.
The move came after the LDP in effect ended debate on changes to the
scandal-prone political system, provoking anger among LDP reformers who
wanted party leaders to negotiate a reform package with the opposition.
The prospect of instability has cast a shadow over the Group of Seven summit
of leading industrial nations, due to be held in Tokyo on July 7-9. If the
LDP is defeated in today's vote, Mr Miyazawa's grip on power will be greatly
weakened, and he may be forced to resign to take responsibility.
Visiting leaders could find themselves caught in the middle of an election
campaign, as a poll should be held within 40 days of a successful
no-confidence motion. The government hoped the summit would be a showcase
for the country's growing international role but, instead, the event could
highlight the inadequacies of the LDP's leadership.
The no-confidence vote will hinge on the actions of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
leader of a pro-reform faction in the LDP, who yesterday suggested that he
was prepared to vote against his party. If the 35 Hata faction members do
defect, the motion will be carried.
The likelihood of continuing instability prompted business leaders to call
on the LDP to reach a compromise with the opposition parties. Mr Yuji
Tanahashi, vice-minister of international trade and industry, attributed the
weakness of Tokyo stock prices in recent days to political conflict.
LDP officials were hoping last night to convince reformers to stay with the
party by offering to extend the present session of parliament, scheduled to
end on Sunday, by another two weeks to continue the reform debate.
But Mr Hata has indicated that he sees the no-confidence vote today as an
important turning point in Japanese politics. If his faction does retreat
from the commitment to reform, Mr Hata's personal credibility will be
undermined and the LDP will be able to return to politics as usual.

MALAWI'S President Kamuzu Banda said yesterday he accepted the result of
this week's democracy referendum but that his government would not resign or
be replaced by an interim administration, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
The life president said the two-to-one vote for multi-party rule presented
voters with a choice of political systems but did not give the opposition
the right to form a transitional government.
'What the people of Malawi have said in this referendum is that they want
other political parties to be formed in this country to compete with the
(ruling) Malawi Congress party,' Mr Banda said in a radio broadcast.
Opposition leaders rejected his statement, accusing him of clinging to power
and violating the spirit of the referendum.

NIGERIA'S National Electoral Commission yesterday announced it would appeal
against this week's court ruling restraining it from publishing election
results.
It said it was taking the case to the appeal court in an effort to put the
country's presidential elections back on course. A high court ban on the
outcome of Saturday's presidential elections threatened to undermine the
democratic process which is due to restore civilian rule on August 27 and
cast fresh doubts on the readiness of President Ibrahim Babangida to hand
over power.
Mr Ahmed Kusamotu, the chairman of the electoral commission, said yesterday
that the suspension of the result was not in the best interests of democracy
in the country. 'The NEC is being manipulated by the authorities,' said Mr
Amos Idakula, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, which had a
commanding polls lead after half the 30 states' results had been announced
earlier this week.
The Campaign for Democracy echoed the injustice felt by many at the legal
wrangle which has disrupted the polls. 'What upsets us about this court
order is that it comes from a justice minister who gave the NEC complete
discretion to carry out the polls,' said Dr Beko Ransome Kuti.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREAN prosecutors have completed their corruption investigation of
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the country's main steel company, by
arresting two company officials.
They also claim that Mr Park Tae-joon, who established the state-controlled
group 25 years ago and served as its chairman until last October, received a
total of Won3.9bn (Pounds 3.2m) in bribes from subcontrac-tors and embezzled
another Won79m.
Mr Park fled to Japan after the government began an unprecedented tax audit
of Posco in February.
Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, who briefly succeeded Mr Park as chairman before
resigning in April, was arrested on bribery charges along with Mr Yoo
Sang-boo, a vice-president and former manager of plant construction.
The presidents of two subcontractors who allegedly bribed the Posco
executives have also been arrested.
The probe of Posco, which is part of the new government's anti-corruption
campaign, has been criticised as being politically motivated.
Mr Park, a former senior official in the ruling Democratic Liberal party,
last year opposed the presidential candidacy of Mr Kim Young-sam, who was
elected last December.
Posco is one of the few companies that has been extensively investigated by
the new government on corruption charges.
The results of the investigation have proved to be surprising since Mr Park
was considered to be one of the country's most able businessmen, with a
reputation for honesty.
Mr Park, a former army general, was ordered by then military government in
1968 to create the nation's steel industry from scratch. Despite doubts that
he would succeed, he transformed Posco into the world's third largest steel
company and one that remains profitable while most of its main international
competitors suffer losses.
Mr Park was also a pioneer in providing social services to his workers,
although his management style was criticised for being authoritarian.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Egypt to seek IMF deal to ease debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Egyptian economic policy makers will go to Washington early next week
to try to reach an accord with the International Monetary Fund which would
trigger forgiveness of around Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in Paris Club
debts.
Mr Atef Sidiki, the prime minister, said after a gathering of Egypt's top
economic aides on Wednesday that talks towards the agreement, which have
been under way since April, were 'advancing with rapid steps'. He said
differences between the government and the IMF and World Bank were 'limited
to small areas'.
But western economists say neither the IMF nor World Bank is entirely happy
with Egypt's speed or energy in implementing reforms designed to steer the
economy towards a free market. An official familiar with the talks put the
chances of reaching an agreement during next week's discussions at '40:60
against'.
The IMF executive board endorsed Egypt's first agreement with the agency in
March, after several months' delay. Under this accord Egypt trimmed its
budget deficit, cut inflation, stabilised its currency and bolstered
reserves while making a start on structural reforms.
Next week's trip by Egyptian officials follows IMF visits to Cairo in April
and May which made 'some progress', according to officials, but left a
series of outstanding differences. Western economists say agreement has to
be found on a figure for Egypt's budget deficit - government officials have
said the IMF is seeking a cut from 3.5 per cent of GDP under the present
agreement to 2 per cent - the pace and breadth of proposed income tax
reforms and the IMF's call tariff cuts.
The World Bank, meanwhile, wants Egypt to accelerate a privatisation
programme now running well behind schedule.
The government in February bowed to heavy IMF and World Bank pressure by
listing 16 assets and companies for immediate sale, but no deal has been
finalised. 'The big question is if the government is unable to sell them, or
doesn't want to sell them,' said a western economist.
World Bank approval of Egypt's structural reform efforts is an informal
precondition for final IMF agreement to a new accord. Cairo's need for an
accord lies not in any attendant standby loan, since Egypt is sitting on
record reserves of Dollars 14.3bn, but rather in the triggering of further
debt relief.
Egypt's Paris Club donors agreed in 1991 to forgive 15 per cent of its then
outstanding Dollars 20bn debt and write off a further 15 per cent on
reaching a first IMF accord - which was achieved in March.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Pakistan cherishes peace role: A UN route to winning friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTANI troops in the United Nations force in Somalia have this month been
at the centre first of tragedy, when 23 of their number were massacred by
Somali gunmen, and then heated controversy when 12 civilians died in
crossfire when the soldiers shot at a demonstration in Mogadishu. Yesterday
at least one more Pakistani was killed in fighting in the capital.
Pakistani soldiers also are serving in the UN operation in Cambodia.
Islamabad believes that acquiring a peacekeeper's role will help its
diplomatic case on the disputed Indian state of Kashmir.
The two countries disagree on ways to resolve the issue. While New Delhi
claims that Kashmir is in an internal matter, Islamabad demands that the
future of the state should be determined under UN resolutions calling for a
plebiscite.
'Pakistan believes that UN peacekeeping is the only rational alternative to
unilateral imposition of the decisions of major global or regional powers,'
said a foreign ministry spokesman recently when asked about the motives for
sending soldiers to join the Blue Helments.
Both Pakistan and India have fought three wars and there have been exchanges
of fire on a number of occasions between the thousands of troops deployed on
each side of the disputed border in Kashmir, known as the line of control.
Tensions have been mounting in the state during the past three years amid
intense guerilla operations waged by separatists. India has accused Pakistan
on a number of occasions of supporting those militants, a charge which
Islamabad denies.
In recent days, some senior officials have said that joining the UN
deployments would also strengthen their case for continuing with the United
Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (Unmogip) operation
either until the Kashmir issue is resolved or at least until relations
improve and tensions are lowered.
Unmogip has been in place since 1949. It consists of military observers
drawn from UN member countries who monitor the line of control.
In spite of recent events in Somalia, Pakistan is likely to try to join
other operations. 'A large Moslem army of almost half a million certainly
gives Pakistan an edge in operations in Moslem countries where there will be
less resentment from the local population,' says one western diplomat.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Miyazawa's frail grip exposed: The cruel humbling of the
Japanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW days ago Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, looked forward
with justifiable relish to the Group of Seven summit next month in Tokyo
where he would have been one of the stronger world leaders on display. Now
he will be fortunate if he has the pleasure of hosting the gathering.
His relative strength was partly a reflection of weakness or changes
elsewhere in the world leadership, but Mr Miyazawa's frail grip on Japanese
power has been cruelly exposed by the events of the past few days.
Instead of showing leadership, he has been relegated to a bit part by other
faction leaders in the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Mr Miyazawa's fate will be determined by a no-confidence motion presented
yesterday by opposition parties and scheduled to be voted on today in the
lower house of the Diet, the Japanese parliament. If the vote is lost, the
prime minister must dissolve his cabinet or call a general election within
10 days.
LDP officials were coaxing reform-minded members of the party not to abstain
or defect during the no-confidence vote, and one compromise apparently
offered last night was Mr Miyazawa's political head. The resignation of the
prime minister would not itself bring political reform, but it would enable
the reformers to argue that they had achieved something.
Mr Miyazawa was said yesterday to 'regret' that he had not supported the
original LDP proposal for reform, which could not win parliamentary approval
and was designed to ensure that the scandal-prone political system remained
unaltered.
Japan has a system of multi-seat constituencies which encourages competition
among the LDP factions, making politics an expensive business and tempting
politicians to accept illegal donations in return for a wink, a nod and a
lucrative construction contract.
Opposition parties are in favour of a system mixing single seats and
proportional representation, which they reckon would increase their chances
of success against the LDP. The four largest opposition parties are yet to
agree on the fine details of reform, but they did agree to move the
no-confidence motion yesterday against the Miyazawa cabinet.
Even if the no-confidence motion fails, Mr Miyazawa, aged 73, has given
another bumbling performance this week that has lowered his standing and
probably shortened his prime ministerial life.
For a month last year, during the height of a corruption scandal, he was
speechless when asked about the fate of the scandal-stricken godfather of
Japanese politics, Mr Shin Kanemaru. The mute Mr Miyazawa was mocked by
television reports, which showed him inspecting dairy cattle, attending
local fairs, and ambling into parliament but refusing to answer
Kanemaru-related questions. He was reticent because Mr Kanemaru had kindly
done the backroom work to ensure his appointment as prime minister.
In the weeks after this self-imposed silence, Mr Miyazawa's popularity
rating plunged to 12 per cent - at last count it was 25 per cent. These poor
returns are in contrast to the popular optimism at the time of his
appointment two years ago, when he was portrayed as the thinking person's
LDP faction head, relatively liberal and, perhaps, the man to wield the
reform broom.
'The most important task of my time in office will be to get rid of money
politics,' he said then. But he has not been able to bring himself to
overturn the system which made him, leaving him particularly vulnerable at a
time when an appropriate scapegoat is needed.
Before he lost control of the reform debate, Mr Miyazawa had a fair chance
of extending his stay in office when the present term ends in September. He
knew his place, leaving other LDP factions to bicker over the policies that
mattered most to them, while showing signs of leadership during a difficult
debate over whether Japanese military personnel should be sent abroad on
peacekeeping missions.
But his chances of a second term have diminished each day this week. If a
snap election is held, the LDP is likely to fare badly, and the prime
minister will be under extreme pressure to resign. If an election is not
called, he will face continuing attacks from the reformers in the LDP.
Mr Miyazawa, and other LDP elders, must long for the return of Mr Kanemaru,
who is awaiting trial on tax evasion charges. The godfather had the clout to
keep maverick factions in line, and it was the splitting of his own faction
that led to the creation of the one led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance
minister, which is threatening to vote against the government today.
Perhaps the prime minister was prescient when he at last ended his
self-imposed silence on the Kanemaru case - on the day the godfather
resigned, a dazed Mr Miyazawa shook his head and said: 'It's a very
unfortunate thing.'

Police yesterday arrested Ms Medha Patkar, India's most prominent
environmentalist, and 85 of her supporters on the 15th day of her fast to
prevent the multi-billion dollar Narmada dam project going ahead, Reuter
reports from Bombay.
The project will displace nearly 200,000 people in three states. Ms Patkar
says the government must suspend work and announce a complete review of the
plan before she will give up her fast.
Police said they arrested her 'because her health was deteriorating' and to
prevent any trouble.

THE POSSIBILITY of Khmer Rouge officials being included in the new Cambodian
government yesterday alarmed politicians and foreign observers a day after
the interim administration was formally announced.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state, released a statement saying
there would be no Khmer Rouge officials in the government. The day after
announcing the formation of a new interim administration, he said only
members of elected parties could join the government.
However, at the same time the prince published a letter to Mr Khieu Samphan,
nominal Khmer Rouge leader, inviting the faction to send representatives to
Phnom Penh to hold 'family-style' talks with the interim government. For
months, the prince has talked of the need for a government of national
reconciliation.
When the prospect of Khmer Rouge representation was first raised by Prince
Sihanouk in a speech to the Constituent Assembly on Tuesday, there was a
swift and hostile reaction from the US. Officials in Washington and
diplomats in Phnom Penh made it clear they would resist any Khmer Rouge
involvement in a Cambodian government.
Prince Sihanouk's statement was intended to calm US fears and to assuage the
Cambodian People's party, the former communist party which has ruled the
country and fought a civil war against the Khmer Rouge since it was
installed by Vietnam in 1979.
Earlier yesterday Prince Sihanouk received the leaders of a short-lived but
violent movement for autonomy in eastern Cambodia, one of whom was his son,
Prince Chakrapong.

THE TOP policy-making body of India's ruling Congress party yesterday
expressed 'full faith and confidence' in the leadership of Mr P V Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, who was accused on Wednesday of accepting a bribe
of Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) from Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the
centre of the Bombay securities scandal.
The Congress working committee said it saw a 'sinister game and pattern'
behind Mr Mehta's 'baseless and malicious aspersions'. Mr Arjun Singh, a
cabinet minister, and Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state,
who are the prime minister's two main opponents within the party, staunchly
supported Mr Rao, who seemed tired and distraught after the latest political
storm in his turbulent two-year tenure.
At a press conference on Wednesday Mr Mehta alleged that he had given Mr Rao
a suitcase-full of money to fund a by-election in November 1991, five months
before the Rs50bn Bombay financial scandal which brought Mr Mehta's
downfall.
Rumours that Mr Rao would resign had unsettled Indian stock markets
yesterday, but trading was thin.
Opposition leaders none the less demanded the resignation of Mr Rao.
The Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, the largest opposition party, which is
currently holding its annual policy-making meeting in the southern city
Bangalore, said that the country 'could not afford a scam-tainted and
insecure prime minister' and demanded an independent investigation into the
stockbroker's allegations.
Several members of the parliamentary committee investigating the financial
scan - dal yesterday demanded that Mr Rao be summoned before the committee
for questioning.
Mr Mehta's lawyer yesterday demanded that the government's Central Bureau of
Investigation investigate the charges against the prime minister.

NIGERIA'S National Electoral Commission yesterday announced it would appeal
against this week's court ruling restraining it from publishing election
results.
It said it was taking the case to the appeal court in an effort to put the
country's presidential elections back on course. A high court ban on the
outcome of Saturday's presidential elections threatened to undermine the
democratic process which is due to restore civilian rule on August 27 and
cast fresh doubts on the readiness of President Ibrahim Babangida to hand
over power.
Mr Ahmed Kusamotu, the chairman of the electoral commission, said yesterday
that the suspension of the result was not in the best interests of democracy
in the country.
'The NEC is being manipulated by the authorities,' said Mr Amos Idakula, a
spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, which had a commanding lead in
the polls after half the 30 states' results had been announced earlier this
week.
The Campaign for Democracy echoed the sense of injustice felt by many
Nigerians at the legal wrangle which has disrupted the presidential polls.
'What upsets us about this court order is that it comes from a justice
minister who gave the NEC complete discretion to carry out the polls,' said
Dr Beko Ransome Kuti.
The electoral commission is directly responsible to President Babangida for
the successful outcome of Nigeria's presidential poll. The rival National
Republican Convention has also condemned the commission decision even though
it looks set to lose if the result is announced.
There were reports that the military government had tightened security
across the country. In the mainly Moslem northern city of Kano, state radio
said police banned unauthorised public gatherings and processions 'to avoid
a breach of the peace'.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asked Congress to authorise continued
funding for the space station and the supercollider, the two most expensive
and politically controversial projects on the US high technology agenda.
Mr Clinton selected an amalgam of two preferred options put forward by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the space station,
intended to conduct research into zero-gravity conditions.
The recommended version, endorsing plans for a modular station already on
the drawing board and entailing expenditure of Dollars 10.5bn over the next
five years, would save Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn by the planned launch date of
2000-2001.
Mr Clinton is calling for greater financial contributions from other nations
expected to share in the station's research. Some feared it might be
abandoned altogether.
The supercollider (a giant particle accelerator on a 50-mile track) is under
construction at a cost of around Dollars 10bn. Mr Clinton said yesterday to
abandon it 'would signal the US is compromising its position of leadership
in basic science - a position unquestioned for generations'.

US business confidence dropped 20 per cent between April and June to its
lowest level since the recession of 1990-91, the US Chamber of Commerce said
yesterday. It attributed the decline to growing economic pessimism caused
mainly by the prospect of higher taxes to pay for deficit reduction and
healthcare reform.
The index, which is based on a survey of 11,000 mostly small companies,
stands at 47.7 against a recent high of 62.4 shortly after Mr Clinton's

<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS of nationwide tampering with Diet Pepsi cans are unfounded, the
US Food and Drug Administration said yesterday following an investigation.
'We've been unable to confirm even one case of tampering among the dozens of
reports we have received,' Dr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, said in
Washington.
His remarks followed days of confusion, during which dozens of people said
they had found objects - mainly hypodermic needles and syringes - in cans of
Diet Pepsi. The claims first surfaced in the Seattle-Tacoma area of
Washington state, but quickly spread to New Orleans, and then to other
regions.
The FDA said its investigation into the numerous consumer complaints
indicated that the suspect cans had come from disparate Diet Pepsi bottling
plants, with production dates months apart.
'It is simply not logical to conclude that a nationwide tampering has
occurred,' said Dr Kessler. He added that 'a number of people' who had made
complaints were now withdrawing them.
PepsiCo shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher, at Dollars 37 7/8 yesterday.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Trade deficit spurs US growth call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday demanded more expansionary economic
policies in other industrialised countries following figures showing that
the US ran a trade deficit of more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) for the
second month running.
Mr Ron Brown, Commerce Secretary, said the unexpectedly large April deficit
reflected faster growth in the US than in Europe and Japan, which needed to
do more to promote domestic growth.
'Large trade surpluses among our trading partners are indications of
unfulfilled opportunities for economic growth, just as our own trade deficit
demonstrates we are helping to trigger global economic expansion,' he said.
The figures seem certain to exacerbate trade tensions between Washington and
Tokyo as more than half of the shortfall was in trade with Japan. The
Clinton administration is pressing Tokyo to open its markets more fully in
order to curb the growing bilateral deficit, which rose to Dollars 53bn in
the year to April.
The overall deficit of Dollars 10.5bn in April was much larger than analysts
had predicted and indicated a similar-sized deficit in March may not have
been an aberration as previously assumed. The poor figures may prompt
analysts to revise down growth estimates in the second quarter to an annual
rate of 2-2.5 per cent.
Exports fell 1.3 per cent between March and April to Dollars 38.4bn,
reflecting economic weakness in many of the US's main trading partners.
Imports fell 1 per cent to Dollars 48.9bn, but remained at a disturbingly
high level given the sluggish recent pace of economic growth in the US.
The longer-term trends are not enouraging. In the three months to April, US
imports rose 12.6 per cent relative to the same period last year. Exports
grew only 2.8 per cent over the same period.
The underlying monthly trade deficit could be as high as Dollars 9bn,
pointing to an annual deficit of more than Dollars 100bn, according to Mr
Geoffrey Dennis, a New York-based economist for James Capel, the
stockbroker.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Suddenly the president appears in charge again: Just when
everything seemed to be going wrong, Clinton can claim real victories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN a week after nothing had seemed to be going right President Bill
Clinton could yesterday claim no fewer than three substantial victories on
Capitol Hill.
None of the Wednesday evening triumphs - on the deficit reduction package,
campaign finance reform and the national service corps - is irrevocable,
complete or fully in line with his original proposals. But taken together
with the widely applauded nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the
Supreme Court, a new sense of a president in charge has suddenly pervaded
Washington with its tendency to pass instant judgments.
Clearly inspired by Mr David Gergen, his new counsellor and former aide to
President Ronald Reagan, Mr Clinton sought to capitalise on the momentum
with another press conference last night. Counting an aborted one on Monday,
this was the third this week, complemented by a series of interviews granted
to the heavyweight press, all emphasising, as the president had vigorously
on Tuesday, the substantive accomplishments claimed during his five months
in office.
Simultaneously, the powerful media have been engaging in a mini-orgy of
introspection, asking in print and on the air whether it was too hard on the
president too soon. Typical was a long New York Times analysis yesterday
headlined: 'The Capitol Press vs the President: Fair Coverage or Unreined
Adversity?' Even the Wall Street Journal leader columns, normally
contemptuous, praised his approach to the North American free trade
agreement.
Of the events in Congress, the agreement by the 11 Democrats on the Senate
finance committee over the details of the deficit reduction package was the
most crucial.
Mr Clinton took the tactical view that getting this accord, long in doubt,
was more important than its component parts, so long as the numerical
deficit reduction goal, of about Dollars 500bn over five years calculated by
the administration, was similar to his own. Unlike the budgetary process in
the House of Representatives, where he lobbied hard and personally, he
allowed the senators to work it out for themselves.
Predictably they agreed to drop his broad British thermal unit-based energy
tax, already narrowly passed by the House in favour of a 4.3 cent a gallon
levy on petrol, diesel and most other forms of fuel used in transportation.
This will generate only Dollars 24bn in revenues over the next five years, a
third of that projected for the energy tax. The shortfall is made up by
cutting another Dollars 19bn from Medicare funding, beyond the Dollars 50bn
already sought by Mr Clinton, by trimming his tax breaks for the working
poor and small business, and by other micro-tax measures.
But the core of his revenue proposals, to generate more than Dollars 150bn
in higher taxes on the wealthy, remains in place, strengthened in part by a
2.8 per cent surcharge in the capital gains tax on those with an income of
more than Dollars 250,000 a year. However, the senators proposed that
pensioners could enjoy greater incomes before their social security benefits
were subject to a higher rate of tax.
The corporate tax rate rises to 35 per cent from 34 per cent, retroactive to
January 1, as in the House bill, while the top individual income tax rate
goes up to 39.6 per cent from 31 per cent, to take effect from July 1 rather
than January 1.
The full committee, 11 Democrats and nine Republicans, began debating the
bill yesterday with a view to presenting it to the Senate for a vote next
week. Assuming the Democrats, with a 56-44 edge, hold together and it
passes, it then goes to a tricky conference committee of both chambers to
iron out differences, it is hoped, probably optimistically, before the Group
of Seven summit in Tokyo starting July 7.
The breaking of the Republican filibuster in the Senate on campaign finance
reform, and subsequent passage of the bill by 60-38, also came at a cost to
the original Clinton proposals - the ditching of most public financing for
elections - but the bill still includes a whole array of changes to
candidate fund-raising much in line with his blueprint.
As applied to Senate races (House rules are somewhat different) it would ban
contributions by political action committees (PACs) representing particular
interests, prevent lobbyists from contributing to those whom they lobby, for
or against, and stop the flow of political 'soft money' whereby funds are
directed to parties rather than individuals so as to avoid ceilings on
donations.
The national service corps plan, very close to Mr Clinton's heart, was
endorsed by relevant committees in both House and Senate. Though smaller in
scope than intended, it is designed to re-ignite volunteerism at home and to
reward college graduates who undertake social service jobs by cutting
Dollars 5,000 a year off their education loan indebtedness.
Completing the day for the president, the House easily voted down a
Republican attempt to weaken US financial assistance to Russia. Also the Air
Force planned disciplinary action against a general who had spoken
disparagingly of his commander-in-chief.
There are rocks enough ahead for Mr Clinton not to be able to breathe
easily. But with the Democratic leadership in both houses at last asserting
itself, his prospects look a lot better than they did a week ago.
It may be excessive to talk about a turning point in his presidency but it
is at least suddenly a legitimate talking point.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's licensing and surveillance system for imported
apples was challenged by Chile yesterday in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Chile told Gatt's governing council that countervailing duties imposed on
its apple exports to the Community were contrary to Gatt rules and could
cost its producers Dollars 14m in lost sales, spelling ruin for many. The
two sides are now in consultations over the dispute which may be brought
formally to Gatt if no agreed settlement is reached.
EC restrictions on imported apples have been a frequent source of trade
friction in recent years. Chile and the US both brought and won Gatt cases
against apple import quotas imposed in 1988.
Under the current EC system, import surcharges are automatically levied when
reference prices of apple imports fall below a certain level.
Despite surcharges, Chile's apple exports had not fallen last year, the EC
said, which suggested the duties were not harming trade. Chile was, however,
supported by other countries with similar grievances against the EC,
including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico.

PROSPECTS are good for joint ventures and other trade and investment deals
between British companies and Cuba, Baroness Young, a former UK government
minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Havana.
She is heading a British business delegation to the island.
'We've had very positive meetings with ministers here. . . . and the very
clear message that has come to us is that Cuba would like to make some joint
ventures and joint arrangements,' she said.
A dozen British business executives in the delegation, sponsored by
Britain's Caribbean Trade Advisory Group, held three days of talks with
Cuban officials about investment possibilities in tourism, the oil sector,
agriculture, mining and the pharmaceuticals industry. The group advises the
British Overseas Trade Board.
Lade Young, who had a two-hour meeting with President Fidel Castro on
Tuesday, said she had invited the Cuban government to send a delegation to
Britain to discuss details of possible joint investment projects identified
in Cuba.
Her delegation was the biggest officially-backed British business mission to
visit Cuba to date.

THE foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market declined slightly in
the first quarter to 19.6 per cent, down from an all-time high of 20.2 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, according to data released yesterday by
the US and Japanese governments.
Foreign market share is the primary measure used by the US to determine
Japan's compliance with a 1991 bilateral trade agreement in which Japan
'recognised the expectations' of the US semiconductor industry that foreign
market share should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992.
US government and semiconductor industry officials said that they would
continue to press Japan for improvements in market access, using market
share as the 'measureable indicator' of progress.
Despite the decline in market share, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, welcomed the first quarter figure as a demonstration that
the fourth quarter 1992 jump in market share from 15.9 per cent to 20.2 per
cent 'was not just a one quarter aberration.'
Mr Kantor repeated his view that 'it is reasonable to expect that foreign
market share will average 20 per cent over the next four quarters of 1993,
at a minimum'.
US semiconductor industry officials expressed some disappointment, however,
in the first quarter market share drop. 'Any decline in foreign market share
is cause for concern,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the
Semiconductor Industry Association, a US industry trade group.
'It is clear that there is still considerable work to be done by government
and industry to achieve the steady progress required by the semiconductor
agreement,' Mr Procassini added.
In Tokyo, however, the Electronics Industry Association of Japan, rejected
the US view of market share goals.
'We will keep working to fulfil the purpose (of the semiconductor
agreement),' said Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of
Toshiba and vice chairman of the EIAJ's committee of users of foreign
semiconductors.
But he said the EIAJ 'could not accept' the US demand for an average 20 per
cent foreign market share throughout 1993. 'Fluctuations in foreign market
share figures should not sway sentiments toward satisfaction or
disappointment,' said Mr Yoshida.
He noted that market share data was influenced by a variety of factors,
including economic conditions in Japan, exchange rates and the supply
capabilities of foreign semiconductor manufacturers.

Urgent action was needed for eastern and western Europe to co-operate in
capacity cuts and ensure that steel trade is conducted at fair prices
according to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation.
He suggested that the bill for social subsidies to eastern Europe need not
be steep: Ecu100m (Pounds 78.60m) would pay for a year's wages for 40,000
redundant steelworkers in countries such as Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, providing time for job-creation and retraining measures.
Mr Vondran, who was speaking at the Aachen technical university, warned that
restructuring plans in eastern Europe were being drawn up in a haphazard
way, although the eastern governments realised the need for large-scale
capacity cuts.
With a workforce of some 350,000, the east European industry was working at
barely 50 per cent of its former 56m tonnes capacity.
In western Europe, the steel industry was facing capacity cuts of 30m tonnes
of raw steel capacity, putting up to 100,000 people out of work. The German
industry alone had decided to cut 8.5m tonnes of raw steel capacity, and 4m
tonnes of hot rolling capacity, since the beginning of last year. At least
30,000 jobs would be lost, he said.
'The eastern European steel producers are trying to save themselves through
exports,' Mr Vondran said. 'But EC acceptance of them has limits.'
East Europeans had drawn up 'sweeping adjustment plans' but implementation
was held up by lack of the 'social mechanisms' to handle mass redundancies.
'It is in the interests of the European Community and its eastern European
neighbours to conduct cross-border talks on putting into effect capacity
adjustments. The EC could offer to take on part of the social costs arising
from the necessary cut-back in production potential,' he said.
The extent and timing of capacity cuts would be determined in the
negotiations and, at the same time, the east Europeans would be expected to
introduce western environmental protection standards and trade strictly
according to Gatt rules.
It should then be possible for the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and other west European financial institutions to provide loans
for the remaining east European steel mills, to improve product quality and
efficiency.

FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Veil of secrecy on US-EC trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US and European Community trade negotiators kept a veil of secrecy around
their meeting yesterday at an unknown London location, with officials
revealing only that they 'compared notes and positions' on a market access
deal to be presented next week at a trade ministers' summit in Tokyo.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC chief negotiator, is understood to have told Mr
Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, that the controversial bilateral
US-German peace accord on the EC-US dispute on telecommunications trade 'had
complicated matters'.
Hopes have been raised that Japan, the EC and the US might provide momentum
towards a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation by agreeing a three-way tariff cutting deal across a range of
manufacturing and services sectors.
At the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris just two weeks ago, Mr Kantor
predicted that 'we are at last within striking distance of the largest
market access package in history'. The mood yesterday was more cautious.
The deal is due to be thrashed out in Tokyo next week when trade ministers
from Japan, the US, the EC and Canada meet.
A limited number of issues now block settlement: Japan is refusing to bow to
pressure to cut to zero its tariffs on imports of spirits, and wood and wood
products. The EC in turn is baulking at similar tariff cuts for electronics
products, agricultural machinery, and non-ferrous metals.
The US is refusing to cut tariff peaks on ceramics, glass, and on textile
imports.

<TEXT>
FRANCE is pressing Bonn to reconsider its apparent decision to opt out of EC
telecommunications sanctions against the US, before next week's EC summit at
Copenhagen.
The Community and the US are at odds over a provision in the EC's public
procurement directive giving European companies a 3 per cent price advantage
when bidding for government contracts.
In protest at the price preference in the telecommunications field,
Washington has denied EC companies the right to compete for a certain amount
of its contracts. As a result, Community ministers agreed earlier this month
to deny US companies a similar amount of business.
However, Germany insists that its 1954 accord with the US takes precedence
over EC solidarity on this issue. This view was repeated yesterday by Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, in a letter to Sir Leon Brittan,
the European commissioner responsible for external trade. He said the EC
decision on sanctions contained a specific reserve clause protecting such
prior obligations.
He repeated his determination neither to discriminate against US enterprises
in public procurement contracts, nor to impose counter-sanctions.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EC affairs minister, yesterday described the
German attitude as 'serious'. Germany had agreed to the procurement
directive and anti-US sanctions, he complained, and 'there can be no
European identity unless decisions taken together are applied together'.
'Either a member state (Germany) has not respected its commitment,' Mr
Lamassoure said, 'or the state of EC law is such that it allows a member
state to wriggle out of a unanimous decision - in either case, it is not
good.'
Paris is pressing Bonn directly, as well as through Brussels, in the hope of
defusing the issue. Mr Lamassoure pinned hopes on the fact that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has not yet publicly backed his economics minister on the
matter, and may not be pushed to do so before the Copenhagen summit where
the German leader is certain to be lobbied by President Francois Mitterrand.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE devaluation of the punt in January caused by last autumn's currency
crisis has restored the competitive position of Irish exports and helped
re-establish the basis for economic expansion, the OECD says in its annual
report on Ireland published today.
The underlying rate of inflation should therefore re-stabilise at about 3
per cent, while real incomes and personal consumption should continue
growing at about the same rate, it says.
The OECD warns, however, that a renewed divergence in monetary conditions in
the UK and Germany, with the former's rates falling and the latter's
remaining firm, could put renewed pressure on Irish interest rates and the
punt.
'(Ireland's) link to the D-Mark may imply that Ireland could continue to
experience monetary conditions tighter than required by domestic needs,' the
report says.
The credibility of this link and the government's macroeconomic strategy of
convergence under the Maastricht criteria will depend upon Dublin's
commitment and adherence to the target of keeping the exchequer borrowing
requirement under 3 per cent of gross domestic product and making further
progress in reducing the debt/GDP ratio.
The report forecasts a deterioration in the employment rate by almost 3
percentage points during this year and next, and says that, although the
growth rate in manufacturing 'has generally tracked that of the OECD at
large, the increase in employment in private services has been much slower'.
Tax incentives to attract high-technology industries to Ireland have
distorted the tax structure, it says, placing a higher burden on labour.
This should be eased by a reduction of a tax bias in favour of property
investment.
The report calls for greater emphasis to be placed on vocational training.
Restrictive practices 'associated with barriers to entry and other trading
restraints' in telecommunications, transport, financial services and the
professions are also 'imposing a deadweight on the rest of the economy'.

A LOOMING air services war between Australia and the US was averted
yesterday when both sides agreed to lift sanctions against each other's
airlines - Northwest Airlines and Qantas. The ceasefire will hold while the
two governments renegotiate the terms governing the airlines' services,
particularly Northwest's lucrative Japan-Australia-US flights.
The Australian government has banned one of Northwest's three weekly flights
from New York to Sydney via Osaka. It claimed the American airline had
contravened an agreement that it would not offload or take in half of its
passengers in Sydney. Northwest has claimed that the so-called 50 per cent
rule was an 'informal' agreement. In retaliation, the US ordered
cancellation of Qantas's three non-stop Sydney-Los Angeles flights.
Senator Bob Collins, Australia's transport minister, said the agreement
allowed Northwest to resume its Sydney services as long as it observed the
50 per cent rule. He said the US government had also agreed to withdraw its
banning order on Qantas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOM, the western watchdog on sensitive exports to Communist countries,
stands to become the latest casualty of the cold war under plans for it to
police non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from both west and
east.
While President Boris Yeltsin continues to complain about Cocom restrictions
on exports of advanced technology to Russia, the Paris-based Co-ordinating
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls has been holding quiet
consultations on a new form of co-operation with former Soviet bloc
countries.
Western diplomats said the two sides had agreed a procedure for gradually
lifting remaining restrictions on former Soviet republics as they implement
their own effective export controls modelled on the Cocom system. The idea
is to prevent western and Soviet technology alike falling into the third
world hands.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, the main successor
republic and the biggest producer and owner of nuclear weapons, found itself
without proper borders between itself and the other newly independent
republics. This made it vulnerable to the dangers of illegal exports of its
own sensitive technology.
Its lack of controls has also stoked fears of potential trading partners
that their technology could easily be passed on to third countries.
The transformation is likely to pick up steam once Russia submits a
long-delayed letter committing itself to a new export control system. The
advantages for Russia are three-fold: it will be able to buy freely western
sophisticated technology with potential military applications; it will be in
a stronger position to export its own military technology; and it will learn
from western countries experience in what one diplomat described
'controlling exports without stifling companies'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian parliament, in an effort to appease striking miners, yesterday
voted to hold a referendum of confidence in both the president and
parliament.
The agreement came a day after President Leonid Kravchuk unilaterally
assumed personal control over the government in an effort to stem Ukraine's
spiralling social and economic crisis.
The presidential decree, issued late on Wednesday night, also appointed the
reformist prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, to head an 'emergency committee'
to run the economy. Mr Kuchma's appointment suggests that he and Mr Kravchuk
may have reached a political compromise after being locked in a bitter power
struggle for the past month.
The ex-communist dominated parliament has rejected the additional powers and
some MPs said they would challenge the president's decree in today's
scheduled parliamentary session.
'This is against the constitution,' said Mr Stepan Khmara, a radical
nationalist MP from western Ukraine. 'Parliament will do its best to
overthrow it.'
Another MP, from the east of the country, compared Mr Kravchuk's decree to
the failed communist coup in Russia in August, 1991.
Meanwhile, the referendum, to be held on September 26, will ask voters if
they have confidence in the president and parliament. Early parliamentary or
presidential elections are likely to be called in the event of a no vote.
Both Mr Kravchuk and the parliament are widely unpopular. However, the
president, perhaps hoping for a re-run of his Russian counterpart's victory
in the April referendum, supported the call by the striking miners for a
nationwide ballot. Parliament has gone along with the idea more in the hope
that agreement would end industrial action led by the miners in the east of
the country which is further damaging Ukraine's already ailing economy.
The miners, whose main goal has been to force parliament to hold a
referendum, have not yet called off their action.
The strike, concentrated in the largely Russian-speaking and potentially
separatist regions, is being viewed in Kiev as the most serious threat to
Ukraine since the Slav state became independent less than two years ago.
The conservative parliament lived up to its reputation yesterday when it
approved an additional 2 trillion (million million) coupons of credits, to
be issued to subsidise meat and milk prices. The move, a concession to
Ukraine's powerful agricultural lobby, is likely to further stimulate
inflation, with prices rising by more than 30 per cent a month.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Attali proposes shake-up at EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, is proposing to create three new senior posts at the bank and
radically change the functions of a fourth, in a far-reaching management
reorganisation.
His most radical proposal, contained in a paper submitted to the bank's
board earlier this week, is that the development and merchant banking
departments should be merged and then split into three 'operations
departments', covering north central Europe, south central Europe and the
former Soviet Union. It would be supported by an operations services group
which would deal with co-operation funds and technical co-operation,
co-financing, loan syndication, education and training and the environmental
appraisal group.
Each operations department would report to a new senior vice-president, who
would also have the title of chief operating officer. On Monday Mr Attali
told the 23 directors representing the 54 countries and agencies which own
the bank that Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's number two, had 'agreed in
principle' to be chief operating officer.
At present the EBRD's merchant banking arm concentrates on financing private
sector projects, while the development banking department deals with
improving the infrastructure of central and eastern Europe. However, a
review recently commissioned by Mr Attali complained that there was overlap
between the two departments and that too little attention is paid to the
needs of each country in EBRD assessments of projects.
Mr Attali also wants to create a second senior vice-presidency in charge of
the budget process, personnel and administration. This would probably be
filled by Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president in charge of development
banking. The vice-president in charge of finance, Mr Anders Ljungh, would
thus lose responsibility for the budget and policy planning activities but
retain the treasury, credit and financial control functions.
Mr Attali also wants to create a new vice-presidency for external and
economic relations in an attempt to 'improve the bank's image and create a
favourable and supportive climate of political and public opinion'.
Mr Stern was asked whether he would become EBRD chief operating officer by
the senior finance officials from the G7 leading industrial countries.
The directors representing the European members of the G7, France, Germany
and the UK, argued on Monday that the reorganisation should be pushed
through as quickly as possible. However, most other directors resent what
they see as the G7's high-handed intervention. They believe any decision
should be delayed until after July 15, when the bank's audit committee
reports to the board of directors on charges that the bank failed to control
expenditure on furnishing its London headquarters, the use of private
aircraft and other items.
Many directors are also concerned, in the words of one, that the EBRD will
'evolve into the European arm of the World Bank'.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VACANCIES at the top of the Bundesbank are to be filled by candidates who
are expected to maintain the bank's hardline policies but also to improve
relations between Bonn and the Frankfurt monetary authorities.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a close associate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is to
take over as vice-president on October 1 when Mr Hans Tietmeyer moves up to
replace the retiring president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger.
At the same time, Mr Edgar Meister, currently finance minister in the
Rhineland-Palatinate state government, will join the bank's permanent
directorate. Mr Meister, 53, a moderate member of the Social Democrat party
(SPD), is known to get on well with Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance
minister.
His appointment follows the selection earlier this week of his boss, Mr
Rudolf Scharping, the Rhineland-Palatinate's prime minister, as candidate
for the vacant national chairmanship of the SPD. Mr Scharping is the logical
choice to stand against Mr Kohl for the chancellor's job in next year's
federal elections.
As one observer noted yesterday, the directorate has the characteristics of
a 'grand coalition' - seen by some as the most likely outcome of the
elections.
Mr Gaddum, who is 63 today, also served as finance minister in the
Rhineland-Palatinate in the 1970s when the state was controlled by the
Christian Democrats and Mr Kohl was the state's prime minister.
The appointments, to be rubber-stamped by the cabinet, ensure a
friction-free transition in the country's most important non-governmental
institution, and a continuation of the Bundesbank's conservative monetary
policy aimed at the defeat of inflation and the preservation of stability.
Mr Tietmeyer, long acknowledged as Mr Schlesinger's heir, and another Kohl
confidant, is a well-established, authoritative international figure, and a
stout proponent of monetary rigour. His official term in office will run
until 1999, when he reaches the age of 68.
As the directorate member most directly involved with the transformation of
the former east German monetary system, Mr Gaddum is especially
knowledgeable about the unification difficulties which have complicated the
Bundesbank's job in the past three years.
The Bundesbank said yesterday it had left its key discount and Lombard
lending rates unchanged after a meeting of its policy-making council, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt. The German discount rate remains at 7.25 per cent
and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 8.5 per cent.

FT  18 JUN 93 / 'Reality' buries Vance-Owen plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, one of the two international mediators for a peace settlement in
Bosnia, yesterday pronounced the official funeral oration over the plan
which he had co-authored with Mr Cyrus Vance and conceded that negotiations
would now take place on the basis of a new plan to be put forward jointly by
Serbia and Croatia.
Referring to the latest proposals for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina
into three ethnically based mini-states representing the Serb, Moslem and
Croat communities, linked to each other by a loose confederal constitution,
Lord Owen said it would be 'quite dishonest' to try to sell this as the
Vance-Owen plan.
'But time in Bosnia-Hercegovina doesn't just move on, it deteriorates,' Lord
Owen said at an emotional joint news conference with his fellow mediator Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg. 'You have seen the provisional provincial map (an
integral part of the Vance-Owen plan) torn up in front of your very eyes by
all three parties in the last few months.'
Given this deterioration in the situation on the ground, there was no point
in going back to the past. Though Lord Owen did not pretend that the new
plan would provide as equitable a solution, he made no apology for
contemplating other ways of getting a peace settlement.
'I think there is a tiredness of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and I think
most people believe we have got to bring it to an end with as much honour as
possible. There won't be a lot of honour and there won't be anywhere near
the sort of settlement that we would ideally have liked.'
Both Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg urged the Moslems to look seriously at the
new plan, which would give them a central Bosnian region between Sarajevo,
Zenica and Tuzla and a separate area in the north-west of the country called
Bihac. It would also give the Moslems access to a free port on the Adriatic,
Ploce.
The mediators denied reports that President Alija Izetbegovic had walked out
in anger from his meeting with Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in a villa near Geneva on Wednesday, at which the
new plan was discussed. Mr Stoltenberg said Mr Izetbegovic had listened
calmly to all that had been said and had undertaken to consult the other
members of the mixed Bosnian presidency before making a final decision on
the new Serbian-Croat proposals, which are due to be presented in detail in
Geneva next Wednesday. Though Lord Owen conceded that he had failed in his
mission of gaining acceptance for his plan, he did not despair of saving
some of its essential elements.
These included the demilitarisation of the country, which all the parties
claim they accept, the monitoring of human rights and the organisation of
free elections. 'I have not given up on getting the maximum degree of
pluralistic democracy established in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' he said.
The US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday opened the door
to Washington's acceptance of the partition of Bosnia, Reuter reports from
Washington. Although he said the US continued to support UN resolutions
endorsing Bosnia's territorial integrity he stressed that was 'our current
position'. He noted that with new negotiations under way, 'it's a dynamic
situation'.

MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said yesterday that United
Nations peacekeeping abilities were hampered by governments failing to
supply enough troops, or not paying their share of the costs on time, Reuter
reports from London.
Mr Hurd, in a speech at a diplomatic banquet in Britain, said the shifting
post-Cold War world had put a heavy burden on the United Nations and
generated increasing calls for it to play a more decisive part in quelling
conflicts.
'It is no use countries arguing for the UN to take an active,
interventionist role and then not putting forward the skilled manpower and
hardware to implement it,' he said.
The UN itself should strengthen its command structure by creating a general
staff of ''highly professional military and civilian experts' to deal with
crises, he said.
'Britain pays her bills on time. So do most of our EC partners, the Nordics
and the countries with a long tradition of peacekeeping such as Australia
and Canada. But some others, who share the heavy burden of international
responsibility, do not,' he said. For operations in Somalia, the former
Yugoslavia and Cambodia, the US owed Dollars 234m, (Pounds 156m), the

FT  18 JUN 93 / Europe's health costs set to soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S health care costs will outstrip both inflation and economic growth
over the next five years, according to a study published today.
The growing demand for health care will lead to a fundamental restructuring
of its provision, according to the survey which questioned more than 2,700
health experts in 10 European countries.
The study concludes that public sector health spending will decline as a
proportion of total health expenditure in all 10 countries. Private
insurance, company schemes and household spending is expected to increase.
European governments will need to balance what taxpayers can afford with
constant political pressure to provide every citizen with ever-better access
to higher quality care.
Most will react by increasingly guaranteeing universal access to only a
specified minimum level of care. This will mean patients will be obliged to
contribute more for treatment and medicines.
Simultaneously, governments will implement a range of cost containment
strategies. These will include increased use of generic drugs and limited
lists of reimbursed medicines, combined with increased contributions from
patients for their treatments. Doctors will increasingly be forced to make
decisions on the basis of cost.
Patients will be moved away from expensive large hospitals to outpatient
care, local treatment centres, and their own homes.

dividing up the fleet until 1995, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. 'The
two sides from September 1993 will begin the practical formation of a
Russian navy and a Ukrainian navy,' said a statement after a summit outside
Moscow. The fleet will be split on a '50-50' basis. As a sweetener, Russia
agreed to help maintain the port of Sevastopol.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Fresh wave of job cuts in Germany
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED wave of job cuts is gaining momentum in west German industry, with
automotive companies once again bearing the brunt. Volkswagen workers heard
yesterday that further job losses were unavoidable in addition to the 12,500
already planned for this year and next in the German parent company.
Mr Daniel Goeudevert, group deputy chairman, told a factory meeting in
Wolfsburg that deliveries in Germany to the end of May were 22 per cent
lower than in the same period last year. Global deliveries were down 12 per
cent, he added.
He gave no clues as to the number of jobs to go, but the stresses within the
group were highlighted on Wednesday when Audi, its luxury car division,
announced a 25 per cent production cut next month, and complained
specifically about a drop in orders from Japan.
Some 25,000 employees are to be sent home for five days in July, following
eight days' short-time this month.
Meanwhile, Audi is continuing with plans announced early this year to shed
4,000 workers by the end of December.
Iveco Magirus, the bus and truck business belonging to Italy's Fiat group,
yesterday announced 'limited' further payroll reductions after a 2 per cent
cut last year. Production had fallen 27 per cent in the first five months of
1993, Mr Wolfgang Keller, the chairman, told the annual meeting.
Phoenix, a leading manufacturer of plastic and rubber vehicles components,
forecast a 23 per cent drop in sales this year. After cutting 15 per cent of
its workforce in the past 12 months, it was now looking for further
economies, Mr Ludwig Horatz, its chairman, said in Hamburg.
In another development, Philips Kommunikations Industrie, a subsidiary of
the Dutch group incorporating the Grundig electronics business, said 1,500
jobs were to go by the end of the year.
On Wednesday, the steel division of Thyssen said 9,000 jobs would have to go
by the end of next year, instead of the 6,000 previously announced.
Even though economists suggest that the economy should start to recover next
year after reaching the bottom of the cycle this summer, unemployment is
expected to continue increasing.
From 3.25m at the last count, total German unemployment is expected to climb
to between 4m and 5m next year, according to senior Bonn officials. At
2.15m, the unadjusted jobless total in the west last month was 26 per cent
higher than a year earlier.

<TEXT>
UN military observers yesterday confirmed the utter devastation of Gorazde,
the Moslem enclave in south-eastern Bosnia, after Serb forces finally
allowed them to reach the region designated a 'safe area' by the
international community.
The team of eight monitors described a scene of 'considerable destruction'
in Gorazde, which has been under a Serb siege for 13 months and the target
of an intense three-week offensive. Artillery attacks ceased 10 minutes
after the monitors crossed Serb lines on Wednesday night, ending what was
described as the heaviest day of shelling.
The monitors described as 'chaotic' conditions in the local hospital, where
a ratio of one doctor to 10,000 people seems to make the humanitarian
situation even more appalling. Some 2,000 people have been treated for
injuries which may require amputation, according to a Bosnian radio report.
Local officials told the monitors that 92 people had been killed in
Wednesday's assault. About 100 critically wounded people require urgent
medical evacuation. Despite several air drops of emergency relief, the
70,000 people trapped in Gorazde are suffering a chronic shortages of food
and medical supplies.
Gorazde's population has more than doubled as about 38,000 refugees have
sought sanctuary from 'ethnic cleansing' in eastern Bosnia, where Moslems
were once a majority. In Belgrade, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
said said hundreds of thousands of refugees may never be able to return to
their homes if the latest Geneva agreement is carried out.
'We are concerned that the plan will create units too small to be viable for
the Moslems,' said Ms Judith Kumin, UNHCR spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S much-vaunted waste recycling system is collapsing under the weight
of its own success, collecting four times more plastic garbage than it can
recycle, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by German companies to collect and
recycle household waste, said it urgently needed DM500m (Pounds 201m) just
to keep going this year. Mr Wolfram Bruck, the company chairman, warned
yesterday that DSD could not ensure the recycling of the garbage it was
collecting and called for a complete rethink of the system.
Rhineland-Palatinate withdrew from the scheme this week, complaining that it
was 'collapsing under 8,000 tonnes of plastic garbage with nowhere to put
it'.
DSD was set up by industry two years ago after the introduction of an
environmental law which forces manufacturers to take back and recycle
packaging products.
While DSD has been successful in dealing with paper, glass and aluminium,
for which facilities already exist, it is failing to find adequate outlets
for plastics, which is costly and difficult to process.

MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is on extended

attend next Monday's EC summit in Copenhagen.
Mr Delors cancelled a pre-summit news conference scheduled for today in
Brussels, his fourth day off work. But aides quashed rumours that he might

Mr Bruno de Thomas, his chief spokesman, said he could not imagine Mr Delors
missing the summit: 'The president continues to work at home.'
Mr Delors' views on why the EC has failed to create jobs at the same rate as
the US and Asia is expected to be one of the highlights of the summit.
Diplomats are watching to see if Mr Delors is ready to countenance some
reduction in Europe's generous social provisions in order to improve
European competitiveness.
Aides said this week that Mr Delors would take an honest approach, offering
analysis rather than prescriptions.
'He will not ask whether the EC can continue to afford the welfare state,
rather how we can maintain it under the present conditions of low economic
growth,' said one Commission official.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Hopes rise for steady recovery: Unemployment falls for
fourth month and inflation stays at 1.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PETER MARSH and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER surprise drop in unemployment and subdued price pressures in May
yesterday raised hopes that Britain might be on the way to achieving a
sustained, non-inflationary economic recovery.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 26,100 to 2.914m between April and
May, confounding City expectations of a rise and cheering Tory backbenchers
in the Commons. The fourth monthly fall in unemployment cut the seasonally
adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent last month from 10.5 per cent in
April and its winter peak of 10.6 per cent.
The unadjusted total of unemployed people claiming benefit recorded its
biggest monthly decline since October 1988. It dropped last month by 84,000
to 2.917m, well below the politically important 3m level.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he was 'delighted at the fall' and
that unemployment had 'fallen in Scotland, fallen in Wales and fallen in
every single English region'.
The government received other good economic news yesterday, which helped
dispel fears that the recovery might be faltering. UK car production jumped
by 23.8 per cent in May to reach the highest total for the month for 16
years. While commercial vehicle production has remained weak, car output has
risen by 9.1 per cent to 608,169 in the first five months of the year in
contrast to the steep fall in continental Europe.
The year-on-year increase in the retail prices index last month was 1.3 per
cent, the same as in April and the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964.
The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, the government's chosen
measure of underlying inflation, rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May after
a 2.9 per cent rise in April. Retail price inflation excluding food fell to
a 33-year low last month.
Yesterday's figures pushed up prices of government gilt edged securities and
boosted sterling, which closed 1.5 pfennigs higher in London at DM2.51 and
up 1.15 cents at Dollars 1.5155. The pound firmed in New York to DM2.51735,
but was little changed at Dollars 1.515.
Equities in the UK slipped back, however, as investors took the view that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was now less likely to cut interest rates.
The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,875.7, down 7.3 points.
The employment department reacted with caution, saying only that
unemployment had flattened out. However, Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist of
James Capel, the London stockbroker, said the jobless and inflation figures
were 'an indication of the recovery being relatively well sustained and
robust'.
Other labour market indicators were positive. The number of people leaving
the claimant count totalled 385,800 last month, some 38,200 more than in May
1992. Unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres reached their highest level for two
years.
Average earnings, up 4 per cent in the year to April, recorded their lowest
annual increase for 25 years. Manufacturing output per head rose 8 per cent
in the year to April. Unit wage costs in manufacturing fell by 2.6 per cent
in the year to April.
However, manufacturing employment fell by 13,000 in the month to April,
reversing first quarter growth and reviving fears that jobs in manufacturing
will resume their long-term downward trend. The workforce in employment fell
by 17,000 in the first quarter, the smallest decline for 2 1/2 years and
well below the record 397,000 drop in the third quarter of last year.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Nadir says tapes of ministers 'prove' conspiracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, DAVID OWEN AND ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KYRENIA, NORTHERN CYPRUS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, yesterday made his most
extraordinary assertion since jumping bail by claiming that he has tapes of
government ministers and officials which 'prove' there was a conspiracy to
bring down his former company, Polly Peck International.
The latest allegation in his war of words with the British authorities came
as Lord McAlpine, former treasurer of the Conservative party, said he had
made a misjudgment in accepting donations to the party from Mr Nadir.
Separately, accountants acting on behalf of the creditors of Mr Nadir and
his companies said they were considering action to recover the donations
made by companies associated with Mr Nadir, which amounted to Pounds 440,000
in the five years to 1990.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Nadir refused to reveal the
names of ministers he says are on the tapes or how he came by the alleged
recordings. He also declined to say if the ministers were recorded in
conversation with him or with another party.
Downing Street said last night it was not aware of Mr Nadir's claims to be
in possession of tape recordings of cabinet ministers.
Lord McAlpine, speaking to ITN, said: 'I was wrong in the matter of Mr
Nadir. There's no two ways about it. I misjudged. The truth of the matter
about Mr Nadir is I didn't make a judgment at all. It was done at third
hand.'
Lord McAlpine recalled two meetings with Mr Nadir. He had lunch with him
around the end of 1988, although he has been 'unable to locate' the exact
date, and he was invited to Mr Nadir's office in September 1991.
It was possible he could have met him incidentally at other social
gatherings. As a prominent donor to charities at the time, Mr Nadir would
have attended many charity functions.
Earlier in the day, Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus six weeks ago,
claimed that Lord McAlpine would be made to 'eat his words', referring to
recent statements by Lord McAlpine that he had had little contact with Mr
Nadir. 'Our links were a lot more than that,' Mr Nadir said.
Asked for detail about the alleged tapes, Mr Nadir seemed irritable and
said: 'Would I dare to mention a tape which was not backed up by verifiable
proof? This is not some mishmash.'
Mr Nadir said that the tapes of a number of cabinet ministers would make
'Watergate look like a minor bugging offence'.
He said he had a recording of one minister saying: 'We know there is a
conspiracy by the intelligence services but there is nothing we can do.'
Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, Mr Nadir's trustee in
bankruptcy, said he had written to the Conservative party this week asking
for details of the payments with a view to possible repayment.
The administrators to PPI may have an even stronger claim on behalf of
creditors on the money, which was written on cheques from companies in the
group.
The Conservative party maintained its stance that it would return the money
if it was proved to have been stolen. It said the Polly Peck companies had
also made a large number of donations to charities and they had not
indicated they would pay the money back.
It also emerged last night that the Conservative party had drawn up a scheme
to enable companies to give financial help to the party without declaring it
in their accounts.
The party said the scheme, which had been withdrawn 11 days after it was
first circulated, was only seen by a handful of party officials. No company
had followed the advice set out in the memorandum, the party said.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Cabinet agrees tough limits on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET yesterday set the toughest limits for at least 15 years on
public expenditure in an attempt to curb Britain's public borrowing,
presaging a summer of attrition between ministers over tax and spending
policies.
As the cabinet agreed spending ceilings that should see public expenditure
falling as a share of national income over the next three financial years,
Mr John Major urged cabinet colleagues to 'sing from the same hymn sheet' on
tax policy and manifesto commitments.
His instruction was a scarcely-veiled rebuff to Mr John Redwood, Welsh
secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who have
clashed publicly over whether income tax increases should be on the
government's agenda.
The prime minister sought to minimise further damaging cabinet splits by
seeking collective agreement on 'new control totals' for the three financial
years from 1994-95 to 1996-97.
However, the deal disappointed some Conservative rightwingers looking for a
firm grip on spending rather than tax increases. Mr John Townend, chairman
of the Tory backbench finance committee, said low inflation meant spending
would remain broadly unchanged in real terms. But Mr Michael Portillo,
Treasury chief secretary, said 'difficult decisions' would be needed.
The totals foreshadow a further tight squeeze on public sector pay but
cabinet ministers have still to reach agreement on whether to extend the 1.5
per cent ceiling on pay rises for another year. Broader and more flexible
limits on the total pay bill for public sector workers could emerge as a
compromise option.
Other targets will include the budgets of the Welsh and Scottish offices,
regarded as the most interventionist in Whitehall. Several cabinet ministers
are lobbying hard for still fiercer controls on local authority spending and
on the Environment Department's housing budget. Prison building and overseas
aid budgets will also be under pressure.
However, Mr Major wants manifesto commitments honoured. In the Commons he
emphasised that National Health Service resources would increase.
Previous spending rounds where spending totals have been set for three years
in advance have seen figures for later years revised substantially upwards.
But after Mr Clarke's assesment of the economic and fiscal outlook, the
cabinet agreed no change in the new control totals of Pounds 253.6bn and
Pounds 263.3bn set last summer for 1994-5 and 1995-96.
Real growth in the new control total for 1996-97 will be restricted to 1 per
cent or below. The totals exclude cyclical spending on benefits and debt
interest.
A cabinet statement said the agreement was 'intended to keep real growth in
spending over the whole period within the underlying growth rate in the
economy. It will also make a contribution to reducing the fiscal deficit in
the medium term to accompany the increases in taxes announced in the last
Budget'.

FT  18 JUN 93 / Stock Exchange criticised over role in Astra collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK EXCHANGE and accountants Stoy Hayward were roundly criticised
yesterday for their role in events that led to the collapse of Astra
Holdings, the munitions company linked to the Iraqi supergun affair.
A report from the Department of Trade and Industry also showed that Astra's
short, but spectacular, publicly quoted existence began in 1986 in
controversial circumstances.
According to the report, directors of the then private Astra falsified
invoices to boost profits and meet a forecast that allowed it to make a
reverse takeover and become a public company.
Last September the DTI sent the Serious Fraud Office a dossier on the Astra
affair, but the SFO has said it 'did not justify' a criminal investigation.
Former directors of Astra, who were also criticised, tipped off the UK
intelligence services in September 1989 about a suspicious contract under
which their new Belgian subsidiary was supplying propellant to Iraq via
Jordan.
The 560-page report concentrates on the financial circumstances surrounding
the disastrous 1989 acquisition of PRB, a Belgian munitions company, and an
accompanying Pounds 36m rights issue.
It shows serious failures by the Stock Exchange and Paine Webber, Astra's
financial advisers, to ensure proper monitoring of circulars to shareholders
that accompanied the rights issue.
The Exchange allowed the circular to be issued without the normal letter
from Astra's advisers to verify that Astra had adequate working capital.
The Exchange said yesterday it regretted that that had happened. Management
in the new listings department had been changed 15 months ago.
Stoy Hayward, Astra's auditors, were also criticised for not being more
forthcoming with information about the company's parlous working capital
position in 1989 and for signing annual accounts in 1987 that did not
reflect a true and fair view.
Stoy Hayward denied the accusations.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (15): Carbonates and culture - The
Coca-Cola flag flies high in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYMBOLS marking the arrival of capitalism abound in Poland, but none is more
striking than the decision to locate the offices of Coca-Cola Company in the
Palace of Culture building.
Referred to by cynical Poles as the Power Tower or Stalin's Church, the 40
story building dominates the drab Warsaw skyline.
In the decades since Stalin ordered its construction the building came to
represent, through its granite and marble exterior, the power of the
communist central authority.
Now, while talk continues of tearing down this monument to Poland's
communist past, it has become a piece of prime city office space. Mr Ryszard
Wojtkowski, a senior manager for Coca-Cola in Poland, says that the decision
to locate the company in the building was taken for purely commercial
reasons.
Since coming to Poland in March 1991, the company has outgrown its two
floors of space in the building, highlighting the pace of growth the company
has achieved. Now it is moving out to one of the modern office blocks
springing up all over the city centre.
With investment commitments to Poland of over Dollars 200m, the country
ranks second to eastern Germany as the US groups's focus for investment in
eastern Europe.
Coca-Cola has made investments in 11 former Soviet bloc countries since
taking the decision, in the late 1980s, to exploit the area's potential.
Before making a direct investment, Coca-Cola maintained a token presence
through arrangements with state-controlled brewers to produce Coke from
imported concentrate.
Legacies of this arrangement remain. But a mixture of joint ventures,
partnerships with bottling companies and wholly-owned operations has enabled
the company to gain a large slice of the carbonated drinks market.
Per capita consumption of carbonated drinks in Poland is well below that in
in western Europe. It has traditionally been supplied by relatively small
local producers starved of capital and marketing skills. Coca-Cola and its
rival, PepsiCo, are both caught up in the throes of large-scale publicity
drives - and these are having visible results in all parts of the country.
The power of these campaigns is expected to drive many small regional groups
out of business as the two multinationals drive home their production and
marketing advantages.
Estimates vary widely, but Coca-Cola says that Coke and PepsiCo have about
50 per cent of the market and forecasts that this will rise to 70 per cent
by the end of the year.
Competition for market share between the two US companies has hotted up
during the past 12 months, with Coca-Cola apparently winning the fight.
Unlike its competitor, PepsiCo has sought to tie up deals with larger
regional brewers for Pepsi production and is complementing its Polish
operations with the introduction of a fast foods subsidiary, Pizza Hut.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's sales volume rose 274 per cent during 1992, from a
small start-up base.
Current output of 40m cases a year of the equivalent of 0.4 litre bottles is
forecast to rise to 100m within two years - equal to sales in eastern
Germany last year. (This forecast is based on establishing nine plants in
the main population centres by the end of 1993.)
The company's joint venture partners in Poland are Brau, the Austrian
brewer, and Ringnes, a subsidiary of Orkla of Norway, which is the Coca-Cola
bottler in that country. Coca-Cola took its initial step into Poland through
a joint venture in Warsaw in which the Norwegian group took a 51 per cent
share.
To widen its geographic spread, Ringnes then established a production site
in Bydgoszcz, 280kms north of Warsaw. It took a 90 per cent holding in this,
for a Dollars 20m investment. The investment will grow to Dollars 30m with
the addition of another production line - and the expansion associated with
this.
A fully-owned production site at Lublin, in eastern Poland, will spread the
Norwegian group's access to about a third of the total population. The
introduction of Coke Lite, to be marketed alongside Coke, Sprite and Fanta,
is the most important product change under way in Poland.
The launch of the Coke Lite was held up because a branch of the government
objected to the presence of one ingredient in the vital imported syrup.
However, the process for approval received a helping hand earlier this year
when Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the former prime minister, asked Mr Roberto
Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chief executive, who was then on a visit to Warsaw,
when she might be able to buy the Coke Lite.
The reason for the delay was explained - and the rest is now part of
Coca-Cola's history in Poland.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (11): Profitable symbol of regeneration /
Profile of Szczecin shipyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS than two years ago the state-owned Szczecin shipyard was on the
receiving end of much appreciated technical and managerial advice from Swan
Hunter, the UK shipyard, about how to raise productivity and improve
efficiency.
Last month the Polish shipmakers were dismayed to find that the UK shipyard
had been taken into receivership, but delighted that their own had become in
some ways a symbol of the regeneration of former loss-making state
enterprises.
The turn round started in April 1991, when the management, headed by Mr
Ryszard Kwidzinski, came to the conclusion that there was no real prospect
of government or other external help and that management and workers had to
rescue the shipyard with their own efforts.
'We started looking for practical, non-political solutions, drew up a
business plan and hawked it from bank to bank,' he recalls.
In July, 1991, Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the then prime minister, visited
the shipyard and agreed to change its formal status into a joint stock
company, albeit with 100 per cent of the shares owned by the Polish
treasury. To gain credibility with the banks, to whom the shipyard owed
2,500bn zloties (Pounds 100m), management negotiated with the 5,200 workers
a series of reforms.
The changes linked wages to productivity; changed the production system to
reduce stocks; concentrated resources on fewer ships at a time; introduced a
double shift; revamped management and introduced computers; and brought the
privatised design bureau back into the company.
More than 700 workers either changed jobs or left the yard, while the
financial and auditing departments were expanded, along with the
introduction of modern cash management.
The results have been extraordinary. Shipbuilding time was reduced by 50 per
cent to 180 days from start of construction to sale. Instead of as many as
24 ships at varying stages of completion around the yard, it now has two
ships under construction, two being fitted out, two in the planning stage
and two in the pre-fabrication shops.
This year the company will deliver 15 container ships of 12,500dwt each,
worth Dollars 280m, all to foreign owners - mainly German, but also to South
African, French and other buyers. It expects to make a 5 per cent profit,
without a single zloty in government subsidies. 'We now have the best
delivery times in Europe and full order books over two years ahead,' Mr
Kwidzinski claims.
The return to profitability would not have been possible without an
agreement with the banks and 1,800 other creditors, including suppliers.
Without a debt rescheduling the shipyard could have been declared bankrupt
and all would have lost.
Instead, small creditors owed up to 200m zloties were paid in full. Those
above that level, including the the biggest creditors, PKO bank and Bank
Gdansk which together were owed more than 1,000bn zloties, agreed to be
repaid in 20 quarterly tranches, with a year's grace and without any
interest - despite inflation of about 32 per cent. 'The choice before the
banks was to get something, or nothing,' Mr Kwidzinski underlines.
Looking ahead, management is preparing for privatisation within two years
with strong management and worker buy-out elements.
A last-ditch attempt by the small Solidarity 80 union to derail the
privatisation through the intervention of President Walesa appears to have
failed, after the president was presented with the full facts of the case.

FT  17 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: MCI gains more
firepower in telecoms war - BT deal is probably the most important in the US
group's history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 19th June 1993) appended to this article.
BOLD, brash MCI Communications, where revenues have grown from Dollars 500m
a decade ago to Dollars 10bn today, has never been shy about trumpeting its
merits.
'The meek may inherit the earth, but they will not take market share,' was
one of the watchwords of the late Mr Bill McGowan, the chairman who
masterminded MCI's growth into the second-largest US long-distance
telecommunications company.
So when the soft-spoken Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's current chairman, describes
this month's tie-up with British Telecom as the 'telecommunications deal of
the century' there is a touch of hyperbole about his remarks.
Yet for MCI, the agreement with BT is probably the single most important
deal in its 25-year history. The two companies agreed to form a joint
venture to provide global communications services to multinational
companies, while BT is also to pay Dollars 64 a share to take a 20 per cent
stake in MCI for Dollars 4.3bn.
The deal gives MCI far greater clout in the fast-growing international
market than it could have ever gained alone, and without diverting resources
from its battle in the US long-distance market against American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, the much richer market leader.
BT's share purchase will also give MCI much greater financial flexibility to
take advantage of the extraordinary upheaval taking place in the US, where
technological and regulatory changes are pushing telephone, computer and
cable television companies into new alliances to capitalise on an expected
explosion of new communications services.
The BT deal will cut MCI's debt as a percentage of total capital to between
20 per cent and 30 per cent, from its current level of around 52 per cent.
This will give it borrowing potential which could raise its acquisitions
war-chest to nearly Dollars 10bn.
How it deploys this firepower will affect not only MCI's future
profitability but the return the UK company gets from its investment, given
that BT is paying a pricey 25 times MCI's expected 1993 earnings per share
(of around Dollars 2.55) and a 23 per cent premium to the US company's share
price when the deal was struck.
So far, MCI has lagged its rivals in forming alliances. AT&amp;T, for example,
has an agreement to buy a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the largest
group in the fast-growing radio telephony market. MCI has no cellular
interests and has not yet formed any ties with the cable TV industry, which
could occupy a crucial position in delivering inter-active communications
and entertainment services to the home.
However, Mr Roberts insists that MCI will become a force in wireless, local
communications, multi-media and information services, and is at the centre
of a web of discussions which include local telephone companies, cable
operators and software houses.
While his first priority is to complete the BT deal, which will probably not
be consummated until early 1994, he expects to form some important domestic
alliances over the next 18 months.
Throughout its history, he adds, MCI has turned what others saw as
weaknesses into opportunities and been a catalyst for change. It intends to
do so again: 'When there is chaos in an industry, when people are scrambling
to align themselves with somebody, when you've got everyone fumbling around
. . . for MCI that means opportunity,' Mr Roberts says.
There is no disputing the company's track record in shaking up the US
telecoms industry, which used to be a cosy monopoly run by AT&amp;T until MCI
emerged in the late 1960s and began challenging its stranglehold on the
long-distance market.
Key turning points came in 1978, when a ruling in an MCI court case allowed
full competition in the long-distance market, and in 1984, when the break-up
of AT&amp;T on anti-trust grounds ensured that alternative long-distance
carriers, such as MCI, would be given equal access to the consumer by local
phone companies.
MCI's revenues have doubled in the past five years, while its share of the
long-distance market has risen to around 18 per cent, thanks in part to this
much more level playing field, combined with surging demand for
long-distance services and the company's particular strengths. These include
a modern digital network, a lean operating structure, keen pricing and,
above all, a flair for new product development and marketing.
For example, MCI's Friends and Family programme, which allows residential
customers large discounts on calls to certain numbers, has grown in two
years from nothing to more than 10m customers.
It is hoping for similar success in the small-to-medium business market with
a programme called Proof Positive. This offers rebates to customers who have
not employed the most cost-effective service package. MCI also calculates
how much customers are saving compared with AT&amp;T services.
MCI is also shaking up the US collect-call market, which it points out has
been unchanged for 100 years, by offering what it claims are savings of up
to 44 per cent of AT&amp;T rates.
Such innovations, coupled with increasing penetration of the market for
multinational customers, means MCI's traffic volume has been growing at
around 15 per cent over the past two years, roughly double the industry
average.
Analysts expect earnings per share increases of roughly the same size over
the next two years as the US economy recovers, as MCI continues to improve
operating margins and as long-distance carriers are required to pay less in
'access charges' for local telephone companies to complete calls.
But this assumes that the marketing war between long-distance carriers does
not intensify and that prices of calls, which are currently relatively
stable, are not cut sharply in the battle for market share.
The BT deal could eventually give MCI's earnings an additional fillip.
Although the joint venture is expected to lose money for the first two
years, it should mean economies of scale in providing inter-national
services and cost-sharing in developing new software and other technology.
BT's global clout should also help MCI win a greater share of US-originated
international calls, where it claims a market share of around 23 per cent,
though only about 10 per cent of traffic originated by multinationals.
All these considerations have helped lift MCI's share price from Dollars 52
immediately before the BT deal was announced to around Dollars 55 3/4 now,
and some analysts think the price could reach around Dollars 60 - close to
the price BT paid - by the end of the year.
But this assumes wise use of the war-chest by MCI to secure domestic
partners - and a lack of new alliances among rivals. In an industry as
volatile as US telecommunications, those remain substantial question marks.
CORRECTION
MCI Communications' net income in 1992 was Dollars 609m, up from Dollars
551m in 1991. These figures were wrongly described as pre-tax profits in

DRESDNER BANK will be the first German bank to establish a branch in China
when it opens for business in Shanghai later this year.
Mr Rolf Kanning, Dresdner's chief representative in China, yesterday said
that approval for a Shanghai branch had been given at the end of April after
the bank had made an application late last year.
Dresdner has also applied to open branches in Guangzhou and in Shenzen, the
booming development zone next to Hong Kong, as part of its strategy to
capture a share of growing business opportunities in Asia. Approval is
expected within the next few months.
Mr Kanning said Dresdner's move was part of a 'long-term' strategy to
establish a presence in China. Its main target customers would initially be
joint ventures, but it hoped to broaden its business once foreign banks were
permitted to deal in local currency.
Hutchison Whampoa's retailing arm, AS Watson, has announced the formation of
China's biggest integrated food manufacturing concern, Reuter adds from Hong
Kong.
Shanghai AS Watson Yimin Food Co, in which AS Watson has a 51 per cent
stake, will cost USDollars 29m.
Mr Ian Wade, Watson's managing director, said that Watson was also
negotiating with its partner, the Shanghai Yimin No. 1 Food Factory, on a
joint venture to manufacture soft drinks, which would cost USDollars 20m.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Merger unleashes new powerhouse: Saudi Arabia's big oil deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The merger of Saudi Arabia's two main state-owned oil companies, Aramco and
Samarec, will create an international powerhouse in the world oil industry.
The deal, announced by the Saudi government on Monday, creates the world's
largest integrated oil company and an important competitor for multinational
energy businesses such as Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon.
While Saudi Aramco has long been the world's largest oil producer, the
addition of Samarec's refining and marketing interests will put a sharper
focus on the kingdom's downstream ambitions, particularly overseas.
The merger will make Saudi Aramco the world's third largest refining
company, behind Exxon and Shell, moving up from seventh place. Joint
capacity will run to 3.9m barrels per day.
The Saudi merger is evidence of a trend among state-owned national oil
companies to create fully integrated concerns operating in all parts of the
oil business. State-owned companies from the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have played a growing role on the world stage as they
have looked to channel investment into markets closer to consumers. But
while they have the raw oil power to take on the majors, they often lack the
financial muscle and technical expertise of the privately held
multinationals.
Their lack of marketing know-how has forced them, in the past, to turn to
partnerships with the majors in areas such as refining, although they are
well placed to compete head to head on production. Their current eagerness
to secure outlets for their crude in markets close to consumers may lead
them to buy into existing ventures run by the majors.
Mr Peter Bogin, at the oil consulting group, Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, suggests there is a growing trend towards partnerships between
the state-owned companies and the oil majors such as Shell and Exxon.
For example, Aramco has been involved in a joint venture with Texaco in the
US for three years - the Star venture includes jointly running two oil
refineries and operating a chain of petrol stations in the mid-western and
south eastern states. It also has a refining venture with Ssangyong in South
Korea. And Aramco still has close links with its four original American
owners, Exxon, Texaco, Chevron and Mobil.
In addition, Saudi Aramco has for some time been looking for a refining
foothold in Japan and Europe as a way of securing outlets for its crude. It
has a preliminary agreement with Nippon Oil for a feasibility study and is
exploring a possible joint venture deal in Europe.
Saudi Arabia has in turn opened its borders to joint-venture refineries for
export. Aramco is involved with Mobil at Yanbu and Shell at Jubail.
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela have led the drive to expand outside
their own countries. Oman and Libya have also been extremely active.
But Mr Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies is
sceptical that the state-owned companies will take on the majors on their
own turf. 'Will they emerge as competitors to the majors by following
similar policies - I doubt it.' He points to the fact that few companies
from Opec have started exploring for oil outside their own borders. 'These
companies, including Aramco, are going to take a long time to build up
market share outside their own countries and I don't think the majors have
much to fear for some time,' he said.
Saudi officials said this week that while the merger would give greater
'dynamism' to Aramco, it would not necessarily accelerate its expansion
overseas. 'We will not stop being patient,' said one official in Riyadh.
The integration of the two companies should, however, streamline the
decision-making process, enabling the new group to respond more quickly to
market opportunities. Many industry observers point to the enormous
challenge facing the kingdom in combining the two large companies
effectively. The complexity of the task might slow down its international
ambitions in the short term. 'It is a challenging step for Saudi Arabia, but
it will eventually give the joint company a clearer and more transparent
strategy in its international moves,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw at Cambridge
Energy.
The shape of the merged company will be decided over several months by a
taskforce set up yesterday and headed by Mr Ali Naimi, Saudi Aramco's
executive vice president for industrial relations. One of the prime goals of
the merger is to give Samarec's activities the benefit of what is generally
considered to be Aramco's stronger and more experienced management.
In part it is a question of management style. 'In Jeddah, with Samarec, it's
a question of coffee, tea and long discussions round ornate brass tables,
while in Dhahran with Aramco it's shirt-sleeves, styrofome cups and 'let's
get down to business',' said one Riyadh industry observer.
But the amalgamation is also expected to have a direct effect on
streamlining the merged company's operations. Saudi officials suggested, for
instance, that training, marketing, accounting and finance for the combined
operation are all likely to be managed within the existing Aramco structure.
Opec's state-owned oil operators acquired the expertise to perform on the
world stage since they were nationalised in the late 1970s. But low oil
prices have left some companies strapped for cash, forcing them to team up
with other operators. In addition, many still want to gain access to western
technology through joint ventures and partnerships.

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ is negotiating with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation
to build up to 1,000 buses a year for the Chinese market.
The Daimler-Benz vehicles subsidiary, already in negotiations on a similar
deal with the Jing Da automotive company in Beijing, said it might be
possible for production of semi-knock-down kits to start on the Shanghai
site before the end of the year.
Mr Bernd Gottschalk, Mercedes director responsible for commercial vehicles,
signed a letter of intent at the end of May, and attended opening talks in
Shanghai last week.
The signing follows an earlier visit to the city by Mr Gerhard Liener,
Daimler finance director, which also foreshadowed the recent announcement by
the group's AEG subsidiary of a joint venture to build metro railway
carriages there.
Mercedes said it wanted to erect a purpose-built production plant and train
Chinese workers to ensure quality standards were maintained.
The aim with the Jing Da project, talks about which appear to be progressing
more slowly, is a start-up capacity for 500 buses a year, expanding quickly
to 1,000.

<TEXT>
KARSTADT, Germany's largest department store group, sees difficulties in
maintaining its earning levels at the previous year's levels because of the
country's recession, Reuter reports from Essen.
'Despite the unfavourable (economic) environment, we are confident we will
achieve satisfactory results again in 1993, although it will be difficult to
reach the previous year's levels,' Karstadt said in its 1992 annual report.
In 1992, Karstadt's group net profit fell to DM224.1m (Dollars 140m) from
DM257m the previous year, while group third-party sales climbed to DM20.6bn
from DM19.1bn. Karstadt planned to continue to focus on department stores,
mail order houses and tourism in the future, although it would create new
stores for glasses called 'Optik Point'.
'The development of our company and its considerable potential make it clear
that we remain on a successful path with concentration on our three main
businesses,' he said.
Of the group's 1992 sales including tourism turnover, which totalled DM21bn,
department store sales accounted for 61.7 per cent, mail order sales for
16.32 per cent, service turnover for 19.16 per cent and wholesale turnover
for 2.79 per cent.

COFINOGA, the credit card unit of Galeries Lafayette, has taken 20 per cent
in Sodira, a company controlled by France Telecom which is a service
provider in France for a new pan-European digital mobile phone service,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Insurance group Europ Assistance has also taken 5 per cent of Sodira, the
companies said.
France Telecom, France's national phone company, is one of two operators in
France launching digital cellphone networks which allow users to use their
phone anywhere in Europe. Its service, Itineris, began early this year and
is marketed through 11 service companies of which Sodira is one.
A commercial accord reached between the partners provides for Galeries
Lafayette and Bazaar de l'Hotel de Ville to sell subscriptions only for
Sodira's mobile phone services, called Cellway.
The rival French operator in the European digital cellphone market, Societe
Francaise du Radiotelephonie, a unit of Generale des Eaux, launched its
service in April.
A subscription to Cellway costs FFr360 (Dollars 66.79) a month after a
connection fee of FFr350, with a variety of possible extra charges for
things such as changing a number, replacing a lost telephonecard or paying
bills other than by direct debit.
Cellway also offers a service through which a subscriber can get travel
information, reserve hotels or flights or find telephone numbers, for no
extra charge.
SFR set a subscription level of FFr315 francs a month with an initial
connection fee of FFr350.

SRI LANKA hopes to get more than Dollars 800m in aid for 1994 from the World
Bank-sponsored consortium which meets in Paris on Friday.
'The point is our economic liberalisation programme is on course and we were
the pioneers in this region,' said Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, the prime
minister, in an interview.
Donors have also been impressed by the smooth transition after the
assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 1.
However, some of the more obvious vote-buying measures introduced by Mr
Premadasa on the eve of recent provincial elections, such as price
reductions and wage rises, may have to be abandoned.
The civil war in the north and east still requires costly defence spending,
the current budget for which is SLRs20bn (Dollars 419m) or more than half
the aid receipts.
'We are receiving only one message from the donors - negotiate or else there
may be humanitarian intervention,' a central bank official said.
Mr Premadasa's policy was to rely on trade and investment, not aid. His
successor is taking the same route.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC member states risk jeopardising their competitive position if they delay
further telecommunications liberalisation, the EC's industry commissioner
warned yesterday.
Mr Martin Bangemann told EC telecoms ministers in Luxembourg that it would
be against member states' own interests to postpone the European
Commission's proposed 1998 deadline for opening all telephone calls to full
competition.
Poorer and smaller member states were last night chipping away at the
Commission's deadline in an attempt to win temporary opt-outs from the
ambitious programme, which follows earlier liberalisation of the market for
telecoms equipment and specialised services.
Under a compromise, Belgium and Luxembourg - which are classified as 'small
networks' - would not have to liberalise telephone services until the year
2000. Less developed networks - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece - would
have until 2001, with the possibility of a two-year extension.
Ireland and Spain were last night attempting to persuade the larger
countries, led by Britain, Germany and France, to accept a general deadline
of the year 2000.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Young thug takes on old KGB man: The increasing political
turmoil in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest political crisis in oil-rich Azerbaijan, in which the president's
position has been threatened, can be blamed on a simple but powerful
confluence of events - the combined wrath of an old communist and a young
thug. The ambitions of the two men now threaten to bring new violence to the
Caspian Sea nation of 7m people.
'The old government is going to be wiped out, and we don't know what will
replace it,' said a diplomat in Baku. 'It's complete chaos and anarchy
here.'
The main reason for pessimism in Baku is that the domestic crisis is being
exploited by Azerbaijan's adversary in the disputed mountain enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh. For the last two days ethnic Armenians from the enclave
have taken advantage of Azerbaijan's political turmoil to attack the key
town of Agdam, which may fall. If it does diplomats believe President
Abulfaz Elchibey could lose his job, as have his three predecessors who
suffered military failures in Nagorno-Karabakh.
The old communist is Mr Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's former KGB and Communist
party leader who tried three years ago to return to Azeri politics, only to
be snubbed and humiliated by the republic's new communist leaders. Mr
Aliyev's revenge came on Tuesday when he won election as the powerful
chairman of parliament. This left him second only to the beleaguered Mr
Elchibey, over whom Mr Aliyev towers as a politician.
Diplomats believe Mr Aliyev will now manoeuvre parliament into appointing
his ideological allies to the prime minister's office and to two other key
ministries, and probably also force new national elections to cement his
power.
Mr Aliyev has exploited the chaos caused by the young thug - Mr Surat
Husseynov, the charismatic ousted commander of a 3,000-strong private army.
Last month, Mr Husseynov was relieved of his command in Nagorno-Karabakh
after a string of Armenian victories there. His revenge began two weeks ago,
when he seized control of Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Gyanja, forcing
Mr Elchibey's prime minister and parliamentary leader to resign. Now Mr
Husseynov is demanding that Mr Elchibey, too, should quit. He has
established a base 50 miles west of Baku.
So far the government has resisted his demands for entry to the capital, but
Mr Husseynov yesterday continued to capture new territory, and he now
controls more than half the country. Mr Elchibey is being pressured by aides
to use force if Mr Husseynov does not end his insurrection.
However, the president enjoys little support in the military and it is
unclear how strong a campaign the government could muster against the
35-year-old warlord.
Oil company executives who have been pressing Azerbaijan to sign exploration
deals have fled the republic because of Mr Husseynov's insurrection.
Mr Husseynov, however, seems intent on capturing still more territory, while
the Armenians battle to seize yet another Azeri town. If either succeeds,
even the masterful Mr Aliyev may be able to do little for his native land.

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk last night took personal control of the
government, appointing his erstwhile rival, prime minister Leonid Kuchma,
head of an emergency committee to run the faltering economy.
Mr Kravchuk's unilateral action comes amid a week-long strike by miners in
eastern Ukraine which has shaken the country's political and economic
structures.
The presidential decree suggests that Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma, who have
been locked in a bitter power struggle for the past month, may have reached
a compromise.
According to the decree, which could be challenged by the legislature today,
Mr Kravchuk is now directly in charge of the cabinet. He has also claimed
direct authority over all 'non-economic' branches of the central government,
which presumably includes the army and security services.
Mr Kuchma is appointed to head an emergency committee to run the economy.
The eight-member committee, composed of the top economics ministers and the
chairman of the central bank, is charged with controlling inflation and
defusing 'emergency situations' in the economic and social spheres.
With his decree Mr Kravchuk has granted himself the extra powers parliament
refused him a few weeks ago. By putting Mr Kuchma in charge of the emergency
economic committee he may succeed in satisfying the prime minister's demands
for more power over the economy, which were also rejected by the
legislature.
Although Mr Kravchuk is increasingly unpopular, Mr Kuchma is one of
Ukraine's most trusted politicians.
However, parliament, which has been effectively stripped of most of its
authority, could challenge the president's move on constitutional grounds.

Correction (published 18th June 1993) appended to this article.
CIA GROUP, the London-based media buying and planning group, has expanded
into Italy via a stake in Blufin, parent company of the Medianetwork group
of companies.
The USM-quoted group is buying a 5 per cent stake in Blufin, for L2.5bn cash
(Pounds 1.1m) and 400,000 shares from Blugroup, the privately-owned Italian
company.
CIA regards the move as essential to help it take advantage of the growing
pan-Europeanisation of media buying and planning.
The Medianetwork group includes Unilever, Quaker and Electrolux, among its
clients.
CORRECTION
CIA, the media-buying group, has agreed to buy a 45 per cent stake in Blufin
of Italy and not 5 per cent as reported yesterday.

<TEXT>
London COCOA futures finished with gains of up to Pounds 19 a tonne in very
active conditions with the market making another attempt to break out of its
recent range. The jump was aided by sterling's weakness. Some traders
thought prices might rise further to meet producers' asking prices, now
possibly only about Pounds 10 above the market. Robusta COFFEE futures ended
near the lows reached early in the day after news of a rise in US stocks.
The September position closed at Dollars 916 a tonne, down Dollars 6. The
London GOLD price staged another early rise, encouraged by renewed buying in
New York, but ran into resistance at Dollars 371 a troy ounce. Gains were
trimmed by profit-taking before a late buying wave rallied the market to
Dollars 369.35 an ounce at the close, up Dollars 3.60 on the day. The London
Metal Exchange COPPER re-tested resistance above Dollars 1,850 a tonne for
three months metal as short-term sentiment was aided by a recent tightening
of forward premiums and caution ahead of end-June labour contract expiries
in the US and Chile. The price ended Dollars 11 up at Dollars 1,857 a tonne.

NIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET Salomon Brothers and the Corruption of the
Marketplace By Martin Mayer Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 23, 256 pages
Like many recent books about Wall Street, Martin Mayer's account of the
scandal that nearly felled Salomon Brothers in 1991 tries to turn a tale of
financial abuse in high places into a metaphor for a decade.
The story at the heart of Nightmare on Wall Street is relatively simple.
Mayer describes how Paul Mozer, a trader at the powerful US bond house,
Salomon Brothers, faked hundreds of millions of dollars in customer bids for
US government securities.
The trader's bosses, believing Salomon was so powerful it did not have to
answer to officialdom, did nothing when informed. Mayer also tells how
government agencies supervising the market operated a poorly regulated
system open to manipulation.
It is an engrossing tale, well told. But Mayer weakens its impact by using
it as a stick with which to beat the 1980s, and those on Wall Street who
prospered during that much-maligned decade.
The book should, thus, be approached with care. The dust jacket, for
example, refers to 'masters of the universe' and their 'trophy wives and
extravagant personal indulgences', and to a system 'run amok' with young,
ruthless traders. Though Mayer cannot bear responsibility for such cliches,
he does for passages at the end of the book. He writes: 'Very few of those
involved in (the securities) industry in the 1980s . . . contributed to the
economy or to their society anything like what they were paid.' How does
Mayer know? How do you measure anyone's contribution to an entire economy,
or to society? Employees are rewarded for contributing to a company, not to
an economy or society.
He adds: 'The misallocation of America's resources from the malfunctioning
of our financial markets in the 1980s slowed the growth of the nation's
productivity and diminished its economic prospects.'
There were some spectacular malfunctions in the US in the 1980s (the savings
and loan crisis and the 1987 stock market crash among them), but to suggest
that an entire decade of work on Wall Street - work that fuelled one of the
strongest periods of economic expansion in US history - retarded the
country's growth is an exaggeration.
Although Mayer ends with an attack on the 1980s, the bulk of the book is a
history of Salomon, and its role in the US financial markets. He is a more
than capable guide for the firm's journey from the earliest days of the
three brothers - Arthur, Percy and Herbert - to the gung-ho trading heroics
of the 1980s under John Gutfreund, the once all-conquering chairman whose
downfall was precipitated by the 1991 scandal.
The most compelling section reveals how the management of Salomon
deteriorated under Gutfreund, a master salesman and trader but a hopeless
manager. Mayer tells how key issues at Salomon - from capital allocation to
employee compensation - were left to be decided by the whim of senior
executives or by cut-throat competition between department heads.
At times, Mayer's account is confusing. He argues that it stretches
credulity to swallow the official Salomon version of the story - that Paul
Mozer was acting alone - yet he paints a convincing portrait of Mozer as a
solitary, highly competitive trader eager to gain revenge on the US Treasury
for its restrictions on his bidding activities.
Nightmare on Wall Street is a worrying tale of how one firm (or one trader,
depending upon which version you believe) can so easily abuse its dominant
position in a market.
A source of greater worry is Mayer's contention that nothing decisive has
been done by the government to improve surveillance of the world's biggest
market in light of the Salomon scandal.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (22): Gateway to the west - Anthony
Robinson and Christopher Bobinski visit Szczecin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE end of the cold war and the decision to restore Berlin as the capital of
a re-united Germany have opened up exciting long term growth prospects for
Sczcecin and much of western Poland.
While Berlin was the divided capital of a divided country - 'a PX surrounded
by Russians,' in US comedian Bob Hope's immortal phrase - the east German
government spent heavily to build up the old Hansa trading city and fishing
port of Rostock as a substitute for the loss of Stettin, the German name for
Berlin's traditional gateway to the sea.
Large federal subsidies continue to be pumped into Rostock and the
surrounding Mecklenburg province, where unemployment is up to 40 per cent in
some parts. But Rostock is 200 kms from Berlin by inadequate roads and a
slow railway, while Szczecin lies only 140 kms away from the restored
capital, at the other end of an autobahn built during the Hitler era. More
important for a city engaged in the throes of a redevelopment boom, Berlin
is connected to Szczecin, and its sister port Swinoujscie on the Baltic, by
a network of canals.
These inland waterways date from the Bismarck era. They were built for the
cheap shipment of bulk goods - grain, steel, cement - into the very heart of
eastern Germany and along the valley of the River Oder. After the end of the
second world war in 1945 the canals, the autobahn and the railways were
under-used.
This is changing. 'Of the 13m tonnes of cargo which passed through the port
in 1992 over 2m tonnes was transit traffic. Of this, about 900,000 tonnes
would have passed through Rostock before re-unification,' says Mr Michal
Popik, general director of the recently privatised and re-organised
Szczecin-Swinoujscie port authority.
He has little doubt that volumes will grow further as cost effectiveness
replaces political will as the leitmotiv of economic activity on both sides
of the German-Polish border. Fast Shipping, a Belgian-UK-Polish joint
venture, has already built a new 8,000 sq metre general cargo warehouse and
500 metre long dedicated quay. New chemical handling facilities have also
been built, along with a Dollars 15m, 16,000 ton capacity cold store and
Poland's first banana-ripening facility.
The cold store is owned by Lodom, a Polish-American joint venture with
finance from the Polish American enterprise fund. Wolf, an Austrian timber
and wooden frame house building company, wants to set up a saw mill to
process cheap timber from Russia.
Looking further ahead, the port plans to build a large container and general
cargo terminal on Grabowski island, adjacent to port facilities, and to
create a free port manufacturing and transhipment area.
Under the communist regime Szczecin's port, 65 kms from the open Baltic, was
starved of investment, which was concentrated on the coastal port of
Swinoujscie, also a Soviet naval base for over 40 years. Swinoujscie was
developed as Poland's main bulk handling port, capable of unloading ships of
up to 14 metres draught.
Swinoujscie is also the southern base for the twice-daily car/passenger and
freight ferry service across the Baltic from the Swedish port of Ystad; a
five times weekly ferry service to Copenhagen; and regular sailing by
Euro-africa, Polish Baltic and Fast lines to other Baltic and Scandinavian
ports, Germany, the UK and Africa. The ferry terminal is leased to the
Polish Baltic Shipping Company by the local municipality which, together
with the shipping line and the ministry of transport, is investing 16bn
zloty in a new passenger terminal scheduled for completion by 1994.
Until 18 months ago Swinoujscie handled mainly coal exports, phosphates and
iron ore. Now, like Szczecin, it also unloads general cargo and is
considering building a coal import facility. This move angers Silesian coal
miners, who fear that cheap imported coal from South Africa and elsewhere
might replace expensively rail-freighted Silesian coal in the city's Dolna
Odra power station.
Together, the twin ports of Swinoujscie and Szczecin are running at less
than under 60 per cent of their 22/24m tonne handling capacity, mainly
because of a decline in coal exports. But specialised wharves owned by
individual companies handle a further 7m tonnes, bringing total throughput
to about 20m tonnes. All expect to benefit strongly from the eventual
recovery of the east German economy and rapid economic growth in Poland's
western provinces.
What has changed most in the last three years is the nature of the
Oder-Neisse line. The border formed by these two rivers divided post-war
Poland from East Germany for over 40 years. It is now the frontier between a
democratic Poland which aspires to full EC membership, and a re-united but
somewhat traumatised Germany.
It was partly to preserve the increasingly porous nature of this border for
Polish-German trade that Poland agreed to co-operate with the drafters of
Germany's new asylum laws which depend largely on tighter surveillance of
illegal immigrants from the former Soviet Union and the Balkan countries on
Poland's eastern and southern borders.
Already, new supermarkets and stores have opened up on the Polish side of
the border to attract German customers. and Radisson, the US hotel chain,
has taken management control of a new Dollars 150m luxury hotel, business
and shopping centre, which is designed to attract business to the city.
For close observers on both sides, such as like Mr Klaus-Heinrich Standke of
Berlin's East-West Economic Academy, and Mr Marek Talasiewicz, the prefect
of Szczecin province, the end of the cold war has given Germany and Poland a
unique opportunity to make the kind of effort made by France and Germany,
former wartime enemies, to put into improve their bilateral relations after
the war.
Such a rapprochement was impossible while East Germany and Poland were
socialist 'brothers' in an artificial partnership dictated from Moscow. But
now that it is once more possible to build normal relations between
sovereign states, academics and politicians on both sides of the border are
not only talking about ways of improving bilateral relations, but also about
forging stronger links with Denmark and Sweden. They are and looking ahead
to the eventual creation of a new EC 'euro-region' at the western end of the
Baltic.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (23): Modernising Poland's road network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modernising the Polish road network is one of the most important tasks if
the vision of Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains is ever to
become a reality, writes Anthony Robinson.
But billions of dollars of foreign financing will be needed to build new
toll roads and expressways now on the drawing board.
Poland is perfect for motorways. Most of the country is flat or gently
undulating; land is currently cheap; skilled and unskilled labour is both
cheap and plentiful. Modern highways linking Scandinavia with central
Europe, or western Europe to Moscow or the Ukraine, would provide much
needed employment in Poland. Furthermore, they would tie the Baltic states,
European Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine into the existing European motorway
system.
In 1992 the Polish ministry of transport developed a Dollars 3bn highway
programme for the construction of 1,960km of new highways.
The aim is to complete them by the year 2010. Financing for the project is
to be provided by a combination of tolls, franchise fees from foreign
carriers, loans from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, and private investors.
Top priority goes to completing three cross country motorway projects:: the
579km long A1 North-South highway connecting Scandinavia through the port of
Gdansk past Lodz and on to Katowice and the Czech border; the 626km long A2
East-West axis, which extends the existing autobahn from Berlin past Poznan,
Lodz and Warsaw to the Belorussian frontier and then on to Moscow; and the
738km long southern route from Dresden which runs through Silesia past
Wroclaw, Katowice and Krakov and on to Lvov in western Ukraine.
Such a network would transform the Polish communications system. It would
have a dramatic effect on the prosperity of towns such as Lodz, now a
depressed textile town, but likely to take on a new lease of life at the
intersection of the main east-west andnorth-south highways.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (20): The atmosphere warms up / Assessing
Poland's foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLES understand the importance of diplomacy and foreign policy. Living in a
flat country surrounded by Russians and Germans, their history has taught
them to take relations with their more powerful neighbours - and events
further afield - very seriously.
This is one reason why Mr Krzysztof Skubiszewski, the 67 year old former
international law professor from the Poznan academy of sciences, has become
the Talleyrand of post-communist Poland. Five governments have come and
gone, but the urbane Skubiszewski has soldiered on as foreign minister
throughout, giving Polish diplomacy a continuity lacking in other areas.
His steady hand on the tiller has helped steer Poland through a period of
breathtaking change since demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and
Moscow's adoption of the 'Sinatra doctrine.' Moscow's benign indifference to
the fate of its former satellites completely changed the context in which
Poland found itself.
On Poland's western border the re-unification of Germany has taken place in
circumstances which guarantee that Germany will be largely self-absorbed for
years.
But it also opens up new prospects for cross-border co-operation, following
signature of the Polish-German treaty which guarantees the Oder-Neisse
border line and marks formal Germany acceptance of the loss of most of
former Pomerania and Prussia.
To the north, the end of the cold war offers hope for co-operation across
the Baltic, while relations with newly divorced Slovakia and the Czech
republic in the south are problem free - and institutionalised, to a degree,
by moves towards freer trade under the auspices of the Visegrad accord
between the central European states.
It is on the east that the biggest changes have taken place. No longer
hemmed in by a monolithic Soviet state, Warsaw can now deal with a patchwork
quilt of small or medium sized nations similar to western Europe. Poland's
only physical contact with Russian territory is along the southern borders
of the Kaliningrad enclave. Elsewhere it now borders Lithuania, Belarus and
Ukraine, all independent states with whom it is once again possible to have
'normal' political, economic and trading links.
'For the first time in over three centuries we no longer have a huge
neighbour to our east. This means that we can once again have an active
eastern policy. Thanks to our experience in political and economic
transformation we feel that we have lot to give our neighbours and to Russia
itself,' Mr Skubiszewski explains. 'They especially need help in creating
the institutions of a modern state and a market economy. We can help them in
this respect.'
While relishing Poland's new-found freedom of action, Mr Skubiszewski
constantly underlines Poland's sense of belonging to western Europe. 'For
Poland, eventual full membership of an enlarged European Community is the
solution for our future. The established nations of western Europe could
perhaps survive without the EC. But Poland is a state whose existence was
eliminated for over 150 years. Membership of the EC would make us feel
safe,' he explains.
Membership of the EC is so important to Poland that the outgoing government
appointed Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, as minister
for relations with Europe. He was charged partly with raising Poland's
profile in Brussels, but also to ensure that Poland's laws and institutions
change in conformity with EC practice.
But the EC's mishandling of the Yugoslav crisis, the narrowly-focused,
nit-picking reality of EC trade negotiations, member states' delay in
ratifying the Association Agreements with Poland and other post-communist
states, and what Mr Skubiszewski gently chides as 'a tendency in the west to
wash their hands of the complexity of post-communist transformation and an
obsession with stability', has led to a more critical approach in recent
months. 'We want co-operation with the EC in reaching common political
decisions, not just a dialogue,' Mr Skubiszewski adds.
With the Copenhagen summit in mind, the foreign minister recently
accompanied President Lech Walesa to Portugal. This was part of an effort to
persuade the EC's southern European members that amending the Association
Agreements to grant central Europe greater EC market access to sensitive
products such as steel, textiles and food products should not be seen as a
threat, but as an opportunity for increased trade in both directions.
Poland's drive for full integration into the EC ultimately reflects a demand
for recognition that, to all intents and purposes, the real border between
the 'west' and eastern Europe now runs down Poland's eastern frontier.
This was underlined last month when Warsaw, after months of negotiations
with Bonn, agreed to stricter passport, visa and other controls along
Poland's eastern and southern borders, and to turn back would-be illegal
immigrants before they could reach Germany and fall foul of Bonn's tighter
asylum laws.
'We understood Germany's difficulties and reached a reasonable agreement. It
imposes upon us the duty to watch out for those who come from the east, not
just former Soviet citizens but also Romanians, Bulgarians and others hoping
to slip in through Ukraine.'
In co-operating with Germany in this matter, Mr Skubiszewski adds: 'Poland
showed that it regards the problem of immigration as a European problem
which is therefore also our problem.'
But the influx of east Europeans into Poland also shows how three years of
often painful economic reforms have turned Poland itself into a land of hope
and economic opportunity for millions of east Europeans from the former
Soviet Union. Controls on the border have been tightened.
Many Poles can still remember recent times when they were just like the
impoverished traders and job seekers from further east who now crowd
Poland's outdoor markets or busk in the city squares. This ensures that
there is still a humanity about Polish relations with its poorer neighbours
 -alongside the determination to be treated as an equal by the west.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (21): Preparing for eventual membership of
EC / A look at the Phare projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT Natolin Palace, in an old park on Warsaw's southern outskirts,
postgraduates from the two halves of Europe are completing a 12-month course
devoted to every aspect of European integration.
The house, built in the 1780s for Princess Elzbieta Lubomirska, is where
communist party hardliners had plotted their power plays in 1956 during the
Hungarian crisis and Poland's concurrent liberalisation.
It is a fit setting for academic endeavour to help stitch together the
formerly divided eastern and western parts of Europe. The course is
organised by the Bruges-based College d'Europe and financed out of European
Community funds. And Natolin is being refurbished with money generated from
early EC food transfer programmes. The project is part of the Community's
Phare effort, the largest of the programmes aimed at helping Poland and her
neighbours prepare for eventual Community membership.
The sums involved are paltry compared to regional aid programmes within the
EC, but each year since 1990 Poland has been allocated Ecu 200m under Phare.
This annual amount is being increased to Ecu 225m for three years from
January 1993.
The size of the annual allocation is decided in Brussels, but its various
end-users are selected through a time consuming process attempting to match,
with varying success, not only Brussels' wishes but also the needs and
priorities of the Poles.
In 1990 food aid received a high profile with half of the funds made
available devoted to supplies of animal feed, pesticides and credits for the
farming sector. Owing to the slump in Polish farming incomes and continuing
high interest rates, the Ecu 30m credit line then allocated has yet to be
taken up. But the pesticides and feed has been sold with the proceeds going
into a co-operation fund now worth 300bn zloty. This fund supports other
Phare projects which have local input.
Since then farming has been a smaller recipient of EC aid programmes, not
least because Polish government priorities have tended to play down the
sector. Indeed for the next three years a mere 7 per cent of the Ecu 675m
allocated to Poland will go to farming.
As most aid organisations know, collection and allocation of funds is only
half the struggle. There have been controversies over whether the projects
chosen in Poland have been the right ones and *something in here (HP) *
whether they have been designed more to favour the donor than the recipient.
Spending the money can be a problem in itself. In Poland's case there have
been delays, with only 60 per cent of the total funds allocated for 1991 and
1992spent, and only 12 per cent of the Ecu 200m for this year disbursed.
The higher and secondary education sector has been a star performer with the
beneficiaries promptly drawing and spending the Ecu 53m allocated to them
since 1990.
The British government's know-how fund is one of the first bi-lateral funds
to have become operational and has spent Pounds 30m of its Pounds 50m
allocation to Poland, with most allocated to providing advice on
privatisation and other financial matters. Phare, by contrast, is giving a
high priority to education exchanges and educational reform. As much as Ecu
125m, or nearly one fifth of the total Phare fund for the next three years,
is to be spent on this sector.
Phare has also made financial assistance available to assist privatisation,
financial reforms and industrial restructuring. At the government-owned
Industrial Restructuring Agency, Dr Lothar Nettekoven, an EC-funded expert,
says that the technical assistance provided to the agency, and through it to
enterprises, has transformed the unit completely. It is now a much more
sophisticated organisation capable of dealing on its own terms with the
outside world, he says.
Mr Marek Krawczyk, a director at the agency agrees, pointing to the EC funds
which have been spent hiring advisers for the Ministry of Industry. They
have helped the ministry deal with Lucchini, the Italian steel maker which
took over the Warsaw steelworks, Pilkington, which set up a joint venture
with the Sandomierz glass works, and Volkswagen, which linked up with the
Tarpan light truck factory in Poznan.
But the Phare programme is soon to undergo a subtle shift, in line with the
wishes of the Poles. The new policy will take it away from technical
assistance and towards direct investment projects aimed at generating growth
in high unemployment areas.
Four such areas have now been identified, Walbrzych in the south west, the
textile town of Lodz, 130km west of Warsaw, Suwalki, in the north east and
the Mielec area to the south. Here Ecu 60m worth of funds are to be spent
this year under the Struder programme, followed by another Ecu 32m and Ecu
37m in 1994 and 1995 respectively, on equity investment, grants and loans,
in an effort to generate jobs.
Other areas covered by Phare include aid to Poland's foreign investment
agency as well as export and tourist promotion efforts. A main chunk worth
Ecu 80m is to be spent on rail and road transport planning schemes. Fewer
funds are available for other urgently needed projects such as modernising
the Polish customs service and tackling environmental problems.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (18): Widespread complaints / Review of the
agricultural sector

<TEXT>
THE FARMER'S gesture as he drew his hand up to his nose left little to the
imagination. The water, he was saying, had risen to the drowning point.
He was one of a thousand who marched through central Warsaw just before the
fall of the government last month to demand more state aid for farming.
The farmer and his neighbours from Krzywda in Siedlce province, east of
Warsaw, were despondent. 'Nothing has changed for the better in the three
years since the end of non-communist rule - and none of our neighbours have
profited either.'
Their holdings were not small by Polish standards. Several farmers had more
than 10 hectares of land each, as do some 20 per cent of the country's 2.1m
private farmers. But their frustration at not having the funds to develop
was greater than the smallholders' who, as Mr Alexander Luczak of the PSL
farmers' party says, have simply turned back to subsistence farming.
The complaints which brought the farmers to Warsaw were simple; food prices
were too low; farming equipment and materials costs were too high; and the
price of credit was prohibitive. They reiterated a common fear; that
subsidised food from the European Community would bang the final nail into
their coffin.
Such feelings are widespread in the countryside where more than 30 per cent
of the Polish population still lives and works. Their complaints have posed
a bigger political problem for successive Polish governments. But all have
resisted repeated demands for farm subsidies and sought to keep trade
barriers as low as possible since the collapse of the communist regime in
1989.
The statistics paint a slightly more optimistic picture. Poland enjoyed a
modest Dollars 193m surplus in its food trade last year with the EC, which
accounted for 8 per cent of the country's total 1992 foreign trade turnover.
However, such figures did nothing to restrain farmers' anger at the recent
ban on Polish exports of baby calves to the EC. The government rejected a
demand by Brussels that the calves be subjected to a 14-day quarantine
before shipment, a demand which strengthened fears that farming is being
subjected to unfair competition. Brussels cited outbreaks of foot and mouth
disease in the former Soviet bloc countries as justification. But the Poles
replied that the last incident of foot and mouth in Poland was in the early
1970s.
Farm incomes as a whole have fallen by a half since 1988, although last year
saw relief for some as farm gate prices rose by 62 per cent compared with a
37 per cent rise in the cost of farming inputs and a 43 per cent increase in
consumer prices.
But this apparent improvement was largely the result of a natural calamity.
Grain prices rose sharply as drought hit last year's harvest, which fell by
25 per cent to 20m tonnes - from 28m tonnes in 1991. Overall, farming
incomes still dropped by 4 per cent on the previous year.
This year, the third consecutive year of lower fertiliser useage which
reflects the farmers straightened circumstances, the grain crop is expected
to reach about 22m tonnes. But it is the declining animal population, both
pig and cattle, which tells the fuller story.
Meat production is dropping in response to depressed demand as working
families who queued for hours for cheap, heavily subsidised meat during the
communist period have adjusted to buying less of the now abundant, but
expensive unsubsidised meat on offer at the largely privatised shops. Per
capita meat consumption is set to drop further this year from 70 kg in 1992,
below the 1980 level when meat shortages provided the backdrop to the
workers' strikes which presaged the downfall of communism a decade later.
The greatest challenge facing Polish farmers is how to face up to the
structural problems left over from 40 years of communism whose post-war
leaders tried and failed to collectivise the farms and then left them alone
in a patchwork of small holdings.
In 1989 a fifth of the land was state owned and the rest was in private
hands. But the patchwork smallholdings are estimated to be six to seven
times less efficient than the operations of farmers in the EC. Farming units
will have to be larger if Poland is to compete on world markets.
For the moment, however, little is being done to address these issues;
successive governments hope that the squeeze on farm incomes will, of
itself, lead to more efficient production on the 14.3m hectares privately
farmed.
Efforts are currently being focused on privatising the state farming sector,
mostly large farms in those parts of western Poland depopulated by the
forced exodus of ethnic Germans at the end of the war. A new state body, the
Agricultural Ownership Agency, was established last year to take over and
sell the 1,495 state farms with their 261,000 employees and 3.1m hectares of
arable land.
Ironically, it is the once heavily subsidised state farms which are the
right size for modern farming methods and which have the best chance of
matching production costs abroad. Traditionally, grain yields have been
higher in the state sector, which had privileged access to seed, fertilisers
and equipment. Even in the 1992 harvest, when 15 per cent of the state farm
arable land was left fallow, their grain yield per hectare was 34 per cent
higher than on the private farms.
But the privatisation task will not be easy. The state farms remain indebted
and many were neglected in the first couple of years of non-communist rule
when subsidies were removed and their fate remained undecided. Foreigners in
general and Germans in particular are not welcomed as potential buyers; they
have to obtain a special permit from the Interior Ministry before a purchase
can be made.
But domestic buyers are also scarce. By March 31 new Polish owners had been
found for a mere 24,000 hectares of former state land and another 204,000
hectares had been leased to individual owners or employee owned companies.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (19): Firms criticised over fees and
standard of advice - Ray Bashford examines the role of foreign advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL advice to Poland is not in short supply. Most of the
international auditing, accounting and consultancy firms which flocked to
eastern Europe at the start of the decade have nested in Warsaw.
Their main task has been to revise auditing and accounting methods and
standards to conform with EC practice; and prepare state owned companies for
privatisation and sale to foreign and local investors.
But the activities of highly paid foreign advisers have come in for
criticism both over the standard of advice on offer and the fees charged.
Some western firms echo these harsh words, but only in veiled reference to
their competitors.
Mr Jurgen M. Wilms, the principal at McKinsey, the firm of management
consultants, says: 'We call some of the early consulting work 'gold rush
consultancy.' Two years ago, he adds, the demand from the government and
from companies was unlimited. 'This is over,' he says. 'Now the
international agencies are spending money more carefully and the Poles,
through experience, are becoming much more critical of the sort of advice
they are getting.'
Western companies working here are reluctant to detail their own charges,
but justify their fees on grounds of their higher skill levels, greater
experience and the need to recoup heavy start-up costs on training and
development.
Mr Jon Newbery of Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants, is one who
argues that the benefits received by Polish firms fully justify his firm's
fees. Another consultant, who declined to be named, backs him, but cited a
recent case of a Polish firm which concluded that a local bank was
profitable. 'We went in and found that it made losses of about 60 times the
estimated profit. If someone had bought that bank they would have been in
real trouble,' he said.
Bain and Company, which undertook sectoral analysis in the detergents,
cables, industrial gases and the telecommunications industries, claims that
for each Dollars 1 in fees it has earned the state treasury Dollars 50 in
revenues from subsequent acquisitions and capital investment.
Ms Henryka Bochniarz, a former industry minister who is president of Nicom,
one of Poland's leading management consultants is an outspoken critic of
foreign firms. But she also blames the ministry of privatisation for
ignoring Polish firms with greater local knowledge.
'With money supplied from international funds the government used
exclusively foreign firms,' she says. 'The government ignored the advantage
we had of knowing how some of these companies worked - particularly at the
time when people were afraid to talk because they might get into trouble.'
She adds that exclusion from this work means that local firms have been
denied the transfer of knowledge which would strengthen domestic standards
and she further points out that this is contrary to the government's general
rule of obtaining maximum knowledge and skill transfers.
Mrs Bochniarz also believes that certain leading international auditing
firms and investment banks offered second-rate management consultancy work
during the early years. She quotes a recent government study which concluded
that advice on all aspects of the privatisation of an average Polish firm
with a staff of 1000 carried out by a local firm would cost ZL400m (Dollars
25,000), compared with ZL2bn charged by foreign advisers.
Foreign advisers reply that the benefits of their work are sometimes not
fully appreciated because the government sits on their findings.
Meanwhile foreign accountancy and management consultancy firms are highly
complimentary about the motivation and educational standards of their local
employees, as they expand recruitment of cheaper local staff. But this also
has its negative effects. Government ministries - especially the finance
ministry, which is recruiting extra tax and customs officers - complain
about losing promising staff to foreign firms which offer substantially
higher salaries together with international training. Universities are also
hunting grounds for prospective staff.
For example, Arthur Andersen is hiring 50 graduates, which will raise its
total staffing level in Warsaw to 165 by the end of the year. Only 15 of
these will be expatriates, compared with 17 during the first year of
operations, when the firm's total work force was only 34 people. Mr Newbery
insists that his company is now a Polish company with a foreign parent; he
forecasts that the first Polish national will be made a partner within three
years.
Mr Antoni F. Reczek, an Anglo-Pole, talks of a similar rate of growth at the
accountancy firm of Cooper &amp; Lybrand, where total staff numbers should rise
from 85 to 100 by the end of the year. Only 12 are expatriates. Similarly,
McKinsey and Company, which opened its office in Warsaw last February, is
giving international training to 20 locally hired staff as it raises
standards and gives local staff greater responsibility. Mr Wilms sums up:
'My job is to make myself obsolete.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (17): Professionals take over - Christopher
Bobinski takes a look at the local media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S media have reached a watershed, with state owned radio and
television about to face competition from legally established private
channels and competition at home and abroad thinning the ranks of once
plentiful newspapers.
It seems a far cry from the heady days of 1989 and 1990, when writers
wallowed in the freedom to write what they chose, and people looked to
television and radio to express each and every point of view. Now, as
advertising revenues loom ever more important, and readership figures become
the key to survival, the professionals able to produce a marketable product
are slowly taking over.
Fiercely partisan newspapers such as Nowy Swiat, which passionately attacked
President Lech Walesa, have failed. Those dailies which are growing, such as
Rzeczpospolita, which is half owned by the French Hersant group, or Gazeta
Wyborcza, are expanding into smart non-political colour supplements and
general features to attract the advertisers. Gazeta Wyborcza, with well over
500,000 readers, has emerged as Poland's best selling paper.
But it is in the broadcast media that the next 12 months will bring the
greatest changes.
Poland's parliament has finally passed a broadcasting law which removes the
state radio and television monopoly and puts in place a framework for the
establishment of private national radio and television stations.
This does not mean that there has been no element of competition up to now.
In Wroclaw, TV Echo was an early private broadcasting pioneer, operating on
a one-off licence issued by the authorities. In Warsaw, Radio Zet, founded
by Andrzej Wojciechowski, a talented journalist and organiser, filled the
airwaves with western pop music and its own distinctive promotional jingles,
as well as advertising.
Radio Zet captured well over a third of the listening audience. Now, in
concert with British investors, the company is considering a move into the
former Soviet Union, Bulgaria and eastern Germany.
A plethora of radio and television 'pirate' broadcasters without licences of
any sort then took to the air, as the authorities waited helplessly for
parliament to produce a law regulating the air waves.
Into this legal gap Mr Nicola Grauso, a Sardinian media baron, has moved. He
first provided equipment to 12 local television stations in an investment of
about Dollars 30m - including, by his own account, his purchase of the
ailing Zycie Warszawy daily.
Earlier this year he followed this up by providing each station with eight
hours of programming daily, promising to provide advertising through
Publitalia, a Berlusconi owned agency. Mr Grauso owns a 33 per cent share in
each station, the most a foreign partner in a broadcasting company can
legally own.
These broadcasters still have no licence. Theoretically they face prison
once the requisite article of the new law comes into force on July 1. Mr
Grauso has said he will consider what to do when that moment comes.
Meanwhile he has shown every indication that he intends to apply to the new
Broadcasting Council for regional licences.
This body, composed of nine men, was chosen by parliament and President Lech
Walesa. Its political allegiances range right across the spectrum. It is
headed by Mr Marek Markiewicz, a soft spoken lawyer from Lodz who, for the
next four to six years, will not only be responsible for issuing licences
but also for policing the airwaves.
Some time in the autumn the council will have to decide to whom they will
hand the one national channel which will be available alongside State TV's
first and second channels. The competitors include Bertelsmann, the owner of
RTL and several Polish groups, including one called Super Television.
This is funded by a group of rich Poles who did well out of the communist
1980s and the last three years. Another is NTP, a group led by Miroslaw
Chojecki, a veteran of the dissident publishing movement, who stresses his
wish to provide programming which will play up Polish cultural values.
The unanswered question is whether the Polish economy can generate the
revenues to sustain all this activity. Bertelsmann's representatives make no
secret of the fact that the company only expects a return round about the
turn of the century.
Most of the top names in world advertising now have a presence in Warsaw and
campaigns have concentrated on state television and radio's prime time
slots. These have become progressively more expensive, but at about Dollars
1,000 per 30 seconds, rates still lag behind those in the west.
According to Mr Brian Dunnion at Saatchi and Saatchi in Warsaw, the total
advertising spend has risen to about Dollars 200m from Dollars 24.5m two
years ago. The total spend is expected to grow, with western multinationals
piling heaping on the pressure to sell their domestically produced and
imported goods as Polish companies realise more and more that advertising is
essential to survival.
For although Poles increasingly complain about intrusive television
advertisements, these continue to do wonders for sales. Anything shown on
television, the retailers say, begins to climb the sales curve. And Ms Anna
Krajewska from NBS, a locally owned company which helped handle the
publicity for the recent public share offer of the Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy, even claims that the advertising campaign on television not only
sold shares but also brought new clients into the bank.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (16): Trying to connect you - when we have
more lines / A look at telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE visiting executives of AT&amp;T quickly realised the task ahead of their
company as they tried to telephone Warsaw from the plant the US telephone
and telecommunications group recently acquired only 280 kms north east of
the capital.
First they had a problem getting a line to the local operator. Then there
was a long delay while the call was transferred to Warsaw. Mr Jerzy Bak, the
president of AT&amp;T Telfa in which AT&amp;T has acquired a 94 per cent state,
relates the incident while reflecting on the improvements that have taken
place in his country's antiquated telecommunications system.
But while it is now possible to make such connections with much greater
ease, enormous efforts are still required to drag the system up to European
standards of efficiency and service.
Successive post-communist governments have given improvement of the
telecommunications system a high priority. A well functioning telecom system
is seen as a vital building block in the establishment of a free market
economy - and indispensable for the encouragement of foreign investment.
Politically. improved telecommunications also represent a symbol of higher
living standards for millions of Poles.
Starved of foreign exchange and by-passed by the rapid changes which took
place in western telecommunications during the past two decades, Poland has
one of the lowest levels of telephone line ownerships in Europe, east and
west.
Figures supplied to the Ministry of Telecommunications by Bain and Co, the
management consultants advising the government on restructuring the
industry, show that at the end of 1991 there were only 7.8 lines per 100
inhabitants. The closest comparison in western Europe is Portugal, with 20
lines per 100 inhabitants. Even to achieve Portugal's level by the end of
the decade Poland needs to install nearly a million lines a year. The
government has concluded that the cost will be in the region of Dollars 1bn
a year.
At the beginning of this decade there was no digital computer technology and
Poles relied on equipment which was often 30 years old. Equipment which came
from the west during the past two decades was invariably outmoded. To tackle
this backlog the government launched a wholesale restructuring programme for
the industry which relies heavily on foreign capital and expertise.
The international and inter-city telephone network will remain in the hands
of the state monopoly, TPSA, and 20 local operators. But the government is
in the final stage of selling off formerly state owned manufacturers of
switching and transmission gear.
At the time the decision was made to transform the industry, five of the 40
state-owned electronics companies dominated this area of the market. The
financial position of all these groups was dire. Like much of Polish
industry, domestic bank debt weighed them down and made them technically
insolvent.
In line with the government's sectoral approach to industrial restructuring
the government decided to 'bundle' these five main producers and their
associated operations into three companies and dispose of them to western
groups, creating an oligopoly of foreign owned-switch and transmission
makers. But the government has given no assurance on market shares, which
will have to be fought for.
In each case two foreign companies were encouraged to bid for the
enterprises on offer. The winner was decided primarily on the full bid price
and the size and type of investment, job security and other commitments
offered.
Mr Bak of AT and T concedes that in Telfa's case it had no financial and
industrial future without an injection of foreign capital. 'We were at least
15 years behind the west and had no chance of catching up, so we didn't look
for half-way measures,' he says.
Bidding against Ericsson of Sweden, AT&amp;T won the right to an 80 per cent
stake in Telfa for Dollars 35m. This holding was increased to 94 per cent
following the sale of employees' shares to the company. The US group
commited itself to invest a total of Dollars 86m on modernising the product
line. An important part of AT&amp;T's product innovation will be the
introduction of its standard 5ESS switching system.
Another two producers, PZT and Teletra, were merged for the purpose of sale,
and disposed to Alcatel of France after a competition in which Siemens and
Northern Telecom took part. The two groups, with a combined workforce of
1,700, were sold for Dollars 46m with undertakings to lift the investment
substantially.
The third piece should fall into place next September when the outcome of
the competing bids by Siemens and Northern Telecom for the combined ZWUT and
Elwro enterprises is expected. The upcoming decision is creating intense
speculation in industry circles. The stakes are especially high in this
sell-off, because the loser will be effectively excluded from the Polish
market for the foreseeable future.
The merged ZWUT and Elwro will be the biggest group in terms of employees,
with 4,000 on the payroll, although this staffing figure may be revised
after the deal goes through. The investment commitment required will also be
the largest, reflecting the importance of ZWUT.
Each of the three companies which will control the industry must achieve 50
per cent local content levels, a measure insisted on by the government to
ensure development of ancilliary suppliers. But the potential rewards for
the foreign companies serving a domestic market of 40m people, starting from
such low standards of service and equipment, are substantial.
For this reason the process of transformation will be watched closely,
especially by those on the political sidelines who question the wisdom of
transfering such a strategically important industry to full foreign control.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (12): Fledgling market's spectacular rise -
Christopher Bobinski visits the Warsaw stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE WORD went out that there was money to be made, so the cash flowed in.'
That is how Mr Janusz Piekarski, an early investor and regular attender at
the Warsaw Stock Exchange, explains the reason for the fledgling market's
spectacular 175 per cent rise over eight weeks after Easter, before the laws
of economic gravity reasserted themselves.
But even as prices began to come down at the beginning of June hopeful
investors continued to crowd into the banks to buy shares in two new issues
which, when quoted on the WSE, should bring the number of stocks traded at
its three sessions a week up to 21 by the autumn.
The surge in prices marked the exchange's first big boom since it was set up
almost two years ago in the communist party's old headquarters. The flood of
money brought price/earnings ratios up to an average of 10 from about three,
at which stocks had stagnated for most of last year. Average turnover per
session rose from 30bn zloty to 350bn zloty as some 19,000 Poles opened
accounts with brokers, enabling them to buy and sell shares. Newcomers to
the market brought the number of active investors up to around 100,000.
The impetus for the boom came from two sources. One was the dip in bank
interest rates in the early spring, prompting savers to find a new home for
their money. The other factor was an influx of foreign investors whose
steady buying orders at the height of the boom were, according to official
estimates, responsible for a quarter of the turnover, giving the market its
upward momentum.
Foreign investment included five funds led by Invesco's CEAM fund, an early
entrant on the exchange. That brought the smaller, and some large, investors
in off the streets as they became aware there was a 30 per cent untaxed
profit to be made buying available stocks.
Despite the madness the market did tend to favour the 'better' shares such
as Wedel, the chocolate manufacturer controlled by PepsiCo, Mostostal, a
building company and Electrim, the trader in power and telecommunications
equipment. Electrim is particularly well-placed to benefit from
modernisation of the country's infrastructure.
Recent developments have delighted Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the WSE chairman.
But even with recent price rises, WSE capitalisation, which reached some
Dollars 800m at its peak, still accounts for little more than 2 per cent of
the population's total savings.
The exchange, modelled on the French order-driven system, where prices are
allowed to move by 10 per cent up or down per session, has stood up well in
the new business rush.
Next year, Poland's mass privatisation programme should see the transfer of
up to 600 enterprises into the hands of foreign-managed investment funds.
Shares in these funds are to be available at a nominal fee to all adult
Poles. These will then become tradeable.
The plan is to establish an over the counter system before the funds are
transferred to the WSE. Thousands of employees are to be granted 15 per cent
of the equity in the companies managed by each individual fund.
An important dampening factor on the WSE's performance is the series of
strict rules on the disclosure of results by publicly-quoted companies which
many Polish companies - and some foreign companies operating in the country
 -remain wary about.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (13): Sell-offs gather pace - The banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE long-awaited overhaul of the Polish banking system moved into higher
gear in April with the successful privatisation of Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy (WBK). The sale to foreign and domestic investors was welcomed by
Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the Polish finance minister, as the first big
commercial bank privatisation in the whole of central and eastern Europe.
Next in line for privatisation is Bank Slaski, the Silesian bank, which like
WBK is one of nine former regional branches of the Narodowy Bank Polski
(BNP), the central bank, which were hived off in 1988 and have since been
groomed for their eventual debut as the core of a revitalised commercial
banking system.
The past three years have seen a rapid growth in private banks, but most
remain small and are finding survival difficult. A few have already failed,
the most spectacular being the ART-B bank which left a hole of about Dollars
500m behind it and led to an urgent strengthening of central bank
supervisory procedures under a new president, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz.
The central bank showed its concern about the dangers posed by the
proliferation of small, under-capitalised private banks when it mounted a
prompt lifeboat operation to protect depositors in the First National Bank
of Lublin following a two day run on the bank last year.
The recent takeover of the small Lodz Development Bank by BIG-Bank, one of
the first of the new private banks, was a sign that a consolidation process,
encouraged by the monetary authorities, is under way.
Last year the nine commercial banks hived off from the national bank, and
the six specialised banks such as Bank Handlowy, the foreign trade bank,
were again the most profitable banks and those most trusted by depositors.
But margins of all banks are coming under pressure. Extensive training and
computerisation programmes are raising costs while lower interest rates and
a greater concentration on low risk but low-yielding government paper are
reducing spreads and therefore income.
The biggest problem facing most banks however remains the high level of
non-performing loans and bad debts from loss-making enterprises. A recent
study by Professor Stanislaw Gomulka of the London School of Economics
showed that the bad debt problem is heavily concentrated in 11 per cent of
Polish enterprises which account for 61 per cent of total bank debt. Thus
far, although most loss-making enterprises in the state sector have sold
assets and reduced their labour force, few have been closed, and their debts
remain on the books.
The World Bank recently approved a Dollars 450m loan to help restructure the
banks and up to Dollars 600m is also available from the original Dollars 1bn
stabilisation fund provided by western governments in 1990 to support the
zloty but never used. Some of these funds will be used to finance the
restructuring of Poland's foreign debt, some to provide interest bearing
bonds to replace enterprise debt writedowns in bank balance sheets.
Providing the banks with fresh capital is also one of the main aims of the
bank privatisation programme. The WBK privatisation, with Schroders, the
City merchant bank, as advisers in close co-operation with Coopers Lybrand,
the accountancy firm, raised 200bn zlotys for the treasury through the
public offer of 20 per cent of the shares to small private investors. The
small investor tranche was heavily over-subscribed.
A further 7.2 per cent was allocated to large investors, both domestic and
foreign, while 14.3 per cent of shares was reserved for employees with the
treasury retaining 30 per cent.
From the WBK point of view the most important element in the privatisation
was the 28.5 per cent stake taken by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) through the purchase of new shares. This meant a
210bn zloty (Dollars 12.7m) injection of new capital.
Critics of the deal, inside the bank and outside, complain that the offer
price of shares was too low, that more shares should have been made
available to Poles and that more effort should have been made to find a
foreign commercial bank rather than the EBRD as a partner.
But the price was agreed before the subsequent general rise in share prices
on the Warsaw stock exchange while the treasury took the view that, with
several other banks in the privatisation pipeline, it was essential to make
the first privatisation a success for small investors.
The willingness of the EBRD to step in where foreign commercial banks have
proved reluctant to tread reflects the wait-and-see attitude of foreign
banks and the relatively limited inflow of equity investment generally into
Poland.
The expectation is that this reticence will dissipate once Poland secures an
agreement on the restructuring of its Dollars 12.1bn debt with the London
Club of commercial bank creditors to match the two-stage 50 per cent
reduction in its Dollars 33bn Paris Club debt reached in 1991.
Citibank of the US and Creditanstalt of Austria have been the first foreign
banks to open branches in Poland and some German banks are believed to have
bought relatively small packets of shares in Poznan-based WBK which is
active in western Poland and has the highest number of Polish-German joint
ventures. Several banks have representative offices and US, German, Dutch
and French banks are preparing to set up new branches.
Meanwhile, the strongest Polish banks are increasing their reserves and
raising their capital adequacy ratios. Bank Handlowy, which has lost its
former monopoly of foreign trade financing but expects to retain a 60 per
cent share of this overall expanding business, added Dollars 150m to its
capital base last year after raising net profit to around 5,000bn zlotys
(Dollars 312m) from 1,400bn zlotys in 1991, Mr Cesary Stypulkowski, the
bank's young US-trained chairman says.
Bank Handlowy's higher profitability bucked the general trend to lower
profits from narrower spreads, higher costs and greater competition which
characterised the bulk of the banking sector. Faced with heavy losses on
loans to the fledgling private sector most banks have reduced lending to the
risky, but capital starved, private sector. They have opted increasingly to
invest deposits in less risky but lower margin government bonds.
The long term aim of bank restructuring is to improve the banks' capacity to
evaluate risks, raise capital adequacy ratios and increase the banking
system's ability to perform its main task. That is to help finance the
development of a dynamic private sector whose capacity for future growth
will be largely determined by access to affordable loans from competent
banks.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (14): Solidarity has its moments / A look
at the labour movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Solidarity trade union, founded in 1980 to oppose the communist system
and its inefficient command economy, finds itself searching for a new role
as the growth of the private sector decentralises power to independent
company managements, while mounting unemployment erodes its power base in
the big factories.
But the now-reduced Solidarity union still has its moments. In 1992 the
union's parliamentary group was instrumental in putting together the
coalition government headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka.
Eleven months later it was Solidarity which decided the coalition's fate
when it followed up a campaign for public servants' wage rises with a
no-confidence motion which scraped through parliament by one vote. Having
toppled the government it then threatened to press for a general strike.
But before Solidarity could savour its political triumph the constitution
shifted the political initiative from the union and into the hands of
President Lech Walesa. He vetoed a bill by which parliament had voted an
extra 21,000bn zloties for pensioners, dissolved parliament and called early
elections for a new government. Ironically, the government brought down by
the union's no-confidence vote had earlier made the greatest effort to draw
Solidarity and the other unions into the new market system. For it was Ms
Suchocka and her ministers who negotiated the enterprise pact which sought
to involve the trade unions in the privatisation process.
As part of the pact the government also pledged to hold regular
consultations on macro-economic policy between the unions, employers and the
government. These promises will have to await the outcome of the elections.
No less ironically, it was the OPZZ unions, fostered under the communist
regime, which appeared in the past weeks to recognise that the Suchocka
government was offering the unions a good deal. Under the leadership of Ms
Ewa Spychalska, a political scientist, the OPZZ union federation movement,
whose membership has shrunk to below 4m, had shown a lack of enthusiasm for
Solidarity's political campaign against the government.
Ms Spychalska herself admits that this year's budget constraints are such
that she could not see what Mr Marian Krzaklewski, the head of Solidarity,
had been hoping to achieve by pushing his wage claims so strongly.
But day by day Solidarity and the OPZZ face similar problems. But the
underlying problem is that neither union has much of a presence in the
private sector, which now accounts for over half of Poland's employment  -
except where a plant has been privatised and the unions privatised with it.
In the state manufacturing sector, conflicts are rarely about pay but more
often about protecting jobs. Strikes are called usually where orders are
scarce anyway, and it is not unheard-of for workers at plants formally
declared to be 'on strike' to continue to work for fear of losing orders.
The conflict line, especially in the state sector, does not really run
between workers and management. On the contrary, public sector workers and
management often combine to put pressure on government for support to keep
their usually loss-making enterprises afloat.
All this is confusing for blue collar workers without whose support the
Solidarity movement would never have removed the communists from power in
1989 and who now see few rewards for their efforts. The feeling of impotence
and disillusion is mounting.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (10): Taking politics out of economics -
The progress of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GIVEN another year of political continuity Poland will have advanced to the
point where the economy becomes independent of political uncertainties,' Mr
Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, said only days
before the government fell on a no-confidence vote in parliament.
That judgment still holds, partly because of a clear majority in the country
for a continuation of market reforms, and partly because privatisation of
the economy is about to achieve critical mass.
Mr Lewandowski is in a good position to judge, because he started the
privatisation process as minister in the first post-communist government in
1989, returning to the helm four governments later in the coalition led by
Ms Hanna Suchocka.
Progress since those early days has been greater than is often realised,
despite the sometimes lengthy periods between governments when privatisation
seemed as becalmed as the rest of the decision-making process. More than
2,000 of the 8,500 state enterprises have been privatised and by the end of
this year more than 50 per cent of GDP and 60 per cent of total employment
will stem from the economy's privatised sector.
Privatisation has attracted a large part of the Dollars 4bn foreign equity
investment commitments to date and has been instrumental in achieving
significant structural changes in the Polish economy towards an
export-competitive, market-based system. Privatisation is also contributing
substantial sums to the Polish treasury, expected to reach Dollars 580m in
1993 alone.
Public perceptions of the pace of privatisation have been clouded so far by
political delays to the introduction of the mass privatisation programme
(mpp) and the time consuming nature of 'sectoral privatisation'. The latter
has involved detailed studies of 36 industrial sectors, comparisons with
similar industries in established market economies, and the setting up of
competitive bidding procedures for potential foreign investors.
In April, parliament with tacit left wing support, approved the long-delayed
mpp in an amended form. This gave pensioners and public sector employees
extra shares in 200 of the 600 state or municipally owned enterprises whose
ownership and management is to be transferred to 20 National Investment
Funds.
Shares in the NIFs, tradeable over the counter to start with and
subsequently to be quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, will be distributed
to the population for a small registration fee equivalent to Dollars 20, or
10 per cent of an average month's salary.
The original timetable for implementing the mpp called for the appointment
of fund managers by a state selection committee to be set up by the prime
minister this summer. In spite of the dissolution of parliament the
timetable will be adhered to, although the five MPs who were to be part of
the 19 person committee will not now be appointed until after the
mid-September election.
By October-November the committee, which includes two trade union
representatives and 12 experts chosen by the government in addition to the
five late-joining MPs, is scheduled to choose from the growing list of
foreign and domestic fund managers who have expressed an interest in
managing the new funds.
A call for tenders will be sent to the management companies in July. Fund
managers will receive an annual fee, topped up by performance-related
bonuses and share options at the end of the envisaged 10-year initial life
of the funds. New Year's day, 1994, has been set as the launch date for the
new funds, with the issue of share certificates to start in the first
quarter. Poles will then have six months to register and claim their
certificates.
The strategic, 10-year, management functions to be assumed by the 20 new
NIFs is what most clearly distinguishes the Polish mpp from its closest
equivalent, the Czech mpp. In the Czech case the investment funds appeared
spontaneously following the launch of the mpp and were not part of the
government's programme. The then Czechoslovak government simply arranged for
the privatisation of 1,300 state enterprises and issued books of vouchers
which could be used to bid for shares in the chosen enterprises.
In practice most Czech and Slovak voucher holders, unaware of the identity
or potential value of participating enterprises, delegated this choice to
the private funds which were mainly created by state-owned banks lacking
proven fund management skills or experience.
The Polish mpp, however, hangs on the quality and skills of the
still-to-be-appointed fund managers whose task will be to convert the
enterprises in their portfolios into profitable investments.
Mr Lewandowski has long argued that this is most likely to happen if
experienced foreign fund managers, backed by management consultants and able
to hire managerial talent, are invited to run or assist the funds.
Significantly this view is shared by the major left wing groups in
parliament, including the former communists. Opposition comes mainly from
the xenophobic confederation for an Independent poland (KPN) and the various
catholic nationalist and smaller peasant parties and could well become an
issue in the election campaign.
Another irritant in the smooth implementation of the mpp is President
Walesa, who, having promised Poles that privatisation would make them
Dollars 10,000 richer during his own presidential election campaign in 1990,
keeps re-surfacing with his own mpp proposals. The plans involve bank loans
and charges on the budget way beyond the capacity of both sources to
satisfy. 'Whatever I can do will be below Polish expectations,' Mr
Lewandowski shrugs in mock despair.
But the average Polish worker employed by a state enterprise should gain
through the mpp or other forms of privatisation.
Enterprises privatised by a smorgasbord of different variants have to set
aside up to 20 per cent of their shares, or a smaller proportion linked to
the average wage, to workers in the enterprise. Up to 10 per cent of these
shares are given to the workers and a further 10 per cent can be bought at a
50 per cent discount.
Under the terms of the Enterprise Pact recently signed between the
government, trade unions and enterprises, representatives of the workers
also sit on the supervisory boards of privatised companies. The sting in the
tail, however, is that privatisation abolishes workers' councils. This means
an end to the cosy alliance between workers and state enterprise managers -
the last vestige of old style proletarianism.
The enterprise pact, which requires management and workers to submit their
own privatisation proposals within six months, is crucial for the smooth
privatisation of the heavy industrial sector and big labour or capital
intensive enterprises. The sectoral privatisation, under which consultants
working for the government have prepared 36 sectors of the economy for sale,
is also expected to take off in coming months.
The first sectors to be privatised in this way include the detergents, soap
and toiletries industry, industrial gases, and cables, in which management
consultants Bain and Co, bankers Samuel Montagu and auditors Coopers &amp;
Lybrand were involved, and the Pulp and Paper industry, where the government
was advised by Hambros bank.
Sectoral privatisation has also attracted the attention of the
multinationals. Procter and Gamble, Unilever, Henkel and Benckiser, for
example, all bought detergent plants, while International Paper corporation
kicked off paper sector privatisation by paying Dollars 120m for the Kwidzyn
paper plant.
All pledged to spend heavily on modernisation and expansion.
All these deals, and others including the chemical industry,
telecommunications and other strategic sectors, involve substantial
investment pledges and employment guarantees, which tend to be decisive
factors in choosing between competitive tenders from foreign companies.
But, with more than 6,000 state enterprises still to be privatised, large
scope remains for traditional Polish state enterprises to be taken over by
management or management-worker buy-outs.
Turning these enterprises round remains the real challenge facing both
sectoral privatisation and the mass privatisation programme.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (7): Campaigning for culture vultures - The
tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVIA SNAIJE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Easter rolls around each year and the holiday rush to the south begins,
Ticino is one of the first stops on Northern Europeans' itineraries.
Visitors bring out their linen suits, sit at outdoor cafes and immediately
feel Latin. Because it is blessed with a Mediterranean micro-climate, and
its culture is firmly rooted in Lombardy, the Canton has been able to market
its decidedly non-Swiss features with success.
Today, tourism makes up 25 per cent of the gross cantonal product, bringing
in about SFr1.5bn a year and employing 15,000 people or 4 per cent of
Ticino's population.
Ticino became a tourist destination in the late 19th century when the
Gotthard Pass railway was opened. Prior to that, the area was frequented for
the most part by Italians who spent a few weeks in Ticino during the summer
and again in the winter to get away from the Milanese fog. In the 1930s, the
Swiss travel agency Hotelplan organised tours to Ticino and then, after the
Second World War, British and Americans became acquainted with the canton
through their soldiers who were sent on holiday to various regions of
Switzerland.
Whereas the international jet set flocked to the Ticino lakes in the
sixties, the seventies saw the advent of mass tourism and the small Canton
found itself unprepared to deal with the influx. It is still battling with
the results of the tourist boom which lasted well into the eighties: traffic
jams, lack of parking space and a certain loss of identity. The local
population, eager to take part in the flourishing industry, quickly sold off
large tracts of land at low prices, and readily spoke German to visitors.
The regional tourist offices decided to change their strategy in the early
eighties when they felt that not only had the area reached saturation point
but also that German was rapidly becoming a second language. According to Mr
Eugenio Foglia, the Ticino tourist board's director, a campaign to promote
'intelligent tourism' was launched, encouraging travellers to become more
sensitive to the identity of the area by visiting local museums and
participating in cultural events.
The tourist board, seeking to distance itself from mass tourism and to
attract a more culturally and ecologically-minded visitor, has made
concerted efforts to increase cultural events which incorporate the area's
Italian identity, evident in its architecture, music, gastronomy and art.
The canton's calendar of events has been flooded with music festivals and
art exhibitions. Also new to the programme are special interest excursions
such as a tour of modern architecture in the region (the star of Ticino's
contemporary architecture movement is Mario Botta), and other tours which
target nature lovers and include cycling and hiking trails.
While early figures for the cultural campaign indicate positive results,
Ticino is battling the recession. Last year the canton had a difficult time
filling its 20,000 beds - overnight stays had dropped more than 8 per cent,
with medium and modest category hotels suffering most. In fact, results for
the 1992 season in Ticino were worse than for the rest of Switzerland.
This, says Mr Foglia, can be explained by Ticino's dependence on
Swiss-German and German clientele - more than half of its tourists are
Swiss-German and Germans make up more than 50 per cent of the total number
of foreign visitors.
Both groups reacted to the economic downturn by cutting back drastically on
holidays, resulting in a 13.7 per cent drop in the number of Swiss visitors
to Ticino compared to a 6 per cent fall for the rest of Switzerland and a
drop of 4.6 per cent in foreign tourists compared to a slight increase in
travellers from abroad to other Swiss Cantons.
British and Americans were primarily responsible for this rise in other
parts of Switzerland and it is precisely this clientele that Mr Foglia and
his office hope to attract. Although Ticino did see a return of British and
Americans last year following their absence during the Gulf War period,
according to Mr Foglia the numbers are insufficient to compensate for the
loss of the Germans and Swiss-Germans.
Mr Foglia, whose tenure as head of the world tourist board began just when
the recession hit Switzerland, has been relentlessly promoting Ticino at
travel industry gatherings, hosting journalists and travel agents and
orchestrating mass mailings of brochures which, while extolling the area's
mild climate and lush vegetation, focus on Ticino as a cultural centre as
well as a resort.
Retaining as clients the long-faithful sun-worshippers while attracting a
new crowd of museum-goers will entail a delicate balancing act but Ticino
has the advantage of already being divided into two distinct regions which
can handle the different exigencies of travellers.
The Sottoceneri is the southernmost tip of the Canton, situated around Lake
Lugano. Over the years, Lugano has developed into an urban centre and now
attracts more of a business crowd with weekend visitors and day trippers
from Italy.
Lugano is the site of many of Ticino's museums, including Baron Heinrich
Thyssen-Bornemisza's Villa Favorita. Classical music, jazz and world music
festivals also take place in the town.
Some 67 per cent of overnight stays are by foreign visitors whereas in the
Sopraceneri region, which encompasses Locarno and the villages around Lake
Maggiore, Swiss tourists constitute 65 per cent of overnight stays and the
average length of time spent there is longer than around Lugano. Mainly a
resort area, Sopraceneri's attraction is the vast Lake Maggiore and its
beaches and surrounding valleys, rivers and streams.
Because the tourist industry is an essential contributor to Ticino's
revenue, the board receives a great deal of support from the canton
government to upgrade the quality of tourism. Enormous sums have been
invested in projects for new roads, tunnels and pedestrian zones to mitigate
heavy traffic during the tourist season, while much effort has gone into
encouraging visitors to use public transport by offering special regional
passes.
Ticino, still reeling from the effects of the recession on the 1992 season,
is banking on diversifying the nationalities of its clientele and targeting
a higher income group, thus extending overnight stays. And Mr Foglia
believes a cardinal lesson was learned from the tourist boom of the
seventies and eighties: so as to maintain a harmonious balance between
guests and hosts the tourists should not outnumber the local population.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (8): Business-oriented - A visitor's guide
to Lugano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVIA SNAIJE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUGANO, like all Swiss cities, exudes a feeling of wealth and luxury and is
clearly a business-oriented town: lively during the day and quiet at night.
It is built around an alluring lakeside with a long, palm-shaded promenade.
The old town centre features a large pedestrian precinct with shops galore
and a visual feast of Italianate arcaded buildings.
Getting there
Agno airport is typically efficient and only 10km from the centre of Lugano.
But there is no rail connection and taxis cost about SFr60. For those coming
from the north, the rail journey from Zurich, winding through the Alps, is
well worth the three hours it takes.
For departures from Agno, look carefully at your booking. Lugano is one of
the places from which a 'direct' flight is seldom a non-stop one. Most
northward flights make a stop in Zurich or Geneva.
Getting around
Lugano makes life difficult for the motorist. Unless a car is absolutely
essential, it is always better to get around in taxis, buses and on foot. On
the other hand, if you have to travel outside of Lugano, a car is essential.
Roads are excellent and directions clearly signposted. Rush hours are
between 7:30 and 8:30 in the morning and between 5:00 and 6:30 in the
afternoon and are particularly fierce near borders because of the heavy
traffic of day workers from Italy.
Hotels
The Grand Hotel Eden in Lugano's Paradiso section is popular with
businessmen. It is divided into two sections and the one on the lakefront is
quieter and offers a better view. The hotel is modern, with all facilities,
but has no memorable personality. (Tel 091-55-01-21)
The Splendide Royal sits splendidly above the lakeside road looking over the
lake and is a little closer to the centre of town than the Eden. An
aristocratic villa transformed into a hotel in 1888, its salons are
furnished with antiques and 19th century paintings. Lake view rooms are a
bit noisy during the summer. Otherwise, this is a fine hotel that has had
the same manager for 15 years. (Tel 091-54-20-01)
The Principe Leopoldo is a beautifully-restored neo-classical villa with 24
suites, a garden around the pool, a winter garden and conference space. Its
disadvantage is that it is somewhat inconveniently located on the outskirts
of the city, making it necessary to drive or take a taxi. It is part of the
Relais &amp; Chateaux chain. (Tel 091-55-88-55)
The Villa Castagnola au Lac is in a restored 19th century villa slightly
outside the centre of town and has a beautiful park, swimming pool and
tennis courts. It is set well set back from the busy main road and is on a
well-served bus route to the centre. (Tel 091-51-22-13)
Among four-star hotels, the Lugano Dante (Tel 091-22-95-61) and the Admiral
(Tel 091-54-23-24) appeal to a business clientele and are conveniently
located.
Restaurants
Most of the better restaurants are a little bit outside of Lugano.
Ristorante Bianchi, founded in 1803 and newly restored is close to the
Lugano Dante Hotel. International-nouvelle cuisine. Good wine list.
Al Portone is a refined, city-style restaurant with international cuisine,
large choice of cheeses and desserts.
Parco Saroli is in the Banc del Gottardo building created by architect Mario
Botta. At noon, it is very crowded but is a pleasant place to meet for
business lunches. The cuisine is local northern Italian-international.
Motto del Gallo is in the Taverne-Toricella. You need a car or must take a
taxi to get there but it is well worth it. High class restaurant in a rustic
setting. Local and northern Italian cuisine. Garden seating in the summer.
The restaurant in the Principe Leopoldo hotel is very chic for the occasion
when someone has to be impressed. Lovely setting and international cuisine.
Tips for time off
Take a boat ride round the lake. There are stops in Paradiso and in the
centre of Lugano, and boats leave frequently for Ponte Tresa (about 1 1/2
hours), Campione (20 minutes) and Gandria (half an hour) on the Italian
border.
Play the tables at Campione, an exclave of Italy on the east side of the
Lake of Lugano, or just soak up the real Italian night life atmosphere there
after Lugano goes to sleep.
Visit various museums, among which the Museo Cantonale in central Lugano,
the Villa Malpensata on the way to Paradiso and the Villa Favorita (which
now houses Baron Thyssen Bornemisza's 19th and 20th century collection of
European and American art) in Castagnola, are the most notable. The Villa
Favorita has just been reopened after extensive renovation. It is open from
10am to 5pm, Tuesdays to Sundays. Rent a car and take a modern architecture
tour of the region. The Ticino Tourist office publishes a brochure outlining
such tours. Local architects Mario Botta, Aurelio Galfetti, Luigi Snozzi and
others have made big contributions to modern architecture.
Visit the medieval castles in Bellinzona where members of the Sforza and
Visconti families once ruled. Castelgrande, the largest of the three, was
recently restored by Aurelio Galfetti. The restaurant Castelgrande within
the castle is worth a visit too.
Visitors in August can take in the Locarno Film Festival. Its emphasis is on
films from the Third World and by new directors. Outdoor screenings are held
in Locarno's main square. Go by train. Traffic jams on the main road to the
city, bad at the best of times, become monumental during the festival.
Go hiking. There are dozens of hilly trails within easy reach of the city,
and the Lugano tourist office publishes an excellent 1:50,000 map
illustrating them. For more leisurely walks and spectacular views over
southern Ticino, take a funicular from Paradiso to the top of San Salvatore
(900 metres) or another one from Cassarate to Monte Bre.
For music lovers, the highlight is the spring concert season, with
orchestral concerts in the Palazzo dei Congressi conference centre from late
March until early June. In July and August, the city offers frequent baroque
concerts in parks, churches and historical buildings. There is a brief opera
season from July 6-10 and an international festival of organ music in
Magadino throughout July.
The New Orleans Music Festival runs from June 25 to July 4 in Ascona and
modern jazz is highlighted in Lugano's Estival Jazz 1993 from July 1-3.
How to spend it
Luxury goods are available in profusion in Lugano. A more original purchase
would be a local Merlot wine at the Bottega del Vino Gabbani in Via Pessina.
Among the best labels are Tenuta Montalbano, Merlot Tre Terre, La Brenta
Riserva Speciale and Merlot dei Castelli di Bellinzona.

<TEXT>
A remarkable industrial transformation lies behind the wide choice of
washing powders, shampoos and personal care products now offered to Polish
consumers, writes Anthony Robinson. Four years ago the market was dominated
by the products of nine Polish detergent companies whose small,
old-fashioned factories turned out indifferent products with little R and D
and almost no marketing skills. They were sitting ducks for the big four
international groups which dominate the world market: Procter and Gamble,
Unilever, Henkel and Benckiser.
Rather than see the local companies annihilated by competition, the Polish
government decided to follow the advice of its consultants, Bain and Co. It
solicited competitive bids from the big four to take over the so-called
Pollena companies and invest heavily in bringing them up to international
standards: the first successful implementation of the government's sectoral
privatisation strategy.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (7): Ambition's arrow flies east / Profile
of Thomson Polkolor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Marek Sabela, the human resources manager of Thomson Polkolor, draws an
arrow eastwards across a map of Poland as he illustrates the ambitions of
his company. 'We are not only here to become a less expensive producer. We
are also here because the market is here, especially to the east,' he says.
His comment reflects the optimism which has developed since the French
electronics and electrical manufacturer acquired majority control of
Polkolor, the bankrupt state-owned producer of tubes for colour televisions.
Much of the French group's efforts, since it paid Dollars 35m for a 51 per
cent stake in Polkolor in August 1991, have been concentrated on a total
overhaul of manufacturing and staff and management practices.
But Thomson's commitment to increase the investment to Dollars 100m is
evidence of the group's longer-term plans. The remaining shares were
acquired by three state-owned banks which had sizeable loans to Polkolor at
the time of its collapse.
The venture is Thomson's only fully integrated television tube manufacturing
operation in Europe, combining glass and electrical components production
with assembly and distribution. Its bigger Italian assembly plant, in
contrast, draws in components from all over Europe.
Production from the plant on the outskirts of Warsaw has allowed Thomson to
narrow its output gap with Philips, the leading European manufacturer.
Nokia, the Finnish group, trails Thomson, while Samsung of South Korea has
increased competition through its venture in Berlin with a former
state-owned group.
When Polish government approval for the deal went through two years ago,
production was running at 600,000 units a year. An industry rule of thumb is
that production must reach 1.2m to achieve a profit break-even.
Mr Stanley Urban, Thomson's chief financial officer, is quoted as saying
that the plant was a 'wreck' at the time of the takeover. By modernising
production and management methods and without altering the product range,
output was raised to an annual rate of 1m within months of the takeover.
This process has continued, and a 13-inch tube has been added to the range.
An annualised production rate of between 1.5m and 1.8m has been targeted for
1993. Output is forecast to grow to 2.4m by the end of next year - and could
reach 3m, depending on the product range mix.
A steep rise in quality standards has been an important factor behind a rise
in productivity. While Polkolor was in its death throes the reject rate was
running at 20 per cent. This has been slashed to 0.8 per cent through
employee training schemes and modernised production techniques.
At present between 65 and 70 per cent of annual production goes to western
Europe, with Thomson the biggest buyer through its domestic appliance arm.
Domestic demand accounts for the rest and about 5 per cent goes to eastern
Europe.
Siting of the plant in Poland, with its comparatively low wage base, gives
Thomson a highly competitive pricing structure in its western European
markets.
Tubes are by far the most costly component, contributing about 30 per cent
to the total price of a television set. The plant is expected to move into
profits by the end of next year, but in the meantime the investment has been
justified by the cost advantages it has provided to its parent.
Mr Sabela believes a 50/50 split between western and eastern Europe is
achieveable, but he is cautious about timing. 'We have no doubt that the
demand is there. The problem for the moment is how places like Russia and
the Ukraine are going to pay,' he says. Thomson Polkolor recently received
from the Ukraine an expression of interest in buying 1m tubes a year.
Central to the re-organisation was a cut in the 4,500 workforce. To achieve
this, 1,000 employees were laid off with a year's salary, while those
retained were given a 37 per cent wage rise. The company forecasts that
3,800 employees will be on the payroll by the end of the year, receiving
salaries 50 per cent above the national average. In addition to salary
rises, Thomson instituted retraining schemes as a means of reviving
good-will and morale.
Mr Sabela, who returned to Poland after working in France for 10 years, says
that there is now an open mindedness and desire to contribute often not
found in western European companies.
'At the start there were big problems,' he says. 'We spent a year just
talking about wages. Now they are coming to me and talking about the job and
this is a big achievement.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (9): A base in the light fittings market /
Review of the return of Philips after 43 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics and electrical group, was one of the foreign
companies which seized the chance to return to Poland when the communist
regime collapsed.
Ending a 43-year break in close relations with Poland, forced by the
nationalisation of the company's operations in 1948, the Dutch group
established its base in the former eastern bloc in mid-1991. The re-entry
came through the purchase of a majority interest in Polam-Pila, a lighting
equipment manufacturer which, like so much of Polish industry, was
floundering for survival at the time of privatisation.
Philips paid Dollars 16m for a 51 per cent stake in the plant at Pila, 320km
north-west of Warsaw, and was granted a further 15.6 per cent interest worth
Dollars 5m in return for raising the plant and its surrounding area to EC
environmental standards. The stake was subsequently boosted to 87 per cent
by the purchase of a 20 per cent slice from employees.
These shares were sold to employees by the state at half the price paid by
Philips. The remaining shares are in the hands of the state treasury.
Philips also won a three-year tax holiday on profits - this runs until
midway through next year - and the right to have a 15 per cent duty waived
on imported machinery and equipment worth up to Fl37m and delivered in
Poland by the end of the year.
The transfer of ownership has bot been without difficulty. The terms were
criticised as being too generous and a short industrial dispute followed the
decision of the Dutch company to freeze wages against employees'
expectations and contrary to the example of several other foreign groups
which entered Poland at the same time.
But with this phase behind it the plant has become Philips's base for
eastern European expansion in the light fittings market. Its proximity to
the former Soviet Union and the associations established there in the
previous two decades are expected to offer it an especially high potential
across eastern frontier.
Mr Stanislaw Kozlowski, the president of the Polish company says that 'the
Russian market is our destiny.' At present 58 per cent of sales are to
export markets. Of this total the US and the UK buy a combined 48 per cent
with the former Soviet Union ranking down the list with other European and
Arab countries. Incandescent lamp fittings, its main product, scores a
significantly higher proportion of export sales than fluorescent fittings
and luminaries.
The Dutch company said earlier this year that its overall Polish operations
returned a net profit of Z75.4bn (Dollars 4.8m)in 1992. The result comes
from sales of Z777.5bn, of which Z647.2bn was generated by the Pila plant.
The plant in Pila was the biggest state-owned producers of lighting
equipment at the time of the takeover but inefficient production and a
mountain of debt had driven it to the wall.
Throughout the last two decades its state-designated function was as a
generator of foreign currency through exports. Heavy local bank loans were
ploughed in to sustain production, with little likelihood of their repayment
after servicing charges. The debt has been reduced dramatically since the
takeover, but interest payments remain a drain on the company.
In order to reach into the international markets during the 1970s and 1980s,
Polam Pila sought to establish ties with world indsutry leaders for the
purchase of equipment and advice. But these overtures were repeatedly
rejected, partly because of a concern that the technology might be passed on
to third parties, especially the then Soviet Union.
Desperate for a much-needed new glass plant, the Poles were forced to turn
to Toshiba of Japan, which completed a Dollars 25m project in 1984. The
Toshiba plant reached contractual standards, but has been virtually scrapped
and replaced with Philips equipment since the takeover, in an important part
of the plan to elevate production efficiency. Mr Kozlowski says that this
decision demonstrates the importance of becoming a part of one of the
world's industry leaders and so share in the latest technology.
Philips's historic ties in Poland, coupled with informal links in the two
previous decades, made the Dutch group a natural potential buyer as the
market in the former eastern bloc became split among the world's leaders.
Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens, is negotiating the purchase of Tesla in what
was formerly Czechoslovakia; and GE bought Tungsram in Hungry. Mr Kozlowski
says that the much bigger GE deal, which has run into significant problems,
has been instructive.
Philips, unlike GE, has not attempted a big, immediate about-face in
management and production techniques; where possible, local management has
been retained - to a point where foreigners have only a token presence in
specialist areas.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (6): Uncertainty inhibits inflow of capital
 -Ray Bashford and Anthony Robinson find that foreign investors are
hesitating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY BASHFORD and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOW flow of foreign capital into Poland remains one of the biggest
obstacles to long-term growth. While there have been notable successes in
the automotive, telecommunications and paper industries, a hesitancy remains
among foreign investors which is inhibiting an acceleration in industrial
development.
Listed, the reasons for investment in Poland are impressive. It has a
population of 40m people, relatively low wages, a motivated and well
educated workforce, good transport connections and historic ties with
potentially large markets to the east. Yet the overhang of political
uncertainty, a tradition of labour militancy and doubts about doing business
in a country which is still in default on large foreign debts act to negate
these advantages.
In addition, as government officials are well aware, Poland is in
competition with Hungary and the Czech republic for the attention of the
foreign investor. Hungary, for example, lacks the domestic market of Poland,
but embarked on market-type reforms much earlier while both the Hungarians
and the Czechs have greater access to international capital markets. The
Czech republic has the added advantage of being relatively unencumbered by
foreign debt.
But Hungary, which received roughly 60 per cent of the estimated Dollars 7bn
equity capital invested in post-communist central Europe by the end of last
year, has itself entered a pre-electoral phase of political turbulence and
is suffering from an unexpected slowness in resuming economic growth. Czech
prospects have also been dimmed by the collapse in post-divorce trade with
Slovakia and uncertainty over the outcome of its mass privatisation
programme.
Now there are signs of a growth in foreign investor interest in Poland,
despite the uncertainty generated by last month's no-confidence vote and
elections in the autumn. Mr Ian Hume, who heads the World Bank office in
Poland, is one well placed observer who believes that Poland is experiencing
a 'mini-boom' for foreign capital after a slow start.
A businessman echoes this guarded optimism. 'You look at the telephone book
here and it's like a Who's Who of international companies,' he says. 'The
problem is that most of them have small representative offices and are still
looking at what's available and how conditions are.'
The completion of detailed comparative studies of 36 sectors of the Polish
economy prior to privatisation has shed new light on several thousand Polish
enterprises which are now open to purchase by competitive tender.
Entrepreneurs who specialise in Poland's many smaller sized industrial
companies, like Mr George Bonner of the Toronto-based UNP, enthuse about the
'hidden jewels' waiting to be burnished by an injection of capital,
management know-how, foreign patents and patience.
Meanwhile Poland is acutely aware that it is competing in a world hungry for
investment. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the minister for privatisation, says:
'These are recessionary times; we are being forced to compete not only with
Hungary and the Czech republics but also with Asia and Latin America for
foreign investment.'
Some potential investors go away empty-handed. A western banker in Warsaw
cites one US company which, after spending considerable time examining
prospects in Poland, finally decided to set up in Mexico. While noting the
difficulties, Mr Lewandowski believes, however, that there are encouraging
signs that foreign investment, either funded or committed, will reach
Dollars 10bn in three years.
With the present total standing at between Dollars 4bn-Dollars 4.5bn, he
forecasts an average annual inflow of Dollars 2bn - which is at the top end
of estimates from Polish and foreign businessmen. A feature of the figures
is the wide gap between the amount foreign companies have directly invested
in buying assets and the sums they have pledged to invest in the longer
term.
The overall picture is distorted by Fiat's decision to buy a majority stake
in FSM, the small car producer in southern Poland. The Italian group has
made a commitment to invest between Dollars 1.8m-Dollars 2bn within eight
years. The Fiat deal gives an example, too, of how, after taking on the debt
of the companies they are buying, foreign companies are putting a small
amount of money up front, compared with the total funds committed. After the
initial purchase of the plant the Italian group has given an undertaking to
invest 10 times this amount in the longer term.
This gap, which is much greater in Poland than in Hungary, is present in
most of the large deals. In part it reflects a reluctance by foreign
companies to arrange large-scale financing before testing market conditions,
as well as concern about trade relations with the EC. They would also like
to hear a stronger and clearer voice of support for foreign investment from
the government.
Another brake on inward investment is an unwillingness by western banks to
lend at normal rates to projects in Poland. The country has yet to reach
agreement with its bank creditors on a Dollars 12.1bn debt which has gone
unserviced since the autumn of 1989. But negotiations with the London Club
of bank creditors are proceeding, with the aim of achieving an overall 50
per cent write-off followed by the resumption of normal banking relations.
Foreign investment remains a contentious issues. Even those politicians who
have been pushing the reform process have been reticent to issue public
statements of strong support for foreign investment. Mr Jerzy Strzelecki,
under-secretary of state in the Ministry of privatisation, says that it is
common to hear arguments about 'selling off the family silver'. In many
cases he believes this has more to do with political rhetoric than strong
opposition.
Mr Strzelecki does not expect to see any fundamental change in the attitude
to foreign investment as a result of the forthcoming elections. But he feels
that there could be some alterations in the timetable for decisions in the
run-up to the September polls.
The remittance of profits is not a vital question, as most companies are
still concentrating on bringing funds in. Those who do have profits to move
abroad have done so with a minimum of interference from the government.
As an incentive for investment the government is willing to consider tax
concessions for projects worth over ECU 2m in areas of high unemployment, or
where modern technology is being brought in and the investment is to
concentrate on export production. Italy, through its Fiat investment, is by
far the biggest source of funds.
Excluding this deal, Italian enterprises have invested 5.4 per cent of the
total (according to government figures). US capital accounts for 18 per cent
 -with the International Paper Company purchase of the Gwydzin paper and
pulp plant raising its proportion. Germany's contribution is relatively low.
The Poles explain that this is caused by Germany's preoccupation with
eastern territories, but historic tensions have also contributed to the
reluctance. The western neighbour's total could rise significantly if it
wins the competition to buy the remaining state telephone switching gear
manufacturer.
A wait-and-see attitude continues. Investors which have made the jump report
solid process. As a western banker put it: ' People are being slow to come
to Poland but I know of no foreign company which regrets coming here.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (5): An impressive beginning - Politics /
La Lega dei Ticinesi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TICINO'S normally tranquil political life was rudely shaken up two years ago
when a totally new party, La Lega dei Ticinesi, took 12 per cent of the vote
in cantonal elections and claimed 12 of the 90 seats in the Bellinzona
legislature.
A few months later, it took 25 per cent in the elections for the federal
parliament, winning two of the canton's eight seats in the lower house of
parliament and one of its two seats in the upper house.
Last year, in communal elections, the Lega's average vote slid back to 18
per cent, but it did very well in the cities, winning enough in Lugano to
place two members on the city's five-man governing council.
It is all rather impressive for a party that did not exist three years ago
and which has no clear philosophical base.
'We are not a party of the left or the right,' says Mr Flavio Maspoli, one
of its federal parliamentarians, cheerfully. 'We are for people who have had
enough and want a change.'
It is difficult for the foreign visitor to see much need for change in this
idyllic little corner of the world, but the Lega has found fertile soil in a
number of causes.
It campaigned vigorously but in vain last year against the proposal to build
a new high-speed rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass. But it was
successful in opposing the plan for Switzerland to join the European
Economic Area (EEA).
This year, it has led the fight in Ticino against the government's plan to
buy FA-18 fighter aircraft.
The party's roots lie firmly in protest. Mr Maspoli and another party
leader, Mr Giuliano Bignasca, set up Ticino's first Sunday newspaper,
Mattino della Domenica, in 1990, with a view to making it a muckraking
paper.
Critics say that Mr Bignasca, a controversial local property tycoon, started
it because he was angry that he lost a bid for a large federal government
building contract. In any event, the paper got off to a flying start with a
campaign against irregularities in government subsidies for poor people's
health insurance premiums and quickly acquired a large following.
Critics say that the paper is popular because it is free. Lega leaders reply
that people queue up at 7am on Sunday at the distribution boxes to get one.
There is no home delivery. As Mr Maspoli, its editor, recalls, within months
letters were pouring in suggesting that he and Mr Bignasca set up a
political party.
Mr Maspoli believes that the main reason for the party's success was that
many people were fed up with the long-entrenched patronage system that
permeates Ticino politics. Until the Lega came along, the liberal Radical
and Christian Democratic parties operated a cosy system of parcelling out
jobs pro rata to their supporters at all levels.
Because of the party's name, it is a fair assumption that local nationalism
also has something to do with its appeal, but party leaders play it down.
Mr Maspoli fumes about the fact that companies based elsewhere in
Switzerland pay no taxes in Ticino on their activities in the canton.
Similarly, he complains that the canton gets virtually no benefit from the
vast amounts of electric power from Ticino power stations transmitted to
consumers north of the Alps.
Last month, its members in the cantonal legislature protested when the
governor proposed importing milk from Italy during the summer to fill a
seasonal shortfall.
Even within the canton, the Lega plays regional politics. Its strongest base
is in Lugano, where members have been able to argue that the Ticino's
largest city provides more resources to the canton than it receives. But
opponents claim that the Lega is merely an opportunistic protest movement.
'It plays on people's lowest sentiments. It is very populist, and even
xenophobic,' says Mr Dick Marty, the governor.
Mr Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo and a former governor,
concedes that the Lega has been clever so far, maintaining voter interest by
launching a string of petition campaigns for referendums on touchy local
issues.
The latest one was over the selection of incinerators. The party claimed
that the government's plan to build two was a typical compromise aimed at
keeping supporters of both traditional political parties happy whereas one
high technology plant would be adequate and would save money.
Sometimes, however, its campaigns backfire. Last summer, Mr Bignasca huffed
and puffed his opposition to new highway speed limits and threatened to hold
a demonstration on the main north-south motorway. In the end, in the face of
heavy threats from the police, he contented himself with a symbolic
demonstration on the motorway at a Lugano theme park featuring a scale model
of Switzerland.
It is a moot point whether Mr Bignasca is more an asset or a liability to
the party. He has been investigated for drug possession and is now serving a
suspended seven months sentence for failing to pay welfare contributions for
his employees.
What are the party's prospects in the future? The next indication does not
come until 1995 when new cantonal elections will be held. Mr Maspoli is full
of confidence, anticipating that one day the Lega will control the cantonal
government.
Mr Raffaelo Ceschi, an historian, is more sceptical. 'It could disappear
very quickly,' he says. 'It could be absorbed by one of the traditional
parties if they straightened themselves out.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (4): Critical Alpine passes -
Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TICINO, as every Ticinese will tell you, is first and foremost a transit
canton.
From the 13th century when the Gotthard pass was opened, the triangular
territory descending from the Nufenen, Gotthard, Lukmanier and San
Bernardino passes has been of crucial strategic importance in traffic
between northern and southern Europe.
The early Swiss confederates fought often and fiercely to gain control of
the territory, initially winning Bellinzona and later all the territory to
Lugano and Locarno.
By the early 16th century, all of Ticino was controlled by the
confederation, and the territory remained a sort of colony until 1803 when,
thanks to a Napoleonic Act of Mediation, it was transformed into a canton in
its own right.
Today, the Swiss are equally determined to control the critical north-south
Alpine passes in their territory. Last year, a majority of the people
endorsed in a national referendum the principle of building two new
high-speed rail tunnels through the Alps - one of them through the Gotthard,
the other through the Lotchberg - to improve the Simplon line.
A century ago, when the first rail tunnel was drilled through the Gotthard,
the then poor Swiss were content to lean on Italy and Germany for
substantial financial support. Today, the more prosperous Swiss insist on
paying for the tunnels themselves, even though the Italians and Germans will
be the main beneficiaries.
It is debatable how much benefit these new tunnels - or indeed the existing
ones - are to Ticino. The Ticinese themselves are inclined to be
self-critical and say that they have not profited much from the passage of
so much important business and so many important people through their
territory over the years. But there is no doubt that the canton's fortunes
were dramatically improved by the opening of the first Gotthard railway line
in 1882.
It marked the beginning of the industrialisation of the canton and - even if
that was achieved more by immigrating Swiss-Germans from the north than by
local Ticinese - it was also the beginning of a period of growing prosperity
that continues to our time.
The opening of the Gotthard road tunnel in 1980 has been a mixed blessing -
certainly improving access to the canton for motor tourists from northern
Europe, but also bringing appalling noise and emission pollution from giant
lorries that thunder through.
So what is the balance sheet of the new rail tunnel likely to look like for
Ticino? Mr Dick Marty, the canton's governor, is fairly sanguine. In the
first place, he says, it should take a lot of lorries off the motorway, thus
preventing a disaster. 'If we do nothing, by 2010 the motorway will be
unbearable,' Mr Marty says.
Why will freighters abandon the motorway? The idea is that the new tunnel,
which is to run from Arth-Goldau in the canton of Schwyz south to Bodio in
the Leventine valley, will have minimal grades and curves. That means that
trains will be able to pass through at much higher speeds than can now be
achieved either on the conventional railway, with its corkscrew and hairpin
turns, or on the motorway.
The journey from Basle to Lugano, for example, should take 1 1/2 hours
compared with more than three hours on existing infrastructure. Experts
believe that, provided the tariffs are right, that will be irresistible to
truckers.
The other benefit Mr Marty cites is to tourism. According to a recent study,
nearly two thirds of those who cross the Gotthard either originate or end
their journeys in Ticino. With the new tunnel, people will be able to get to
the canton much more quickly.
Mr Remigio Ratti, director of the canton's Istituto di ricerche Economiche
and a transport economics specialist, is less optimistic. Indeed, he argues
that if the project proceeds as planned, it will have a negative effect on
Ticino.
'It will make Lugano into a suburb of Zurich,' he claims. The problem is
that the Swiss, rather like the British with the channel tunnel, have not
made any plans for what will happen to the new rail lines once they get to
Lugano.
Mr Ratti says that unless provisions are made for efficient connections to
other Ticino cities and, more importantly, to Milan, then the most
significant effect of the project will be to facilitate passenger travel
between Lugano and points north of the Alps.
Mr Ratti has joined with a number of local engineers led by Mr Aurelio
Galfetti, the architect, in preparing a plan aimed at meeting these regional
needs. The group presented it earlier this year to government and Swiss
railway officials in Bern, but got a rather chilly response.
The government sold the whole project to the people last year with the
promise that it would cost SFr14bn, already a numbing amount of money. But
since then, the engineers have sharpened their pencils and the general view
is that the cost will be at least double the advertised sum.
A few weeks ago, the federal finance minister suggested that only one of the
two proposed new trans-Alpine lines be built, an idea that sent shudders
through Ticino. They fear that if one is cancelled, it will be the Gotthard
line because it is the more expensive one.
'We are a bit worried,' Mr Marty admits. 'We are the victims of our own
Swiss perfectionism,' he suggests. 'We need more courage and fewer
accountants. Yes, this project is expensive, but it will set the living
conditions here for the next 100 years, just like the last rail tunnel did.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (6): Aiming at worldwide markets / Profile
of SMB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW Ticino companies are known beyond the borders of the canton, let alone
the borders of Switzerland.
But mention the name Schmiedemeccanica and suddenly the lights go on in
chancelleries throughout the world.
Schmiedemeccanica, a small, high-precision forging shop tucked away in
Biasca where Val Blenio joins the Leventine valley, achieved wide notoriety
in August 1990 when it was one of the first companies accused of supplying
goods for Iraq's nuclear programme.
The family-controlled company, which has since changed its name to SMB, is
still trying to recover from the catastrophe.
As Mr Gianni Martinelli, president, explains, the company received an order
in early 1990 from a Middle East trading company with which it had done
business before for four batches of 250 rough gear forgings worth some
SFr42,000.
Mr Martinelli says that the company had always been very careful about
orders for sensitive components and sought guidance from the Swiss
government if it was in doubt about a foreign purchaser.
'But this was just a rough stamping. Any shop in the world could do it,' he
says. 'You would never have thought they were for a uranium enrichment
plant, especially in that volume.'
However, the parts were intercepted at Frankfurt airport and the company was
charged, along with others, with illegal exports to Iraq.
Swiss investigators descended on Biasca the next day, but within minutes
they realised there was no case. 'They saw immediately that we were
innocent, but we had to wait 11 months for every other case to be
investigated before they officially announced the results,' Mr Martinelli
recalls.
The publicity surrounding the case caused SMB considerable damage. Since
peaking in 1989 at roughly SFr30m, the company's turnover has halved and he
attributes more of the fall to the bad publicity surrounding the Iraq sale
than to the recession in manufacturing industry.
SMB - the name change was in the works before the Iraq incident, Mr
Martinelli says, in an attempt to distance the company from its rough
forging image - is one of the few outstanding exceptions to the general
truth that Ticino has no industrial history.
The company was formed more than 100 years ago at Faido in the upper
Leventine valley to provide metal parts and tools for the great Gotthard
railway tunnel project. For a long time, its main business was
railway-related, and it still makes components for Swiss locomotives. But Mr
Martinelli doubts that it will be competitive for supplying items for the
new rail tunnels that are to be drilled through the Gotthard in the next few
years.
Because of high Swiss labour costs and the strong Swiss franc, the company
has had to move into ever-higher precision and higher-value products to
survive.
Mr Martinelli, who holds a PhD in engineering from the UK's Aston
University, observed at close hand the shake-out in the UK forgings sector
in the late 1970s. He then went to the US to do metallurgical research, but
before long he could see the shake-out also hitting the family company. He
returned reluctantly from the US in 1980 and rescued the company with a
combination of better management, new investment and a search for new
markets.
SMB's main products today are artificial human joints, precision-forged from
titanium-based super-alloys. The company only got into this business five
years ago, and sales of joints now account for about one third of the total.
The rest comes from highly-stressed steel forgings for textile machines,
trucks, aircraft and oil rigs.
Mr Martinelli, who was named Switzerland's entrepreneur of the year in 1985,
suspects he must now engineer another revolution to preserve the company.
Recent currency devaluations have hurt SMB's competitiveness in Italy, the
UK, Sweden and Norway. Low-cost suppliers from eastern Europe are making
significant inroads in all European markets, especially in Germany, and Mr
Martinelli makes clear that there is no quality gap; many east European
forging shops were formerly suppliers to the Soviet military and space
programmes, he points out.
He is confident that the medical prosthesis business will continue to
prosper. Precision forgings have proven superior to machined castings in
avoiding stimulating the body's rejection processes, and SMB is one of only
a very few companies in the world capable of making these forgings.
He also believes the company should take on more development projects, that
is, working with a manufacturer to develop a sophisticated component, then
passing the production technology on to another company to make it in
volume.
He has thought of shifting the company elsewhere, but dismissed it. 'There
is no point, there is overcapacity all over the world,' he says. SMB, with
it 100-strong workforce, is also the biggest employer in Biasca, which
imposes a responsibility.
SMB is the kind of manufacturing company that Ticino authorities want to see
develop in the canton. They share Mr Martinelli's unease that the cantonal
economy moved from its rural base to sophisticated services - banking and
tourism - without establishing a large manufacturing base.
SMB, and other companies like it, even though small, are building businesses
from a higher technology base and aiming at markets all over the world.
Their success is vital if the canton is to maintain any industrial base.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (5): Cell phone at the ready / Profile of
Aleksander Kwasniewski of the Social Democratic party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years ago Aleksander Kwasniewski was a top communist party aide, deeply
involved in the so-called 'round table' negotiations between Poland's last
communist government, led by Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, and the anti-communist
Solidarity movement.
Last month, as leader of the Social Democratic party, he was talking with
his former opponents about a possible compromise which would have kept the
government in place, thanks to his party's benevolent abstention. In the end
no compromise was possible. But the fact that the talks took place indicate
how far the former communists have regained a degree of political
respectability.
This is partly a tribute to the political skills of Mr Kwasniewski, whose
party dominates the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) of former communists.
Almost indistinguishable from Poland's emerging business management class,
Mr Kwasniewski, with his double breasted suits, natty ties and cellular
telephone, has gained a reputation as one of the most able and far-sighted
of the younger generation of Polish politicians.
The alliance which he leads developed, by default, into the largest
parliamentary group in the recently dissolved parliament. This followed the
defection earlier this year of a dozen MPs from the Democratic Union, the
largest party of the former Solidarity coalition parties to emerge from
general elections in October 1991. The defectors, led by Mr Alexander Hall,
set up their own Polish Convention party.
Oddly, the re-emergence of former communists as the biggest group in the
outgoing parliament attracted less attention than the SLD's earlier
decision, in May, to support the Suchocka government's mass privatisation
programme (MPP), albeit after the government had incorporated, at the SLD's
demand,amendments in favour of state employees and pensioners.
Significantly, the SLD supported the principle of giving an important role
in the MPP to foreign-run investment funds - a crucial part of the MPP,
which was opposed by catholic nationalist members of the coalition
government itself. The votes of Left Alliance deputies helped Mr Janusz
Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, defeat a right wing and solidarity
union no-confidence vote which saved both the MPP and the government.
'The privatisation vote carried a high risk for our party. It was not easy
to explain to our electorate why we were supporting the government while the
Solidarity trade unions and the Christian nationalists were opposing their
own government,' Mr Kwasniewski admits.
But it was a decision which gave credibility to the social democratic
credentials of the party in the business community and brought closer the
time when the party could be legitimately considered as a potential member
of a future left of centre coalition government.
The SLD is again expected to perform strongly at the elections in September,
capitalising on the votes of former communists and those who feel poorer for
the loss of the low level social security of the communist years.
The political rehabilitation of former communists has not gone so far as
neighbouring Lithuania, where the party led by Mr Algirdas Brazauskas won
the recent elections. But developments in Poland are similar to those in
Slovakia, where the Democratic Left led by Mr Peter Weiss is preparing
itself for a future government coalition role, and in Hungary, where the
reform communists led by Mr Gulya Horn are also benefiting from the low
popularity of the right wing coalition government. The SLD, Mr Kwasniewski
adds, has close links with all these parties, and with reform communists in
Italy.
Helping to rally former communist voters, including many unemployed and
unskilled blue collar and office workers, behind the revised mass
privatisation programme is part of a long term strategy. There may be many
among his voters nostalgic for a simpler, more comfortable past, but Mr
Kwasniewski is not among them. He opposed the idea of holding new elections
under the old electoral proportional electoral system.
'Poland needs a stable government, and that would not have emerged from
early elections under the old rules,' he said shortly before President
Walesa agreed to sign the law which will eliminate smaller parties from
parliament.
Mr Kwasniewski argues that the rightward shift of the former communists is
matched by a leftward shift in the attitudes of right wing parties such as
the liberal democrats led by Mr Jan Krzyzstof Bielecki. 'The liberals no
longer believe in Adam Smith's invisible hand. They too recognise that we
need a compromise between the market and people's social needs. So maybe we
are both moving towards collaboration in a future government,' Mr
Kwasniewski said, looking ahead to the inter-party negotiations which will
follow the elections.
Memories are probably too long for such an 'historic compromise' to take
place soon after the September elections. But even the idea of such a
centre-left coalition would have been unthinkable four years ago  -
underlining the fluid nature of Poland's post-communist politics.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (4): Voters look for new faces to support -
Christopher Bobinski considers the shifting political alliances in the
run-up to September's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
POLAND faces 10 weeks of frenetic electioneering and pre-election
alliance-forming among a plethora of small parties in the run-up to general
elections on September 19.
However, President Lech Walesa's decision to dissolve parliament last month,
after opposition deputies passed a vote of no confidence in the the
six-party coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, was generally well received by
the electorate. Poles had increasingly come to see the two chambers of
parliament - the 460 seat lower house, or Sejm, which legislates and
appoints governments, and the 100 seat senate - as little more than
self-centred talking shops, unwilling or unable to address their day-to-day
concerns, which centre on the prospect of further job losses, a continuing
low wage regime and uncertainty about the future of the education, health
and welfare safety net put in place by the communists, now unravelling at a
pace which seems frightening to many.
The popular mood suggests that voters, irritated by politicians whom they
feel have lost touch with the grass roots, will be looking for new faces to
support this autumn. And for the moment it appears that President Walesa is
thinking of providing such candidates.
Already he and his aides have begun to talk of a new movement for reform. 'A
kind of non-party movement for reform has to established which would act as
a counterweight to other forces,' Mr Walesa said after mass one Sunday
earlier this month on the steps of St Brigid's Church in Gdansk.
The site - a Solidarity shrine, which the president had shunned lately  -
was deliberately chosen. It had been the place from whence, in the final
years of communist rule, Mr Walesa had led and encouraged his supporters in
the old anti-communist Solidarity movement.
'Nominate people whom neither you or I will be ashamed of, and I'll have my
photograph taken with them,' he said, seeking to capture the mood of those
days with a reference to Solidarity's posters in the 1989 election (Poland's
first free ballot.)
'There is a chance to reverse everything that was bad over the past four
years. Choose deputies who see the poverty of the pensioners and the
activities of the gangsters and I will work with them,' he told the crowd -
with a populist spin which, as he knows, any successful campaign in Poland
needs.
President Walesa's move to put a strong group of loyal supporters into
parliament may work; he retains the support of that part of the electorate
which originally voted for him in the 1990 presidential election.
But it leaves the established parties, bereft of funds and stunned by the
sudden decision to dissolve parliament and call elections, with some
difficult choices. Their task is made more difficult by the new election
law, passed by the outgoing chamber at the last minute, which bars the way
into parliament to those parties which fail to get 5 per cent of the
national vote - 8 per cent for coalitions. This is likely to restrict entry
to about eight groups.
The governing coalition parties running the caretaker government decided to
stay together in the cabinet room. They are talking about running separate
campaigns, but they have agreed a 'non aggression pact' during the campaign,
to smooth governmental caretaking.
This is expected to enhance the already strong electoral appeal of Ms Hanna
Suchocka, the prime minister, and the Democratic Union (UD) party of which
she is a member.
The Democratic Union, which groups some of Solidarity's historic leaders, is
seen from abroad as 'sound' on monetary and privatisation issues. On social
policies it tends to lean to social democratic options. Until now it has
been able to rely on a solid 15 per cent of the electorate, mainly the
intelligentsia - a base which may be eroded, as teachers and doctors turn
their back on a government committed to holding public servants' pay within
strict budgetary limits. It was this issue which led to the present crisis.
The Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) a free market group and another
coalition member, is the most likely to work together with the UD during the
campaign, and afterwards to form a government.
But it will be the right wing, catholic, nationalist Christian National
Union (ZChN), the third of the main coalition partners, which will find
staying in the government and running a separate campaign the most onerous.
Outside the coalition, the parties slot into several segments. The former
Communist party, renamed the Social Democrats (SdRP) can be expected to push
its electoral support up into double digits, winning the votes of the
disillusioned as well as diehard supporters of the ancien regime.
The PSL, a farmers' party, survived the postwar years by collaborating with
the communists. It stands to do well in the countryside and small towns
where a disaffected 40 per cent lives.
Another group aiming to harvest the protest vote is the anti-communist
Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN). Its right-wing populist
rhetoric should win it seats in the next parliament.
The smaller right wing parties which, unlike the ZChN, have consistently
opposed not only the government but also President Walesa, pose one of the
larger questions.
They all charge that the ruling establishment has blocked attempts to purge
parliament and the administration of those who had formerly worked with the
communist police. Many of their supporters remain convinced that former
communists continue to run Poland, in conjunction with their erstwhile
opponents from the Solidarity movement.
'Poland - time for a change', the slogan encapsulating the programme of one
groups, the Centre Agreement, could have some appeal. But unless all these
separate parties form an electoral pact, none will transcend the electoral
barrier.
The hope is that the new election law, by limiting entry into parliament to
fewer parties, will stabilise government over the next few years and prevent
a repetition of Mr Jan Olszewski' experience. Asked, at the start of his
premiership, if his government would fall, he replied: 'It is already
falling, but very, very slowly.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (2): A haven for rich Italians - Lugano as
a financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TICINO'S main claim to fame in the post-war period has been its position as
a financial haven for rich Italians.
Lugano is the third-largest banking centre in Switzerland after Zurich and
Geneva and boasts no fewer than 56 banks operating within its confines.
Because most of the business of these banks is in private banking - that is,
managing the fortunes of rich people - there are no hard statistics about
the magnitude of the funds held. But there are some indications.
It is believed that Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), since acquiring control of
Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) last year, has overtaken Union Bank of
Switzerland as the largest bank in Ticino, with something close to SFr60bn
under management.
Credit Suisse, the third-largest, recently revealed that 18 per cent of its
funds under management in Switzerland are in Ticino branches, even though
only a tenth of its personnel is there.
No one denies that the lion's share of the funds placed in Ticino banks
comes from Italy. 'After the war, Italian industrialists did not have
confidence in their own financial system, so they came to Ticino,' says Mr
Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo, itself a post-war creation
which is now controlled by Japan's Sumitomo Bank.
Mr Generali and others do point out, however, that the Ticino banks provide
not only fund management services but also commercial banking for Italian
companies. Fiat, for example, has a large financial subsidiary based in
Lugano with assets of some SFr3bn, and many Italian companies organise
export finance through Lugano because the service is better than that
available from Italian banks.
Mr Luigi Butti, general manager of BSI, notes that the Italian banking
industry 'lost a generation of expertise' when capital export controls were
introduced in 1976. 'Certainly, they will catch up, but it will take a very
long time in the provinces.'
Managing the fortunes of rich Italian individuals has not always left Lugano
with the best image, either in Switzerland or in Italy.
Lugano bankers got a particularly bad reputation in the late 1970s and 1980s
following the prohibition of capital exports from Italy. Everyone knew that
in the subsequent years all sorts of sharp schemes were being devised in
Lugano and elsewhere to enable rich people to get their money out.
In the past two years since Italy removed exchange controls the criticism
has eased somewhat. However, as Mr Generali puts it: 'It is still not
considered exactly proper in Italy to put your money in Switzerland.'
The bad smell has re-emerged in recent months with the Tangentopoli
political scandals in Italy. UBS, in particular, has had to face a lot of
bad publicity over the tantalisingly-named 'protezione' account (that was
the password needed to gain access to it) in its Lugano branch. The account
was used for funneling pay-offs from state-owned industry to politicians.
But Lugano bankers point out that the protezione account was closed as long
ago as 1981 and that they have all become much more careful in recent years
about who they deal with. Also, Switzerland's legislation on money
laundering and dealing with criminals has become much tougher.
'I think the banks understand now that they do not have any interest in
going after questionable business,' says Mr Dick Marty, Ticino's governor
and a former chief prosecutor famous for investigating money-laundering
cases. 'In any event, there is enough good business for them to go after,'
Mr Marty says.
Indeed, by all accounts, the inflow of funds in the past few months has been
very brisk because of the political instability in Italy, and the outlook
appears good. Mr Butti sees new opportunities in Italy because so much of
the Italian government's huge deficit is almost entirely financed by
domestic bonds. Both the government and individual investors urgently need
to diversify their portfolios, he says.
Ticino bankers are aware that it is only a matter of time before Italian
banks become more competitive in fund management and other services, so they
are putting a lot of effort into training and generally improving standards.
'The system grew very quickly in the past 30 years with a readily available
market, and so the development of organisations was rather anarchic with
some important gaps in education,' says Mr Rene Chopard, director of the new
Centro di Studi Bancari (CSB).
The CSB was set up three years ago by the Ticino Association of Bankers,
which groups 23 of the banks representing 90 per cent of the employees in
the sector, with a view to providing post-secondary courses for member bank
employees.
It now offers a general four-week first year university-equivalent course in
banking and economics and a nine-week course spread over three years for
senior managers. The centre also generates research and sponsors seminars
that are open to the public.
The relatively stable structure of Ticino banking was rocked last year when
SBC moved in on BSI, turning it into the core of its group of small private
banks in Switzerland.
BSI's commercial and retail branch network north of the Alps has been shut
down; in Ticino, even though it claims officially that it will remain a
universal bank, commercial and retail business is being de-emphasised. Last
year, 430 jobs, a third of the bank's workforce, were eliminated. Mr Butti
says further reductions will take place only through natural attrition.
The remaining big question in Lugano is over the future of Banca del
Gottardo. Rumours have raged for months that Sumitomo Bank, which bought 51
per cent in 1984 for SFr212m, would like to sell. The argument is that
Sumitomo, like most Japanese banks, is in need of capital. Moreover, the
Swiss capital market is no longer as active for Japanese issuers as it used
to be.
Sumitomo has consistently denied any intention of selling Gottardo, but
bankers in Lugano suspect that this stance has a lot to do with face-saving.
A sale now would be a sign of weakness.
If Sumitomo did sell, it would present an opportunity for the Ticinese
themselves to take control of one of the top banks. At the moment, no
significant bank in the canton is locally owned. But the betting in Lugano
is that UBS will be the purchaser.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (3): Circles of fortune - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMOTERS of regional economies love to illustrate the attraction of their
territory by drawing concentric circles around it to show the size of the
regional market.
Few, however, are as lucky as those whose job it is to promote Ticino.
Within a 70km radius of Chiasso there are 6m people. Extend the radius
slightly further and the circle encompasses most of northern Italy, one of
the most productive and prosperous areas in Europe. The exercise is also
revealing, for Ticino's economy depends for its health to an extraordinary
extent on various links with Italy.
For most of the post-war period, those links have enabled the canton to
build a standard of living that the majority of Italians can only dream of.
Per capita income of SFr33,078 in 1990, while 20 per cent below the Swiss
average, is well above that in most of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries.
Some 35,000 people cross the border between Italy and Ticino every day to
work in the canton, providing about a third of the total workforce. About 10
per cent of the canton's exports go to Italy; most of the funds managed by
Ticino banks come from Italy.
Yet in the past couple of years things have turned somewhat sour as the
economic effects of the upheavals south of the border have exacerbated a
slump that was already hurting. Many Ticino companies, especially those in
the important machinery and clothing sectors, depend on Italian industry for
orders.
The Ticino economy has a curious structure; it is based mainly on finance
and tourism. Industry is relatively underdeveloped as is agriculture because
of the largely mountainous terrain.
While there are no official statistics, economists estimate that the
canton's gross domestic product is in the vicinity of SFr10bn, of which
industry accounts for roughly 20 per cent and construction another 20 per
cent. Tourism accounts for about a quarter and finance the rest, except for
a modest 2 per cent which comes from agriculture.
Until the late 19th century, Ticino was a poor rural area, dependent on
subsistance mountain agriculture. In recent decades, agriculture has
declined drastically in importance, but farmers have become more productive,
taking advantage of the semi-tropical climate to concentrate on market
gardening and to develop a pleasant, if rather expensive, line of Merlot
wines.
The canton largely missed the beginnings of the industrial revolution, being
effectively cut off from northern Switzerland where Brown Boveri and Sulzer
Brothers established a pioneering engineering industry.
But the opening of the Gotthard railway tunnel in 1882 changed things,
providing the opportunity for Ticinese artisans to work on the tunnel
project itself and later bringing entrepreneurs south of the Alps.
Development proceeded slowly until after the Second World War when both
manufacturing and the financial sector took off simultaneously.
In both cases, development owed a lot to the canton's cultural and
geographical proximity to Italy. In the case of manufacturing, the
neighbouring Italian provinces of Como and Varese provided the cheap labour
that attracted Swiss textile, clothing and metal goods producers to the
canton.
Even today, most of these companies are strung along the Italian border,
facilitating commuting for the tens of thousands of workers who come in
every day.
'Without the frontalieri, we could not have done it,' says Mr Franco
Citterio, secretary of the Association of Ticinese Industries.
Perhaps reflecting the Italian connection, most of the 500-odd industrial
companies in the canton tend to be small, employing fewer than 100 people.
It is difficult to think of a single Ticinese company that is a household
name outside of the canton.
The industrial structure is also characterised by a very high degree of
foreign ownership. Mr Citterio estimates that half of the capital invested
in industry comes from outside the canton, mainly from German Switzerland
and Italy.
In the past, the Ticinese have resented the significant Swiss-German
presence. 'In the 1930s, they installed a sort of apartheid. There were only
10,000 of them, but they were in all the top places,' says Mr Raffaello
Ceschi, a Ticino historian.
In the past, the canton maintained its prosperity in difficult times simply
by exporting its unemployment. When jobs disappeared, the authorities
removed the work permits from the Italian frontalieri. Today, partly because
of a change in Swiss laws, this is no longer so easy. Unemployment soared
from an average of 1.9 per cent in 1990 to 5.3 per cent last year, the
highest in Switzerland. At year end, there more more than 8,000 out of work.
However, as Mr Dick Marty, the cantonal governor, points out, it is
difficult to get too alarmed at this development. The fact that there are
still 35,000 frontalieri coming in every day means that the 8,000 are not so
desperate that they will take any job available.
Indeed, it could be argued that the frontalieri are still taking the brunt
of the burden. Officials estimate that the number of workers crossing the
border every day has plunged from 40,000 to 35,000 in the past two years.
Much of this fall is due to the slump in the outsize construction industry,
where labour turnover is notoriously high anyway.
Analysts doubt that employment will rise rapidly even when economic recovery
comes because most companies feel an urgent need to improve productivity.
The high value of the Swiss franc and high Swiss wage rates make it
increasingly difficult for them to compete in world markets.
Another source of anxiety is the rejection by Swiss voters last year of the
European Economic Area (EEA). 'It is still difficult to see any impacts of
the vote,' Mr Citterio says, but manufacturers fear increased red tape at EC
borders.
'More than half of our output is exported and companies were already having
difficulty before the EEA vote. Now they have to worry about discrimination
as well,' he says.
Yet another worry is the continuing political turmoil in Italy, which is the
canton's second-most-important exports customer after Germany. As a result
of the scandals, investment in the huge Italian public industrial sector has
ground to a halt, resulting in declining orders for many Ticino machinery
and chemical companies.
There is not a lot that Ticino authorities themselves can do to promote
industrial development. They have managed over the past decade to improve
public finances so that tax rates are more competitive, and they have
increased the amount of investment tax credits available for industry.
Apart from that, the government is hoping that the project to build a new
high-speed rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass will prove as beneficial as
the original rail line a century ago.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (2): A year of rising output - Harsh
economic medicine is starting to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
POLAND was the first country in post-communist central Europe to embark on
radical economic reforms. It now has the satisfaction of being first to see
light at the end of the tunnel after 3 1/2 years of wrenching economic
change.
Industrial output, which dropped like a stone for two years after the
introduction of a crash economic stabilisation package in January 1990, has
been rising for over a year from a low point 40 per cent below 1989 levels.
Official figures show that April output was 8.1 per cent above the same
month last year, and 7.6 per cent higher on average over the first four
months.
Official unemployment, the surest indicator of the depth of the industrial
surgery which has pared down the state-owned enterprises, remains at a high
14.3 per cent of the labour force. But the rate of increase in unemployment
has declined sharply and it now looks as though more jobs are being created
in the dynamic private sector than are being shed in formerly bloated and
inefficient state enterprises. Registered unemployment actually dropped by
more than 6,000 in March.
A recent World Bank report found that many state owned enterprises are also
now showing the benefits of better management, lower labour costs and other
delayed adjustments to the harsh external environment imposed by the
government's tough fiscal and monetary policies. Some, such as the Szczecin
shipyards, have shown remarkable turnrounds and are now exporting profitably
without subsidies.
Strong growth in the chemical, electrical machinery and construction
industries is leading the industrial recovery, accompanied by signs of a
revival in investment and consumer demand. Higher output and rising real
incomes, however, have put pressure on the external account with an 8 per
cent drop in exports to Dollars 3.04bn in the first quarter contrasting with
a 16.5 per cent rise in imports to Dollars 3.41bn.
The deepening recession in EC markets, especially Germany, has made
exporting more difficult, while the continuing effects of last year's
drought, the EC ban on livestock imports, and poor prospects for the current
farm season have cut into farm exports and led to an increase in grain
imports to make up the 7m tonne shortfall in last year's 20m grain harvest.
Were it not for the drought, Poland would have registered a 3-4 per cent
rise in GDP last year instead of just over 1 per cent. This year the GDP
growth target is 3-4 per cent and, longer term, the government is looking
for a resumption of steady growth averaging 5 per cent annually for the next
decade.
The Central Planning Office (CUP), which advises the government, has drawn
up two growth projections for 1994. The slow growth variant looks for 2.7
per cent GDP growth, a modest rise in exports and imports, but 18 per cent
unemployment and 32 per cent inflation. The fast track variant opts for 6.5
per cent growth, an 8 per cent rise in exports, double the rate of capital
formation, 15 per cent unemployment and 36 per cent inflation.
To move to the fast track, the CUP calls for income tax relief for
investors, lower interest rates linked to the producer price index (and not
the consumer index), tax breaks for high unemployment regions and export
promotion through the creation of a new export credit and insurance agency.
Economists believe the shift from a Dollars 385m trade surplus in the last
quarter of 1993 to a Dollars 370m deficit over the first quarter of 1993
reflects the high import elasticity of Polish industry - which increasingly
incorporates sophisticated imported components in its products - and the
desire of Polish consumers for quality imported goods. But the deterioration
also reflects an over-valued zloty.
The government imposed a 6 per cent import surcharge on December 17 to
restrain imports and followed this up last month by raising the daily
devaluation of the zloty from 12 to 15 zloties, equivalent to a 1.85 per
cent monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation.
The government has been reluctant fully to devalue the zloty in line with
domestic inflation, which has declined sharply over the last three years but
is still affected by the phasing out of energy subsidies, government deficit
spending and the impact of devaluation itself. Consumer prices are currently
rising at 32/34 per cent on an annual basis with a smaller rise in producer
prices.
Reducing inflation to single digits remains a key policy target. The
outgoing government's main policy anchor was its commitment to limit the
budget deficit to around 5 per cent of GDP. This was the central plank in
its letter of intent to the IMF which agreed a Dollars 660m standby loan in
March. This was followed two months later by two further loans totalling
Dollars 750m from the World Bank to help finance farm reforms, bank
restructuring and debt repayment.
Holding the line was politically difficult for the minority coalition
government which was brought down by trade union and opposition demands for
higher pay and higher pensions for public sector employees. Had the
government given in to the demands the 21,000bn zloty (Pounds 840m) extra
spending would have breached the budget deficit limits.
Shortly before dissolving parliament President Lech Walesa vetoed the
parliamentary vote for higher pension payments and Ms Hanna Suchocka,
re-appointed as acting prime minister, publicly welcomed the fact that with
parliament in abeyance the government would have an opportunity to prepare
next year's budget in peace.
Keeping to agreed IMF parameters is essential if Poland is to reach a debt
reduction agreement with foreign bank creditors. Much hangs on the outcome
of forthcoming negotiations with the London Club of commercial bank
creditors to whom Poland owes Dollars 12.1bn in capital and accrued
interest. Negotiations due to take place earlier this month have been
postponed to the end of June, ostensibly to give the banks more time to
study a report of the state of the economy and Poland's ability to pay.
Poland is faced with a serious bunching of repayments on its Dollars 33bn
debt to the Paris Club of official creditors and recent borrowings from
international institutions in the first years of the next century. So
Poland's debt negotiators are seeking a 50 per reduction in overall debt,
similar to the Paris Club deal two years ago, with a significant buy - back
component, and repayment of the outstanding debt over 30 years.
Agreement with the London Club would remove one of the main restrictions on
Poland's ability to attract foreign equity investment and permit the
normalisation of relations with the commercial banking system. Until now
Poland, in spite of its 40m internal market and rapidly growing private
sector, has attracted relatively little foreign investment. That is now
changing, however, as foreign investors gain experience in the market.
A combination of rapid growth in the locally owned private sector and
foreign investment is helping to change the product mix and the quality of
Polish exports. The traditional sinews of the old centralised economy -
especially coal, steel and heavy engineering - have withered. Coal output
this year will be under 120m tonnes, only 60 per cent of its 1980s peak;
steel output has more than halved since 1989; heavy engineering output fell
over 10 per cent last year.
The painful shift away from energy, labour and raw material intensive
industries has reduced power consumption, done more for cleaner air and
water than expensive environmental control equipment, and released resources
for more profitable employment.
Inside some of Poland's former satanic mills, international companies such
as Fiat, Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Philips, Unilever and Thomson have
introduced new management and new machines to produce first class industrial
goods for both export and the home market. Fiat now sources Europe-wide
sales of the new Cinquecento from its plant in southern Poland and has
pledged to invest Dollars 2bn before the end of the decade.
Consumer product and food corporations with worldwide brand names, along
with the global detergent and soap companies, have set up plants, attracted
by low wage costs, a 40m strong domestic market hungry to adopt western
consumption patterns and the prospect of re - expanding trade links with the
Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine.
Poland's capacity to absorb higher foreign investment has grown steadily
over the last three years as a series of structural, institutional and legal
reforms have created the most privatised economy in the region. Most foreign
trade, over 80 per cent of retailing, 75 per cent of construction, over 60
per cent of road transport and nearly 30 per cent of industrial sales now
come from the private sector which accounts for over 50 per cent of GDP and
nearly 60 per cent of employment, including agriculture.
The pace of privatisation is due to accelerate next year with the formation
of 20 National Investment funds (NIF), which will manage 600 former state
enterprises under the mass privatisation programme, and government
encouragement for wholesale worker and management buyouts.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (3): Agreement would help - Anthony
Robinson examines the debt problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE increasingly widespread view that the Polish economy has turned a corner
and resumed a path of steady growth is making life more difficult for Mr
Krzysztof Krowacki, Warsaw's plenipotentiary for debt negotiations with
western commercial banks.
Mr Krowacki, charged with negotiating a debt reduction agreement with the
360 creditor banks represented by the London Club, is seeking a 50 per cent
reduction on the Dollars 12.1bn capital and accumulated interest owed to the
banks. Earlier this month the Polish government appointed Kidder Peabody,
the US investment and brokerage house, to advise the Polish team.
Poland is obliged to seek a debt reduction deal by the terms of its April
1991 agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors. They have agreed
to write off at least 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt in
two tranches, provided that it followed IMF-approved policy guidelines and
has sought comparable terms from its non-official creditors.
But the banks, reluctant to go beyond the standard 35 per cent reductions
associated with Brady-type debt restructuring agreements, and facing even
more extensive debt reduction demands from Bulgaria, have been reluctant to
concede the Polish case.
'I'm fighting against the misconception that because the economy is starting
to grow we can pay more,' says Mr Krowacki. In the long term, higher
investment, foreign capital inflows and income-raising tax reforms should
raise Poland's capacity to repay debt. In future, repayment capacity will be
determined essentially by balance of payments, not budgetary factors, he
concedes.
But for the forseeable future Poland's capacity to repay debt will remain
determined by budget constraints. These are dictated by the need to finance
social security and other spending and yet keep overall government outgoings
within tough IMF-determined limits on the budget deficit.
With support from the IMF, which recently approved a Dollars 660m standby
loan, and from the World Bank and other institutions, together with higher
foreign equity capital inflows, Poland's economic planners are looking
forward to a decade or more of 5 per cent annual growth.
'In the long run we will repay our debts from higher growth and higher
exports. But we are already committed to foreign debt repayments of about
Dollars 4bn a year by the year 2005 under the terms of our Paris Club
commitments. It will be very difficult to add repayments under a London Club
agreement, even with a 50 per cent reduction agreement,' Mr Krowacki argues.
An agreement now would remove a barrier to foreign investment in Poland,
reduce Poland's country risk profile, lower borrowing costs and open the way
for an influx of western banks to service international and local clients.
Many of Poland's bank creditors have already written off much of their
Polish debt or traded it on the secondary market where Polish paper has
risen in recent weeks to about 30-31 per cent of face value. A debt
agreement would therefore show up as an exceptional profit in many bank
balance sheets, as Mr Krowacki would like to buy back between 25-30 per cent
of Polish debt for cash, and various options for the remainder.
'I believe 1993 offers a window of opportunity for a mutually beneficial
settlement which I hope to reach this summer. I'm glad to see that some
banks agree with me. Both sides have grasped the situation and that is why
we are talking to each other,' Mr Krowacki adds.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (1): Evidence of unease in gilded cage -
Ticino, like most European regions, has suffered an economic downturn -
although the impact has been softened by the canton's peculiar economic
structure.  But beneath the relative economic calm, there is evidence of a
growing unease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TICINO, Switzerland's Italian-speaking canton, has become something of a
bird in a gilded cage.
Its gentle people enjoy a largely unearned prosperity, benefiting from the
efforts of their more energetic Swiss cousins to build industry there, and
from the venality of Italian institutions, which has enabled the canton to
become a thriving financial haven.
The Ticinese are also lucky in their geography, occupying one of Europe's
strategic and truly blessed plots.
An inverted triangle stretching from the highest mountains in the north to
the outskirts of Milan in the south, Ticino contains no fewer than four
north-south road passes and one important rail pass through the Alps.
Its transit vocation is about to be significantly enhanced, thanks to the
Swiss government's bold plan to build a new high-speed rail tunnel under the
Gotthard pass over the next decade.
The canton also packs an extraordinary variety of landscape and climate  -
from glaciers to palm trees - into its less than 100km of length, and
tourism now accounts for about a quarter of its estimated SFr10bn gross
product.
Ticino's exceptional prosperity is a recent phenomenon. Until the opening of
the first rail tunnel through the Gotthard pass in 1882, it was a poor
canton populated mainly by subsistence farmers. Its principal export was
people.
Today, the Ticinese themselves marvel at how little benefit they gained over
the centuries from the heavy traffic of people and goods that crossed over
the Gotthard before the rail line was built.
Thereafter, it was mainly Swiss-German entrepreneurs who developed the
canton's industries, concentrating on the ones - banking and tourism - that
seemed most promising to them.
Manufacturing industries remain underdeveloped and largely dependent on
low-paid day workers coming from Italy. 'We have an economy that is
structurally weak,' Mr Dick Marty, the cantonal governor, admits.
Like most European regions, Ticino has suffered from an economic downturn in
the past few years, but the impact has been softened by the canton's
peculiar economic structure.
The construction industry has been hardest hit, but job losses there have
been borne largely by the so-called frontalieri who come from Italy every
day to work in the canton. Their number has tumbled from 40,000 two years
ago to 35,000.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil in Italy has kept activity brisk in
Ticinese banks.
But beneath the relative economic calm, there is evidence of growing unease
within the gilded cage. A new nationalist political party, the Lega dei
Ticinesi, has sprung up in the past two years and become a leading force in
the canton's political life.
The Lega, led by a garrulous building contractor, plays effectively to
Ticinese sensitivities. On the one hand, it rails at perceived slights or
injustices inflicted on the canton by the country's Swiss-German majority,
while on the other it displays a self-satisfied disdain for disorderly
Italians.
Ticinese identity has become a delicate issue in the past few years, which
is hardly surprising considering its fragility.
The Ticinese represent a large majority of the Italian-speaking community of
Switzerland, yet the cantonal population is little more than 4 per cent of
the national total. Ticino has no university and many of its bright students
go to German or French language colleges north of the Alps never to return.
Only a bare majority of the canton's 290,000 population has local roots. A
quarter are foreign and the rest are mainly German-Swiss. More than half of
the capital invested in industry is of external origin and all of the big
banks are controlled from outside.
As tourism is an important factor in the economy, the foreign presence often
seems even larger than it is and, in some instances, becomes suffocating. In
the centre of Ascona, an exquisite medieval town on Lago Maggiore, German
appears to have become the dominant language, causing anxiety about a more
general encroachment. 'The Swiss-Germans regard Ticino as 'our verandah'',
says Mr Raffaello Ceschi, a local historian.
But the Ticinese clearly prize their attachment to Switzerland and there is
not a whiff of separatist sentiment in the new nationalist wind.
Perhaps that is partly because they know that they get economic benefits
from the federal government disproportionate to their size. Many of them are
also among the more committed participants in Switzerland's militia army,
unlike the French-Swiss, who tend not to take it very seriously.
The Ticinese attitude to Italy is also complex. They obviously have much
affection for their Italian neighbours, and recognise the value of Italy as
their only source of cultural support. The television antennas in Ticino all
point south.
But they also seek to keep a certain distance from their neighbours to the
south, whom they seem to look down upon. Most Swiss - and many Ticinese -
were shocked when a majority of the canton's citizens voted last December
against joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free trade
area that would have brought Switzerland closer to the European Community,
including Italy.
Normally, Ticino, like the French-speaking cantons of Switzerland, is
understood to be pro-European because of the obvious benefits to be gained
from easing contacts with EC neighbours.
Ticinese leaders say the No vote, which was championed by the Lega, was
largely a defensive response to the current upheavals in Italy. They feared
a flood of immigrants and a lowering of their standard of living.
'If the vote had taken place at a more propitious time, it would have been
positive,' Mr Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo, says.
The Ticino government and the business community nevertheless see the canton
becoming increasingly dependent on closer links with its southern neighbour.
Mr Generali says the canton is luckier than other Swiss border cantons,
having such a highly developed industrial region on its doorstep.
Efforts are being made at the official level to institutionalise contacts
with the Italian provinces of Como and Varese and a 'Regione dei Tre Laghi'
(Region of the three lakes) is in embryo form.
In the meantime, the canton's economic future will continue to depend
largely on banking and tourism.
The banking sector seems well placed, having been strengthened in the past
few years by the addition of several banks which are neither Swiss nor
Italian. 'We have the critical mass now to be a second-tier international
financial centre,' Mr Generali says.
Banking leaders are also trying to become more professional and to do
whatever else is necessary to get rid of the community's image as a centre
for carrying out dodgy transactions and for stashing away hot money.
The outlook for tourism is less clear because the canton finds it difficult
to compete with lower-cost destinations in Europe. However, even the
nationalistic Lega dei Ticinesi believes in its expansion. Mr Flavio
Maspoli, one of the Lega leaders, says the canton should stop setting up
industrial development zones - 'there are too many industrial zones' - and
concentrate on luring more tourists with casinos and golf courses.
If that is the view of the nationalists, it suggests that the bird at heart
still likes its gilded cage.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (1): Out of the tunnel - Poland's
determination to build a prosperous democracy is vital to the future
stability of Europe.  Signs of economic recovery are giving strong
encouragement and hope to its watching eastern neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A powerful message is radiating out from Poland to the patchwork of
newly-independent states to its east. Carried by private traders from the
former Soviet states, or discussed at academic and government meetings, the
word is that Poles are already living in the post-communist future - and it
works.
It is a message which gains perspective from distance. Seen from Moscow, or
Kiev or Minsk, the achievements of Poland's four post-communist years seem
little short of miraculous.
Politically, Poland has developed from a one party state with a powerful but
illegal opposition, into a fully-fledged parliamentary democracy. Its
political parties reflect a wide spectrum of views from the frankly
xenophobic right through the Catholic middle to a respectable, former
communist, social democratic left. Governments stand or fall according to
the parliamentary rules after free and fair elections.
Economically, the country is the first in central Europe to resume economic
growth after three painful years of deep structural and institutional
changes. These have raised productivity and improved both the quality of
Polish products and the ability to compete in world markets. What is already
the most privatised and entrepreneurial economy in the region is on the
verge of a new wave of mass privatisation. The shortage economy has given
way, irreversibly, to market mechanisms and vigorous consumerism.
Budapest or Prague may look more prosperous. But they were much richer
before the war and were always considered part of the west. For millions in
what was the European part of the Soviet Union it has always been Slavic
Poland - big and close and ruled from Moscow by czar and commissar alike for
the best part of two centuries - which has offered a more tangible vision of
the future. The emergence of Poland from the trauma of transition to
capitalism and democracy gives hope to them all.
Seen close up, however, the reality looks less enchanting for many ordinary
Poles immersed in their daily lives. Millions of peasant farmers in a
country still 30 per cent rural have seen their incomes drop half over the
past five years. Nearly 3m Poles are officially unemployed, over 14 per cent
of the labour force. Millions of white and blue collar workers have left
their former badly paid but secure jobs to become self-employed or be taken
on by the rapidly expanding private sector. But low average wages of just
over Dollars 200 a month leave many staring at a cornucopia of goods which
their low incomes and high inflation keep tantalisingly out of reach.
The pain is not only economic. Whole categories of workers - teachers,
university professors, doctors, nurses, miners, steel workers, arms factory
and heavy engineering workers, railwaymen - have lost their former
socio-economic prestige along with their jobs and their former relatively
high incomes.
Even the heroes of the long anti-communist struggle, the Solidarity union
organisers in the big factories and shipyards, have become dinosaurs; doomed
remnants of a perverse proletarianism in a new economy where small is good
and where economic power is shifting fast to private entrepreneurs and
ultimately to the new banks, insurance companies and pension funds.
Those who have lost most, or gained least, from the transition processes
proved vocal enough and numerically strong enough in a highly fractured
parliament of 29 parties to bring down the government on an emotional issue
 -by one solitary vote. But they do not constitute a majority.
Most Poles are much better off socially, politically and economically than
they were under the despised communist system. Even the former communists,
now social democrats, are led by young men who support the shift to a market
democracy and want to become junior partners in a future centre-left
coalition.
Seen in this broader framework, Poland's reputation for political volatility
is exaggerated, even though Poles are once again between governments and
heading for early general elections on September 19. This follows the one
vote parliamentary defeat on May 28 of the shaky coalition government of
free market liberals, main stream Solidarity moderates, Christian CAP
nationalists and peasant parties, which was unexpectedly cobbled together
last July by Ms Hanna Suchocka.
The no-confidence motion was tabled by the Solidarity union MPs because of
the government's refusal to award higher pay and pensions to teachers and
other public servants. To do so would have breached the budget deficit
ceiling - equivalent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product - agreed with
the International Monetary Fund. The budget deficit limit became the main
anchor of economic policy for both domestic and external reasons.
Lax social policy in the past has saddled Poland, a country of just under
40m people, with 8m pensioners. Many are recipients of more or less
fraudulent disability or other special pensions, granted essentially as a
form of unemployment pay. Without pension reform, and lower real pension
payments, the budget will be hard pressed to finance other programmes.
The need to curb social transfer payments is made more acute by Poland's
foreign debt repayment obligations. The resumption of debt servicing on
Poland's Paris club debt to official creditors, together with the cost of
servicing new loans from the World Bank and other institutions, will cost
around Dollars 4bn annually by early next century. These repayments will
rise further if, as expected, Warsaw negotiates a 50 per cent reduction on
its Dollars 12.1bn debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors
later this year and has to service this as well.
Until now the legacy of overdue debt left over from the communist past,
coupled with unease at the traditions of labour militancy and the perception
of political instability, has tended to discourage foreign investors who
would otherwise be attracted by the potential of a 40m strong market and a
strategic location.
This has not been wholly negative. The relative paucity of foreign capital
and competition has forced Poles to become more entrepreneurial. They have
had to do more for themselves than, for example, the Hungarians, whose
economic regeneration is largely based on foreign investment, or in the
extreme case, former East Germans who have been effectively re-colonised by
west German capital and Bonn's largesse.
Before the latest government crisis there were signs that foreign investors
were taking a more positive view of Polish prospects. This followed
agreement on a Dollars 660m standby loan from the IMF in March,
parliamentary approval of a modified mass privatisation programme, and the
announcement of new loans and new projects from the World Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
A slight hiatus is to be expected between now and the elections on September
19. The outcome in party terms is uncertain, especially since the election
will be fought under new rules which limit representation in the new
parliament to parties gaining above 5 per cent of the vote. It is also
unclear just what role President Lech Walesa sees for himself in future.
But in broad brush terms the most likely outcome will be a new and probably
more coherent coalition, possibly again led by Ms Suchocka, the current
caretaker prime minister. Such a government will almost certainly continue
the policies of the last four years which broadly correspond with the desire
of most Poles for a functioning market economy and a law-based society.

FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares advance as rate hopes revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENTS in the currency markets revived hopes among UK equity investors
that a cut in German interest rates might open the door for Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, to reduce base rates in Britain.
A recovery of 13 points to 2,883 took the FT-SE 100 Index to the top end of
its trading range, but traders again warned that the impending expiry in
stock index futures was exerting pressure on the equity market.
The stock market appeared satisfied with the important economic speech from
the new chancellor in the City of London on Tuesday evening. His
confirmation that no changes of substance in economic policy are planned
encouraged confidence in the market.
Share prices opened lower in London, subdued by Wall Street's fall of 22 Dow
points overnight, but quickly turned upwards when the stock index futures
opened strongly. With the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index expiring on
Friday, attention is now focused on the September contract, which traded
comfortably above 2,900 again yesterday.
Base rate optimism, calmed down by the relaxed tone of the speech from the
chancellor, returned to life at mid-morning when the D-Mark began to fall
after comments from German government sources were read as implying a
quickening pace of German rate cuts. At the same time, the move towards the
US dollar benefited overseas earning stocks in the London market.
News of a disappointing fall of 0.2 per cent in April retail sales, while
hardly encouraging evidence for recovery in the domestic economy or
corporate profits, was seen as strengthening the chances for a cut in base
rates. The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for May, slightly below some
forecasts, did nothing to change views in the stock mar-ket on government
borrowing prospects.
The FT-SE 100 advanced to a day's peak of 2,888.3, but again showed
unwillingness to break through into what would be seen as peak-challenging
territory. Some analysts, pointing to the upward pull on share prices as the
big securities houses grappled with positions in stock index futures, warned
that the top end of the market range has yet to be convincingly broached.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also rallied, although less aggressively, closing
6.9 up at 3,212, just 1.4 under the peak reached a week ago.
Seaq volume was slow to develop but increased as basket trading between
equities and stock index futures was joined by at least one genuine
investment programme. By the close, the Seaq total stood at 607.3m shares.
The focus on the Footsie-listed stocks occasioned by futures-related trading
reduced business in non-Footsie issues to only about 51 per cent of the
day's total, significantly lower than usual.
On Tuesday, Seaq volume of 512.3m shares brought in retail business worth
Pounds 1.16bn, a comfortably profitable level from the point of view of the
London-based securities houses.
While London market strategists refused to demonstrate too much enthusiasm
on the prospects for the meeting this morning of the Bundesbank's policy
council, for which no press conference was planned, it was clear yesterday
that interest rate optimism has remained a significant factor for UK
investors.

FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent meeting between Standard Chartered and a number of bank analysts,
at which the bank described its current strategy, provided the spark for
another burst of sustained buying interest in the shares, which yesterday
reached their highest closing level for more than seven years.
The stock price settled a net 26 up at 795p, only a whisker from its
all-time high of 807p reached in April 1986. The steep rise in the price was
not, however, matched by any sharp increase in trading volume. Nevertheless,
turnover of 2.7m shares was at the high end of the scale.
Some analysts were surprised at the performance of Standard shares after
Monday's meeting. 'The meeting was positive but not wildly exciting,' said
one who attended. He added that the UK business was still in a loss-making
situation in the current year, in spite of cost-cutting, and that there
would be a need for yet more provisions against bad debts.
International conglomerate BTR was hit sharply by a profits downgrade from
BZW, the London investment bank. At the day's worst the shares were down 10
at 354p, but they later picked up in line with a strong market trend to
close a net 5 off at 359p after trading volume of 6.5m.
BZW trimmed its estimate for the current year's profit figure by Pounds 50m
to Pounds 1.25bn, citing tougher than predicted market conditions in Europe
and 'a more realistic currency situation'. It kept its 1994 forecast at
Pounds 1.45bn.
Royal Insurance rose 4 to 287p after a buy recommendation from Kleinwort
Benson Securities. Royal Bank of Scotland dipped 6 to 282p amid hints of a
broker downgrade.
Interim results up 71 per cent and ahead of City expectations moved the
share price of Granada Group up 6 to 415p in trade of 4.2m, while analysts
set about upgrading their profits forecasts.
Positive views ranged virtually across the market in spite of the absence in
the board's report of any hint of an economic recovery. Mr Hamish Dickson at
Hoare Govett said: 'It would be the icing on the cake if the recovery picks
up.'
Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court said the interim results were a commendation
to Granada's new management. The company, a largely cash generative concern,
is expected to make further good progress and is viewed as undervalued by
many leisure analysts.
In a patchy brewing sector, Guinness moved forward 4 to 489p. In Paris,
chairman Mr Tony Greener was upbeat about the company's 1993 prospects,
while Lehman Brothers, the UK securities house, recommended buying of LVMH,
the French luxury goods manufacturer with which Guinness has a 24 per cent
cross-holding.
Optimism over a turnround in Brazil pushed up Coats Viyella 6 1/2 to 236 1/2
p. Watchers saw the increased hopes as evidence of a recovery, much more
than the recent consolidation in the Indian subsidiary, said one analyst.
Fears over possible moves by Unilever to make a substantial US acquisition
provided part of the reason behind the stock's fall of 12 to 1036p in modest
volume. Following recent buoyancy, based on its optimism for growth in East
Asia, some watchers are now pointing to its lack of a significant presence
in the US.
But Ms Nicola Mallard at Charterhouse Tilney believed that the concern was
premature. 'It is not going to happen immediately. First there has to be
something to buy.'
Among other engineering and aerospace stocks, British Aerospace appreciated
8 to 401p on hopes that the long-awaited Pounds 1.3bn Tornado order from
Saudi Arabia was about to be signed.
Hints of a corporate deal and of a buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais
Laing, the stockbroker, helped TI Group move ahead 8 to 345p.
A sigh of relief after the last of the expected major cash calls in
property, a significant property portfolio acquisition, and positive noises
from NatWest Securities, triggered a bounce in the sector.
Hemingway Properties pleased the market with its Pounds 30.2m purchase of a
property portfolio and the stock firmed 2 1/2 to 31p.
British Land added 6 at 309p, Brixton Estates went ahead 2 to 197p in modest
trading, Slough Estates put on 3 at 206p, Great Portland Estates gained 3 at
180p and Clayform benefited from high demand and moved up 8 to 33p.

FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy Zeneca trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A late upsurge in Zeneca shares was ascribed to Robert Fleming Securities,
the stockbroking arm of the merchant bank, which told clients that the
rights issue 'should definitely be taken up'. Fleming's buy note triggered
heavy demand for both classes of Zeneca shares, the most heavily traded
issues on the London market yesterday. The Pounds 1.3bn rights issue closes
on Monday.
Marginally easier during the morning, both classes of Zeneca shares made
rapid progress to close sharply higher on the day. The 'old' settled 7 up at
623p, with 12m shares changing hands, while the 'new' nil-paid rights added
5 1/2 at 21 1/2 p on 15m traded.
Fleming analyst Mr John Doree said recent weakness in Zeneca shares was due
to lack of international interest: 'Overseas interest is near-zero.' But he
forecast that domestic institutions will ensure the issue will be taken up.
'Zeneca is on a 35 per cent yield premium to the market and, given the
potential to grow the dividend as fast as the market in the long term, the
shares look oversold and a short-term buy. Fleming also labelled ICI a
'buy'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading volume in aero engine maker Rolls-Royce rose to 4.2m shares in good
two-way business after suggestions in the market that Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, may be planning to issue a warrant enabling overseas buyers
to continue purchasing the stock, although foreign ownership levels are
already at maximum permitted levels.
Rolls-Royce announced a week ago that foreign ownership of its shares had
reached 29.5 per cent, the maximum allowed by the company's articles of
association. As things stand, any further purchases by non-UK investors
would have to be relinquished or transferred to UK ownership, as soon as the
company confirms the purchases.
However, Rolls-Royce said last week it would take no immediate action in the
hope that its announcement would itself reduce further foreign purchases.
The suggested move by Goldman Sachs would appear to offer an alternative
investment entry for overseas investors, for whom Rolls-Royce remains an
attractive stock. However, there was no-one available at Goldman to comment
on the suggestion. Rolls-Royce closed unchanged at 149 1/2 p.

FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: New trust focuses on waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT upsurge in water shares, in the midst of the sector's preliminary
results season, gathered further momentum yesterday, with good general
buying of the sector said to have gained impetus from large-scale buying of
the FT-SE 100 water constituents by Smith New Court, the leading UK
securities house. Over the past three trading sessions, water issues have
risen more than 8 per cent.
The strong buying by Smith was associated with that company's participation
in the launch of the new Johnson Fry Utilities Trust investment trust. The
new trust is sponsored by Smith New Court Corporate Finance and distributed
by Smith New Court Securities. The prospectus for the new trust, which will
invest primarily in UK utility stocks, such as BT, British Gas and other
water and electricity issues, was published yesterday.
Anglian Water outpaced its FT-SE 100 rivals yesterday, closing 14 higher at
484p, closely followed by North West Water, up 12 at 474p, Severn Trent, due
to report this morning and 9 stronger at 496p, and Thames, 5 to the good at
476p. Northumbrian led the smaller stocks, adding 14 at 577p.
Dealers also said the utilities were attracting keen support ahead of next
Monday's market debut by Northern Ireland Electricity. 'Grey market'
indications yesterday suggested an opening level of around 121p to 124p.

<TEXT>
RENEWED HOPES of a cut in both German and UK interest rates reversed
Tuesday's falls in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Hopes of a reduction in base rates, which had fuelled Monday's rise but
faded on Tuesday, returned strongly yesterday. The June contract on the
FT-SE 100 Index, which opened at 2,876, was in demand from the beginning as
developments in the currency markets were taken to indicate a cut in German
rates today. Such a move, traders argued, would allow a reduction in UK
rates. This view was strengthened by the release of UK retail sales figures
which were worse than expected.
Having moved steadily forward throughout the morning, June reached the day's
high of 2,900 just ahead of Wall Street's opening. It came off the top to
close at 2,889, a 6-point premium to the underlying cash market. Dealers
continued to roll pos-itions forward ahead of tomorrow's expiry of the June
contract, which saw volume of 12,923. The September future had 6,854 lots
transacted.
The expiry of the June stock options was the main feature in traded options
and a significant contributor to the day's total turnover of 31,338 lots.
Amstrad, whose June options expired yesterday, traded 3,197 lots, followed
by British Gas with 2,214, another with June expiry. GEC had volume of
1,150.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program buying lifts
blue chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER A hesitant start, blue chip stocks posted solid gains yesterday in
spite of weakness in technology and airline shares, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19.65 at 3,511.65. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.16 firmer at 447.43, but
the Nasdaq composite finished 1.09 down at 696.25. Trading volume on the New
York SE was 267.5m shares.
The morning's economic news had little effect on the markets: industrial
production rose 0.2 per cent in May, capacity utilisation was unchanged, and
housing starts were up 2.4 per cent, all of which was in line with analysts'
expectations. The figures, however, did nothing to dispel concern among
investors that economic recovery may be stalling.
Although this means that inflationary pressures in the economy should remain
subdued, and interest rates low, it also means corporate profitability will
probably not improve over the next year as much as investors had hoped. A
string of recent profits warnings from companies seem to have backed up that
view, and have unnerved investors.
Consequently, prices spent most of the day virtually flat, before a round of
late program buying closed the session on a broadly positive note.
Hewlett-Packard recorded one of the day's biggest declines, dropping Dollars
3 3/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 in volume of 3.96m shares after the chief executive
was reported to have delivered a downbeat assessment of Hewlett's
second-half prospects at a meeting in Germany.
The company later said, however, that the reports were misleading and that
its views on its near-term prospects remained positive.
Other technology stocks were also lower. Motorola lost Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 82 3/4 , Compaq Computer Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 1/8 and Digital
Equipment Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 3/8 .
USAir dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 after the airline said its May
revenues were lower than expected, and that it would report a loss in the
second quarter and for the full 1993 year, although the losses would be
smaller than incurred in 1992.
The airline sector in general was weaker. Delta declined Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 49 7/8 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped Dollars 2 to
Dollars 66 and UAL tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 126 3/4 .
Club Med advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 5/8 after the holiday group
announced a bigger than expected improvement in second-quarter earnings.
Also higher was Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which bounced back from
recent losses to post a gain of Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 as bargain
hunters moved into the stock.
On the Nasdaq market, Price Co jumped Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 and
Costco Wholesale climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 on news that the two
discount warehouse retailers are to combine forces in a multi-billion dollar
merger.
Canada
TORONTO finished with a slightly firmer bias, although the real estate
sector featured weakly. The TSE 300 index gained 4.6 at 3,892.4 and advances
outpaced declines by 410 to 304 after volume of 61.9m shares valued at
CDollars 575m.
The real estate sub-group index dropped 96.96, or 3.15 per cent, to
2,977.73.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls
below 20,000 on political anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING anxiety over the country's electoral reform proposals weighed
heavily on activity, and the Nikkei index fell below the 20,000 level for
the first time since April 26, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 143.46 at 19,902.42 on small-lot profit-taking
and arbitrage-linked selling. Public funds, which were noted placing buying
orders around the 19,500 mark, failed to support sentiment. The index rose
to a day's high of 20,103.00 in the morning session and fell to a low of
19,820.90 in the afternoon.
Volume remained almost flat at 370m shares. Declines outnumbered advances by
909 to 154, with 96 issues remaining unchanged. The broader Topix index of
all first section stocks weakened 19.74 to 1,600.14. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.01 up at 1,209.03.
Confusion over the political situation grew as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, was poised to give up political reform, an issue on the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's agenda since 1988.
Foreigners were net sellers, while domestic institutions remained on the
sidelines. A rally by the dollar against the yen eased some selling
pressure. The dollar rose Y1.32 to close at Y106.35.
Overseas institutions were seen selling bank shares: Industrial Bank of
Japan dipped Y10 to Y2,930 and Mitsubishi Bank Y80 to Y2,670.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y27,000 to Y919,000 on profit-taking,
while electric utilities, which have been recently popular as beneficiaries
of a higher yen, lost ground. Tokyo Electric Power retreated Y60 to Y3,730.
The lower yen, however, encouraged some high-technology exporters. Toshiba
gained Y3 at Y693 and Fujitsu firmed Y4 to Y761. A 5.3 per cent year-on-year
rise in semiconductor exporters supported Oki Electric, up Y17 at Y491, and
Kyocera, the semiconductor ceramic package maker, which added Y40 at Y5,450.
Mitsukoshi, the department store which accounts for more than 90 per cent of
Tiffany's sales in Japan, put on Y4 at Y8,231. Reports that Tiffany would
take over its own importing and distribution operations in Japan from
Mitsukoshi encouraged customers.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 336.22 to 22,040.24 in volume of 18m
shares.
Roundup
THERE were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG was slightly higher as rumours of a breakthrough in Sino-British
talks triggered moderate demand, reversing early losses. The Hang Seng index
finished 21.37 ahead at 7,304.83, after losing 53 points in early trading.
Turnover was strong at HKDollars 5.2bn.
Index futures leapt earlier on talk of progress in Sino-British talks in
Beijing on Hong Kong's political future and of an imminent agreement on the
deadlocked issue of financing Hong Kong's new airport. The talks in Beijing
ended with no outward signs of progress.
Among the most active stocks, HSBC appreciated 50 cents to HKDollars 74,
Hutchison Whampoa gained 10 cents at HKDollars 22 and Jardine Matheson shed
50 cents to HKDollars 60.50.
TAIWAN saw profit-taking in the last hour erode earlier gains. The weighted
index, which had risen more than 40 points at one stage, finished 9.40 down
on balance at 4,188.90. Turnover remained thin, at TDollars 16.9bn.
Strength in the Big Three banks led the market up at the opening, while
speculative activity focused on stocks going ex-rights: Kuei Hung and Taiwan
Sakura ended the day's limit up at TDollars 81 and TDollars 45.40
respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR weakened as profit-taking continued to dominate the market. The
composite index finished 2.91 lower at 736.51.
Among speculative stocks, Union Paper, which had been rumoured as a takeover
target for co-operative Koperasi Usaha Bersatu, fell MDollars 4.05 to
MDollars 7.95 on reports that the latter had called off talks. Shares in
Union Paper had risen some 400 per cent in the past two weeks, reaching a
high of MDollars 23 on Monday.
SINGAPORE also eased further as investors took profits, the Straits Times
Industrial index relinquishing 7.97 to 1,811.66. Among losers were banks and
shipyards as volume slipped to 215.7m shares from Tuesday's 227.9m.
SEOUL managed to reverse five consecutive days of losses with a 1.42-point
gain to 759.26 in turnover of Won570.3bn.
AUSTRALIA was marginally higher, helped by strength in gold shares. The All
Ordinaries index closed 0.7 up at 1,724.7 in turnover of ADollars 277.0m,
while the golds sector index moved forward 50.2 to 1,717.1.
Among gold issues, Plutonic was up 31 cents at ADollars 5.01 after losing 42
cents on Tuesday.
BANGKOK saw high demand for major property groups pull the index up in
afternoon trading. The SET index added 2.22 at 873.39 in turnover of
Bt5.54bn.
The property sector index moved ahead 2.67 per cent, with Bangkok Land
climbing Bt3.50 to Bt86.
KARACHI rose sharply on overseas buying, and the KSE index closed above the
1,200 level for the first time in four months, 13.15 higher at 1,200.93.
The market's rise has been prompted by Monday's budget that extended
exemptions on capital gains tax.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Spain defies downtrend in Europe - But
its gains were based on flawed logic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses, last month, once again showed little inclination to scale
the heights of activity that they reached in the first three months of 1993.
After a fall of 25 per cent in April from the March level, aggregate
turnover in senior markets declined by a further 2.5 per cent in May.
Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, which
produces the figures, notes that the fall in activity came in spite of a 1.2
per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries European index in May.
Turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based dealing system for
foreign shares, rose by 2 per cent over the month so, says Mr Cornish,
London volume as a percentage of domestic market turnover continued to
increase.
The total conceals big swings in individual markets. In Spain, turnover
jumped by 86.5 per cent on the month and there was a switch here in the Seaq
International trend as the latter's gain was held to 49.9 per cent. This is
significant because Seaq International, trending upwards since 1990, does up
to 40 per cent of Spanish equity business; its share last month fell from
38.7 to 33 per cent.
The reasons for the excitement, after an averagely poor month in April, were
the Spanish general election, expectations of a change in government, and
forecasts that the peseta would, first, be devalued - as it was, by 8 per
cent, in mid-May - and, secondly, that it would be floated after a win for
the Partido Popular. As it happened, the Socialists won and volume has since
dropped.
Other winners in May included Switzerland, France and the UK.
Switzerland's turnover rose by just under a fifth on the month as the market
outperformed Europe in the FT-Actuaries World Indices, and reached new
highs, helped by the recovery in the pharmaceutical sector after analysts
decided that the nervous reaction to President Bill Clinton's health service
review in the US might have been overdone.
France was up 4.7 per cent after a weak April. Volume has been climbing
again in June, as the Paris market has recovered confidence and French
interest rates have cut loose, on the downswing, from the Bundesbank's
straitjacket.
The UK also rose by 4.7 per cent, helped by rights issues, which produce
extra trading on the announcement of funding, and afterwards as investors
tidy up their holdings.
Italy had the fall it might have had a month earlier. Turnover was down 37
per cent on the month and 35 per cent on the previous three-month average,
after hitting record highs in March and April.
Elsewhere, Belgium dropped 29.6 per cent to the lowest level since last
June.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses replace Buba hopes
with higher dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES turned their attention yesterday to the higher dollar, and its
beneficiaries in corporate Europe, writes Our Markets Staff.
Interest rate hopes moved away from today's Bundesbank meeting, brokers
Hoare Govett arguing that there is scope for core ERM countries to reduce
their rates to as much as two percentage points below German rates, and for
non-core countries to narrow their interest rate premiums significantly.
FRANKFURT saw flat repo rates as a poor augury for today's Bundesbank
meeting. It was also treated to forecasts that west Germany's economy will
not begin a lasting recovery until next spring, and to a further weakening
in the D-Mark/dollar rate.
The DAX index pushed up again to close 5.46 higher at 1,689.56. D-Mark
weakness was keeping foreign investors out of the market at the moment, said
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, but German investors were
attracted by the prospect of higher export margins.
Turnover eased from DM6.5bn to DM6.2bn. Automotive stocks, particularly
suppliers like the tyremaker, Continental, and the battery manufacturer,
Varta, were traded higher again with rises of DM4.20 to DM206.20 and DM4.30
to DM294.30 respectively, although Varta said again late in the day that it
might have to cut its 1993 dividend.
The big three chemicals produced modest rises on the export margin argument,
and Commerzbank extended Tuesday's strength with a rise of DM2.20 to
DM305.70, this time on rumours of foreign stakebuilding, with the rest of
the banking sector flat.
PARIS regained its uptrend on hopes for a further cut in domestic rates by
the end of the month, irrespective of whether the Bundesbank eases today.
Supported also by strength in the Matif, the dollar and French franc, the
CAC-40 index put on 20.95 or 1.1 per cent to 1,918.81 in turnover up to
FFr3.3bn from Tuesday's FFr1.9bn.
Financials were active on the interest rate theme, with Bancaire gaining 5
per cent, up FFr25 to FFr515.
Both Suez and UAP rallied after the former said that it could take a stake
in UAP when it is privatised, to solve the dispute between the two over
Groupe Victoire. Suez gained FFr4.40 to FFr299.80 while UAP was FFr14 firmer
at FFr591.
There was considerable activity in the retail sector after Docks de France,
a major retail distribution group, announced the acquisition of Alsacienne
de Supermarche. The shares of Docks de France closed down FFr2.50 to
FFr481.00, but off the day's low of FFr451. Interest was also noted in a
number of stocks which have been underperforming the market recently: Remy
Cointreau, for instance, put on FFr8.00 to FFr166.50.
MILAN was supported by short covering on the last day of the June account
but a fall of some 20 per cent in Ferruzzi, down L118.50 to L475, weighed on
sentiment, leaving the Comit index down 5.36 at 508.01.
The group of creditor banks was meeting yesterday to discuss the
restructuring of the group's debt.
Montedison was given some encouragement by indications that it would be able
to dispose of its polymer subsidiaries which, said some analysts, would help
cut its debt burden by L2,000bn. The shares fixed up 4 per cent at L810
before slipping on the kerb to L750.
Among the banks, BCI and Credito Italiano gained on short covering with
respective gains of L249 and L165 to L4,899 and L2,530.
Stet, which, together with Generali, has helped prop up the market over
recent weeks, lost some ground, down L145 at L3,265. Generali was L695
higher at L35,705.
AMSTERDAM was another market to be lifted by the stronger US currency. The
CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 109.5.
Philips reached a new 12 month high after the EC agreed a subsidy plan to
promote high definition television. The shares put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 29.20.
ZURICH returned to the upgrade on the higher dollar, interest rate hopes and
good liquidity, the SMI index closing 20.0 higher at 2,294.0. MADRID seemed
subdued by the prospect of tomorrow's expiry of the Ibex-35 contract, the
general index closing just 0.75 higher at 260.64 with banks mixed, and
gentle gains in construction and most utilities.
OSLO climbed 1.4 per cent on the dollar, and lower money market rates, the
all-share index rising 6.69 to 481.40 in turnover of NKr600m.
COPENHAGEN put on nearly a percentage point, the KFX index closing 0.82
higher at 86.72 in turnover of DKr552m with banks in focus after a late
rally.
Danske Bank, boosted by falling interest rates, rose DKr5 to DKr323.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Critical days for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR enjoyed another rally against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday, with some dealers wondering whether the US currency was on the
verge of the strategic move upwards that has been awaited all year, writes
James Blitz.
The currency has made several attempts at a sustained break through the
DM1.67 level this year, only to fall back on fears that the US economic
recovery was not powerful enough and that the D-Mark remained intrinsically
strong.
However, at the close of European trading yesterday, the dollar appeared set
for another test of the elusive DM1.67 figure, having risen more than 2
pfennigs on the day to DM1.6585. In New York it finished at DM1.6560.
For dollar bulls, the striking feature of yesterday's rally was that it came
at a time when all the indicators ought to have triggered weakness in the US
currency.
The Bundesbank disappointed those dealers who had expected an easing in
monetary policy, leaving its repo rate on hold at 7.60 per cent.
Tuesday's consumer price inflation data, showing a smaller than expected
monthly increase in US prices of 0.1 per cent, had also wiped away
expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon raise short term interest
rates, thereby reducing the premium on holding D-Marks. But this indicator
has been mostly ignored by the market.
Instead, the D-Mark has been undermined by growing concern about the
weakness of the German economy and its budget deficit.
In Europe, the D-Mark fell against most currencies yesterday. It closed at
minus 21 per cent on its exchange rate mechanism divergence indicator, its
lowest level since August 1991. The unchanged repo rate also failed to
prevent sterling closing stronger against the currency, 1/4 pfennig higher
at DM2.4950.
Some dealers were also concerned that the Bundesbank was losing its grip on
the setting of Europe-wide interest rate policy. It was striking yesterday
that three-month Dutch guilders were  3/4 percentage point below the
corresponding German rate - but the Dutch currency remained at the top of
the Dutch central bank's self-imposed limit against the D-Mark in the ERM
grid.
Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist at UBS, believes the trend of D-Mark
weakness is set to continue. 'The D-Mark is slowly losing its anchor status
in the ERM,' he said. He believes that, in several months' time, the
currency markets' focus in Europe will be on the setting of French interest
rates rather than German ones.
Mr Steve Hannah, of IBJ International, believes that another dollar setback
will occur before the break through DM1.67 takes place. He thinks the two
key elements of a sustained dollar rise are not in place: clear signs of a
rise in US interest rates and certainty of the decline in German rates.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Expectations of cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN German money markets remained confident that the Bundesbank would
lower its short term interest rates soon, even though its repo rate remained
unchanged yesterday, writes James Blitz.
In recent days, Bundesbank officials have led the market to think that
monetary policy could be eased because of expectations that M3 money supply
growth would come down.
Expectations of rate-cutting were dampened yesterday after the Bundesbank
announced that the cost of lending short term funds to commercial banks via
the repo rate would remain unchanged at 7.60 per cent.
Short dated Euromark futures reflected some disappointment with the
unchanged policy, the September Euromark contract closing at 93.27, down 3
basis points on the day.
Nevertheless, at this level the contract is still pricing nearly 100 basis
points off three-month German cash in the next 12 weeks, projecting 6.73 per
cent in September.
That view reflects optimism that the Bundesbank will lower its official
rates again, with an outside chance that the discount rate will be reduced
at today's council meeting.
The Bundesbank has been concerned that cuts in German interest rates will
lead to a depreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar and other
currencies, leading to inflation. But it is striking that the D-Mark has
continued to decline in recent weeks in spite of unchanged German policy,
leading to suggestions that it is the scale of the German recession that now
concerns the foreign exchange markets.
At the same time, European central banks take the view that they can cut
rates to below German levels whatever the Bundesbank does. The Danes,
Italians and French have all cut rates in the past week.
Sterling markets were slightly more bullish for lower UK base rates
following Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech on Tuesday night.
The emphasis of the speech was on fostering UK growth and this helped the
September short sterling contract to rise 2 basis points on the day to
94.19.
Three-month sterling cash was  1/16 percentage point softer at 5 7/8 per
cent, helped by the swift despatch of a small daily shortage of Pounds 550m
in the discount market.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Law of diminishing returns hits
world fish catch - A crisis caused by over-exploitation of limited resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD fish catch declined in 1992 for the third consecutive year and
fisheries experts say that gross over-fishing is wrecking chances of
increasing output.
According to recent figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation, the 1992 catch was just under 97m tonnes compared with a
record 100m tonnes in 1989. Until then the world fish catch had risen
steadily, from little over 20m tonnes in the early 1950s. In both 1990 and
1991 the catch fell back from the 1989 peak.
The overall figures hide the even steeper decline in fish caught at sea. In
1992, the marine catch totalled about 80m tonnes, down from about 86m tonnes
in 1989. Catches from inland waters are continuing to grow, from 14m tonnes
in 1989 to 17m tonnes last year.
'We are going through a crisis in world fishing,' says FAO fisheries
specialist Mr Robin Welcomme. 'There are strains showing in the system.' All
the major fish resources in the world are under stress and to some extent
over-fished, he believes.
The FAO says that fish has been harvested under the misconception that
natural stocks are an unlimited natural resource, 'incapable of being
affected by fishing pressure'.
According to Mr Welcomme, the drop in sea catches is due to a large
over-capacity in fisheries equipment around the world - 'This makes for
over-fishing and means that fishing grounds are exploited long after they
should be'.
'When people see others making money from fisheries, they invest in new
fishing boats and equipment,' says Mr John Caddy, the chief of FAO's marine
resources division. 'At first the increased investment leads to increased
output, but now it is leading to a decline.'
With the protection afforded by the 200-mile exclusive economic zones,
agreed under the Law of the Sea treaty, many governments of developing
grounds have invested heavily in deep sea fishing fleets. 'They assume that
the more money they put in, the more they will get out, but that is not the
way it works,' says Mr Caddy.
By using 'vacuum cleaner' technology, large commercial trawlers have wrecked
the inshore fishing grounds of some developing countries, and the
livelihoods of small-scale fishermen.
In an effort to increase their shrimp catch, fishermen in parts of South
Asia are destroying the coastal mangrove forests, but as these are fish
nurseries the catches soon tail off, often within two years.
Fisheries experts believe that the only hope of raising the world's overall
fish catch is for much better management of sea fishing and the FAO is
supporting projects that help countries to manage their fisheries sectors.
The northern Mediterranean, the Gulf of Thailand, the southern part of the
North Sea and the seas of south-east Asia are the most overfished areas.
'The trouble is that countries that are supposed to know best, including the
European Community, have done nothing to stop overfishing,' says one expert.
China continues to be the world's largest fish producer with a rise in
output in 1992, mostly reflecting higher inland catches.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World wool markets are still far from buoyant as the end of the selling
season approaches. It is hard to discern much growth in demand in any of the
leading consuming countries, and there may be some softness in prices at
next week's closing sales, when the total offering will be substantially
larger than this week's. There is little change in prices for Bradford tops.
The AWC market indicator yesterday was 450 cents a kilogram compared with
459 cents a week before.

Jute exports, which account for 28 per cent of Bangladesh's annual export
income, rose in 1992-93 as world market prices fell by about 14 per cent,
agriculture officials said, reports Reuter from Dhaka. The country expects
to earn Dollars 430m from exports of 1.51m bales of raw jute and 594,000
tonnes of jute goods in 1992-93. In 1991-92 it earned Dollars 387.63m from
exports of 1.4m bales of raw jute and 496,000 tonnes of goods.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares for small jute
crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the favourable weather, India, the largest grower of jute, will
produce a small crop of about 6.5m bales (180 kg each) during the season
beginning next month. That would be down some 300,000 bales from the
estimated 1992-93 crop, but in the preceding two years as much as 9m bales
were harvested.
The quality of the next crop will be good, however, as the overflowing
canals and ponds will allow proper retting (softening) of jute.
Farmers in Assam, north Bengal and Bihar, have been unable to realise
adequate prices for raw jute this season, with the government price support
agency remaining virtually inactive. So they have reduced plantings of the
crop. The heavy carry over stocks from 1991-92 of nearly 3m bales kept
prices below the government's recommended minimum.
According to industry and trade officials, a recent recovery in jute prices
should continue into the 1993-94 season because it will open with stocks of
only about 1.6m bales. The total supply of 8.1m bales will just be enough to
meet the mill industry's requirement of 7.5m bales and village level
consumption of 600,000 bales. There will, however, be no surplus at the end
of the next season.
India's jute season must open with stocks equivalent to at least two months'
fibre supply to the mills, as the new crop starts arriving in the market in
volume from September. India will have to find a solution to the problem by
importing fibre from Bangladesh, which exports about 1.6m bales a year. But
Bangladesh may not have much surplus either in 1993-94 when its crop is
expected to be only 4.5m bales, down from 5.2m bales in 1992-93. It
certainly is not going to bail out India at the cost of its regular jute
buyers.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'End of an era' in sugar market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMISE of central buying agencies for raw sugar in the former Soviet
Union and China has ended the era of large-scale bulk raw sugar prices,
according to the June sugar market report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London
trading house.
This change in the nature of the market goes some way towards explaining why
news of the smallest Cuban sugar harvest for 30 years - 4.2m tonnes - failed
to boost world prices. 'In both China and Russia imports have, by and large,
been decentralised. The resulting trend towards disparate purchases is not
conducive to speculative hype,' says the report.
In addition, changing trade policies and depreciating currencies in eastern
Europe had left the market guessing about import quantities. Consumption was
also difficult to estimate for a large majority of the developing countries
with sensitive incomes.
Man described the fall in the Cuban harvest from 7m tonnes last year as 'a
major blow' to the country's sugar industry. While the extent of any
recovery next year was difficult to gauge, the certainty of continuing
economic problems and a potentially lower cane yield did not bode well.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin prices touch fresh 20-year
lows on LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPERATE CONDITIONS in the tin industry were reflected yesterday across the
world as prices in London touched fresh 20-year lows while in Kuala Lumpur
sellers were so appalled by the prices offered that in effect they staged a
strike.
For only the second time in its 40-year history the Kuala Lumpur tin market
failed to fix a price because of a rule requiring a daily turnover of at
least ten tonnes. 'At present unrealistic prices, nobody wants to sell tin,'
Mr Nazir Ariff, managing director of Datuk Keramat Smelting, told Reuter.
London dealers said buyers had been waiting for tin to fall to Dollars 5,000
a tonne, well below most mines' production costs, before putting in any
substantial orders.
At one stage yesterday the London Metal Exchange three months delivery tin
price fell to Dollars 5,070 a tonne, after dropping by Dollars 135 a tonne
or 3 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. In late trading it recovered to Dollars
5,112.50, up Dollars 17.50 from Tuesday's close.
Analysts warned that tin producers faced more hardship. The market was still
suffering from the impact of producer price support schemes that for many
years held prices artificially high and encouraged over-production. This
support ended in 1985 when the International Tin Council's buffer stock
operations collapsed in 1985, leaving 100,000 tonnes of tin stocks
overhanging the market. Since then the Association of Tin Producing
Countries, on which countries accounting for about 60 per cent of production
are represented, has attempted to limit exports, wear down the stocks and
keep prices up.
'There is now widespread frustration among members of the ATPC at the
futility of the export scheme. The feeling is growing that export curbs
should be scrapped and everyone should go out there and produce and export
all they can,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial
services group. This would cause prices to fall to a level where marginal
producers would be swept away.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst at the Commodities Research Unit consultancy
organisation, said the tin market was in deficit last year with consumption
184,500 tonnes and production 176,300. There was another 4,000-tonne deficit
in the first quarter of 1993 but stocks, at about 40,000 tonnes, roughly
double the required level, were weighing heavily on sentiment.
He said the ATPC's efforts had been undermined by substantial exports from
China and because Russia, previously a small net importer, was now a net
exporter.
Dozens of tin mines around the world have already closed and last month
Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, said
that, after suffering three successive years of losses, it would close all
its tin mines.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hard times ahead for Ecuador's
shrimp farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING RECORD exports last year, there are signs that Ecuador's shrimp
industry may be heading for a slump. Rising costs, low productivity and a
lack of investment capital are raising doubts about whether the country, the
world's fourth largest shrimp-cultivator, will be able to maintain its
market share.
Double-digit growth figures in 1991 and 1992 took total production of whole
shrimps to 125,000 tonnes, worth USDollars 526m. But export prices for
Ecuador's high quality white shrimps dropped consistently from Dollars 4.20
in 1986 to Dollars 3.10 in 1992.
Notwithstanding its strong growth, Ecuador's shrimp industry compares
unfavourably with its Asian competitors. Productivity is less than half
Thailand's 2,500 kg a hectare, for example.
'Had there not been an increase in the cultivation area, exports may have
dropped between 10 and 15 per cent,' says Mr Luis Villacis, president of the
National Federation of Shrimp Exporters: 'Our productivity has been
seriously affected by pollutants and diseases.'
Besides lacking the aggressive government support of its competitors,
Ecuador's shrimp farmers are facing a series of problems.
The price of diesel fuel, used to operate the pumps that continuously change
the water in the cultivating pools, has risen by 70 per cent since the
government began cutting energy subsidies last September.
High shipping costs out of Ecuador will continue to constrain profit margins
in the future. For a container of shrimps heading to Europe, an Ecuadorian
exporter pays a tariff of Dollars 7,500, while in a Chilean port that tariff
equals Dollars 3,500.
An increase in piracy in the Gulf of Guayaquil has resulted in the loss of
nearly Dollars 1m worth of shrimps being shipped to the packaging sites.
Military action has been ineffective and shrimp farmers have resorted to
hiring private security forces.
Industry analysts say that productivity could be boosted significantly if
diseases were controlled, nutrition improved and breeding pool sizes
optimised. But state funds for research have been cut back considerably and
with interest rates high and investment capital in short suply the private
sector seems unlikely to be able address these problems for some time.
One advantage that Ecuador has in the world market is that it is at present
the sole supplier of the vannamei, a white shrimp which is favoured by
consumers in the US, which takes more than 70 per cent of Ecuador's exports.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS aluminium shake-out seen
continuing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE NORMAL conditions are likely to return to the depressed aluminium
market by the end of 1994, Mr Allen Born, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Amax said yesterday.
Amax is in the process of effecting a merger with Cyprus Minerals in the
course of which Amax will spin off its large aluminium arm, Alumax.
Mr Born, speaking in London, said that this year and next would see a
continuing shake-out in the former Soviet Union where excess capacity was
depressing the aluminium markets. He believed that the Russians might close
some of the capacity down, and develop more fabricating operations to absorb
output.
'There is a need for more discipline in these markets,' he said.
Mr Born also said the outlook for copper 'looks good', though only for low
cost producers.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Tovarevic's pigs go wild for
acorns - Serbian farmer's answer to soaring feed costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE price of animal feed soared by 500 per cent because of UN sanctions
against Yugoslavia, Mr Toma Tovarevic moved his 1,300 pigs to a wood near
Belgrade to rear them on acorns.
Mr Tovarevic, who claims to be Serbia's largest pig producer, says that
veterinarians were afraid his pure-bred Yorkshires would never survive the
rigours of life in the wild.
'I was willing to take the risk. Otherwise, I'd be selling at well below
cost,' he says. 'In fact, it's worked out well.'
The pigs that hurtle out of the undergrowth in response to the sound of Mr
Tovarevic's jeep look the picture of health. They have the run of 28,000
hectares (70,000 acres) of state-owned oak and poplar woods beside the Sava
river, which provides them with a supply of extra protein in the form of
newts and frogs.
'They'll eat anything they find in this wood. I give them a little corn at
night and in the morning, but my feeding costs are down by more than 80 per
cent,' he says.
Mr Tovarevic pays nothing for using the Kupinovo wood. He took advantage of
a new law that opened up state forests to pasturage by local residents. His
main expense was building pig shelters, which are roofed with metal plates
from a bankrupt newspaper printing plant.
Mr Danilo Viskovic, a Belgrade University veterinarian, says: 'It takes an
extra month to get pigs raised in the open to market weight. But the quality
of the meat is better and you don't have as much illness as with pigs kept
in sties.'
Mr Tovarevic has also moved 150 beef cattle to the wood. He plans to add 500
sheep. 'The numbers would triple if it were still possible to export,' he
says.
Meat production in Serbia is down by an estimated 30 per cent this year.
Sanctions have eliminated a flourishing export trade in beef and lamb,
mainly to the Middle East. In addition, pork and baby beef was exported to
Greece and Italy.
Serbia earned about Dollars 87m in 1990 from exports of meat and meat
products, mostly ham, salami and bacon supplied to the former Soviet Union.
'We had well developed export arrangements for the Middle East. To avoid
having to export live animals, we slaughtered here according to Islamic
practice and sent butchered meat as air freight,' says Mr Milorad Gilic of
Srbcoop, a leading meat producer.
Srbcoop earned Dollars 7m from meat exports to Middle East countries in
1990, much of it produced on its own farms. Another Dollars 4m worth went to
western Europe.
Domestic sales are also shrinking as Serbia's economic position worsens.
With hyper-inflation taking hold, meat prices are rising by at least 100 per
cent each week. Few Serbian families in towns can afford to eat meat more
than once or twice a month.
In villages around Belgrade, pigs are being slaughtered at home to provide
stores of bacon and ham rather than being sent to market.
'It's not just that fewer people can afford to buy fresh meat. Our products
plant may have to close because salami and sausages are getting too
expensive,' Mr Gilic says.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices ease amid debate over interest
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEATED debate over whether Germany will cut interest rates today was the
focus for government bond traders and analysts throughout Europe. The
consensus by the close of trading was in favour of no change and the view
prompted German bund prices to end weaker on balance.
The bund future for September reflected the tussle of views. It opened at
94.97, was bought up to 95.18 on rate cut hopes and then sold back to 94.80
on currency factors before recovering slightly to close at 94.90 in London.
There was some disappointment that the weekly repo rate was left unchanged
at 7.6 per cent, but the real damage was done by the surge in the dollar
against the D-Mark.
The two pfennig rise sprang from a shift of money into the US currency on
comments from an official Bonn source that the government was not worried
about the D-Mark's level.
Mr Julian Callow, a European economist with Kleinwort Benson, said: 'In some
respects the worst fears of the Bundesbank concerning the intentions of
foreign investors have been realised.'
THE net slide in German long-dated bonds was countered by a rise in the
French equivalents. The disparate moves resulted in a new historic low for
the OAT-bund yield spread which narrowed by two basis points to 0.16.
On the Matif, French June futures opened strongly and broke through a key
resistance level to hit 118.92 before profit-taking took it back to 118.86,
up four basis points on the day.
UK government bonds performed strongly yesterday as dealers focused on the
deflationary pressure of actual and expected economic data.
The market shrugged off Tuesday's 'Mansion House' speech on the economy by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
However, a fall of 0.2 per cent in retail sales against expectations of a
rise reversed any concerns that inflation might be about to take off.
It also came ahead of the latest unemployment data which are expected to
show a month-on-month rise of 10,000 after recent falls and add to pressure
for a further interest rate cut to kick-start the economy.
Short-dated gilts were sluggish but at the long end they were ahead by
around and gilt futures for September rose  3/8 to 104 25/32 by the close.
IN THE high yielding European markets, Spanish government bonds picked up
sharply as the market took heart from a meeting between Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the prime minister, and a representative of the communist-led United Left as
well as rate cut optimism. The yield on the 10.3 per cent bond due June 2002
fell 18 basis points to 10.52 per cent.
DUTCH government bonds ended marginally lower across the curve as the
Ministry of Finance announced that its new 6.25 per cent state bond maturing
in July 1998 had raised Fl 9bn in three days.
US Treasury prices were flat-to-firmer across the board yesterday as the
market struggled to establish a new trading range in the wake of the recent
good inflation figures.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 103
15/32 , yielding 6.811 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent.
The day's economic news had little impact on sentiment. Industrial
production rose 0.2 per cent in May, while capacity utilisation was
unchanged at 81.6 per cent. May housing starts, meanwhile, rose 2.4 per
cent.
The data was broadly in line with analysts' expectations, and made little
impression on dealers and investors, who were hoping in vain yesterday that
the market would establish a decisive new trading range after the easing of
inflation concerns.

JAPAN Securities Dealers Association is to admit banks as special members

'It is not clear when authorities will actually give a go-ahead for the
first securities subsidiaries of banks,' JSDA said. 'But the overall
direction has been set.'
Bank units' operations will be restricted to the primary market, and will
need to ask ordinary brokerages to trade equity-linked bonds they lead
manage, JSDA said. The bank units will ask one JSDA-member brokerage to make
a market in such bonds, and JSDA will appoint another as a second
market-maker.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Ontario global offering raised to
Dollars 2bn to meet demand

THE Province of Ontario was the talk of the international bond markets
yesterday with the launch of its Dollars 2bn, seven-year global bond
offering.
The deal was increased from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn reflecting strong
demand from investors in the Far East and Europe, and so dealers expect the
bonds to be priced at the tighter end of the indicated range to yield 64
basis points over the US Treasury bond. The lead managers gave an indicated
range of 64-66 basis points over the Treasury bond.
The Province of Ontario, which has an AA2/AA credit rating, is a fairly
frequent borrower in the international capital markets, usually preferring
to launch global US dollar or Canadian dollar deals.
Mr John Madden, assistant deputy minister of finance, said yesterday that
the Province has a 1993-1994 borrowing requirement of CDollars 10bn. 'We
have already pre-borrowed CDollars 2bn and this latest global bond issue is
the equivalent of another CDollars 2.5bn,' he said. The Province of Ontario
borrowed CDollars 14bn in fixed income in 1992-1993 to fund a CDollars 12bn
deficit.
Salomon Brothers, which is joint book-runner with Goldman Sachs, said
investors were hungry for dollar bonds 'because there hasn't been that much
sovereign or supranational paper in dollars and there won't be much in the
seven-year area, so people want a good liquid benchmark'.
The province's 10-year dollar paper is trading at a yield spread of about 70
basis points in the secondary market.
The other main dollar deal of the day was LKB Baden Wurttemberg Finance's
Dollars 500m 10-year bond issue. The deal, which was marketed as a 'hybrid
dragon-Eurobond', was targetted at Asian and European investors. It was
priced to yield 25 basis points over the US Treasury bond, but the spread
widened out in the course of the day.
Nomura, the lead manager, said the spread widened to 26-28 basis points, but
other houses said they were quoting a spread of around 30 basis points in
London.
Elsewhere in the market, Deutsche Bank Finance raised Y50bn with a five-year
bond issue lead managed by Daiwa Europe. The lead manager said this is the
first public borrowing in yen by Deutsche Bank Finance. The proceeds were
swapped into floating-rate yen because of the attractive arbitrage
opportunities.
Norsk-Hydro has launched a Dollars 300m Yankee bond issue in the US domestic
market, writes Tracy Corrigan. The 30-year non-callable bonds carry a coupon
of 7 3/4 per cent and were priced to yield 97 basis points over the
comparable US Treasury. The deal was arranged by Morgan Stanley.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it has lowered its senior
long-term rating for debt issued by Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals
group, to A- from A, while the short-term rating has been lowered to A-2
from A-1.
A meeting between Bulgarian government officials and commercial bank
creditors has produced no results so far, according to a spokesman for
Deutsche Bank, the German bank hosting the talks, Reuter reports from
Frankfurt.
The talks focus on Bulgaria's ability to pay interest and principal on its
Dollars 9.3bn foreign bank debt. The two sides are split on the size of the
payments, which are part of a debt restructuring package.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Equity Issues: Korean stock shortage boosts
demand for GDRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for global depositary receipts and convertible Eurobonds issued by
Korean companies has been boosted by the lack of availability of Korean
stocks.
Although the Korean stock market has been partially opened to foreign
investors, under Korean regulations foreign investors cannot hold more than
10 per cent of the shares in any Korean company, and that limit has already
been reached in many cases.
Consequently, foreign investors are willing to pay a premium to get hold of
paper, which has fuelled issuance of GDRs and convertibles, which are not
covered by the rules.
Samsung Electronics's Dollars 150m recent issue of global depositary
receipts, priced at the end of last week, was five times oversubscribed,
according to lead manager Goldman Sachs. As a result, many participants in
the deal were disappointed with their small allocations of paper.
The lead manager reported an even spread of demand from Europe, the Far East
and the US, where the GDRs are being placed under the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission's Rule 144A.
The deal was the second GDR issue for Samsung, which is a favourite Korean
stock, along with others in the electronics sector.
The new GDRs were priced at Dollars 29.50, compared with Dollars 30.25 for
the outstanding GDRs, and at a premium of 23 per cent (compared with 25 per
cent, the current premium of the original GDR issue, with which the new GDRs
become fungible early next year).
Given the strong demand for the paper, a number of other Korean companies
are also eyeing the market.
Ssangyong Oil, the private-sector oil company, is contemplating a Dollars
150m convertible issue, while Jinro, a drinks manufacturer, may launch a
Dollars 30m issue of convertible bonds.

INDUS Motor, the Karachi-based affiliate of Toyota, yesterday appealed for
reversal of a reduction on import duties for cars, announced in Monday's
Pakistani budget.
Monday's budget reduced import tariffs and other taxes for cars across the
board, with the duties on 1300cc cars, similar to the Corolla assembled by
Indus, reduced from 197 per cent to 100 per cent.
In response to the company's plea, the government yesterday announced it was
setting up a committee to consider appeals from Indus and any other
companies who claimed to be affected.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, said that the committee would begin
hearings within 72 hours and finalise its recommendations within the next
two weeks.
Indus Motor began producing Corollas in April this year, from its Rs1.5bn
(Dollars 56.43m) plant at Qasim, near Karachi.
The plant has an annual capacity of between 20,000 and 40,000 vehicles.
Toyota has a 25 per cent stake in the company.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Salomon Bros lures Warburg
director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the three managing directors of SG Warburg's German operations is
leaving the German arm of the UK investment bank to become a managing
director of Salomon Brothers in Germany.
The departure of Mr Nicholas Coulson follows the defection of Warburg's
German highly-rated equity analyst team to Goldman Sachs earlier this year,
combined with other difficulties in the German market, which is notoriously
difficult for foreign financial institutions to penetrate.
Mr Piers von Simson, head of Warburg's European investment banking
activities, said that Mr Coulson's departure was 'part of the normal comings
and goings of investment banking staff'.
Mr von Simson said the departure was regretted. He said, however, that
corporate finance relationships with German corporations would not be
damaged since he had handled these personally from his base in London.
Mr Coulson joined Warburg in London in 1984 and moved to the bank's German
operations in 1990. In 1991 the bank established a wholly-owned German
subsidiary to complement the acquisition of Berwein Wertpapierhandels- und
Borsenmakler, Munich's leading specialist brokerage house in 1989.
Warburg has won some large corporate finance mandates in Germany, for
example advising the Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency, on its
sale of Interhotel, the east German hotel chain.
It won a high profile advising Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB),
Germany's second largest insurance group, in its defence last year against
what were then the unwelcome attentions of Assurances Generales de France.
But Warburg's advice was not heeded and the two companies reconciled their
differences.
Warburg lost Pounds 11.6m (Dollars 17.8m) last year on the closure of the
German arm of its Pallas Leasing Group, an important factor behind
disappointing figures at the Warburg group last year. These leasing
operations were not managed by Warburg's German subsidiary.
Warburg is in the process of transferring its German operations, which
employ over 60 people, from Munich to Frankfurt.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: SA group bids for Hungary's
largest brewer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN Breweries (SAB), South Africa's largest consumer goods
company, emerged yesterday as the preferred bidder for Kobanyai Sorgyar,
Hungary's largest and oldest brewery.
SAB has won the right to exclusive negotiations for four weeks to acquire
state-owned Kobanyai Sorgyar, the State Property Agency (SPA), Hungary's
privatisation authority, announced yesterday. An SPA decision to name a
leading bidder generally determines the outcome of a transaction.
Under discussion is a controlling stake - in excess of 75 per cent - in
Kobanyai Sorgyar. Privatisation advisers estimate the total value of the
transaction at more than Dollars 100m.
The planned investment includes the purchase price, a capital injection and
the funding of development over five years. The total has surpassed the
Hungarian authorities' most optimistic expectations.
The sale of Kobanyai is one of the largest Hungarian privatisations so far
this year, and if successful, SAB will become the largest South African
investor in eastern Europe.
SAB is the world's seventh largest brewer, but the planned Hungarian
acquisition marks its first significant foray into Europe.
The South African brewer's sales are concentrated in the home market, which
it dominates, and expansion was until recently hampered by South Africa's
international isolation.
SAB's 10 breweries manufacture 99 per cent of South Africa's beer and,
according to the 1992 annual report, it exports to 47 countries. In the year
to March, SAB made attributable profits of R825m (Dollars 258m), of which
R541m came from the beer division.
Mr Meyer Kahn, SAB chairman, has often stressed that the company understood
developing markets, and this was where any offshore activity would be
targeted. However, the group continues to be secretive about its offshore
activities, saying it is not in the interests of shareholders to divulge
details.
Kobanyai Sorgyar's market share of about 35 per cent and annual sales of
about 3.5m hectolitres make it the largest Hungarian beer producer. The
company made Ft296m (Dollars 3.4m) profits after tax in 1992 on revenues of
Ft7.6bn.
But it was also the most indebted in the sector and technically backward,
Hungarian officials say.
The identification of a buyer for Kobanyai Sorgyar almost completes the
privatisation of Hungary's brewing industry. The SPA is expected within the
next two weeks to announce a preferred bidder for another brewer, Pannonia
Sorgyar.
Of Hungary's seven breweries, Brau of Austria has acquired two, while
Interbrew of Belgium, Heineken of the Netherlands and the management of
Nagykanizsai Sorgyar have each taken control of one.
Investors already present in the market were barred from the tender for
Kobanyai.

BROKEN HILL Proprietary (BHP), Australia's largest listed company, has said
that although it is not planning a large acquisition, it is financially in a
position to make investments of any size, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
A BHP spokesman said chief executive Mr John Prescott's statement in a
newspaper interview that the oil, minerals and steel giant could make an
acquisition of any size was made in a response to a question about its
strong balance sheet and its expansion plans.
'He wasn't indicating we were about to do anything mammoth,' the spokesman
said. 'We have a lot of options open.'
Mr Prescott said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review
newspaper: 'I think we are very clearly in the situation that we could make
any quality investment that we wanted to make - of any scale.'
He was also quoted as saying that BHP would issue figures in a few weeks
showing it had reduced its gearing in the year to May 31 from the 48.2 per
cent level at May 31 1992.
Mr Prescott indicated it would 'be a little less than that', the spokesman
said.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: US 'warehouse clubs' in deal to
merge operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MERGER was announced yesterday between two of the largest operators of
'warehouse clubs' in the US.
San Diego-based Price Company, which pioneered the highly-successful retail
concept, and Costco, with headquarters at Kirkland, near Seattle, announced
yesterday that they planned to combine their operations in a new company
called Price/Costco.
It will take in 195 membership warehouses - huge out-of-town retail barns,
which sell merchandise at rock-bottom prices - in three countries. Annual
sales will stand at around Dollars 16bn. Both have disclosed plans to open
warehouse club outlets in the UK - with Price Club setting up a joint
venture with Littlewoods.
Under the deal, shares in the new company will be issued on the basis of
2.13 shares for each Price Company share, and one share for each Costco
share. Price Company shareholders will own about 48 per cent of the new
merged group, while Costco shareholders, who include France's Carrefour,
will have 52 per cent. Price shares soared Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 38 on
the news, while Costco gained Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 18 3/4 .
Top positions at the merged company will be filled by executives from both
companies, and the Price/Costco board will comprise an equal number of
directors. There will be home offices in both San Diego and Kirkland,
although the information and accounting systems will be centred in the
former city, and buying and merchandising in the latter.
The warehouse club movement has been one of the most dynamic elements in the
US retail sector in the recent years, where sales reached around Dollars
33bn in 1992. However, sales have slowed sharply recently, and analysts have
noted that certain geographical markets were over-crowded.
Accordingly, there have been predictions of consolidations. Last month,
Wal-Mart Stores, the largest US operator of warehouse clubs through its Sams
Club chain, said it was buying 14 outlets from Kmart, the number two
operator via the Pace Membership Warehouses. Costco and Price Company rank
third and fourth respectively, in terms of outlets operated.

<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, plans to broaden its presence
in the US by launching an expansion and acquisition drive through its
Chicago-based subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp.
BoM yesterday named Mr Alan McNally, vice-chairman for personal and
commercial banking, as Harris's new chief executive. He replaces Mr Kenneth
West, who has been chief executive since BoM bought Harris nine years ago.
Mr McNally will have a mandate to triple Harris's branch network and assets,
currently almost USDollars 13bn, within the next 10 years. Harris will focus
efforts on Illinois, as well as other surrounding states, including Michigan
and Ohio.
Ms Linda Stromberg, an analyst at Howe Barnes in Chicago, described Harris
as a 'sleepy, conservative' institution, which has failed to capitalise on
the easing of Illinois' curbs on branch banking.
These curbs have left the state with a highly fragmented banking industry,
with about 1,200 separate institutions.
Ms Stromberg predicts a rash of mergers and consolidations over the next few
months. Some powerful regional banks based in nearby states have also
signalled an interest in the Illinois market.
Bank of Montreal, with assets of CDollars 109bn (USDollars 85.8bn), set a
target in 1990 of boosting the contribution of US business to 50 per cent of
earnings. But it has been little changed at around 25-26 per cent.

HEWLETT-Packard said orders grew by 19 per cent during the first six weeks
of the current quarter. The growth rate, although down from the 26 per cent
order growth of the first half of the year, was within management's
expectations, the computer and electronics company said.
The unusual interim performance report was issued by HP after a sharp drop
in its share price yesterday. The shares fell Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 79.50
in heavy early morning trading following a report that Mr Lewis Platt, HP
president and chief executive, had warned of slowing order and revenue
growth in the second half.
HP executives, including Mr Platt, spoke with financial analysts in
Frankfurt, Germany, yesterday, the company said.
'One news report on the Frankfurt meeting erroneously mentioned that we
discussed the possibility of slower revenue growth in the third quarter,'
said Mr Robert Wayman, HP chief financial officer. 'We didn't comment on
revenue, since it is far too early to say anything meaningful about revenue
for the quarter.'
Company officials expressed surprise at the reaction to cautionary comments
regarding order growth, which reiterated similar remarks made by company
executives at an analysts' meeting in New York last month.
At that meeting, Mr Wayman told analysts: 'Customers will buy strong
products even in a difficult environment, but I don't think we can
extrapolate our first-half order-growth rates out into the future.' He noted
that the worldwide economic environment was very mixed, with several leading
economies in recession.
HP's shares regained some early losses after it issued the interim order
growth report, and closed down Dollars 3 3/8 at Dollars 83 5/8 . HP last
month reported first-half net income of Dollars 608m, up from Dollars 293m
in the same period of 1992.

TIFFANY, the New York-based jewellers, is taking over management and
marketing responsibility for 29 Tiffany boutiques in Japan, currently
operated by Mitsukoshi, the country's leading department store.
Mitsukoshi accounts for more than 90 per cent of Tiffany's sales in Japan.
The move will give the US group greater flexibility to distribute its
products to other Japanese retailers. Mitsukoshi owns 14 per cent of
Tiffany.
The decision will also relieve Mitsukoshi's mounting inventory of Tiffany
products, which have been hit by the sharp fall in Japan's consumer demand
for luxury goods.
As a result, Tiffany will take an after-tax charge of about Dollars 32.7m
against its second-quarter earnings.
Tiffany said that the charge stemmed from a Dollars 57.5m product return
reserve which it had established as result of its decision to repurchase
most of the Mitsukoshi's Tiffany stocks over the next four years.
Under the new arrangement, Tiffany will provide the merchandising and
management expertise for the 29 boutiques, while Mitsukoshi continues to
provide and maintain the locations and staffing. Tiffany previously sold the
merchandise on a wholesale basis to Mitsukoshi.
The two companies have also agreed to set up a new marketing operation to
look over marketing and promotion planning for sales of Tiffany products in
Japan.
Tiffany and Mitsukoshi's relationship started in 1972.

forecast of shortfall for year

<TEXT>
SHARES in USAir, the US airline in which British Airways holds a minority
stake, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 yesterday after the
Arlington-based carrier said that it expects to make an after-tax loss this
year.
USAir said: 'In addition, based on results of operations for the months of
April and May and a projection of June results, the company, which had
expected to be profitable in the second quarter, currently anticipates that
it will sustain a net loss for the quarter'.
USAir stressed the results for both the full year and the second quarter
should show an improvement over those recorded in 1992. But it said the
shortfall over previous expectations stemmed from sluggish revenue growth -
which it blames on the general economic conditions.
'Management has taken a number of steps recently to stimulate traffic and
generate increased revenues, including reducing leisure fares in certain
short-haul markets, and will be reviewing further measures to enhance
revenues and reduce costs,' said Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chairman.
USAir managed to make a Dollars 2m operating profit in the first three
months of 1993, although its significant interest charges meant that this
translated into an after-tax loss of Dollars 61m - down from an underlying
Dollars 110.2m deficit in the same period of 1992.
Last year, its after-tax loss was Dollars 1.2bn, although the deficit was
inflated by a number of extraordinary items. The adjusted operating loss
stood at Dollars 166.4m, down from Dollars 219.4m in 1991.

MR Conrad Black and his associates are making more shares in Hollinger, the
Canadian holding company for Mr Black's international publishing interests,
available to the public.
Argus Corporation, a company controlled by Mr Black, plans to sell up to
2.5m Hollinger common shares to the public, starting on June 22. The shares,
4.6 per cent of Hollinger's 54.5m outstanding shares, will be sold through
BBN James Capel of Toronto.
Argus is controlled by Ravelston Corp, a private company owned by Mr Black
and a handful of business associates. Ravelston presently owns 47.5 per cent
of Hollinger.
Mr Black and other Hollinger employees have separately converted options in
the form of preferred shares into 1.1m Hollinger common shares. The bulk of
these shares are expected to be sold into the market.
At Hollinger's current share price of CDollars 13.13, Argus will raise about
CDollars 33m (USDollars 25.9m) from its share sale. It said the proceeds
would be used to repay debt 'in furtherance of the objective of both Argus
and Hollinger to reduce debt'.
Moody's Investors Services has confirmed its ratings of Seagram's USDollars
3bn senior and subordinated debt at single A2 and A3 following the group's
purchase of 5.7 per cent of Time Warner for Dollars 700m.
While Seagram carries its 24 per cent holding in Du Pont, the chemicals and
energy giant, at Dollars 3.3bn, the market value is Dollars 8.4bn and well
above 'the Dollars 5bn debt Seagram might have to carry if it raised its
Time Warner holding to 15 per cent'. said Moody's.
Seagram has the liquidity to provide ample financial flexibility to carry
the cost of an expanded Time Warner position despite the minimal dividends
likely to be received, Moody's added.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal plans to expand
presence in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, plans to broaden its presence
in the US by launching an expansion and acquisition drive through its
Chicago-based subsidiary, Harris Bankcorp.
BoM yesterday named Mr Alan McNally, vice-chairman for personal and
commercial banking, as Harris's new chief executive. He replaces Mr Kenneth
West, who has been chief executive since BoM bought Harris nine years ago.
Mr McNally will have a mandate to triple Harris's branch network and assets,
currently almost USDollars 13bn, within the next 10 years. Harris will focus
efforts on Illinois, as well as other surrounding states, including Michigan
and Ohio.
Ms Linda Stromberg, an analyst at Howe Barnes in Chicago, described Harris
as a 'sleepy, conservative' institution, which has so far failed to
capitalise on the gradual easing of Illinois' curbs on branch banking.
These curbs have left the state with a highly fragmented banking industry,
with about 1,200 separate institutions.
Ms Stromberg predicts a rash of mergers and consolidations over the next few
months. Some powerful regional banks based in nearby states have also
signalled an interest in the Illinois market.
Harris is the third biggest downtown Chicago bank, after First Chicago and
Continental Illinois. One of its smaller rivals, LaSalle, was bought by
ABN-Amro of the Netherlands in 1989. Since then, LaSalle has acquired a
number of savings and loan institutions which it has turned into bank
branches.
Bank of Montreal, with assets of CDollars 109bn (USDollars 85.8bn), set a
target in 1990 of boosting the contribution of US business to 50 per cent of
earnings. But the US component has so far remained little changed at around
25-26 per cent.
BoM also announced a reorganisation yesterday which would bring its US and
Canadian corporate and investment banking business under a single North
American umbrella. The bank will in future be divided into four divisions.
Besides North American corporate and investment banking, the new units will
comprise BoM's core retail and small-business operations in Canada, and
similar operations of Harris in the US.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Good times keep rolling for junk
bonds - The market's insatiable appetite for high-yield debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So far this year Dollars 23.7bn in new high-yield debt - junk bonds - has
been issued in the US, putting the market on course to smash last year's
record-breaking Dollars 38bn total.
Although the mid-to-late 1980s are traditionally regarded as the heyday of
junk bonds, the volume of high-yield debt coming to the market over the past
18 months has far exceeded anything seen when Mr Michael Milken, the
one-time junk bond king of Drexel Burnham Lambert, was at the height of his
powers.
Companies have been queueing up to issue junk bonds and investors have been
eager to buy them, rushing to get into high-yield debt because the returns
have been so rewarding. In the past 18 months high-yield securities have
outperformed most other leading asset groups.
Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street securities house, says that its master index
of high-yield debt achieved a total return of 18.2 per cent in 1992. In
comparison, the Standard &amp; Poors' 500 index of leading US stocks returned
7.6 per cent last year, and 10-year US government securities returned 6.5
per cent.
Junk bonds are also outstripping the opposition this year. In the first five
months of 1993 Merrill's high-yield index posted a return of 8.4 per cent,
against 4.5 per cent for the S&amp;P 500 and 6.1 per cent for 10-year government
securities.
The huge volume coming to the market has inevitably raised questions about
how long the boom in junk bonds can last. And if the boom does end, will the
market come crashing down as it did at the end of the 1980s?
Fears of a sharp downward correction have intensified in recent months
because of the pace of new issuance, and the willingness of investors to buy
higher-risk debt from companies with very low debt ratings. At the same
time, concern has grown that interest rates may be heading higher if the
Federal Reserve is forced to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation.
Rising interest rates would make junk bonds look less attractive compared
with other assets, and if a number of low-rated issuers were to start
defaulting on their paper because of the poor state of the economy,
investors might stampede out of junk and into more secure assets, triggering
a collapse in the high-yield market.
This may be the worst-case scenario, but it has escaped no one's notice that
similar conditions existed prior to the collapse in junk bond values at the
end of the 1980s.
Yet, Wall Street remains upbeat about the outlook for the junk bond market -
which is not surprising, because securities firms and investment banks earn
huge fees underwriting and selling high-yield debt.
Much depends on the direction of interest rates. The key factor behind the
boom in junk bonds has been the sharp decline in US interest rates over the
past two years. To maintain their income stream, yield-sensitive investors
were forced by falling rates to buy either longer-dated investment-grade
debt, higher-yielding junk bonds, or stocks. Of the three categories, junk
bonds benefited most from the huge inflows of investor cash.
If the short-term rates rise, however, those inflows to the high-yield
market will certainly slow, warns Mr Martin Fridson, head of high-yield
research at Merrill Lynch. And if investors' appetite for high-yield debt
shrinks, the number of companies issuing high-yield securities would also
fall. How far and fast the market tumbles depends upon how far and fast
interest rates rise.
He believes that as long as any rise in short-term interest rates is modest,
a dramatic slump in the high-yield market is unlikely.
The only event that could shatter the junk boom would have to be so
calamitous that it would probably wreak havoc on other asset groups as well.
Mr Fridson is optimistic, however. He says. 'I don't see anything out there
that would cause the high-yield market to collapse that would not also
affect equity and long-term bond markets.' An analyst at another big Wall
Street firm says the same thing: 'I don't see a reason, unique to the
market, for a pull-back.'
Most analysts do not believe that comparisons between the current market and
1989 are valid. Four years ago one of the key problems was the growing share
of the market taken up by relatively small (under Dollars 100m) issues of
very low-rated debt - the category of debt that is the least liquid and the
most likely to default.
Although more small, low-rated issues have been coming to the market in the
past year, Mr Fridson says this is not particularly worrying, because what
matters is not the absolute number of low-rated small issues, but their
dollar share of the overall market, which is still low by historical
standards.
Between 1987 and 1988, 60 per cent of the junk market was taken up by the
high-risk category of low-rated debt issues. Last year, that share was only
15 per cent, and in the first five months of this year it has fallen further
to 10 per cent.
The number of high-risk issues may have been rising, but they have been far
outnumbered by the volume of better-quality debt coming to the market, says
Mr Fridson. 'Overall, this is still a pretty conservative market.'
Ms Diane Vazza, director of high-yield research at the ratings agency
Standard &amp; Poors, agrees. She says that credit quality has improved
considerably over the past two years and the recent surge in small,
first-time issuers has done little to undermine that improvement.
Also, for the junk bond market to collapse, issuers would have to start
defaulting on their debt. Yet, default rates are currently running at low
levels. The rate peaked in 1991 when 10.7 per cent of high-yield issues
defaulted. By last year, however, it had fallen to 5.9 per cent.
This year, the market looks even more stable, says Ms Vazza. In the first
five months of 1993 there have been only four defaults of high-yield
corporate debt, representing Dollars 300m of a market total of Dollars
200bn.
Ms Vazza says: 'We expect the default rate this year to be down dramatically
from 1992.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: SE Banken to call on
shareholders for financial aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's
leading commercial bank, yesterday agreed that the first step towards
recapitalising the loss-hit group should be a call on its shareholders.
In a joint statement on negotiations under way since SE Banken applied for
state support late last year, the two sides said a conclusion on government
aid would not be reached until the August-September period.
However, they said it was agreed that 'the bank's capital base should in the
first place be strengthened by additional contributions from the owners of
the bank'.
It added that SE Banken would 'analyse the prerequisites for an issue of new
shares' over the summer, but gave no details of the scope of such an issue.
SE Banken's senior shareholder is the Wallenberg family, Sweden's powerful
industrial dynasty, which holds about 7 per cent.
The announcement, released shortly after the Stockholm stock market closed,
effectively confirmed that recent improvements in SE Banken's operating
conditions had removed any urgent need for state support, originally sought
because the bank was in danger of falling below the international capital
ratio minimum of 8 per cent.
With non-performing loans totalling about SKr25bn (Dollars 3.5bn) and
further heavy losses expected this year after the SKr5.4bn operating loss in
1992, it remains unclear to what extent, if any, the state will still need
to provide aid beyond a general commitment issued in February to keep the
bank solvent.
In recent weeks, SE Banken shares have risen sharply on speculation that
direct government aid might not be required. This followed publication of
the first-quarter results, which showed a 55 per cent cut in operating
losses thanks to a sharp rise in operating profits before loan losses.
Yesterday, the most traded A shares closed at SKr38, up more than five times
since April.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the bank's chief executive, acknowledged that the rising
stock price, falling interest rates, a strengthening of the Swedish krona
and better underlying performance had improved SE Banken's position. But he
warned substantial risk still attached to loan losses which have come mainly
from the crippled property sector.
The government, which has laid out SKr74bn in aid to the stricken banking
sector and has been forced to take over Gotabanken and Nordbanken, would
clearly like SE Banken to earn its way out of trouble.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said last week she was concerned to
avoid any risk of a credit squeeze imposed by financially-strapped banks
choking off an anticipated slow move out of recession later this year.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: KOP slips as loan losses
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has reported a
group loss before taxes and provisions of FM626m (Dollars 116m) in the first
four months as loan losses grew to FM933m. But the bank said it still
intended to achieve its target this year of halving its FM3.7bn 1992 loss.
The figures showed a sharp deterioration compared with the same period in
1992, when losses were FM527m.
However, KOP said the results were not directly comparable because the 1992
figures did not include the acquisition late last year of STS-Bank and
because the one third share of full-year loan losses then estimated at
FM728m fell well short of the actual FM1.42bn.
The estimated full loan loss figure for 1993 is FM2.8bn, compared with
FM4.27bn in 1992. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chairman, said the goal of cutting
the 1992 overall loss in half this year was 'a demanding target, but our
recent performance suggests that it is not beyond reach'.
The portfolio of non-performing loans held by KOP grew to FM8.2bn at the end
of April from FM7.1bn at the end of 1992 - in spite of the exclusion of
FM2.8bn in non-performing loans in a STS-Bank unit for which the government
has assumed 90 per cent of the risk.
However, Mr Voutilainen said non-performing loans appeared to be reaching a
plateau.
'The improvement in the bank's performance in the current year is based
largely on this assumption,' he added.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool Europe sells
refrigerator plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL Europe, part of the big US white goods group, has agreed to sell
its Barcelona refrigerator plant to IAR/Siltal, the fast-growing Italian
commercial refrigeration and domestic appliances group.
Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is significant for both
companies. Whirlpool Europe said it reflected implementation of a strategy
to rationalise industrial operations to meet customer needs.
The Barcelona plant produces 130,000 units a year with 270 employees, and
was considered too small to fit Whirlpool's philosophy of large-scale,
highly automated manufacture. Whirlpool Europe said this was its first such
deal, but others were not excluded.
The US-owned company said it had received more attractive offers for the
plant, but the deal with IAR/Siltal ensured continuity of operation.
IAR/Siltal will acquire full ownership of the plant at the end of July. It
will sell part of its output to Whirlpool for distribution in Spain and
elsewhere in Europe under a four-year supply contract.
The deal represents a big foreign expansion for IAR/Siltal, which has annual
revenues of L240bn (Dollars 162m), employs 1,100 people and operates four
plants in Italy. Based near Alessandria, it grew fast in the late 1980s
through acquisitions.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Daimler sees significant profits
recovery next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, is on course for a
significant profits recovery next year, the group's finance director said
yesterday.
Mr Gerhard Liener said that next year's profits could be twice as high as in
the current year. This means a figure of around DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) for
next year after an expected DM1bn for this year and DM1.45bn last year.
The prediction will surprise analysts who have been whittling back their
forecasts in the wake of the group's dire first-quarter figures.
Last month, Daimler announced that it made net profits of just DM20m for the
first quarter of the year, down from DM480m in the same period last year.
Mr Liener's optimism is based primarily on high expectations for the group's
Mercedes-Benz luxury car subsidiary which this week launched its new C-class
smaller executive car, the long-awaited successor to the 11-year-old
Mercedes-Benz 190-Series.
Combined with the impact of cost-cutting measures across the Daimler-Benz
group as a whole, the effect will be a 'fundamental improvement' in
Daimler's profitability from 1994 onwards.
The profits will feed through early enough to ensure that the group makes
about DM1bn net profit for the whole of this year, he said.
'The C-class is a great success story,' Mr Liener. 'It was only this week
that the model was presented to the German public and I can already predict
that every C-class car we produce this year will be sold without having to
grant any discount.'
The production target for the new model for this year is 120,000 units, Mr
Liener said, rising to 240,000 next year. He said that 40,000 units have
been ordered in Germany. For next year, he said order volume could be in the
region of 260,000 to 270,000, which compares to annual sales of 190,000 of
the 190-Series over the past decade.
Mr Liener said that by the middle of 1994, the group would have cut 40,000
jobs, approximately 10 per cent of the workforce, since the beginning of the
economic downturn in Germany.
The total cost of these measures will be DM3bn-DM4bn which will be booked
against current year profits; the annual savings in 1994 onwards will be in
the same order of magnitude.
'By next year all the costs associated with the reduction of the workforce
will have been digested,' Mr Liener said, 'that is why I feel so confident
that 1994 profits will be considerably increased on the 1993 figures. They
could be as much as double the current year figures.'
He predicted that the severity of the recession in Germany this year would
have abated somewhat by next year, partly as a result of lower interest
rates.
This would help the group's performance, as would an expected strengthening
of the US dollar versus the D-Mark which could provide an impetus to the
group's export sales later this year.
Scepticism about the group's profit outlook has caused the Daimler share
price to fall this year to DM602.40 down from a high this year of DM628.50.
Present expectations for next year's net profits range from DM1.1bn to
DM1.4bn.

KUHNE &amp; Nagel, the private Swiss-based forwarding group, said consolidated
net income last year nearly doubled to a record SFr38.6m (Dollars 27.6m),
but it anticipated a flat performance this year.
The group, in which Lonhro sold a 50 per cent stake for DM340m (Dollars
212m) last year, said the remarkably strong result was due to the
elimination of special spending, a considerable improvement in the business
structure and profitability of its west European countries and the
consolidation of its position in North America and Asia Pacific.
Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne, the chairman, said at the group's annual press
conference that the first four months of the current year were above budget
but trading conditions were deteriorating and he was sceptical about further
profit growth in the full year.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi creditors meet Bank of
Italy officials
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING bank creditors of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group met Bank of Italy
officials yesterday as the collapse in the company's share price took on a
new political dimension.
The meeting came against signs that foreign banks, which have lent to
Ferruzzi, might be invited on to the five-bank committee of leading
creditors. Mr Guido Rosa, the local head of France's Societe Generale and
chairman of the foreign bankers' association in Italy, may join the talks as
the foreigners' representative.
The Bank of Italy has moved into the fray as the scale of Ferruzzi's
financial difficulties have become more evident in recent days. The group
and family holding company is known to have total borrowings of about
L31,000bn (Dollars 20.9bn).
Brokers are asking why warning bells at the Bank of Italy, which is supposed
to supervise the scale of bank lending to individual companies, did not
sound earlier.
Separately, Mr Vincenzo Visco, deputy chairman of the finance committee of
the upper house of parliament, strongly criticised the rescue operation
being mounted by Mediobanca and the other leading bank creditors.
Mr Visco, briefly finance minister in the new Ciampi government, drew
attention to the use of public sector banks to rescue a private company.
'I don't believe taxpayers' money . . . can be used by Mr Cuccia with the
ease to which he has accustomed us in the past'. Mr Enrico Cuccia is
Mediobanca's honorary chairman.
Other critics of the lifeline, which remains shrouded in mystery, have
pointed to the possibility of public sector banks swapping loans to Ferruzzi
for equity - potentially nationalising the company at a time when Italy is
supposed to be privatising its state-controlled banking sector.
The attacks came against a further day of sharp falls for shares in Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin) the main holding company, and its subsidiaries. Ferfin
stock plunged a further 16.6 per cent to L494.8 from L593.5, while shares in
Montedison, the main industrial subsidiary, dropped to L750, making for a
cumulative drop of over 23 per cent since Friday's close.
Investors showed their hostility to this week's surprise rights issue by
Fondiaria, the Ferruzzi-controlled insurance group, by marking its shares
down by almost 8 per cent to L22,201 from L24,101.
Fondiaria stock has now tumbled over 17 per cent since the deal was
announced late on Monday.
The precipitous falls and the fact that many of Ferruzzi's operations are
backed by attractive industrial assets has not yet triggered any bargain
hunting, although prices recovered somewhat in after-hours' trading. The
explanation lies partly in the widespread cynicism towards Mediobanca, which
has a reputation for ignoring minority investors, and the continued silence
about the rescue plans.
Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of the Consob companies and stock exchange
watchdog, yesterday said brokers' reactions have been 'excessive and
premature' in view of the fact that details of the rescue were not yet
available.
However, the legacy of hostility in the bourse towards Mediobanca and
opacity of the Ferruzzi rescue project means investors are still willing to
ditch shares at almost any price. That sentiment has hit stock in the five
most exposed creditor banks and the market in general, which has fallen for
four days running.

UNIVERSAL Leaf Tobacco, the US tobacco trader and processor, is to take over
Nyidofer, Hungary's dominant supplier of tobacco for cigarette makers.
Universal's offer involves the acquisition of a 76 per cent shareholding, an
immediate capital increase, a subsequent injection and substantial support
for hard-pressed Hungarian tobacco growers.
Total investment including commitments would amount to about Ft2bn (Dollars
22m), Hungary's State Property Agency privatisation authority said
yesterday.

<TEXT>
Teesside Holdings, the unquoted owner of the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m on turnover of Pounds 43.8m for
the 12 months to March 31 - the first full year since the port's
privatisation early in 1992.
The company said the profit figure could not be compared with similar
pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the previous year because of changes in
the company's financial structure arising from the sale of the port to the
Teesside Holdings consortium. Turnover, however, rose 10 per cent.
Tees &amp; Hartlepool was the first and most controversial of five trust ports
privatisations that took place last year. Its sale for Pounds 180m to
Teesside Holdings aroused bitter resentment from rival bidders.
Last November the port lost a valuable contract to import and export cars
for Nissan, the Japanese car manufacturer with a plant in Sunderland.
Mr Bill Andrews, chairman, said the loss of the contract had come as 'a
great disappointment', but the company was using its ample resources to
invest in new dockside facilities to replace and increase business for the
future.

Kembrey, a maker of electrical connectors and accessories, returned to
profit in the second half of 1992-93, overcoming the first half loss, and Mr
David Burnet, chairman, said he expected a further recovery in the current
year.
Pre-tax profit for the 53 weeks to April 3 emerged at Pounds 11,000 - better
than the directors expected at halfway when a loss of Pounds 114,000 was
reported. The previous year's deficit was Pounds 347,000.
Mr Burnet said that no clear trend had emerged for the current year, but he
hoped that profits would improve and borrowings decline further. He said
that the weight of any improvement would probably be heavily biased towards
the second half.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 22m (Pounds 27.4m). Extraordinary costs in the
year fell from Pounds 741,000 to Pounds 441,000 and related to losses on the
disposal of non-core businesses Despro and Dalforsan. Redundancies
throughout the group cost Pounds 189,000.
Net borrowings have come down by Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 4.3m. After the
extraordinary items and the cost of the proposed dividend of 0.155p (0.15p),
there was a deficiency on the profits and loss account of Pounds 472,000
(Pounds 1.14m) which was met from reserves.
Earnings per share were 0.04p (1.24p losses).

Graystone, formerly Ptarmigan Holdings, launched the rights, originally
planned as a placing, to raise Pounds 5m towards the Pounds 8m cost of
acquiring FKI Cableform, which makes numbering machines, lighting products
and electrical controls.
This follows the acquisition last November of three engineering companies.
It is disposing of its original businesses of making sausage casings,
artificial flowers and ribbons, publishing cookery and crafts books, and
running three small country hotels.
The directors said the fund raising would give the company a much broader

IVORY &amp; SIME, the investment managers which handle Pounds 3.3bn of funds,
reported an increase of 7.5 per cent in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.9m for
the year to April 30.
The previous year produced Pounds 4.52m but was adjusted to Pounds 4.91m,
including gains on disposals, under FRS 3.
Turnover rose to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.9m) while administrative expenses
were virtually unchanged for the fourth successive year. That led to
operating profits increasing by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds
3.65m).
Funds under management grew 12.7 per cent to Pounds 3.3bn, reflecting the
attracting of additional funds, notably from North America and Japan, and
buoyant stock markets worldwide in sterling terms.
Earnings per share were 10.75p (9p and 10.38p under FRS 3), the growth rate
boosted by the reduced number of shares in issue following the purchase and
cancellation of 2.25m shares.
The final dividend is 4.75p to lift the total to 6.5p (5.75p).

Mr Donald Brennan, manag-ing director of Morgan Stanley, is to hand over the
chairmanship of Waterford Wedgwood to Mr Tony O'Reilly towards the end of
this year once the luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer's
rationalisation programme is complete, writes Tim Coone.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Brennan said the rationalisation plan for
the crystal and ceramics divisions 'has been put in place with considerable
success'.
He said the acceptance of the plan by the Waterford Crystal workforce last
January, that division's return to operating profits, and improvements in
cost reductions and production efficiencies at Wedgwood had put the group
'in a better position today than many believed possible a year ago'.
He acknowledged the sacrifices in job losses but said as a result of
rationalisation more than IPounds 10m (Pounds 9.8m) had been permanently
removed from the cost base in a comparison with overheads in 1991-92.

<TEXT>
Barlo, the Dublin-based radiator and plastics manufacturer, announced an
IPounds 19m (Pounds 18.6m) open offer and share placing to finance the
acquisition of VEHA, a Belgian radiator manufacturer.
Total price will be IPounds 14.5m; the additional proceeds will be used for
extra working capital and capital expenditure in the enlarged group.
The 35m new shares are to be offered at 58p per share on a 2-for-7 basis to
existing shareholders. The placing is underwritten by AIB Capital Markets.
Last month Barlo reported a sharp upturn in pre-tax profits to IPounds 3.9m
for 1992-93, with strong growth in its radiator division. The deal, agreed
with VEHA's present owners - Royal Begemann - will boost the division's
turnover from IPounds 20m to over IPounds 50m.
Although profits at VEHA last year were only IPounds 500,000, Barlo said the
company has embarked upon 'a substantial programme of capital investment and
rationalisation'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus to lose almost one in
three jobs
</HEADLINE>

ALMOST ONE in every three jobs is to go at Aer Lingus, the Irish state
airline, as part of a radical restructuring plan revealed to the company's
trade unions yesterday. The recovery plan is intended to return the company
to profitability by 1995.
Some 1,280 redundancies are being sought from the airline's 5,500 staff,
plus a further 250 redundancies at TEAM Aer Lingus, a Dublin-based aircraft
maintenance subsidiary.
No other redundancies have been mentioned from the 13,000 employed worldwide
by the group and its subsidiaries, as a major sell-off of up to two thirds
of the group's non-core businesses - including its Copthorne Hotel group in
the UK - is to be carried out.
The black hole in the company's finances appears to be worse than hitherto
assumed, with losses estimated at IPounds 116m (Pounds 113.7m) for the
current year alone, although IPounds 65m of these relate to exceptional
items, mainly due to a write-down of the group's investment in GPA. Losses
in the air transport division are forecast to be IPounds 64m this year.
Ms Joan Carmichael, the secretary of a joint trade union council at the
airline, said yesterday she was 'devastated' at the scale of the planned
redundancies, and that 'it only appears to be the tip of the iceberg'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: James Crean
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, has sold three of
its Irish-based distribution businesses to Allegro Holdings for Pounds
5.35m.
The companies which have been sold are Tennant &amp; Ruttle Distribution, JC
Distribution and David J Thompson &amp; Son. A further consideration is likely
to be paid in respect of these companies' results for the period from
January 1 until June 11 1993.
The sale does not include the Tennant &amp; Ruttle property which is retained by
Crean. This property is valued at between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m.
Sales of the three companies for 1992 were Pounds 28.8m and profits before
tax and rationalisation costs came to Pounds 997,000. Net assets at the end
of 1992 were Pounds 3.8m.
Crean said the disposals were for 'strategic reasons'. It added that it had
no plans to sell JCM, which distributes Mars confectionery products in
Ireland on behalf of Masterfoods.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clyde Blowers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite recording a first-half loss before tax of Pounds 17,632, against a
Pounds 33,723 profit, Clyde Blowers hoisted its interim dividend from 0.83p
to 4p.
Mr JA McColl, chairman, said the decision was in recognition of progress now
being made and would reflect 'the pattern of profit recognition that we have
the potential to achieve'. In addition, he said there was a need to reduce
the excessive imbalance between the interim and final dividends - last
year's final was 7.07p.
He said he expected the operating loss of Pounds 205,163 (Pounds 56,174) to
be reduced in the second half, with improved profitability from boiler
cleaning equipment beginning to come through during the latter part of this
year. The factory workload was high until the end of the current year.
Sturtevant Engineering, acquired in April, had a healthy order book and
plans were currently being implemented to increase turnover and profits of
its material handling and vacuuming systems.
Turnover for the half year to February 28 was Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.01m)
and losses per share came to 1.76p (2.52p earnings).
