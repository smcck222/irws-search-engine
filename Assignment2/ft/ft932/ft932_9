FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Waterford rationalisation
successful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DONALD Brennan, managing director of Morgan Stanley, is to hand over the
chairmanship of Waterford Wedgwood to Mr Tony O'Reilly towards the end of
this year once the luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer's
rationalisation programme is complete, writes Tim Coone.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Brennan said the rationalisation plan for
the crystal and ceramics divisions 'has been put in place with considerable
success'.
He said the acceptance of the plan by the Waterford Crystal workforce last
January, that division's return to operating profits, and improvements in
cost reductions and production efficiencies at Wedgwood had put the group
'in a better position today than many believed possible a year ago'.
He acknowledged the sacrifices in job losses but said as a result of
rationalisation more than IPounds 10m (Pounds 9.8m) had been permanently
removed from the cost base in a comparison with overheads in 1991-92.
'I seriously doubt if we would be meeting here today had not the capital
infusion been made in 1990 and this plan put in place and well executed', he
stated.
Mr Brennan was appointed chairman a year after Morgan Stanley and
Fitzwilton, the industrial holding group headed by Mr O'Reilly, bought
jointly a 29.9 per cent stake in the group for IPounds 79m.

<TEXT>
IWP International, the Dublin-based industrial holding group, reported a 7.4
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.6m) on
turnover up 2.8 per cent to IPounds 95.2m for the year ending March 31.
The advance was achieved 'despite unfavourable economic conditions in the UK
and the currency crisis which prevailed in Ireland in the second half of the
year' according to Mr Joe Moran, chairman.
The group comprises 18 companies divided into two main divisions,
manufacturing chemically-based household products and printed cartons and
self-adhesive labels. Its main markets are the UK, Ireland and the
Netherlands.
The household division performed particularly strongly with operating
profits up 14 per cent to IPounds 8.97m on turnover ahead almost 7 per cent
at IPounds 48.8m and now accounts for almost 70 per cent of group profits.
The packaging division's operating outcome dipped to IPounds 5.07m (IPounds
5.36m) of turnover of IPounds 43.1m (IPounds 42.9m), mainly reflecting price
competition. The small telecommunications interests incurred a small loss.
Some IPounds 4.2m has been spent on acquisitions in the past year, while one
of the two companies involved in telecommunications was disposed of for a
consideration of IPounds 2.1m in shares in VMX, a California-based
electronics company.
Mr Moran warned that trading conditions continue to be 'difficult . . . we
cannot at this stage be over optimistic about the current year'.
Earnings per share were up 13.5 per cent to 31.9p (28.1p) and a final
dividend of 4.25p is recommended for a total of 7.25p (6.6p).

Details of the level of subscription and allocations will be announced next
week; dealings begin on Wednesday.
The placing of 25.5m shares with institutions was oversubscribed, with
investors rep-orted to have received about a quarter of those they sought.
The offer of 13.7m shares is believed to have been comfortably

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Nuclear jumps to Pounds 66m -
Go-ahead for spent fuel dry store will cut reprocessing costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which operates Scotland's two
nuclear power stations and generates nearly half of its electricity, more
than quadrupled pre-tax profits in the last financial year.
Mr James Hann, chairman, said the results were 'still not good enough, but
nevertheless a substantial improvement.'
The company aims to make further cost reductions and to become
'privatiseable', by which it means healthy enough to be privatised should
the government so choose.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.8m for the year to March 31 compared with
Pounds 13.7m previously. Turnover increased almost 10 per cent from Pounds
477m to Pounds 524m.
Scottish Nuclear's depreciation was Pounds 14m less than it would otherwise
have been, due to its acceptance of an engineering study which extended the
operating life - from 30 to 35 years - of the Torness power station in
Lothian. A similar study is being carried out on the Hunterston B station in
Ayrshire.
The company's operating cost fell from 3.21p per unit of electricity to
2.98p. The plants had a combined load factor of 68.2 per cent.
There is no non-fossil fuel levy in Scotland, unlike in England and Wales,
but Scottish Nuclear sells power to its two customers, ScottishPower and
Scottish Hydro-Electric, at more than the market price. This will fall, in
line with an agreed formula, from 1994-95.
Scottish Nuclear hopes shortly to receive planning permission from Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, to build a dry store at Torness to hold spent
fuel.
The store will open two years after planning permission is granted and the
company hopes to save Pounds 45m a year in fees that are currently charged
for reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria, by British Nuclear Fuels.
The company also wants to reduce its bill for fuel, which was Pounds 84.4m
last year.
It is negotiating with nuclear fuel manufacturers - believed to be in
France, Japan and the US - as well as with BNF, which is the world's only
supplier of fuel for advanced gas-cooled reactors. Scottish Nuclear said it
would consider helping finance the construction of an AGR fuel plant by an
overseas supplier.
Nuclear Electric has appointed Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance as its
financial adviser in the forthcoming government review of the UK nuclear
power industry. PW will also advise on NE's business strategy, including the
options for raising finance from the public sector. Mr John Collier, NE's
chairman, reaffirmed its aim of making a profit without subsidy by 1996.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM pulls out of unquoted
investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, has completed its withdrawal from
active unquoted company investments with the sale of Invesco Ventures to
Baronsmead, an independent venture capital company.
The group's retreat from unquoted investments began when Drayton
Consolidated Trust, an investment trust it managed, ran into difficulties.
Drayton Consolidated was wound up at the end of last year and primary
responsibility for the management of a successor fund, Second Consolidated,
was taken over by Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures.
Invesco paid Pounds 9.5m to investors in Drayton Consolidated after it
emerged that it had breached the trust's ceiling on the concentration of
funds in a single investment.
Invesco Ventures, formerly known as Invesco MIM Development Capital, has a
portfolio valued at about Pounds 40m comprising a pooled fund and several
local authority funds.
The local authority funds have geographical restrictions on where
investments can be made but the purchase gives Baronsmead about Pounds 12.5m
of liquid funds to invest at a time when conventional fund-raising activity
is particularly difficult.
The purchase represents a considerable boost for Baronsmead which has a
portfolio valued at about Pounds 65m, including Pounds 25m managed on behalf
of Barclays. Invesco Ventures has investments in 70 companies while
Baronsmead has 50 investments.
The value of the deal was not disclosed but the payment is performance
related. Mr Michael Perman, Invesco company secretary, said the unquoted
investments were 'profitable but marginal.' Two Invesco staff will join
Baronsmead's 10-strong executive team.
Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of Invesco's European division said:
'Venture capital no longer forms part of our core activities.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mezzanine Capital pays special 4p interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEZZANINE Capital &amp; Income Trust 2001 has declared a special interim
dividend of 4p per income share. This follows the flotation of one of its
investments, American Safety Razor, on the Nasdaq exchange.
The US group issued payment-in-kind notes as part of a financial
restructuring last year. As the PIKs were not cash, MCIT cut its interim
dividend last year. However, MCIT has received a repayment of Dollars 7.5m
(Pounds 4.87m) as part of the flotation, including repayment of the PIKs,
and is accordingly making a special distribution.
The flotation values MCIT's equity stake in American Safety Razor at Dollars
2.9m, compared with the balance sheet valuation of Dollars 1.5m.
MCIT has also made a further investment, of about Dollars 9m, in debt and
other securities of LePage Industries.

Pounds 15m in placing
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANAGEN, a biotechnology company with no sales to date, is coming to the
market via a placing which will raise Pounds 15m. The group is capitalised
at Pounds 46.5m.
Anagen is developing AN2000, a line of fully automated immunoassay systems.
This is a method of measuring the presence of cancer markers, fertility
hormones and other substances in blood.
The company is placing 15m 10p shares at 100p each. The cost of the
flotation was Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 2.9m will be used to pay off
short-term borrowings. The remaining Pounds 11.5m will be split between
working capital and the funding of a new system, AN500, to detect
contamination in food.
With spending on research and development running at an annual rate of
Pounds 3.5m, Mr Mervyn Sennett, managing director, said the company would
not be cash flow positive until the third quarter of 1995.
The company will not be ready for commercial production until this November,
although its product is currently in pre-production. Its development costs -
Pounds 14.5m so far - are financed by a consortium of venture capital firms
led by Schroder Ventures and include CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the
Coal Board pension fund, Electra Capital, Norwich Union Venture Capital and
Questa.
Dealings are expected to start on June 24.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSSROADS OIL Group and Melrose Group have entered into an agreement under
which Melrose is to invest Pounds 1m and could eventually own up to 47.5 per
cent of Crossroads' enlarged capital.
Melrose is to subscribe for 5m new shares at 20p each in USM-quoted
Crossroads, which in turn is to acquire, in two phases, an interest in joint
ventures with Melrose, satisfied in Crossroads shares.
The proposals will be put to shareholders at an EGM on July 9.
Mr Robert Adair, chairman of Melrose, is to join the Crossroads board as an
executive director and Mr Simon Pendock of Crossroads will hold a similar
post at Melrose.
The London offices of the two companies are to be merged, aiding the
Crossroads programme to cut overheads.
The subscription proceeds will help accelerate Crossroads' US onshore
development drilling programme.
For the six months to September 30 Crossroads incurred an unchanged
operating loss of Pounds 80,112. The after-tax loss emerged at Pounds
106,903. Profits of Pounds 267,368 last time included exceptional revenue of
Pounds 377,142.
Crossroads' joint venture investment is calculated on an earn-out basis,
under which its stake will be between 20 and 40 per cent, and which could
involve the issue of up to 33.9m shares.
Crossroads is involved in the onshore development of oil and gas in
Louisiana and Texas.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson acquires waste business from Tarmac
 -Further Pounds 44.2m expansion into UK landfill sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARC, a subsidiary of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has paid Pounds
44.2m for the principal assets of Econowaste, the waste disposals business
built by Tarmac.
The acquisition marks a further move for Hanson into the UK waste sector,
making its Greenways Landfill subsidiary the third largest operator of
landfill sites in the UK.
In March the conglomerate took a 4.9 per cent stake in Shanks &amp; McEwan in
return for options in landfill sites which the waste company had exercised.
For Tarmac, the UK's biggest building materials and construction group, the
sale marks a further stage in its programme to reduce its large borrowings
by selling peripheral businesses.
'We want to be out of active waste and into void creation,' said Mr Neville
Simms, Tarmac's chief executive.
Tarmac decided to sell Econowaste in the third quarter last year when high
prices for waste businesses were still expected by some in the industry. It
was initially hoping to sell the entire business for Pounds 80m. Mr Simms
said yesterday's sale was only marginally below the figure Tarmac expected
to achieve.
Tarmac has now disposed of more than Pounds 200m of assets in the last 12
months and is believed to have made a Pounds 10m book profit on the
Econowaste sale. It plans to raise more than Pounds 300m from asset sales,
on which it hopes to break even. Mr Simms said that might prove tough in the
current markets.
The businesses sold to ARC are understood to account for about two thirds of
Econowaste's profits which approached Pounds 3m pre-tax last year. The parts
of Econowaste that Tarmac is retaining made Pounds 1m.
Mr Martin Taylor, Hanson's chief executive, said it was a good time to buy
assets and that 'hopefully' the British recession had bottomed out. 'We
think Greenways is a very good business and this is a sensible acquisition
at this price at this time.'
ARC is buying 18 of Econowaste's sites, 12 of which are active. This will
give ARC an additional 54m cu ft of landfill capacity to add to the 42m
Greenways operates at 20 sites in England and Wales.
In addition ARC is buying the waste haulage business. It also has options to
acquire rights over 17 sites for further landfill.
The combined business will have an annual turnover of Pounds 35m.
'Tougher environmental legislation will offer increasing opportunities to
landfill operators with good access to long term void resources,' said Mr
Nigel Sandy, managing director of Greenways.
Tarmac's net debt at the end of last year, including the group's share of
off-balance sheet finance of Pounds 100m and Pounds 99.3m of auction
preferred stock, stood at Pounds 677m. This was equivalent to 73 per cent of
shareholders' funds Pounds 942m.
Mr Simms has said that he hopes to reduce debt by a further Pounds 200m this
year through disposals, savings and by further squeezing working capital
including in UK housebuilding.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sale of waste arm helps NFC jump to Pounds
87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport and logistics company, yesterday reported slightly lower
than expected profits because of losses at its Lynx parcels division.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 86.6m in the
28 weeks to April 17, thanks to a Pounds 50m profit on the sale in January
of the company's waste management arm.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said economic conditions remained 'difficult'
although there were signs of improved confidence in the UK and US. In
continental Europe, activity was at 'a low ebb.'
The results have been prepared under the FRS 3 treatment and the comparisons
have been restated.
The company has maintained its 'best view' forecast for the full year of
on-going profits of between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m. However, Mr Watson
said the board would review its practice of giving best view forecasts,
mainly because of legislative concerns in the US.
Turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 977m (Pounds 879m), helped by
currency factors. Operating profits rose to Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 43.1m).
Most of the growth came from Exel Logistics, which increased operating
profits by 50 per cent to Pounds 33.5m, helped by acquisitions and
translation of dollar earnings.
BRS, the transport and truck rental arm which incurred heavy reorganisation
costs last year, increased profits by 52 per cent to Pounds 15.4m.
Allied Pickfords Merchants, the removals division, saw flat profits of
Pounds 7.1m.
Lynx was affected by overcapacity and depressed margins in its market, and
recorded operating losses of Pounds 6.1m. Despite management changes, the
full-year performance would depend on economic recovery, NFC said.
Interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 10.9m. The cash inflow from the
waste division sale was cancelled by acquisition costs.
Net borrowings, affected by currency and seasonal factors, increased from
Pounds 181m at the year end, to Pounds 256m, leaving gearing at 73 per cent.
Mr Watson said gearing would end the year at about 55 per cent.
Earnings were 13.5p (5.2p).
A second interim dividend of 1.45p is declared, making a total of 2.8p for
the half year.
The shares fell 8p to 249p.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Exports lift Chemring to Pounds 2.92m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG EXPORTS helped Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress
rockets and waterproof clothes, to report a 10 per cent increase in interim
profits.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.65m to Pounds 2.92m on sales up 15
percent at Pounds 21.3m. Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 9.49p and the
interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 3p (2.725p).
Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said defence markets - which account for 55
per cent of group business - would continue to enjoy steady growth. Measures
to deter missiles attracted by heat and radar signatures would continually
need to be improved.
Sales of distress rockets and marine-related safety equipment - which make
up part of the 45 per cent of non-defence sales - were benefiting from the
introduction of new safety regulations.
The group was looking at some sizeable acquisitions which might require a
call on shareholders.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn shares rise 30% despite
Pounds 3.6m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL losses of almost Pounds 7m, mostly related to the
discontinuation of the loss-making Gola business, pushed Porter Chadburn,
the packaging, consumer products and specialist distribution group, into a
Pounds 3.62m pre-tax deficit in the year to April 2.
The final dividend is cut to 0.4p, halving the year's total to 1.25p.
However, the shares jumped 30 per cent - from 20p to 26p - reflecting
positive comments on the outlook from Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman. He said
there had been 'continued growth' in the US since the year-end and reported
'a few encouraging signs,' including some stronger order books, in the UK.
The loss, which had been expected, led to losses per share of 4.82p; in the
previous year there was a profit of Pounds 5.59m giving earnings of 5.18p.
The results were prepared in accordance with the FRS 3 accounting standard.
Mr Dinkin said 1992-93 had been 'a year of mixed performances' with Porter
Chadburn's enlarged labelling business in the US performing well. But the UK
leisure and household marketing and distribution activities suffered badly
from recession which hit sales and margins, particularly in the second half.
Group turnover from continuing operations increased by 19 per cent to Pounds
132.3m (Pounds 110.8m) including Pounds 11.9m from acquisitions.
Discontinued operations added Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 21.5m).
Operating profit from continuing operations fell by 50 per cent to Pounds
4.14m (Pounds 8.3m), and acquisitions provided Pounds 1.56m. The
discontinued Gola operations incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.36m
(Pounds 2.36m).
Turnover in the packaging division, led by Lord Label and the recently
acquired Lancer Label in the US, jumped by 62 per cent to Pounds 52.6m
(Pounds 32.6m) and operating profits increased to Pounds 4.78m (2.63m).
In consumer products sales also grew slightly to Pounds 61.7m (Pounds 60.2m)
but operating profits slumped to Pounds 214,000 from Pounds 4.07m. Profits
from the specialist distribution businesses slipped to Pounds 709,000
(Pounds 1.61m) on turnover of Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 18m).
Net interest payments fell to Pounds 978,000 (Pounds 1.36m) and year-end
borrowings were Pounds 10.9m, representing gearing of 56 per cent.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 'Lean and efficient' structure for Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a further
series of changes designed to sharpen management focus on its core
businesses.
The most significant move is the replacement of the separate hotels and
restaurants divisional structures with individual business and service units
reporting to a newly-created operating board.
Mr Rocco Forte, group chairman, said yesterday that the changes would
provide 'a lean and efficient structure' enabling the company to
'concentrate its resources in the hotel and restaurant sector and on
businesses within it which can build or sustain a leading position.'
The new board will include Mr Alan Hearn and Mr Tony Monnickendam, the
present divisional heads, as group directors with responsibility for the
business and service units, as well as Mr Bob Leinhard (strategy), and Mr
Richard Power (communications).
Mr Hearn and Mr Leinhard will also become members of an office of the
chairman being formed to assist Mr Forte in the executive management of the
company.
Each of the new units will manage a brand or group of brands, increasing
customer focus and shortening lines of communication.
Appointments include Mr Randolf Guthrie, former managing director of
Shangri-La hotels, one of the leading Asian groups, who will head Forte
Grand; Mr Herman Jenny, former chairman and chief executive of Copthorne
hotels, who will run Forte Crest.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: London Scottish Bank up 11% as loan arrears
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON SCOTTISH Bank, the consumer finance company, yesterday announced an
11 per cent rise in interim profits after its income from personal loans
rose for the first time in two years.
The bank, which makes consumer loans and collects debts on behalf of other
companies, said its rise in pre-tax profits for the half year to April 27 to
Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 1.81m) reflected an improvement in loan arrears as
recession eased.
Income from interest on loans rose 2.5 per cent to Pounds 9.75m (Pounds
9.51m), which the bank said was the first rise in loan income since April
1991. Income from commission on third party debt collection rose 17 per cent
to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 2.66m).
Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, said the rise in interest income had been
produced by an improvement in arrears, as the net value of loans to
customers - less unearned interest and insurance payments - rose to Pounds
39.7m (Pounds 37.5m).
The bad debt charge fell Pounds 184,000 to Pounds 1.06m. The results were
also helped by a 13.9 per cent fall in finance costs for funding lending to
Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.4m) following the fall in base rates.
Income from the sale of Christmas hampers - for which customers contribute
weekly - fell by 5.1 per cent to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 1.17m). The bank said
orders in the first 26 weeks, which will be taken into profit in December,
had risen by 15 per cent.
Income from insurance to cover interruptions in loan payments fell by 1.3
per cent to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.93m). The figure was affected by higher
unemployment.
The interim dividend is increased by 8.4 per cent to 1.03p (0.95p). Diluted
earnings per share rose by 8.7 per cent to 2.5p (2.3p). The shares closed
1/2 p down at 82 1/2 p.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S helps Stirling double to Pounds 5.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STIRLING GROUP, the clothing manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer,
more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 5.84m in the
year to March 31 on turnover 48 per cent higher at Pounds 100.8m.
Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman and chief executive, put the advance down to a
number of reasons, but singled out the long-term solidity of its
relationship with M&amp;S, its 'principal customer', which accounted for about
Pounds 70m of turnover. This, however, was from a period of 53 sales weeks
at M&amp;S.
High volume production runs for M&amp;S had lengthened as the retailer reduced
the number of suppliers, Mr Sheldon said, enabling Stirling to achieve
greater efficiencies and lift operating margins for its M&amp;S business to 7
per cent.
Mr Sheldon said that although Stirling was 'very reliant' on M&amp;S, so also
was M&amp;S on its leading 10 suppliers.
He said the year had been 'one of consolidation of our recent acquisitions'
 -the most important of which was another M&amp;S supplier, Ritz Design, in
December 1991 for Pounds 19.2m. It contributed Pounds 40m of turnover and
enabled the group to be closed with the loss of some 440 jobs.
Mr Sheldon said that progress was due to the contract division, with
importing and brands making 'only small contributions'.
During the year Boftex, a UK importer with a Hong Kong-based sourcing
operation, was bought for Pounds 440,000. Since its integration and the
ironing out of volume problems, Mr Sheldon expects an improvement from the
import side. Main customers here include C&amp;A, Burton, Littlewoods and BhS.
Brands, which include Rigby &amp; Peller and Fantasie, take a while to achieve
strong profits growth, Mr Sheldon said.
Net interest payable was Pounds 712,000 (Pounds 199,000) - the Ritz
acquisition included Pounds 4.5m, now Pounds 3.5m, of medium-term debt. The
final dividend is lifted to 1.35p (1.15p) for a total of 1.85p (1.65p),
covered 2.1 times by earnings of 3.92p (3.08p) per share.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar acquires designer for Pounds
17.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics group, has made its
second acquisition this year with the Pounds 17.4m purchase of CMB Carton
Systems, a designer of packaging equipment.
Low &amp; Bonar raised Pounds 50.2m through a rights issue in March for the
Pounds 33m acquisition of Cereal Packaging. It will use the balance for the
latest purchase, which will make it the UK's second largest maker of high
quality folding cartons.
Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the purchase of CMB Carton 'bridged a
strategic gap'. He said the expanded company would be able to offer
equipment design services to existing clients and would benefit from
enlarged purchasing power.
CMB Cartons, based in Speke and Swindon, made operating profits of Pounds
2.2m last year on sales of Pounds 28m. At completion it had net assets of
Pounds 7.5m, with no debt.
The company was acquired from French warehousing group CGP, which in turn
bought the company in 1991 from CarnaudMetalbox.

TRANSPORT and logistics company NFC, an experiment in popular capitalism
since its 1982 employee-led buy-out from the government, is considering
ending its unique practice of giving 'best view' forecasts of future
profits.
The practice was developed to keep shareholder employees informed before the
company was listed on the stock market.
When the company floated in 1989, it won special permission from the stock
exchange to keep the 'best view' practice because about 90 per cent of its
33,000 employees were also shareholders, but many were not familiar with
owning shares.
The practice is under review because of changing rules about communicating
information to shareholders.
The company is also concerned about possible legal challenges in the US if
it failed to meet its best view forecast.
NFC yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 86.6m in
the 28 weeks to April 17.
Most of the increase was due to exceptional profits on a disposal and the
results were slightly below expectations.
The company is sticking to its earlier 'best view' estimate for this year of
Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m, excluding exceptional gains.
The review of 'best view' forecasts also reflects NFC's growing
international businesses, which are more prone to economic and currency
swings. Overseas earnings have grown from almost nothing 10 years ago to 45
per cent.
According to analysts, the review also signals NFC's desire to come into
line with other large transport groups, especially as institutions now own
more than 50 per cent of its shares.
Some analysts expect NFC to launch its first rights issue if a suitable
acquisition arises.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Shell to sell farm chemicals business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL, the Anglo-Dutch group, plans to sell its agrochemicals business to
American Cyanamid of the US.
The deal, the latest in a series in the Dollars 27bn-a-year (Pounds 17.5bn)
industry, would propel the US group from tenth to sixth in the world
agrochemicals league. The combined operation would have sales of about
Dollars 2bn, although about Dollars 300m of American Cyanamid's operations
are in animal health and nutrition.
Shell's business, employing 2,200, generated sales last year of about
Dollars 700m. 'The multiples in agrochemicals are less than they were a
couple of years ago. Given that half of Shell's sales are third party
products, we think the exit multiple won't be much more than one,' said Mr
John McDougall at Wood Mackenzie.
The deal is part of a broader rationalisation of a sector involving
fungicides, pesticides and insecticides, though not fertilisers. The EC
market shrank by between 10 and 13 per cent last year after reforms of the
common agricultural policy.
In May Schering, the German bioscience group, revealed it was negotiating
the possible merger of its agrochemicals operations with Hoechst, the German
chemicals giant. Rhone-Poulenc of France has forged links with Sumitomo of
Japan.
American Cyanamid said the two businesses formed a perfect fit
geographically and in products. Its operations were mainly in the US with
herbicides for soyabeans and soil insecticides. Shell's business was more
international and sold fungicides and leaf insecticides.
The US concern is repositioning itself as a bioscience group. Two years ago
it sold its consumer products business and earlier this year announced a
plan to spin-off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business.
Shell said its business had not generated a satisfactory return. The
operations needed to be larger to cover the costs of developing a stream of
new products.
The deal, expected to be completed by the end of the year, includes
factories at Paulinia, Brazil, research operations at Schwabenheim in
Germany, and formulation sites around the world. Shell did not expect either
its crop protection research facilities at Sittingbourne and Amsterdam or
manufacturing plant at Pernis in the Netherlands to be involved.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Granada in expansion mode as profits rise to Pounds 68m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, made it clear
it was in expansionist mood yesterday as it unveiled pre-tax profits of
Pounds 68.1m for the 26 weeks to the end of March.
The profit figure on a near static turnover of Pounds 640m represented an
underlying rise of 28 per cent - 72 per cent as restated under new
accountancy rules.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said that after the Pounds
360m acquisition of Sutcliffe, the catering and laundry business, the
company wanted to be a strong contender for running the UK's planned
National Lottery. The company said it would bid in a consortium to run the
lottery.
Mr Robinson also said that if the government relaxed the rules preventing
the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over, Granada would be in
the market. 'There is absolutely no way we will sell Granada Television.
Granada TV is absolutely at the heart of our business,' said Mr Robinson,
who on Monday represented the group at the National Heritage department when
ownership rules were considered.
All the main Granada businesses improved their operating profits without
what Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, described as 'any apparent
improvement in consumer spending'. Granada's rental business had operating
profits of Pounds 50m, an increase of 6 per cent, and television profits
rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 21m. Mr Robinson said leisure, influenced
mainly by improvements to products offered by motorway service stations,
raised profits from Pounds 3m to Pounds 8m.
Computer services was largely unchanged - Pounds 4m compared with Pounds
3.7m last time. Underlying earnings per share grew to 9.8p, an increase of
40 per cent and there was a 10 per cent rise in the dividend, from 2.75p
last time to 3.025p.
'We have a long way to go. We will see these kind of improvements continuing
into the second half,' Mr Robinson said.
Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court, yesterday
increased his forecast for the full year from around Pounds 165m to Pounds
173.
He believes Granada can move on to pre-tax profits of Pounds 210m next year.
'Granada is hardly a recovery stock, but they do what they say they are
going to do. There are no nasty surprises,' he said.
Granada said yesterday it expected gearing to be around 80 per cent by the
year-end and that borrowings should fall substantially next year.
The share price gained 6p to close at 415p.

FT  17 JUN 93 / SE reviews cash settlement on BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange is preparing to back down on a scheme under which
marketmakers in the shares of British Telecom would only publicly display
dealing prices for those who wished to deal for cash settlement.
The move follows an internal review by the stock exchange, which is believed
to have been concerned about some of the technical aspects of the
arrangement, which is unprecedented. Also, there is concern that its actions
may inadvertently lead to the creation of a false market in BT shares.
As a result of the internal discussions, the stock exchange has decided to
put off until today a decision on whether it should recommend dealing for
cash settlement in BT shares.
It is believed that the exchange will continue to display the account
settlement price on its Seaq screens, but will recommend that participants
deal through marketmakers on a cash basis.
A stock exchange canvas of the 18 registered marketmakers in BT shares
showed that the most favour the move.
However, some institutional investors have expressed alarm.
Late yesterday, it emerged that the National Association of Pension Funds,
the UK's largest shareholder group, is preparing to register its opposition
to the move.
Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the NAPF, said: 'We
are seeking clarification and expressing the concern of our members to the
chairman of the stock exchange.'
The exchange, following a request from SG Warburg, global co-ordinator in
the sale of the third tranche of the government's stake in BT, had earlier
circulated a memo to marketmakers asking whether they wanted the stock
exchange to recommend that all deals be for cash settlement. The move was
intended to help discover quickly who had bought or sold BT shares.
Dealings for cash settlement are known within 48 hours while under the
account settlement system it takes two weeks. If account settlement
prevailed, Warburg, which has said it intends to award higher allocations to
those who had increased their BT stakes, could be generous to those who had
in fact sold shares before the allocation date.
Warburg had wanted the dealing prices placed by marketmakers on the Seaq
price display screen to reflect the price for transactions for cash
settlement. Those who wanted to deal for account settlement would have to
call marketmakers to negotiate a price.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Bad weather is blamed as retail sales decline for second
month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH retail sales posted a small decline in May for the second month in a
row but government statisticians and retail sector representatives said the
fall reflected bad weather rather than economic weakness.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that seasonally adjusted
retail sales fell by an estimated 0.2 per cent in volume terms in May after
a 0.2 per cent fall in April. Sales volumes in May were 2.3 per cent higher
than in May last year - the smallest year-on-year increase since December.
The CSO said last month's decline in sales reflected a sharp 5.9 per cent
drop in clothing and footwear sales as miserable weather conditions
dissuaded consumers from buying summer outfits.
According to the British Retail Consortium, which claims to represent more
than 90 per cent of retail outlets, turnover of do-it-yourself stores was
also depressed because the late May bank holiday was the last day of the
month and its sales will be counted towards the June total.
But other CSO figures pointed to a slowdown in the growth of retail sales
since the first quarter. Taking three-month figures, which the CSO says give
a better guide to underlying trends, re-tail sales rose 0.8 per cent in the
March-to-May period compared with the previous three months and were 3 per
cent higher than in the same period of 1992. By contrast, sales in the first
quarter were up 1.6 per cent on the final quarter of last year and 3.3 per
cent higher than in the first quarter of 1992.
The retail consortium said cool weather helped sales of electrical and
electronic goods after with a depressed May last year. White goods sales
were healthy, while business-related products were 'a star performing area'.
The consortium reported higher sales of food and drink, furniture, carpets
and healthcare products in May, while sales made by London stores to
tourists were 'buoyant'. It said clothing and footwear sales had recovered
'to encouraging levels' this month in line with better weather. Mr Peter
Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, said
stronger growth of banknotes and coins in circulation so far this month also
pointed to a revival of retail sales in June.
The note and coin figures grew only slowly in May and have proved to be a
good coincident indicator of consumer demand in the economy since sterling
left the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The Treasury was untroubled by the slight dip in May retail sales. 'If
consumer spending is holding up, without going mad, while manufacturing
output and exports grow, it means we have the sort of recovery that we
want,' a spokesman said.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Court suspends Nigeria poll result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL future of Nigeria was thrown into renewed doubt last night
when the commission overseeing presidential elections held last Saturday
suspended publication of the outcome.
The move followed a court ruling restraining it from announcing the result.
It lends substance to fears raised by pro-democracy groups in Nigeria that
the transition to democracy in Africa's most populous state, promised by the
military government of President Ibrahim Babangida, is in jeopardy - having
been put back three times in three years.
Gen Babangida's options are now far from clear. Extension of military rule
would be controversial yet the transition to civilian rule has been
seriously undermined, and the August handover date appears impractical.
Although a presidential decree in April stated that no court could stop the
commission carrying out Nigeria's first presidential elections for a decade,
the electoral body says it will respect the latest ruling from the high
court. The suspension is in effect until further notice.
Mr Moshood Abiola, the millionaire Moslem businessman who was presidential
candidate of the Social Democratic party, one of two almost
indistinguishable rival parties created by Mr Babangida's government, had
been declared the winner in 13 of the country's 30 states by Sunday night.
Since then no more returns have been released. Those close to the commission
say Mr Abiola won by a clear margin, taking 59 per cent of the votes cast.
The injunction against the electoral commission was brought by the
Association for Better Nigeria, an unofficial pressure group which is
seeking the extension of military rule for at least another four years.
It claims to represent the views of most Nigerians - and can draw some
strength for its arguments from the low turnout at the polls, estimated at
below 40 per cent - but is thought to have close links with the presidency.
Gen Babangida took power in a coup in 1985.
The Campaign for Democracy, another pressure group, won an injunction
against the ABN in April at a high court in Lagos on the grounds that a
decree in 1992 made it illegal to campaign against the transition process.
The ABN has ignored that injunction and the presidency has made no comment.
The electoral commission denies alleged vote rigging is behind the
suspension.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, Standard Chartered held a meeting for eight selected analysts to
discuss the organisation of its UK operations. On Tuesday and Wednesday, its
share price rose by 6 per cent. Standard emphasises that the analysts'
meeting was of a non-financial nature and the swing in its share price on a
volume of only 3.4m shares reflects the lack of liquidity in its paper. Just
the same, such a sharp movement so soon after such a limited briefing leaves
an uncomfortable feeling. If Standard had something interesting to say about
its UK operations, it could have gone to the small extra trouble of putting
out a statement through the stock exchange.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling holes in the ground is not as profitable as it used to be if
Tarmac's sale of Econowaste is any guide. When Wimpey and NFC sold their
landfill sites, they emerged with stinking profits. Tarmac's Pounds 44m sale
smells far less sweet. This may owe much to the negotiating power of Hanson.
It also reflects the hazards of starting disposal programmes late in the
day. Shareholders may simply be relieved that Tarmac has completed
two-thirds of its targeted Pounds 300m of asset sales. They may prove less
sanguine, though, if Tarmac again trails Wimpey and taps them for more
funds.

FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Granada Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Granada recovery bandwagon rumbles on. A 28 per cent improvement in
underlying pre-tax interim profits on sales up less than 1 per cent
continues to reflect the bracing effects of Granada's re-invigorated
management.
Granada's rental activities, which represent about half group profits, may
be slowly shrinking but they remain highly cash generative - especially
since depreciation has overtaken capital expenditure. Catering, television,
and even computer services continue on their upward trend. But there are
blemishes. Locking into interest rates of 12 per cent a few years back is a
minor embarrassment. Losing the chance to buy WH Smith's stake in Yorkshire
Television may prove a more serious setback, especially if the government
really does relax the ITV franchise rules.
Granada's shares have bounced strongly as Mr Gerry Robinson has strengthened
his grip on the business. Continued outperformance will increasingly depend
on successful expansion of turnover. The acquisition of Sutcliffe should
guarantee satisfactory progress for at least a year or two. Thereafter, the
prospects grow more opaque. Still, Granada is proving it has the happy habit
of generating cash and the management skill to apply it productively. That
is a rare enough combination and should secure Granada's premium rating over
the longer run, especially if BSkyB or the National Lottery turn up trumps.

FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be a crying shame if NFC abandons the practice of publishing a best
estimate of profits for the coming year. At least its official forecast is
freely available to all investors. Institutions with access to brokers'
forecasts - massaged up or down by companies at private briefings - would
barely notice the change. NFC's army of employee-shareholders might find
themselves disadvantaged.
Still, the company cannot be blamed for worrying about potential litigation,
especially in the US, should it ever fail to hit its target. The broader
question is whether a more conventional style of communication with
shareholders might lay the ground for a more conventional pattern of share
ownership.
With shareholders' funds of Pounds 350m supporting turnover approaching
Pounds 2bn, NFC is not well endowed with equity. That partly explains the
rapid rise in gearing during the first half. An acquisition in logistics,
for example, would demand substantial goodwill write-offs and further weaken
the balance sheet. Since employees own 15 per cent of the shares, a rights
issue would be touchy. Smaller placements of equity might be used to fund
acquisitions, or cement alliances such as that with Schneider in the US.
That might explain NFC's concern with the potential pitfalls in the US
courts.
While its parcels business is losing money and with reorganisation
provisions promised for the second half, though, NFC has its work cut out
closer to home. Even if Lynx can be quickly turned around, it is
questionable whether NFC should slug it out in the overcrowded parcels
market. Another good performance from Exel Logistics should be a pointer to
the way ahead.

FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Goldman fingered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One should not be misled by the size of the fine, trivial though Pounds
160,000 is for an institution as large as Goldman Sachs. In the context of
its limited powers of investigation, the Securities and Futures Authority
has come up with some damaging indictments of Goldman's dealings with the
Robert Maxwell empire. No investment bank with global pretensions can relish
the revelation that, for seven business days in 1991, it had a shortfall of
up to Pounds 20m in its regulatory capital. No such bank can happily admit
that, on three separate occasions, it failed to consider the full
implications of late delivery - itself the rarest of events - of securities
it had bought from clients connected with Mr Maxwell.
Publication of such findings is an important part of the sanction process.
The revelation that Goldman's procedures and supervision were inadequate
deals a blow to its reputation more damaging than any fine. That is about
all one could have expected from an inquiry confined to the remit of
examining Goldman's compliance with SFA rules.
But the SFA chooses its words carefully. It says it 'did not conclude' that
Goldman or any of its personnel participated or were aware of any illicit
conduct. That seems to leave the door open to further investigation in the
light of other enquiries still in train. The statement that Goldman was not
aware of illicit dealings by Mr Maxwell or his associates is anyway a rather
limp exoneration. Given Mr Maxwell's dwindling reputation at the time,
perhaps it should have tried harder to make itself aware. The ease with
which it flouted SFA rules suggests a culture that was too laisser-faire.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Leading Article: A dose of reality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on South Africa's political future have reached a delicate
stage, possibly a dangerous one. Tuesday's decision by the Inkatha Freedom
Party chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and a motley group of other political
players from the white right and black homelands to walk out of the
multi-party negotiating forum raises the spectre of two competing factions
whose rivalry could destabilise South Africa.
Chief Buthelezi and the white right have little in common other than
antipathy to the expedient alliance between the government and the African
National Congress (ANC). But, while they lack the support to govern South
Africa, they may well have the capacity to make it ungovernable. A
disaffected Natal, township violence and a security force with many
right-wingers in its ranks - these elements could combine to make peace
unattainable.
The only forum at which the country can forge a lasting settlement,
including principles for a new constitution and rules for the country's
first all-race elections, is at the multi-party talks taking place near
Johannesburg. The first instinct of Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, and
possibly of the government may be to threaten to go ahead without Inkatha.
But both parties must know that it would be far better to persuade Chief
Buthelezi to send his representatives back to the conference table. Equally,
if chief Buthelezi takes serious stock of his options, he will know that his
movement has nothing to gain from trying to scupper the peace process from
the sidelines.
What the current impasse exposes is that, after months of wishful thinking,
South Africa's constitutional negotiators are at last confronting the
fundamental issues in the transition to democracy. Up to now delegates have
created an illusion of progress by constantly referring the most difficult
problems to technical committees; most recently, they masked the lack of
progress on substantive issues by setting next April 27 as the date for
elections to a constituent assembly.
If Inkatha's action brings the delegates down to earth it will have served a
purpose. The issue that prompted its move - the powers of the provinces
under a new constitution - is a critical one that politicians must address
as a matter of urgency. The most sensitive concern of all is also one that
has yet to be properly addressed. Both the ANC and the National Party speak
of 'power sharing' in a government to be formed after elections, but they
have very different concepts in mind. For the ANC, which expects to emerge
as the largest single party, it is a coalition in which they are the
dominant partner. For the National Party, as President F. W. de Klerk made
clear in a recent interview with the Financial Times, power sharing would be
written into the constitution, with the leaders of the main parties taking
major policy decisions by 'consensus'.
Until the negotiators resolve these two problems in a form which will be
binding on a proposed constitution-writing constituent assembly, elections
will not be viable. This week's upset may yet mark not the collapse of talks
but the point at which they get down to business.

<TEXT>
Until recently, trying to assemble a picture of the secretive Fred Olsen -
owner of Timex, numerous tankers and much else - was rather like trying to
sketch the invisible man.
Worries about terrorist attacks were said to be the reason why one of
Norway's most mysterious shipping tycoons kept such a low profile. Suddenly,
however, Olsen has begun to pop up on TV screens, where he comes across as a
rather nice elderly gent who doesn't know what terrible things his
subordinates have been doing at the doomed Timex plant in Dundee.
The old man has certainly impressed Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
Nationalist Party. He had Olsen on the phone for an hour and a half on
Tuesday, and Olsen was paying for the call. 'I couldn't get him off the
phone,' says Salmond.
Ninety minutes on the blower might not sound long for a politician, but it
is a veritable age for an international businessman used to making snappy
decisions. 'He kept asking me what I would do,' says Salmond, who has
already faxed his answers to Norway. 'I wish I had phoned him earlier,'
laments the man who does not hold out much hope of a last-minute reprieve.
Come to think of it, the SNP leader might have had more luck if he had rung
Fred's daughter, Anette, who many think really runs the group these days.

If there seems to be a bit of a power vacuum in Canberra this week, the
explanation is quite simple.
No less than four of Australia's 19 cabinet ministers are in London: Gareth
Evans, the foreign minister, Simon Crean, minister of primary industries and
energy, Laurie Brereton, minister for industrial relations and Kim Beazley,
minister for employment.
Each has a busy round of meetings, ranging from discussing nuclear dumps
with Douglas Hurd to woolly jumpers with the International Wool Secretariat.
Also in town - what a coincidence - are the lord mayors of all Australia's
state capitals.
Surely this sudden interest in the mother country cannot have anything to do
with the second test match beginning at Lord's today?

Expect word shortly on who is going to replace Gerry Corrigan, as president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Corrigan is not due to depart until August 20th. But today will be the last
monthly board meeting of the NY Fed before Corrigan goes off on a long
vacation and there is also a big farewell bash for him in New York tonight.
The delay in naming Corrigan's successor is starting to cause a headache in
the rest of the central banking community since he is also chairman of the
Basle committee on banking supervision. Brian Quinn of the Bank of England
would be an obvious candidate for the Basle job. But his chances might have
been hurt by the fuss over the BCCI affair, and anyway the committee's first
two chairmen, George Blunden and Peter Cooke, were both Bank of England
types.
Jean-Louis Butsch, secretary general of France's La Commission Bancaire is
one possibility and the Dutch provided Corrigan's predecessor, the late Huib
Muller. But Corrigan is the most senior central banker to do the job to date
and the fact that the Basle committee is waiting to see who replaces him
before making its own choice suggests that there is no obvious front runner.

Hands up all those who turned up at the Lord Mayor's Guildhall dinner this

To a degree, Celestria Noel, social editor of Harpers &amp; Queen, sympathises

specified evening dress and decorations. Not a word about white ties. 'You

Noel opines.
As the author of Jennifer's diary a well-studied arbiter of good form, Noel
is infinitely more concerned by the faux pas of the 'children of the

FT  17 JUN 93 / Carmakers hit the panic button: The European auto industry
is struggling against overcapacity, high costs and a fall in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe has become the battleground of the world motor industry in the 1990s.
As demand nosedives across the continent, the failure of many European
carmakers to put their houses in order during the recent fat years is
becoming glaringly apparent.
The race to regain global competitiveness is intense. By the end of the
decade, the frontiers of the European car market will be thrown open fully
to Japanese competition when all import restrictions end.
The sickening downward lurch in new car sales in the first five months of
this year has forced carmakers to hit the panic buttons from Wolfsburg to
Turin and from Stuttgart to Gothenburg.
Large parts of the industry have been forced on to short-time working;
thousands of jobs have been axed; components suppliers are being squeezed
ruthlessly to cut prices; and, as overcapacity grows, rationalisation and
restructuring are the order of the day.
Ford of Europe, once the Ford group's main profit-generating machine
worldwide, has racked up losses of more than Dollars 2bn in the past two
years, exposed early by the long-lived recession in the UK, its biggest
market in Europe.
Fiat, which now accounts for virtually the entire Italian car and truck
industry, saw the profits of its car subsidiary, Fiat Auto, virtually wiped
out last year with net income dropping to L16bn (Pounds 7m) from L361bn in
1991.
The rot set in deeply during the final months of last year as orders in most
European car markets suddenly began to shrink. After more than doubling its
profits in the first nine months of last year, the Renault group of France
fell into loss in the final quarter, pushed down by the turmoil in the
European currency markets, its share of losses at its partner Volvo, and the
red ink of its truck operations.
The real horror story late last year emerged in Germany, however, where
Volkswagen, the group that has led the west European market in terms of
sales volumes for the past eight years, crashed deep into loss. After making
a pre-tax profit of DM1.2bn in the first nine months of last year, it
plunged into a pre-tax loss of DM563m in the final quarter and followed this
with a DM1.2bn loss in the first three months of 1993.
According to a report by UK financial analysts James Capel: 'The first
quarter of 1993 has been the worst period for earnings (in the European auto
industry) since the early 1980s and possibly for a period much longer than
that.'
It is not as if warnings had not been posted. The scale of the challenge to
come from Japan became clear in the 1980s, and the industry has always been
sensitive to changes in the volume of demand. Experience in the American
market had shown how quickly carmakers' profits could melt away, as
uncompetitive producers faced the twin challenges of recession and a deep
incursion by Japanese rivals into their domestic market.
Europe had always appeared to be next in line, but for a time the hour of
reckoning was delayed by a car market that had seemed to defy gravity.
New car demand in west Europe bounded from one record year to another during
the second half of the 1980s, with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to
13.47m in 1989. Until 1992 demand held steady at about the record level of
13.5m.
Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well as demand
began to diverge wildly in key markets. With the onset of recession, sales
in the UK slumped by a third over three years from their 1989 peak, and
sales faltered too in France. These setbacks were more than compensated for
by the unprecedented surge in new car sales in Germany, Europe's biggest
market, in the wake of unification.
Carmakers, most of all the Volkswagen group which controls about 28 per cent
of the German market, were able to surf on the rising wave of demand in
Germany, where the car market surged from 2.8m in 1989 to 4.2m in 1991 and
3.9m last year. Now the German party, which all carmakers shared in, is
over. The hangover is proving unpleasant.
With the UK as virtually the only exception, new car markets across west
Europe have shrunk alarmingly in the first half of 1993. In the first five
months alone, 1m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe than in the same
period a year ago, with sales dropping by 17.3 per cent to about 5.2m. Sales
were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe.
In Germany, sales in the first five months fell year-on-year by 20 per cent,
in Italy the decline was 21.1 per cent, in France 18.5 per cent and in Spain
31.2 per cent. The flickering of recovery in the UK - with sales up by 8.9
per cent this year - pales against declines of this magnitude elsewhere.
Forecasts by leading carmakers suggest that sales could fall to only
11.4-11.5m in the full year.
All carmakers in Europe are under fierce pressure - with only the UK's Rover
group increasing its European sales this year - but the German industry is
feeling the most intense heat.
For too long, it has rested on its laurels. Now it is finding that its
bloated cost-base has left it with a worrying lack of competitiveness not
only against Japanese carmakers but also against its European rivals.
'Production costs in Germany are too high,' says Mrs Erika Emmerich,
president of the German auto federation. 'The cause is labour costs as well
as energy, transport and environmental costs. Working hours are shorter than
in the auto industries of most other countries. And corporation tax is
higher than in our most important competing countries.'
Based on exchange rates last December, German auto makers had total wage
costs of DM47 an hour, two-thirds higher than the average of DM28.3 in the
rest of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in both the US and Japan at
DM34.4 an hour. German car workers clocked up only 1,483 hours in 1991 (the
latest figures available), a third fewer than the 2,181 hours worked by a
Japanese car worker, and 27 per cent fewer than their counterparts in the US
at 2,022 hours.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, who took over as the head of Volkswagen in January to
lead the troubled group's drastic restructuring, has not sought to hide the
problems behind the cloak of recession.
'The VW group's current difficulties can only be blamed in small part on the
weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other German
manufacturers,' he says. 'The real cause is much more the structural
problems of the entire sector. We have to accept that in the eight years of
booming sales we did not do our homework. Because as soon as sales fall we
are in the red.'
Intent on expanding its sales and market share at the expense of cutting fat
and keeping costs under control, Volkswagen, the European market leader, has
become the continent's highest-cost producer. French carmakers have a 20 per
cent cost advantage over the group, says Mr Piech, and the Japanese a lead
of 25-30 per cent.
The bare-knuckle legal fight between Volkswagen and General Motors over Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom Volkswagen recently poached from GM to
lead their cost-cutting drive, shows just how frayed the nerve-ends have
become. Cutting purchasing costs - Mr Lopez's forte - is one way forward for
VW, but the key to global competitiveness is unlikely to be found in a
German courtroom.
The remedies prescribed by VW's management have a familiar ring:
Jobs are one of the prime targets, with last year's 7,300 reduction at VW's
six domestic German plants to be followed by a cut of at least another
12,500 in 1993-94. Worldwide the group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda,
is cutting 30,000 jobs in 1993-94 to 243,000.
Capital investments are being drastically pruned, with a halving of planned
spending across the group and a virtual halt on investment at Audi and Seat
for the rest of the year.
Components suppliers are being put under severe pressure to cut prices. Some
are reporting demands for cuts of up to 30 per cent over the next three
years.
At the same time the group is seeking to rationalise drastically its
production and engineering processes with the urgent adoption of 'lean
production' methods. It is also seeking to reduce the proliferation of
similar components across the group's various model ranges, by moving to the
use of more common components.
Volkswagen is not alone in resorting to drastic remedies.
In a stunning departure from corporate tradition, Mercedes-Benz, the world's
most prestigious luxury carmaker, is trying to rethink the whole way it does
business with 'a very extensive realignment of its strategic product
policy', led by Mr Helmut Werner, who took over as chief executive last
month.
He admits that Mercedes-Benz's present luxury and executive cars are
'over-engineered', and says that the company would end up being 'priced-out'
of world markets if it persisted with such a policy for developing new
models.
Mr Werner claims that the only way Mercedes-Benz can maintain its
engineering and quality leadership is if it can also achieve cost
leadership. Gone are the days when the charging of premium prices could
disguise an uncompetitive cost-base. 'No one in the world is prepared to pay
for German complacency on the cost front,' says Mr Werner.
About 13,000 jobs were already eliminated by Mercedes-Benz last year in
Germany (at its car and commercial vehicle operations), reducing the
workforce from 225,000 to 212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs
are scheduled to be cut in the coming two years.
While the present crisis is at its most acute in Germany, the pain is being
felt elsewhere in the European industry. After two years of record losses,
Ford of Europe has been in the process of cutting 10,000 jobs since late
last year.
Fiat, under heavy attack by its rivals in its domestic fastness of Italy,
cut 9,000 jobs in its car operations in the two years to the end of 1992.
Under the pressure of falling sales it resorted to halting production lines
to eliminate the output of 230,000 cars last year and 180,000 in the first
half of 1993.
Even while production in existing plants is being pruned, new plant capacity
is coming on stream. European producers are commissioning plants with a
capacity for about 1.5m vehicles a year between mid-1992 and the end of
1994, although VW is delaying part of its expansion in eastern Germany. In
addition, Japanese vehicle makers are expected to have built a capacity in
Europe for some 1.2m vehicles a year by the end of the decade.
'The whole industry, but European manufacturers in particular, have to face
one particularly severe international challenge. This is worldwide
overcapacity,' says Mr Bruno Adelt, executive vice-president of the
Volkswagen brand division. 'For the remainder of the 1990s we estimate this
at more than 10m vehicles . . . Excess capacities in Europe will greatly
increase, competition will be tougher and above all pressure to sell at
lower prices will increase dramatically.'
Faced with the accelerating contraction of the market, established European
producers are clamouring for intervention by the European Commission to
renegotiate Japanese import levels.
'The agreements between the European Community and Japan are not enough,'
says Mr John Hardiman, chief executive of Ford of Germany. 'We are deeply
dissatisfied . . . We are demanding that Brussels sets Japanese export
quotas exactly in line with the actual development of the market . . . You
do not have to be a prophet to foresee that the goal of orderly adjustment
and a far-reaching restructuring of the European auto industry cannot be
reached by 1999.'
The real challenge is not so much the Japanese imports, however, as local
Japanese production in Europe, where Nissan, Toyota and Honda are already
showing that they can reach Japanese levels of quality and efficiency with
European (British) workforces, albeit in new plants and with new labour
agreements.
In the middle of these challenges European auto industry share prices have
performed with remarkable resilience. Some brave investors believe they can
see the start of the recovery, but most carmakers still cannot imagine when
the present decline will stop.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Brooke, the heritage secretary, is considering whether to lift the
ban on the UK's larger independent television companies being acquired or
merging. Hopes he may do so have been raised by his assertion that Britain's
broadcasting should not go the way of its motorcycle industry because of
unreasonable restrictions. The rules should change, but not for the reason
stated.
The issue has been precipitated by a European Community policy which will
open all ITV companies to hostile bids from elsewhere in the EC from the
start of next year. That makes a nonsense of a continued embargo on domestic
takeovers. However, the most powerful reason for abolishing it is that it
serves no useful purpose. The main arguments for keeping it are to prevent
unhealthy industry concentration and preserve regional broadcasting
services. But the strongest safeguard against anti-competitive behaviour is
the application of the UK's standard merger laws.
Regional programming is best assured for now by enforcing franchise licence
terms. That is what the Independent Television Commission is there to do.
Longer term, though, provision of regional services need not continue to be
regarded as a profitless social obligation. In the US, it has become a
rewarding business, attracting many participants.
In Britain, variety in local services has been inhibited by scarce frequency
spectrum. But new digital compression techniques - which may be introduced
on the planned fifth ITV channel - and gradual expansion of cable television
offer the promise of a far greater diversity of delivery systems. The ITC
needs to ensure that these new sources of competition are allowed to develop
freely.
However, Mr Brooke should be sceptical of some arguments advanced by the
abolitionist lobby. Much is made of the cost savings which industry
consolidation will permit. However, many of these efficiencies are available
without mergers or acquisitions by, for example, pooling production
facilities and contracting out services such as transmission. There is also
a risk that potential savings will not go to better programming but will be
dissipated in over-bidding for contested acquisitions.
Much the most dubious argument is that the ITV structure needs to
consolidate if British broadcasting is to prosper internationally. True,
even the biggest companies are dwarfed by foreign counterparts. But it is
not obvious that they possess the commercial vision and skills to compete
effectively on world markets. Indeed, the disappointing results of offshore
excursions by BT suggests businesses based on domestic monopolies make poor
national champions. Mr Brooke needs to remember that UK motorcycle
manufacturers failed not primarily because of inadequate size, but because
they grew used to captive markets and ignored new competitors until too
late.

THE LOCAL Government Commission which is reviewing the structure of local
councils in England has now published four reports. As anticipated when it
was launched last year, the commission is approaching its task with no
preconceived blueprint for how local government ought to be structured. The
different solutions adopted in the first four reports, however, suggest that
this pragmatic approach is less attractive than it seemed at the outset.
Some counties such as Derbyshire and Durham will survive, albeit without
large towns like Derby and Darlington, which will be reconstituted as county
boroughs. Others, such as Somerset and Gloucestershire, will survive only
for 'ceremonial and cultural' purposes, being divided into smaller
districts. The 'new' counties like Avon and Cleveland which failed to
generate popular support (or even a county championship cricket team) are to
be scrapped. The only option so far ruled out appears to be the preservation
of the status quo in which district councils provide street-level services
and county councils strategic services.
If the commission continues in this manner, much of the country will be
divided into district councils varying greatly in size. The smallest are
unlikely to be able to perform satisfactorily strategic functions like
planning and economic regeneration. In the large conurbations, the creation
of unitary authorities has required new quangos and joint boards to handle
such issues. If this is repeated where county councils are abolished, it
will do little to enhance accountability, one of the justifications for
moving towards single-tier authorities.
Nor is it clear that reorganisation will always save money, the other
rationale for eliminating a tier of local government. While each commission
report has claimed savings for the local taxpayer, the calculations are
hotly disputed by the councils recommended for the scrapheap. There may be
scope for economies of scale where services are to be provided by fewer
councils, as in Derbyshire. But where county services are to be divided up
among several district authorities, one possible outcome is a growth in
bureaucracy and higher costs to pay for it.
This piecemeal approach is a novel way of reorganising local government
which, even after 14 years of centralisation, employs more than 2m people
and spends Pounds 54bn a year. England needs a system of local government
that is capable of strategic action and which combines local delivery of
services with genuine electoral accountability. Is the Local Government
Commission sure that is what its reforms will produce?

FT  17 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The true case for an independent Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The case for an independent but accountable Bank of England is mainly that
it could make it easier to lock in a low rate of inflation. This is more
than it seems because the pain of recent recessions has been aggravated by
the need to reduce inflation after it has already taken off. But even the
retiring UK governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, oversold the case when he
attributed the upward drift of unemployment over three business cycles -
which has been a common European phenomenon - to the failure to contain
inflation. This is a structural problem which will be no more cured by an
independent Bank than will cancer or the common cold.
The distinguishing feature of monetary policy is that its short-term effects
are often the opposite of its long-term ones. The UK government has
committed itself to keeping inflation within a range of 1 to 4 per cent. But
sticking to this target may be what some economists call 'time
inconsistent'. In other words, it may not always pay the government to
observe its own guidelines.
Stimulating the economy with low interest rates in the period before an
election may bring a temporary increase in jobs and output. An increase in
government spending, not offset by taxes or tighter monetary policies, will
benefit specific groups, while the inflationary costs can sometimes be
deferred. Thus it may pay a government, which is sincerely intent on keeping
inflation low, to tie its own hands or 'pre-commit' itself, just as it may
pay someone trying to wean himself off smoking to clear all cigarette
packets out of the house.
WHY DO EX-CHANCELLORS TEND TO PUT FORWARD THE IDEA AND PRIME MINISTERS TO
REJECT IT?
There is no 'ex' about it. Both Nigel Lawson and Norman Lamont put forward
plans when they were chancellor. The unfortunate holders of that office know
that they get the blame when inflation gets out of hand, but they also see
how intrinsically political monetary policy decisions are, and how
short-term tactical motives will interfere with decisions.
Prime ministers, on the other hand, have itchy fingers and feel that they
cannot enjoy the full dignity of their office unless they can interfere in
every area of policy implementation.
Independent national central banks are required under the Maastricht treaty
for countries which want to go to a full monetary union, as a preliminary to
establishing an independent European Central Bank. Therefore the idea has
suffered guilt by association. But the UK can also have an independent
central bank of its own quite apart from Emu.
Many people confuse democracy with the unfettered rule of the government of
the day. A central bank is more accountable if it has to report directly or
via parliament than under the present system under which all
advice is secret and policies are supposed to emerge fully fledged from the
head of the chancellor, like Athene from the head of Zeus.
The US Federal Reserve is free of presidential control and reports to
Congress. One specific UK plan, dating right back to 1988, long before
others climbed on to this bandwagon, is described in an appendix in Nigel
Lawson's The View from Number 11. Under the Lawson plan, the Bank of England
'would have the statutory duty to preserve the value of the currency'. The
idea was to 'lock in an anti-inflationary force into the system as a
counterweight to the strong inflationary pressures which are always
lurking.' The governor and members of the Court would be appointed by the
government - the Court for a long period. The Bank would be answerable to
parliament in the sense that the governor would appear regularly before a
select committee.
IS THERE NOT A DANGER THAT AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK WILL CONCENTRATE ON
INFLATION? HOW ABOUT OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT?
The crucial insight is that there is no long-term choice between reasonable
price stability and growth. So you might as well have price stability, which
has advantages of its own and may provide a helpful background to policies
to stimulate growth.
Of course, policies to squeeze out high inflation often involve a painful
transitional recession. But if anything the pain is likely to be worse when
policy lacks credibility. Pay and prices will rise for longer; and the main
effects of a credit squeeze will for some time be on output and employment.
The speed of disinflation can be decided by democratic process. Under the
New Zealand Reserve Bank Act, passed with cross-party support by the former
Labour government in 1990, the Bank has total independence in the operation
of monetary and exchange rate policy. But the act leaves the definition of
price stability to the government, which sets a target range for inflation
in the form of a personal contract with the governor, normally for a fixed
five-year term. Contrary to hearsay, the Reserve Bank governor's salary is
not tied to inflation, although his job is on the line in the event of
failure. The government can amend the contract, but any change must be made
publicly, ensuring that monetary policy is always transparent.
The Reserve Bank governor, Don Brash, describes the contract as 'a useful
bulwark against any government which might wish to return to the bad old
days of saying one thing to the public about the need to control inflation
and at the same time trying to get mortgage rates down before an election.
That is the sort of thing which used to happen in New Zealand, and cannot
happen now.'
Don Brash was appointed by a Labour government, but has been reappointed by
the outspoken National party finance minister, Ruth Richardson, for a
further five years from this September. His new contract, like his old one,
will require inflation to be maintained within a range of 0-2 per cent. The
contract specifies the temporary adjustments that can be made for one-off
price rises and for distortions such as the effects of mortgage rates.
The act marked a watershed for New Zealand, which had suffered double-digit
inflation for most of the 20 years since 1970. The policy has become more
popular since recession has given way to what appears to be a sustainable
economic recovery. Growth in GDP reached 3 per cent in the 12 months to
December, and is widely expected to stay near this rate.
According to Brash, the New Zealand Reserve Bank's most significant
achievement has been a change in inflationary expectations. 'Regardless of
whether they agree with the policy, people know that the miserable bloke in
the Reserve Bank is going to keep pursuing it.'
IS NOT INFLATION YESTERDAY'S PROBLEM? SHOULD WE NOT WORRY MORE ABOUT
DEPRESSION AND UNEMPLOYMENT?
No one knows. But it is all too easy to have high inflation combined with
high unemployment, as has frequently happened in Latin America. Although
preventing inflation is usually the main task of central banks, occasionally
there is another supremely important task: that is to prevent a cumulative
contraction of spending, such as that which occurred in the 1930s when the
national income of countries like the US and Germany fell by a half in money
terms.
Although we have never had it since the second world war, I would give
central banks responsibility for avoiding deflation as well as inflation. As
Lord Lawson argues in his concluding chapter, a deflation in today's
circumstances would almost certainly be associated with cumulative failures
of financial institutions across national frontiers which could best be
fought by independent central banks co-operating together.
Alas, I do not think they would do it well, but they could act more quickly
and more informally than prime ministers and finance ministers. The Latin
American debt crisis of the early 1980s was an example.
WHICH ARGUMENT AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK DO YOU FIND MOST
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER?
The knowledge that the central bank had the task of fighting inflation might
make for bigger structural budget deficits. I am not sure how important this
is in practice. The main examples of supposedly conservative governments
running high budget deficits have been the US in the 1980s and Germany in
the 1990s. The Reagan administration persuaded itself that tax cuts would
pay for themselves through so-called supply-side effects. Germany would have
had a high post-unification deficit anyway. But it is difficult to see how a
pliant central bank would have helped in either country.
According to Don Brash, there are four key elements in central bank
accountability: the objective of price stability; a clear policy targets
agreement; the personal responsibility of the governor; and the publication
of a regular monetary policy statement. New Zealand has all four; Britain
has at most the first, and that not very clearly.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: A lesson in leadership for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GRENIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Pay-off punch' (June 8) is helpful as far as it goes in
supporting the Postel move to curb directors' rolling contracts. But does it
go far enough?
Postel appears to have the limited objective of rolling back three-year
contracts to 12 months at the outside. Surely, however, the real issue is
whether or not it is appropriate for directors to have service contracts of
any duration.
Some interesting light is shed on this issue in the recently published 1993
report and accounts of Marks and Spencer. The section on corporate
governance states categorically that neither the chairman nor any of the
executive directors has any form of service contract with the company. If M
and S is prepared to do without directors' service contracts, why shouldn't
the same procedure be acceptable for all the top 100 UK companies without
exception. This, after all, is what leadership by example is all about.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Dollars 21bn covers more than new Hong Kong airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLINTON LEEKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on Hong Kong's airport in the Aerospace survey ('Plethora
of airports - Hong Kong', June 8) does us less than justice. Simon Davies
wrongly suggested we are building an airport costing USDollars 21bn, which
would indeed be very expensive when compared with Japan's Dollars 10bn
airport at Kansai and Singapore's Dollars 1.3bn expansion at Changi.
In fact, our airport is only costing Dollars 8.8bn. The Dollars 21bn (all
the figures are out-turn prices) also covers 34 kilometres of highways and a
railway, including the world's longest suspension bridge carrying road and
rail traffic, plus 350 hectares of reclaimed urban land and a new town for
20,000 people.
Along with other port and railway schemes, these interlinked infrastructure
projects will form the basis for Hong Kong's economic expansion into the
next century. They will ease problems in congested urban areas and open new
areas for development, as well as starting a new highway to the border with
China. That is more than just an airport]
Mr Davies might also have noted that we are making outstanding progress with
construction of the Dollars 21bn programme: we have awarded contracts worth
some USDollars 4.4bn, all on time and within budget - a significant
achievement by international standards. This is going ahead on a
step-by-step basis while we continue talks with the Chinese government on
financing arrangements for the airport and airport railway.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Longer-term threat posed by trade imbalances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From FRANCISCO HG FERREIRA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While you understandably concentrate on the short-term issues addressed
by Peter Sutherland, the newly appointed director-general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('Failure on market access could 'sink' Gatt
round', June 11), I found most interesting his awareness of a longer-term,
but potentially much greater, threat. His call for '. . . legitimate
interests, particularly those of the developing world, . . . to be taken
into account by the developed world' could not be more relevant. Non-OECD
countries (the 'poor') - which account for some 85 per cent of the world's
population - are responsible for a mere 25 per cent of the world's
international trade (calculated using imports; data from the World
Development Report of the World Bank, 1992).
I believe these numbers explain why the seemingly endless rows between the
US, the EC and Japan focus so much of our attention. Nevertheless, developed
countries should not underestimate the threat to themselves from ignoring
trade demands from the poor majority.
Where goods and services cannot move, people will. If income differentials
are allowed to continue to widen - which they have a greater chance of doing
without freer trade in agricultural and basic consumer goods - massive
migration flows will be inevitable. Unless, that is, the current trend
towards closing external borders in the EC and ports in the US develops
fully into an international system of global apartheid.
We should all wish Mr Sutherland well. His task in convincing OECD
policymakers to take a long-term view is a hard but essential one.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: ITV shareholder sees directors facing a conflict of
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, This week the chairmen of 15 ITV companies have been busy lobbying the
heritage secretary for changes in the ITV network.
How many of the chairmen of the smaller companies - those that have been
putting the case against permitted takeover in their regions - have been
acting in the interests of their owners, as opposed to those of their
managements?
Directors have a duty to act in the interests of their shareholders. The
managements of these companies are ignoring a fundamental conflict of
interest between themselves and the owners - who are naturally interested in
maximising value. As the largest shareholder in one of them, Grampian
Television, I object to its directors lobbying against takeovers being
allowed by next door neighbours.
One chairman, Mr Louis Sherwood of HTV, says he is acting 'as a citizen'.
Shareholders in the ITV network in general and HTV in particular may feel
he, and others, have got their priorities wrong.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Jobs for all a realistic goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BRITTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 1944 William Beveridge wrote: 'Idleness is not the same as Want; but
a separate evil which men do not escape by having an income. They must also
have the chance of rendering useful service and of feeling that they are
doing so.' I offer this quotation in response to the letter from Prof Ronald
Dore ('Proper recognition still to be given to unemployment problem', June
15). The case for full employment is not based solely on concern to
alleviate poverty, but also on concern that everyone should participate in
the economic life of the community. A 'citizen's income' would not satisfy
that need.
I also believe that Prof Dore exaggerates the problems created for
employment by technical progress and improved welfare provision. We do not
at present realise the full potential of the labour force, except for a
minority of high-fliers. The 'learning capacity of people who did not do
very well at school' is not developed as it could be - to judge by what is
shown in international comparisons. The goal of full employment could still
be achieved in the UK if it is given sufficient priority - and achieved well
before the year 2020 on which Professor Dore asks us to focus our minds.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: A 'Spitting Image' Lysistrata - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be almost impossible to mount a production of Lysistrata more
shocking than the original. The erections, the blue jokes and, above all,
the satire are there in profusion in the Aristophanes text of 412 BC when -
to put it mildly - the war with Sparta was going badly.
Sir Peter Hall has achieved the impossible in another way. His production is
not shocking, not funny, not erotic, not topical and consequently has lost
the satire. If it were put on in Bosnia, it would have about as much effect
on the warring factions as a newspaper editorial urging mutual restraint.
Hall's direction at the Old Vic has the television programme 'Spitting
Image' written all over it. The men are old buffers; the women, far from
looking remotely like Helen of Troy or her ilk, resemble pantomime dames.
This is the original 'Spitting Image' mistake. If you make the targets look
over-grotesque, more like puppets than people, you diminish the force of the
satire because it is not close enough to reality. In Hall's Lysistrata, the
error is compounded. The essence of Aristophanes's play is the force of
sexual attraction. Only by withdrawing their favours do the women compel the
men to make peace. Even then Lysistrata has a hard enough time keeping the
rest of the women in line because the females are just as libidinous as the
males.
It would be good, indeed one expected, to see some of this sexual longing at
least hinted at on stage. Yet if you make the women look like harridans and
the men like left-overs from the Crimean War, you have negated the point of
the play. No-one could care a fig about this lot. Hall is not acknowledging
the power of sex; he is knocking it. I also object to the extraneous use of
four letter words; in Lysistrata there is plenty of room to use them
literally.
An accompanying blunder, though it is part of the same pattern, is that the
characters wear masks. There is no reason why this should be so, but I
suppose that if you give the women giant artificial busts, you might as well
conceal their facial beauty as well.
The other fundamental error is Ranjit Bolt's verse translation. I admired
Bolt's early work: for example, his translations of the Corneille comedies.
The trouble is that his style has become excruciatingly repetitive. Again
there is no necessity for a modern English version of Lysistrata to be in
verse at all. It would go down perfectly well in prose. What Bolt offers is
a string of couplets like: 'I'll be the lousiest lay he ever had/ He won't
have dreamed that sex could be so bad.' One knows that Aristophanes is
ribald; the effect is spoiled when the words descend into drivel.
There is a further lost opportunity in the set. The background world is
covered with slogans. It must have been possible to devise a few wittier
wilier graffiti than 'We hate all Spartans' and 'Your country needs you.'
There is very little sense, apart from a burst of machine gun fire at the
end and a few helmets, that a war is going on, lovely or otherwise. Joan
Littlewood would have been acutely embarrassed.
All that is a great pity, for Lysistrata is played by Geraldine James who
should have ideal for the role. She struggles manfully against the
obstacles. There are a couple of good songs, one where Ms James goes into
splendid cabaret-style and leads the women's chorus in 'I made you give up
sex to save the nation.' The other is the men's chorus with 'I've got to
find a pimp/Before this thing goes limp.' I know the words are weak, but it
sounds all right and there is some nice saxophone.
The performance runs for 90 minutes without an interval. The ending
especially is intolerably slow, for once Lysistrata has made her point there
is nothing left to happen, not even the joy of sex.
Old Vic Theatre (071) 928 7616
American theatre is getting a good showing on the London fringe at present,
and deservedly so. At the New Grove, a relatively new pub theatre in the
Euston Road, there is a revival of Sam Shepard's The Tooth of Crime, which
was first performed at the Open Space in 1972.
The piece has its origins in the Rock and Roll, drugs cult of the late 1950s
and, like much contemporary American drama, contains more than its share of
violence. However, it is the quality of the writing and the variety of the
playing that stand out. If the images are those of Hollywood, they adapt
very well to the stage.
The outstanding performance in The Tooth of Crime is by Guy Oliver-Watts as
Hoss, the rock singer who is ultimately overtaken by the new age. There is a
touch of Hamlet in the play which goes beyond the verbal duelling and is
clearly deliberate. Direction is by Richard Kimmel who heads a Boston-based
company called Empty Gate. Unfortunately it runs only until Saturday, but a
new Sam Shepard, States of Shock, is opening at the Salisbury Playhouse in
association with the Royal National Theatre Studio later in the month.

<TEXT>
LES NUITS FAUVES (18) Cyril Collard
MATINEE (PG) Joe Dante
THE TRIAL (12) David Jones
BOXING HELENA (18) Jennifer Chambers Lynch
FIRE IN THE SKY (15) Robert Liebermann
Cyril Collard screenwrote Les Nuits Fauves, the succes de scandale of the
French film year, from his own quasi-autobiographical gay novel. He also
directed it and took the starring role of the HIV-positive young (anti)hero.
As a grim rounding-off of this one-man show, and its sense of consuming
identification between artist and project, Collard himself died of Aids
shortly after the film's release.
Life and art, let alone death and art, make bewildering bedfellows. When I
first saw Les Nuits Fauves at the Berlin Film Festival I thought it - and
still do despite the special pleading of real-life tragedy - an exercise in
manic narcissism. Here is our handsome, fast-living hero Jean (Collard), a
photographer-musician swinging sexually between a teenage girl (Romane
Bohringer) and a handsome, thuggish sports player (Carlos Lopez). And here
is a Paris vast, kinetic and unruly, as seen by a hand-held camera trying to
shake us into empathy with the movie's seismic romantic nihilism.
Les Nuits Fauves is an ego trip through a self-willed hell. Doomed to an
early death, a young man pursues his last long delirium of pleasure and
existential danger (to others as much as himself, since he conceals his HIV
status): until after two hours of up-yours bravura, the film's last scene
ushers in the deathbed repentance. Collard gazes out at a sunset, and as the
surreally speeded orb fizzes below the skyline and then up again we hear his
voice-over: 'I may die of Aids. But it's no longer my life. I am in life.'
This climactic flood of pantheistic awe is meant to cleanse away two hours
of tunnel-vision self-gratification. But nothing, ultimately, can disguise
the fact that Les Nuits Fauves is a serenade to solipsism disguised as a
story about relationships. The girl's character description could have been
scribbled on a cigarette packet: moppet turns into Medea on discovering she
may have caught Aids. (She spends the film's second half burning up the
telephone line with sulphurous insults). And the sportsman remains an
unsolved enigma throughout. Do we see latent guilt in his none-too-latent
homophobia, as when he viciously beats up a gay man during an initially mild
S-&amp;-M session? Do we see mere brute stupidity? Or do we see . . . ?
We see what we want. There are no real characters save Jean in this movie.
The people he ranges around himself are neutrons hired to bombard him until
dramatic fission is achieved. And though the film sometimes feints at
foregrounding the subject of Collard/Jean's egotistic failure of emotional
reach - 'You're incapable of loving]' screams the girl - that failure
becomes the failure of the movie. It rants and raves; it careers about the
land with its hero's video-camera. But the one journey it never makes is
into the skin of other characters.
The missing dimension of humanity is finally, perversely supplied by the
film-maker's own death. Real-life events cannot help affecting our emotional
response to art, even if they fail to budge us from our critical verdict.
That Collard shared his own hero's anticipated end does not make Les Nuits
Fauves a better film, but it gives it a belated, eerie poignancy. A crusade
for egomania that seems cruel as fiction becomes almost quixotic as
half-fact: a pageant of hubris enacted by an artist who knew that his
nemesis was already waiting.
The rest of the movie week says hello to the silly season. Blithest
silliness - it comments on movie folly rather than perpetrating it - is Joe
Dante's Matinee. In the tradition of Dante's Gremlins or Explorers this
pours parody, social comment and grand guignol into its aesthetic
cocktail-mixer; then gives it a shake and waits for it to froth over.
To a Key West, Florida, already gripped by real-life historical panic - the
Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 - comes movie horror merchant Lawrence Woolsey
(John Goodman) Mission: to cash in on the anxiety climate by opening his
latest shoestring screamer 'Mant.' ('Half man, half ant, all terror]'
proclaims the poster). Woolsey's greatest fan is youngster Gene (Simon
Fenton), taking his mind off Dad's absence on a blockade ship by helping the
shlock-mogul set out his stall of gimmicks. These include: seats wired to
shock the audience, man in ant's head roaming cinema, and 'joke' nuclear
explosion to round things off.
Woolsey is based on that great gimmickmaster William Castle: a man who
released everything into the audience from skeletons to electric shocks to
increase appreciation of films like The Tingler or Horror Of Haunted Hill.
(There are also be touches of Dante's own mentor, Roger 'Buckets Of Blood'
Corman).
But guessing games can wait till after the film. This slides its merry way
from real-life near-apocalypse - Key West was only 90 miles from the
epicenter of what many thought might be World War Three - to the
sublimations of movie fantasy, via a typical Dante's inferno of gags,
ghoulishness and period grace-notes.
Boxing Helena, by debut writer-director Jennifer Lynch (David's 24-year-old
daughter), and The Trial, directed by David Jones from Harold Pinter's
Kafka-based script, were surely mixed up at birth? Why else is Mr Lynch's
favourite actor Kyle McLachlan - the chinful wonder of Twin Peaks - not
starring in Miss Lynch's movie as the surgeon hero who cuts off the arms and
legs of his beloved (Sherilyn Fenn) the better to adore her?
Instead Britain's Julian Sands signs on up as the nutty American sawbones;
while at the other end of the Western hemisphere McLachlan struggles with an
English accent as the German-Czech hero of Kafka's paranoid classic.
Why is McLachlan's Joseph K English-brogued? Because this is a Great
European Classic co-produced by the BBC. In period-accoutred Prague -
crumbly streets, onion domes and only one renegade TV aerial in sight - the
likes of Juliet Stevenson, Alfred Molina and Sir Anthony Hopkins purl forth
the Pinter-precise prose. And Mr McLachlan flat-rackets back the arias of
bewildered indignation.
The cinema has now given us two movies of The Trial made at opposite ends of
the disaster spectrum. Where Welles's 1963 effort was OTT-baroque, this one
is visionless, lifeless and dreamless. It turns the work of a great Middle
European fabulist into middlebrow culture fodder. Every Kafka frisson is
flattened by declamatory literalism; every dark Kafka joke is trapped in the
headlights of the film's stagy overemphasis.
Boxing Helena is another potentially startling idea boxed into banality by
the mise-en-scene. Boy loves girl; boy quadruply amputates girl; boy lives
happily ever after (almost).
Tsk] tsk] what will the feminists say? Like most people, they may be too
underwhelmed to care. The grand guignol all happens off-screen, leaving the
film as tame as a tea party. And with the possible exception of Ms Kim
Basinger, who lost Dollars 9m for breaking her alleged pledge to star in
this limbless wonder, everyone connected with it seems tuned into another
channel. Sands camps and hisses as if doing his 'Be a mad genius' exercises
for Ken Russell. Miss Fenn is inexpressive with or without anatomical
extensions. And Giacomo Puccini delivers a stream of great arias on the
soundtrack, though 'Nessun dorma' hardly describes the state of
consciousness prevailing at the Press show.
There is always Outer Space. Fire In The Sky is based on the 'true' story of
Arizona logger Travis Walton (DB Sweeney) who was snatched into the sky by
an alien spaceship. Days later, after what seems to have been a short but
nasty interstellar medical examination, he was re-deposited naked on Earth.
Sheriff James Garner initiates the enquiry as the film gradually establishes
that yes, something strange may have happened; and yes, people could be
fooled into believing it given enough loud music (Mark Isham) and splashy
special effects (Industrial Light And Magic of Star Wars and ET).

Why has the spirit of the times changed so much that it is now widely
regarded as admirable to increase company profits by sacking thousands of
people? Could it be that after the millions of family tragedies in a major
war each country experiences a strong sense of brotherhood but that today we
are a long way away from any such war? The thought is prompted by Business
Matters which reports on 'The House That Jack Built': Jack Welch's
'down-sizing' of the General Electric company in the US which has involved
'laying off' 100,000 workers (7.20 BBC2). Practically all Italians seem to
agree their country is undergoing a dramatic, albeit virtually bloodless,
revolution. They differ only in their predictions of the outcome: some
believe it will lead to the first stable Italian state, others that the old
power centres (Mafia, political parties, church) will ensure even greater
conspiracy than before. As part of its 'Italian Week' The Late Show holds a
studio discussion (11.15 BBC2). True Stories offers yet another documentary
about American PoWs supposedly still missing after the Vietnam war (9.35
C4).

FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: Grieg, Mozart and Szymanowski - London concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grieg was born 150 years ago last Tuesday, on which day the Royal
Philharmonic devoted a concert to him in the Royal Festival Hall. Not the
right place, really: apart from the Piano Concerto there is precious little
concert-size Grieg for orchestra.
Beyond the Concerto, to which the pianist Geir Henning Braaten and the
conductor Per Dreier gave the unhurried, appreciative attention due a
national monument, this concert represented Grieg's best virtues dimly.
First we had the dreadfully faded 'Homage March', then the 'Norwegian Bridal
Procession' - as orchestrated by Delius: a world premiere, this] - which was
alright. Next, the young soprano Anne-Margrethe Eikaas, in demure national
costume, sang six orchestrated songs. Her voice is true and pretty, though
not large, and she delivered every song with the same bright innocence,
unsullied by the least nuance.
After the interval we heard an orchestral version of 'Bell-ringing', which
counts as mildly experimental but is not interesting for any other reason.
Finally, the four Symphonic Dances - the adjective is ill-earned - of
Grieg's op. 64 proved amiable, lightweight and repetitive: far less
ambitious than, say, Dvorak in this undemanding genre. Dreier and the RPO
dealt affectionately with them.
Sponsored by the Royal Norwegian Embassy and DYNO
On the face of it, the Philharmonia's Festival Hall programme last Friday
looked curiously marginal: early, lightweight Mozart, and Szymanowski's
grave Stabat Mater of 1926. With Claus Peter Flor conducting, it drew a
creditable full house nonetheless. No doubt the appearance of the Labeque
sisters in Mozart's three-piano concerto K242, with Bruno-Leonardo Gelber as
the third pair of hands, exerted a considerable pull; but Szymanowski - even
when as sober as here - wields an appeal that is gaining new credit.
In Mozart, the three pianists were scrupulously charming. Though K. 242 is a
piece of little density, they suggested a many-levelled structure by picking
out small inner parts. The concerto sounded deceptively rich and rewarding;
the effect would have been greater still, had not the Adagio sounded so
laid-back and lax.
Before that, Flor and his quartet of solo voices - Sylvia Greenberg and
Linda Finnie, Thomas Randle and Anthony Michaels-Moore - had done light,
dancing justice to young Mozart's Missa Brevis in D, K. 194. This little
Mass presupposes some unwritten plainchant at the beginnings of successive
sections, and a male section of the Philharmonia Chorus undertook that. Cool
and chaste, it jostled against Mozart's sprightly Rococo inventions.
The elegiac Szymanowski was more consistent. Flor calibrated its melancholy
sounds to a theatrical nicety, and Mss. Greenberg and Finnie duetted with
heartbreaking sweetness. It was not quite the right work, however, to close
a concert that boasted such lively preliminaries. After the Stabat Mater had
risen to stern utterance in the middle, the subsidence into familiarly
sweet, all-purpose harmonies at the end sounded like a cop-out.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: Muldowney tracks a trumpet - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dominic Muldowney's Trumpet Concerto, which John Wallace and the Premiere
Ensemble under Mark Wigglesworth introduced on Monday at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall, is his sixth concerto and probably his most successful orchestral work
to date. It is an attractive, catchy piece, a single movement that plays for
just under 20 minutes and effortlessly parades Muldowney's array of skills,
with deft orchestration and a teasing patchwork of melodic tags.
The easy accessibility of the score belies its mechanics. As another of
Muldowney's explorations of tempo layers, the players and conductor all have
to listen to computer-generated click tracks to keep them on their
metronomic course. The concerto operates on three carefully geared tempi -
the solo trumpet and a piano have the fastest pulse, the strings and other
wind (the only players controlled by the conductor) the slowest, while
widely spaced pairs of clarinets and marimbas take a speed between them.
But the result is much more than a neat piece of clockwork; the music pans
easily and smoothly between the groups, adroitly changing perspective.
Behind the trumpet the piano functions almost like a continuo instrument,
filling in textures, highlighting the solo line.
Muldowney has likened the piece to a latter-day Brandenburg Concerto; the
outline is a sonata shape with clearly marked points of development and
reprise. The lingering flavour, though, is provided by the melodic material,
derived in part from a theatre song which Muldowney wrote a couple of years
ago. It dodges in and out of the solo line, is caught from different angles
and in different shades, and provides the trumpet with some fine
opportunities for nimble virtuosity; Wallace played it quite superbly.
The new concerto was wedged between two Mozart symphonies, the E flat K543
and the Jupiter K551. The Premiere Ensemble offer small-band Mozart, played
on modern instruments but informed with some of the lessons of authentic
practice, including the affectation of observing the second-half repeat in
the finale of K549.
In such music Wigglesworth is a puzzling, unsatisfying conductor, producing
bustling, superficially acute playing with cosmetic expressivo which seems
to mask a basic instability of tempo and phrasing; at a particularly awkward
moment, it seemed, click tracks might have helped in Mozart too.

FT  17 JUN 93 / People: Lambeth vacuum filled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the least sought-after vacancies in local government has just been
filled. Henry Gilby (above) is to take over as chief executive of Lambeth
borough council in south London.
The post was most recently vacated by Herman Ouseley, who left to take up
the chair of the Commission for Racial Equality.
His parting shot was a damning report alleging maladministration, fraud and
inefficiency costing Pounds 9.5m.
That was followed last month by an even more damning public interest report
by the district auditor, which found that more than Pounds 20.2m had been
spent illegally.
One of the report's most pressing recommendations was that a new chief
executive from outside the council should be appointed to serve for a long
term. However, Gilby, 50, already has 16 years' experience at Lambeth,
having worked his way up from senior assistant director of the amenity
services department to become director of environmental services. Before
that he had worked with four different borough councils and also for Essex
county council.
Like every other development in Lambeth's labyrinthine politics, the
appointment has been hotly contested, with all non-Labour conucillors voting
against it.
Liberal Democrat councillors complained that the appointment was originally
advertised for only six months and that many applicants were hence deterred.
They also claim that the total cost of Gilbey's appointment would be more
than Pounds 300,000, because of the offer of 10 years superannuation at the
end of his contract. They also argue that external candidates should have
been considered.
But Gilby has made plain his determination to clean up Lambeth. He
contributed to Ouseley's Section Five report and says: 'In my view,
significant changes are required immediatiely to put this council on a sound
footing.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DENNIS REDIKER has been appointed president and chief executive officer of
the American operations of ECC International, part of English China Clays,
the world's largest producer of ball clay used as fillers and coatings in
paper manufacturing.
Rediker, 49, will be responsible for the group's north and south American
operations which have grown substantially following the acquisition of
Georgia Kaolin in 1990.
He will report directly to Graham Lovering who remains managing director of
ECC International's world wide industrial minerals business.
English China Clays has reorganised since Andrew Teare, previously managing
director of the Rugby cement group, was appointed chief executive in 1990.
As part of its plan to concentrate on the industrial minerals business the
group last week announced a Pounds 113.4m rights issue, a Pounds 202.3m US
acquisition and plans to hive off its UK and US building materials business
into a separate company.
English China, which had previously announced it was pulling out of UK
housebuilding, said it was acquiring Calgon, the US speciality chemicals
business, for Dollars 307.5m from Merck, the US drugs group.
Teare argues that Calgon will complement ECC's industrial minerals business
which has become increasingly sophisticated in the use and development of
speciality chemicals for paper-making and other processes.
Rediker previously worked for ten years with Mead Corporation, one of the
country's biggest paper manufacturers.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Technology: Focusing in on the future -After years of delay,
Australia's high-technology city is suddenly moving forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six years after it was proposed by the Japanese government, a moribund
Australian plan to build a high-technology 'city of the future' in Adelaide
is showing signs of returning to life.
The project, inelegantly named the Multi Function Polis, has been stalled by
political instability since it was approved by the federal and South
Australian state governments in 1991. The delay prompted speculation that
the MFP was being allowed to die - a view that gained ground with the
retirement in March of John Button, the former federal industry minister,
who was a strong supporter of the project.
But a sudden flurry of activity by the MFP Development Corporation, set up
by the state government to run the project, suggests a scaled-down version
of the MFP will go ahead. Most significantly, the corporation's board,
appointed only last October, recently appointed its first chief executive,
ending a six-month search for someone capable of reviving the project.
It will not be an easy task. The MFP concept has been shrouded in confusion
since it was floated in a 1987 speech by Hajime Tamura, then Japan's
minister of international trade and industry. A joint Australian/Japanese
feasibility study which followed Tamura's speech prompted concern by
referring airily to the MFP as 'a biosphere' and a place for 'renaissance
living' without putting any flesh on the vision.
Australian unease increased when a second report produced for the federal
government concluded that the project would only be viable with a population
of 200,000, of whom 80 per cent would have to be foreigners. There has also
been confusion about the cost of the project, which has been variously
estimated at ADollars 6bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and ADollars 13bn. The corporation
now says only that the first of 10 phases will cost ADollars 150m.
Paradoxically, the delay in getting the MFP off the ground may have saved
the project by giving the development corporation time to refine the
elements that were unlikely to work or politically unacceptable. There is
now no sign of the science fiction jargon which dogged the MFP's early days,
although officials continue to brush aside criticism of its clumsy name. But
there are more substantial refinements, too:
The proposed population has been reduced to about 50,000 people, equivalent
to less than 5 per cent of Adelaide's population. Most of the newcomers
would be Australians.
Japanese involvement is being played down, although officials deny that this
is a response to criticism. The international advisory board comprises three
Australians, two Japanese, two Koreans, a Taiwanese, an American and four
Europeans.
Grandiose proposals for a fee-paying 'world university' have been abandoned,
and a proposed 'information utility' joint venture with the private sector
will now be a public-sector project.
Complex plans to make the project a joint venture with the private sector
have been dropped, at least for the first phase. Instead, the development
corporation is seeking direct government funding.
The revised plan envisages the development over about 30 years of a series
of 'villages' on four sites centred on 1,840 hectares of wasteland at
Gillman, a low-lying area about 20 minutes' drive from central Adelaide. The
villages would include about 1,000 hectares of waterways and 800 hectares of
parklands and forests, creating a pleasant urban landscape not dissimilar to
some existing Adelaide suburbs.
There is little doubt that the swampy Gillman area could be successfully
developed - similar land elsewhere in the city has already been developed
privately into an upmarket housing estate. The state government also
controls most of the potential residential land in and around Adelaide,
enabling it to underwrite the value of housing on the site by delaying the
release of land elsewhere.
But if it is to succeed, the MFP will have to be much more than an upmarket
housing estate. Specifically, it is designed to help Australia develop
expertise in four key areas:
Innovative urban development. The sites would be 50 per cent more energy
efficient than the South Australian average, and would feature dual water
and sewerage systems, allowing recycling of water for non-drinking uses. A
services company set up by the development corporation and a number of
private companies would develop energy saving and waste recycling technology
and expertise for commercial sale.
The services company is considering a host of ideas, including the
commercial use of sewage sludge for brick making and fertiliser and
generating electrical power from waste disposal.
Information technology. All buildings would be linked by broadband fibre
optic cable, allowing a large-scale experiment in the use of interactive and
intelligent communications devices. If the federal government and other
state governments agree, the MFP would co-ordinate national tele-medicine
activities (in which diagnosis and even surgery can be controlled over large
distances using videoconferencing facilities.)
The project would include a media studies centre on the Gold Coast of
Queensland, providing advanced facilities for film and television
post-production work. The MFP planners also hope to build on Australia's
high reputation for innovative computer software. One promising area is the
conversion of western software to Asian languages and conventions.
Education. In place of the abandoned plan for a world university, the MFP is
now promoting a joint venture with South Australia's three universities to
establish a fee-paying Asian business school to expand Australia's existing
role as a source of education facilities for emerging Asian economies. The
project also plans to develop Australia's expertise in distance learning
techniques, including an expansion of a fibre optic video conferencing
system already being used to deliver technical further education to remote
communities.
Environment. Building on the polluted and swampy Gillman site would provide
valuable environmental management skills, which are increasingly in demand
around the world. Other ideas include using recycled water to replenish
underground reservoirs (aquifers), which are being depleted by overuse. Some
researchers even speculate that the sandy aquifers could be used to treat
raw sewage.
Despite the simplifications, MFP officials still have difficulty in
explaining the project concisely - Rod Keller, the acting chief executive,
took 15 minutes to deliver a 'one sentence' explanation of its objectives.
But Keller says the project will gain credibility over the next few months
as earthmoving work starts on the Gillman site and final decisions are made
on the availability of government funding.
Keller admits that less than ADollars 300,000 has so far been committed to
the project by its overseas corporate supporters, which include some of the
biggest companies in Japan and South Korea. But he claims most criticism of
Japanese involvement in the project is racist, and insists that the 84
Japanese corporate supporters will begin to invest as soon as Australia
shows its commitment to the MFP.
'My father was killed by Japanese bombing in Darwin (during the second world
war), so I have as much reason as anyone to be suspicious of the Japanese,'
Keller says. 'But if we can't get past that and recognise that we need
investment from Japan, South Korea and other foreign countries then we all
ought to put our heads in the sand.'
Robin Marrett, chairman of the state's Economic Development Authority, says
the project dovetails neatly with South Australia's need to develop
technology-based industries to replace manufacturing, which has been hit by
reductions in protective tariffs.
Marrett says the project will make 'real strides forward' in the next 12
months. But he concedes that the project may yet face problems. 'Right now
the MFP is at a crossroads. There has been a lot of talk about it, but the
talk has been mainly in conceptual terms.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Technology: A little camera with big ideas - The latest
smart vision system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists around the world may soon no longer be blinded by headlight glare
in their rear-view mirrors thanks to a microchip camera and image processing
system invented by a Scottish start-up company.
That is only the first commercial application of what has the potential to
be world-beating semiconductor technology developed by a group of scientists
at Edinburgh University three years ago.
Last month, VLSI Vision Ltd (VVL), the company set up to develop this
technology, introduced the world's first image-processing system on a single
microchip.
Donnelly, the big Massachusetts-based manufacturer of rear-view mirrors, has
snapped up the combined camera and computer on a chip, known as the imputer,
to control a new self-adjusting anti-glare mirror. Using electrochromic
technology, the mirror's surface (containing the imputer) darkens to cope
with outside glare. The deal is a valuable one for VVL, one of a new
generation of small design houses which have limited resources but must
survive on the uniqueness of their ideas.
'Without VVL, Donnelly would not have thought about putting a camera into a
rear-view mirror,' says Stewart Smith, VVL's marketing manager. Peter
Denyer, the Edinburgh University professor who invented the technology and
is now managing director of VVL, believes it can grow into a Pounds 20m
company within five years. 'I have learnt to speak cautiously,' said Denyer,
'but that's possible if one of our products takes off and I believe any of
them is capable of it.'
Denyer and his team have created a smart vision system which can be made
small enough and cheaply enough to introduce image-processing technology
into new applications from production-line monitoring to supermarket
checkout scanners. 'Nowhere in the world can you find a camera at such a
size and price. It will be unique for a while,' says Denyer.
Japanese companies such as Sony lead the world in miniature optical sensors
called charge coupled devices (CCDs) which are used in camcorders. US
companies specialise in fast microprocessors which can turn optical data
into usable information. VVL, which has Pounds 2m of development capital,
combined the CCD sensor with a microprocessor which can process digital
picture information at 1bn bits per second on a single integrated circuit
costing less than Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.40). But the first production order
from Donnelly, the world's largest company in its sector, is likely to be
priced at less than Dollars 5 per circuit.
Denyer and his team have none of the financial resources usually thought
necessary in the semiconductor industry. The VVL microchip is made in France
by custom chip-maker ES2. Their asset is the ability to innovate in
semiconductor chip design and software development.
To help find commercial applications for the imputer - such as inspection,
traffic control, navigation, and robotics - VVL has produced a development
system, with special software, costing Pounds 500. It can be used as an
image processor in its own right, but Denyer says its real aim is to enable
customers to develop applications.
Once the application is found, VVL will compress the system into an
integrated circuit the size of a postage stamp. Denyer believes this will
give VVL atechnological edge over Japan and the US.
VVL is typical of the small, high-tech start-up companies scattered across
California which have done so much to give the US its world lead in
computer, semiconductor and software design.
It has long been suggested that the reluctance of British investors to back
new technology companies has stifled the start-up culture in the UK. Denyer
believes this is a myth. He had no trouble in raising the necessary capital
from private investors.
He believes inventing something is not enough for university scientists if
they want a successful product. The ideas must have a commercial
application.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fresh chapter for
retailers - WH Smith's schools initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MARTIN ROSENBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If schools are short of books, computers and other equipment, it is a
problem for pupils and teachers. But it is also an opportunity for companies
that want to enhance their corporate image and sell products at the same
time. This opportunity is being increasingly exploited.
Several leading retailers are now implementing promotions where schools will
get the benefit from the incentive to purchase. This week WH Smith launched
its 'Free books for schools' initiative, the company's largest promotion.
Until 10 September customers will receive a voucher worth 10p for each
Pounds 2 they spend. Primary schools can collect these vouchers and redeem
them via WH Smith for a maximum of Pounds 500 worth of books.
Following Tesco's highly successful 'Computers for schools' scheme, WH
Smith's approach reflects the rapid development of 'cause-related' or
'social' marketing in the UK.
One in four primary schools has already registered for the scheme, put
together by sales promotion agency LGM. WH Smith expects to distribute up to
Pounds 5m worth of books. If so, the promotion will have to drum up a lot of
extra business to be worthwhile. 'We are confident it will work,' says Julia
Nolan, marketing services manager at WH Smith. 'It's nice to be able to do
something which meets our commercial objectives and gives benefit to the
community.'
Next month WH Smith's rival John Menzies will launch a parallel programme.
Vouchers will again be given on a Pounds 2 spend, although only on purchases
of books or stationery. However, the Menzies scheme will also allow
secondary schools to collect and redeem vouchers.
In the autumn another books-for-schools plan will be launched by Boots,
based on a Pounds 5 spend.
This rush of copycat schemes has been inspired by the Tesco initiative, in
which schools could redeem vouchers for Acorn computers and software. The
supermarket chain is now employing this idea for a second year. Last year
8,000 schools received Pounds 3m worth of equipment. And according to Tesco
even more schools are involved this year. Distribution of vouchers has
ceased, but schools have until early July to send them in.
'Many people thought the Tesco scheme was a good idea, combining customer
loyalty and community benefit, so we are now getting lots of 'me-toos','
says Susan Short, secretary general of the Institute of Sales Promotion. The
institute provides a copy clearance service and she adds: 'This time last
year we had no such schemes. In the past three months we've had six or seven
proposed. Most come from retailers, but there is also a major, fast-moving
consumer goods manufacturer of leading brands.'
The attractions of such programmes are clear. They are loyalty schemes which
aid a good cause. Tesco describes them as incentive promotions driven by
community rather than personal needs. They boost sales while creating a
valuable association and generating good publicity.
This is part of a trend in which corporate do-gooding is more closely tied
to business objectives. Andrew Wilson of Ashridge Management Centre, who has
been investigating the motivation behind companies' community involvement,
says: 'Our research shows that most large companies are moving away from
old-style philanthropy, and are looking for a business-related pay-off. They
are trying to be more cost-effective and professional in their community
involvement.'
But will returns diminish as such promotions become more widespread? Tesco,
which is cagey about publicly quantifying the pay-back, recognises it will
have to improve its scheme if it is to retain its reputation as a leader in
this field.
Short thinks others will respond with wider diversification: 'The idea may
well be taken further into other areas of social needs such as health or
community care.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cross-border
Kraftsmen - The US food group is aiming for closer collaboration between its
European units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon after Todd Martin became vice-president of marketing and business
development at Kraft General Foods Europe 18 months ago, he made a radical
decision. He gave his job away.
That is how he describes the thinking behind a recent shake-up of marketing
strategy at the large, US-owned food group, intended to tackle one of the
toughest dilemmas facing consumer products manufacturers operating in
several European countries.
The challenge is to find a management structure which maximises scale
economies and eliminates wasteful duplication, while remaining sensitive to
often very different patterns of local demand.
Prompted by the single market, tougher competition and the growing power of
retailers, other companies including Unilever and Mars have recently
extensively re-organised their operations in an effort to meet these
objectives.
However, in several cases, the search for strategic coherence has led to
unwieldy centralisation or blurred responsibilities, leaving national
managers confused and demoralised.
Martin was determined to avoid these mistakes. Instead, he set out to make
the group's eight European operating subsidiaries responsible for initiating
and implementing cross-border collaboration.
His approach was coloured by Kraft's failed attempts a decade ago to impose
uniform product and marketing strategies across Europe. The results were so
catastrophic and created such ill will that the central marketing team was
disbanded soon afterwards.
The loose system of headquarters co-ordination which replaced it mollified
KGFE's national managers, but discouraged direct communication between them.
Each pursued its own marketing strategies, even for big international brands
such as Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft dressings.
By the time Martin, a 37-year-old American, arrived, national managers had
begun to chafe at this compartmentalised structure. They needed little
persuasion, he says, to see the advantages of closer cross-border
collaboration.
A year ago, he set up eight 'core teams', covering KGFE's principal product
categories and the main marketing functions. The teams, which meet for two
days, three times a year, bring together more than 100 KGFE national
marketing staff.
Each team has a co-ordinator, assigned to KGFE's Munich headquarters for two
to three years from a country unit, who identifies issues of common concern,
prepares research and case studies and guides debate. However, what to do
and how to do it are left to national managers to decide jointly.
'I had to look to self-interest to drive this process because I can't be
everywhere at once making sure it works,' says Martin, who stays away from
team meetings so that managers can discuss mistakes and failures without
fear of reproach.
The biggest financial pay-off so far is from agreements to rationalise the
specifications and packaging of the 1,000 KGFE product lines sold in more
than one country, which account for 40 per cent of the group's Dollars 3.6bn
(Pounds 2.3bn) annual sales. Some come in more than 50 versions, often
because of unco-ordinated decisions by country managers rather than real
differences in local demand.
KGFE expects decisions already taken to reduce by Dollars 10m in the next
two years the Dollars 100m in manufacturing fixed costs needed to support
this product complexity. Martin thinks savings of as much again are
achieveable.
Another priority has been to improve effectiveness of brand management and
advertising. The main goal here is not to cut costs, but to get maximum
mileage from the Dollars 400m KGFE spends annually on advertising and
marketing.
Relying heavily on comparisons of national subsidiaries' past experience and
detailed analyses of failures as well as successes, the core teams have
begun to define general principles for effective marketing.
One is that food products are often better promoted by focusing on questions
such as when, how and by whom they are eaten, rather than by concentrating
on intrinsic qualities such as texture and taste, as some national units
have done in the past.
The objective is a broadly consistent strategy across Europe which can be
tailored to individual markets. It is already being practised in television
commercials for Philadelphia cream cheese, one of KGFE's main product lines.
In the commercials, a housewife shows a visitor various ways of serving
Philadelphia. In Italy, where the aim was to differentiate the product from
the many other soft cheeses on the market, an exotic touch has been injected
by casting the visitor as a Japanese au pair. But in Spain, a hard-cheese
eating country where Philadelphia is unfamiliar, KGFE played safe by making
the visitor a neighbour's daughter.
For a new range of do-it-yourself pizza and pasta dinners, sold under the
Miracoli brand, KGFE uses identical commercials in five countries. These
show an Italian family enthusing at mealtime, in Italian, over the toppings
and sauces available.
Ironically, the range is not sold in Italy, where its potential is
considered very limited. However, as Martin observes, the Miracoli brand
stands 'not for Italian food, but for the idea of Italian food'.
Unlike previous KGFE campaigns, the Miracoli commercials were neither
developed by each country separately, nor imposed from the centre. Instead,
core team members adopted a campaign thought up by KGF Belgium after judging
it superior to alternatives developed by their own and other subsidiaries.
The Miracoli dinners are also an early result of efforts to develop more
products jointly. Since the new system began, the list of research and
development proposals from national subsidiaries has halved, and many more
are for products to be sold in several countries.
'In the past, there were almost no multi-country projects - and if there
were, it was pure coincidence,' says Phil Smith, marketing director of KGF's
UK operation. 'The core teams have got marketing people to focus on big new
ideas and meaty projects, rather than on easy window-dressing like minor
line extensions.'
A drawback is that the new system is relatively slow to respond to demands
from KGF's US headquarters and Philip Morris, its ultimate parent. 'If
Michael Miles (chairman of Philip Morris) asks if we can do something in a
month, I have to say it will take six months,' says Martin.
However, KGFE is also better equipped to formulate its strategies and
initiate ideas without transatlantic prompting. Piero Capizzi, director of
refrigerated products, says he spends only 30 per cent of his time liaising
with the US, compared with 70 per cent for his predecessor.
Martin thinks there are two main reasons for the smooth working of the core
teams system, which Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss coffee and confectionery
company owned by Philip Morris, is also thinking of adopting.
One is that many traditional cross-border management links were severed by
the reorganisation which followed Philip Morris's acquisitions of General
Foods in 1985 and Kraft in 1988. That made it easier to introduce a new
approach from scratch.
The other is that KGFE has solidly established core businesses with broadly
similar strengths in different markets. That means subsidiaries from smaller
countries do not worry about being pushed around by those from bigger ones.
'Getting the balance right requires democracy,' says Martin.
He is open-minded about how the system will develop, saying national
subsidiaries may sometimes find it makes more sense to act separately than
jointly. But at least they will have considered the possibility of
cross-border co-operation first. 'If there are synergies to be had at a
European level, we'll capture them,' says Martin. 'If we can't, they don't
exist.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Disturbing conspiracy to gild the lily -
Stratagems used by accountancy firms to inflate fee income when reporting
their results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New draft reporting guidelines from a little-known sub-committee of the
Accounting Standards Board have fallen into the hands of the Financial
Times. They make disturbing reading.
The document is called Hype 1, How You Present Earnings, a recommended
statement of financial reporting practice for British accountancy firms. It
should be read in conjunction with the latest fee income figures produced by
the firms last week.
It contains a series of basic rules to be followed by firms in preparing
their results. The first chapter is a framework 'statement of principles' on
which all the detailed rules are based. Its principal recommendation is:
Decide the figures you want and aim for them. Firms should be publicly
required to deride the importance and reliability of the figures. Privately
many readers - most importantly existing and potential clients - take the
results seriously. They are important for marketing and morale. As a result,
the full force of creative accountancy should be used to help in their
compilation.
The most important detailed proposals are as follows:
Alter the year-end yearly. Using significantly different year-ends from
other firms makes comparisons between firms more difficult and ensures that
income-generating or -depressing events can be excluded or included as
necessary. This also makes easier explanations of discrepancies from the
general trend - which may or may not correspond with the actual treatment of
the figures.
Change the comparatives. Less assiduous readers may not bother to check last
year's published figures and simply look at the re-stated version of the
previous year in the new set of results. For the more assiduous, the
explanations for the variations can include the suggestion that the old
version was produced with too tight a timetable to permit proper assessment,
or that important new accounting systems have been introduced which now
permit a more reliable estimate of last year's results.
Create dissonance around de-consolidation. If total fee income must be
broken down between different categories - audit, tax, consulting,
insolvency, and so on - there is no reason why these headings need
correspond too strictly to the billed time of the respective departments.
Gild by association. Include in the figures as much income as possible from
autonomous regional partnerships, associate and affiliate firms or other
arm's-length entities. The guiding rule is that they should be included if
there is a marketing advantage in doing so; linkage in any formal, legal
sense such as profit-sharing is irrelevant.
Juggle off-shore subsidiaries. Play around with operations or affiliates in
regions such as the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Northern Island.
Ideally throw in additional income from international networks of firms too.
Swell with secondments. Any contributions made by affiliates overseas to
staff on secondment can be added in; but it may be useful to exclude these
staff from the totals of professional staff to reduce the apparent cost base
of the firm.
Subsidise with non-subsidiary subsidiaries. Consulting operations, financial
service advice and other areas well beyond the traditional remit of
accounting firms are all welcome inclusions to increase total reported fee
income.
Confuse income and costs. Include items such as goods like software packages
and computer equipment which have been bought on behalf of and then sold on
to clients.
Add the effects of acquisitions. Consider the scope for taking a substantial
amount of the year's income from any mergers with other accountancy firms.
A final section of Hype 1 deals with implementation, which stresses that
early adoption of the guidelines is encouraged. The most significant
recommendations are:
Agree the ground rules in advance. Most of the larger firms meet to discuss
the format of the figures long before publication. The biggest eight firms
have separate gatherings for senior partners and public relations officers
on the subject, and Group A - the tier below - also hold such meetings.
Do not trust the competitors. Ideally co-ordinate a simultaneous release of
the firm's figures to the press and to competitors. Then break that schedule
to allow time to inspect everyone else's results and tweak the results to
provide the desired position in the rankings.
Though Hype 1 has not yet been released for discussion and comment, many of
its recommended practices seem to have been implemented by the UK's
accountancy firms, as the presentation of the figures last week clearly
shows.
Commentators should perhaps not complain. The firms - as they constantly
stress - are private partnerships which are under no obligation to produce
any results at all. And some are making improvements to disclosure: KPMG
produced separate figures for corporate finance forthe first time this year,
for instance.
Equally, even the more creative approaches to reporting listed have been
unable to completely conceal the impact of the recession. The top 30 firms
reported near static income in the last year, below inflation although
totalling about Pounds 3.4bn. The number of partners and professional staff
dropped by 4 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.
Stripping out the effects of the few firms defying the general trend, the
pattern looks far more gloomy. Only 7 of the top 20 firms reported any rises
in income - generally at very modest rates. Of these, two had large
contributions from unusual activities - consulting and financial services -
two had mergers, and one added a substantial number of new offices.
Growth in insolvency income - in as far as the category can be trusted  - at
10.8 per cent was clearly insufficient to compensate for the decline in
other forms of income, notably audit, which provides 41 per cent of all fee
income and was down by 2.4 per cent.
But there is almost certainly worse to come. The 'leverage' or ratio of
professional staff to partners has fallen across the larger firms. In other
words, there is a shrinking number of salaried staff supporting each
partner. It is highest - at 15 - for Andersen, down to as low as 9 at Price
Waterhouse.
Leverage by the 'Big 6' firms remains above those of their smaller rivals -
if they can be considered competition - but the decline almost certainly
suggests that more partners will need to be shed in the future if incomes of
the remainder are to be sustained.
There is one important final section circulated as an appendix to Hype 1:
'All accountancy firms should publish their true profit figures,' it
recommends. 'This will disprove the rumours of financial instability
affecting them and demonstrates the underlying strength of the business.
With the firms as large and powerful as they are, there is also a strong and
legitimate public interest in producing these details.'
Just kidding.

FT  17 JUN 93 / 'You suddenly think: that bloody Lloyd's': Richard Lapper
and Gillian Tett talk to stricken Names who have given up hope of being able
to repay their debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S an-nouncement that Names on the Gooda Walker syndicates face
fresh calls for cash will make little difference to a particularly hard-hit
group of more than 250 Gooda Names who have long since given up hope of
meeting the bill.
Mr Norbert Mallet, 61, says: 'The numbers now are just academic really. We
can't pay. The thing is that if you're drowning, it doesn't matter if you're
drowning in the Atlantic or a pond - you're still drowning.'
Mr Mallet's Lloyd's affairs were handled by the Gooda &amp; Partners members'
agency, which gave its Names - the individuals whose assets support the
market - shares on the loss-making catastrophe reinsurance syndicates
managed by its sister agency, Gooda Walker.
He and his wife are both Names, and their combined losses for 1988 from the
Gooda Walker syndicates came to Pounds 270,000. They were able to meet those
by selling possessions, but additional losses in 1989 and 1990 left them
facing a total bill for Pounds 250,000. They are effectively ruined.
The Mallets are among more than 2,000 Names who have applied to the Lloyd's
hardship committee for help to avert bankruptcy.
Under 'hardship', Names reschedule their debts to Lloyd's and are allowed to
retain a 'modest' income - of Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 - and a home of
up to the value of perhaps Pounds 150,000 if in the London area.
Lloyd's suspends action to recover debts while hardship applications are
being considered. Only about 150 hardship offers have been accepted and many
applications have been pending for months. As a result most damaged Names
are living in a curious limbo world, and many say they simply file or throw
away demands for cash.
'The day of reckoning is coming closer. We are all living on borrowed time,'
says one woman who has a hardship application pending. She joined Lloyd's in
1980, shortly after being divorced, and faces losses of more than Pounds
800,000.
Few Names have declared bankruptcy, or sold their houses. More than 70
hard-hit Gooda Names are based in Surrey and West Sussex, yet Hampton's
estate agency in Horsham, Surrey, which specialises in up-market properties,
reports that it has done limited business for Names in the past year. For
the moment, for example, Mr Mallet is still living in his elegant farm house
in Copsale, near Horsham.
What has gone is most of the artworks, family jewellery and furniture, sold
to the local office of Sotheby's, the auctioneers.
Some Names are refusing to apply for hardship because they do not want to
acknowledge that the losses are justified, or because they are unhappy about
providing the detailed breakdown of their finances that Lloyd's requires.
But many are critical of the hardship committee.
'We went to Lloyd's last year and said 'why don't you let us live on a bit
of our land and keep chickens - we're not proud, we can live in a caravan','
explains one 50-year-old ruined Name as he stands in the kitchen of his
house that will shortly be repossessed. 'But then Lloyd's said no, we
couldn't even keep that bit of land. So now we've lost everything, all our
houses, everything,' he adds with a desperate laugh.
Under pressure from the banks over his property business, he sold his houses
and applied to the Lloyd's hardship committee. After extensive wrangling
with the banks, they offered to let him live in 'what's just about the
cheap-est property' in the area.
To add to the uncertainty, many of the Names are party to legal actions
alleging negligence by Lloyd's agencies and believe they have some chance of
recovering a sizeable chunk of their losses through the courts. Some Names
harbour hopes that Lloyd's may move to settle the actions outside the
courts.
Mr Richard Godden, a retired businessman and former Conservative councillor
and magistrate, expects to have to apply for bankruptcy eventually. He is
living on a pension and savings and says that the stress is wearing him
down. 'You wake up at five in the morning and think it can't work out like
that. You've got this ghastly despair. It takes over sometimes when you're
out gardening or when you go to dinner. You suddenly think: 'that bloody
Lloyd's'.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Man crosses street to avoid Gooda: Richard Lapper and Norma
Cohen find a usually restrained community in southern England convulsed by
hatred. The former chairman of a Lloyd's agency insists he has done nothing
wrong. Many of the neighbours disagree vehemently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR TONY GOODA'S easy charm and social prowess may have been the key to his
success as a Lloyd's agent, but they cannot shield him from the bitterness
and venom his Names now feel towards him.
Around Coneyhurst in West Sussex, where Mr Gooda lives in a restored
17th-century farmhouse, the former chairman of the Gooda &amp; Partners members'
agency is reviled by neighbours and former golfing partners alike.
'My wife saw Tony Gooda in Budgens supermarket. She said 'You dirty sod, why
don't you commit suicide?'', says one Name, who used to socialise with Mr
Gooda.
One neighbour crosses the road when he sees the former Lloyd's agent. 'He
never said 'bad luck' or 'How are you surviving?' There was not a single
word of regret. It had been a 30-year friendship,' says the man who used to
play golf with Mr Gooda.
But Mr Gooda defends his record as an agent. 'I've done nothing wrong,' he
says. 'I am not going to run away and hide. I never asked Names to join
Lloyd's ever.'
He adds that most of the more than 250 Names who joined Gooda &amp; Partners
approached him through friends or other contacts. 'I know you find it hard
to believe that I never knocked on people's doors,' he says. Mr Gooda says
he is also ruined because he invested his own fortune and that of his wife,
who is seriously ill with multiple sclerosis, in the same syndicates as his
Names. He is so financially ruined that he has had to apply for help from
Lloyd's hardship committee to stave off personal bankruptcy.
Tanned, fit and looking younger than his 55 years, Mr Gooda is far from
relaxed. 'For the last 2 1/2 years I have been bombarded by letters and
phone calls,' he says. 'All of them aggressive, all highly critical. There
aren't words to describe the way I feel. Is there a word that is worse than
'very upset'?'
His fall from grace has been spectacular. At the West Sussex Golf Club where
Mr Gooda held lavish 'golf days' in the heyday of the Lloyd's market in the
mid 1980s, he says his attendance has been reduced to a game a year.
To comprehend the sense of outrage and betrayal of Mr Gooda's Names, you
have to understand the manner in which they came to stake fortunes on a
business which many did not understand.
Underlying the recruitment process was the sense that Mr Gooda embodied the
middle-class respectability and easy wealth of the home counties. Mr Hugh
Taylor, who joined Lloyd's in 1985 and now faces ruin, says: 'I knew where
Tony Gooda lived and where he drinks on a Sunday morning in Coneyhurst. He
used to leave his Porsche outside.'
He adds: 'We'd been on a skiing party together. His sister married my wife's
brother. I was at the wedding at his father's house in Coolham.'
Names say that Mr Gooda underplayed the risks of Lloyd's membership and
concentrated them on high-risk catastrophe syndicates. Mr Richard Godden, a
retired businessman who joined Lloyd's in 1985 and now faces losses of more
than Pounds 600,000, says: 'I emphasised I didn't want to be greedy. He said
it was a good spread.'
Mr Gooda says: 'My job as a members' agent was to point out the risks.' In
particular, in short meetings in his London offices with Names, Mr Gooda
says he explained the concept of 'unlimited liability', by which Names could
be liable for all their assets to meet claims on policies underwritten by
their syndicates.
He said the agency's policy was to place its Names, at least initially, on
the seven syndicates managed by its sister agency, Gooda Walker Ltd. Three
of these syndicates specialised in the growing catastrophe reinsurance
market.
Mr Gooda concedes that he never explained in detail the potential risks of
this kind of business. 'Nobody would have joined Lloyd's if they had been
fed the information you are implying we should give. It would take six
months to do it.
'I certainly pointed out the risks. Whether they took it on board I doubt. I
explained it all in very simple terms. No promises were made for the
future.'
Other Names allege that Mr Gooda did not advise them to buy stop-loss
insurance - a kind of personal reinsurance - which would have limited their
losses. Mr Gooda says he told Names that stop-loss was expensive, and that
he never bought a policy for himself, but he insists: 'I never said 'Don't
take one out'.'
Names also complain that they were not informed about the way their
syndicates' losses worsened in 1989 and 1990. 'We had no indication of the
results for 1989 when they were aware there would be substantial losses,'
says Mr Taylor. Ms Gill Cotterell, who joined Lloyd's through Gooda in 1987,
complains that Mr Gooda persuaded her to increase her commitment to the
market at a time when many of the syndicates to which she belonged faced
heavy losses.
Mr Gooda cannot remember how many letters his agency wrote but insists that
the objective was to keep Names 'fully informed at all times'. He adds: 'I
think it was October 1989 that the figures started coming through. Then we
just started fire fighting.'
Mr Gooda's former friends and neighbours are unconvinced. 'He doesn't seem
to have any conscience,' complains Mr Godden. 'His name is mud around here.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Customs' move angers brewers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Customs and Excise officials and the Brewers' Society
erupted again yesterday over Customs' statements that the new system of beer
duty introduced earlier this month would not penalise brewers but bring them
'a bonus of millions'.
Brewers protested two weeks ago that the system - under which duty is
charged on the alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase
the industry's tax burden by Pounds 64m a year.
Bass, Courage, and Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK's three leading brewers,
announced reductions in the strength of a number of beer brands to ease the
impact.
However, in a statement yesterday, Customs and Excise said switching the
duty charge from an earlier production stage would produce a one-off
cashflow benefit to the industry of Pounds 200m.

THE government's decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the Thorp
nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield could be complicated by a new
international agreement reached last night.
The Paris Commission Convention on sea pollution, whose 13 signatories
border the north-east Atlantic, voted last night in Berlin to tighten the
rules on discharges of radioactivity to the sea. The UK was the only member
to vote against the proposal.

FT  17 JUN 93 / MoD is criticised over ship refits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence's handling of naval vessel refitting was criticised
by MPs yesterday as the service's privately managed dockyards awaited a
crucial government decision on their future, David White writes.
The Commons public accounts committee complained of slow progress in
changing procedures at the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards since management
was transferred to private consortia in 1987.
The cabinet will decide shortly which yard should service the new Trident
submarines. The decision - not expected until next week at the earliest -
will mean concentrating all work on refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered
submarines on one site.
The committee's report coincided with intensive last-minute lobbying by the
dockyard managers and local politicians in the bitter battle over which yard
should service the UK's new Trident submarines.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Family silver and jewellery piles up in salerooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS at the Sotheby's salerooms in Billingshurst, West Sussex has been
brisk in recent weeks, Richard Lapper writes.
The losses faced by the area's badly hit Lloyd's Names are one of the main
reasons, according to Mr Leslie Weller, managing director of the auction
house's Sussex division. 'The latest calls have started to affect people.
We've been handling quite a lot of property.'
Names had been selling everything across the board from garden statues to
pictures, he added. 'The market has been going well.'
Nationally, Sotheby's said it had received 'thousands' of inquiries in
recent months from Names, with most of them seeking to raise between Pounds
50,000 and Pounds 100,000.
In response the auction house is offering a tailor-made service to Names who
want to sell the family silver or other heirlooms. Details of the package
were presented to Lloyd's members' agents this week. Sotheby's is offering
Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans of up to 35 per cent on
the value of objects sent for sale, and free surveys. It also promises
'total anonymity'.
Mr Norbert Mallet, a Sussex-based Name who faces losses of Pounds 750,000,
says that he has had to sell most of his family jewellery in the past two
years, at prices he believes are 'some 30 per cent lower' than 1980s prices.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Sotheby's offer discreet service to Lloyd's Names
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S, the London auction house, is offering a discreet tailor-made
service to Lloyd's Names who want to sell the family silver or other
heirlooms, following the spate of recent demands for cash.
Mr Lesley Weller, managing director of the auctioneers' salesroom in
Billingshurst, West Sussex, said business had been going well in recent
weeks. 'The latest calls have started to affect people. We've been handling
quite a lot of property.'
Names had been selling everything from garden statues to pictures, he added.
Nationally, Sotheby's said it had received 'thousands' of inquiries in
recent months from Names, with most seeking to raise between Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 100,000.
The flood of new pieces had not, as yet, triggered a significant fall in
prices for silver and jewellery, the auction house said, although prices in
the furniture market have dipped in the past year.
The auction house offers Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans
of up to 35 per cent on the value of objects sent for sale, and free
surveys. It also promises 'total anonymity'.
Mr Norbet Mallet, a Sussex-based Name who faces losses of Pounds 1m, said
ruefully that that it is a 'buyer's market'.
He has had to sell most of his family jewellery in the past two years, at
prices he believes are 'some 30 per cent lower' than 1980s' prices.

FT  17 JUN 93 / MoD is criticised over ship refits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence's handling of naval vessel refitting was criticised
by MPs yesterday as the service's privately managed dockyards awaited a
crucial government decision on their future.
The Commons public accounts committee complained of slow progress in
changing procedures at the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards since management
was transferred to private consortia in 1987.
The cabinet will decide shortly which yard should service the new Trident
submarines. The decision - not expected until next week at the earliest -
will mean concentrating all work on refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered
submarines on one site. Thousands of jobs are at stake in Devon, Cornwall,
and Fife.
The cross-party committee, chaired by Labour MP Mr Robert Sheldon, said
reductions in the Navy's refitting programme and short-notice changes had
made it difficult for the new managers to operate on a commercial basis.
Faster progress should have been made in tightening specifications for work
at the yards, the committee said.
'Poor specification of the work to be undertaken in refits has contributed
to difficult contract negotiations, excessive extra work, delays and cost
increases,' the committee's report found. It criticised 'deficiencies' in
the system for procuring materials, most of which were still supplied to the
yards by the Navy.
'This is a legacy of history, but it is not appropriate for a commercial
regime,' the report said.
The report also attacked Pounds 137m worth of 'abortive expenditure' on two
submarines, which the ministry decided to decommission in 1990 while the
submarines were both in refit. The cross-party campaign among MPs trying to
ensure that Rosyth dockyard wins the Trident contract stepped up its efforts
yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, is to meet Mr John Major today and
will give the prime minister a copy of the report setting out Rosyth's case.
His Dunfermline East constituency includes Rosyth.
Devonport is widely regarded at Westminster as the front-runner but several
Scottish Conservatives have indicated that they would be prepared to vote
against the government if Devonport wins.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Political Notebook: On the European sideline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE have been two unaccustomed reminders this week that Mr John Major's
government can now lay claim to the occasional political strength among its
all-too-manifest weaknesses. They came from Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Douglas
Hurd.
On Tuesday Mr Clarke offered few insights into how the substance - as
distinct from the rhetoric - of his chancellorship will differ from that of
his predecessor.
Even for a government so familiar with policy U-turns, the constraints
imposed by Britain's budget and trade deficits and by the gloomy world
outlook do not allow for radical policy shifts. Over time, Mr Clarke's
priorities may well turn out to be distinctly different from those of Mr
Norman Lamont. But in the short term the policy changes will be at the
margin.
His typically unconventional performance was important nonetheless. In
casting himself as a character in a DH Lawrence novel, Mr Clarke sent an
important message to the government's disgruntled supporters. After a long
excursion into theoretical debates about the relative worth of monetary or
exchange rate targets, economic policymaking is to re-enter the real world
of jobs and living standards.
Reassurance of a different kind came from Mr Hurd. The easy elegance of the
foreign secretary stands in stark contrast to the rough-edged populism of
the chancellor. But there is a common denominator - instinctive political
skill.
So, after the ravages of Maastricht, Mr Hurd yesterday had soothing words
for MPs on the European Community's agenda for next week's Copenhagen summit
and beyond.
His message was straightforward. Britain is not alone in suffering from
post-Maastricht depression. Anyone who has followed the pronouncements in
recent weeks of Chancellor Helmut Kohl or those of the new French
administration of Mr Edouard Balladur will understand that.
Belgium, which assumes the EC presidency next month, will continue to fight
the cause of federalism. It will do as much as it can to hold up the
enlargement of the Community to include Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway.
So will some others. They might even manage the odd 'Britain isolated'
headline with a rhetorical ambush at the autumn summit planned to salute
Maastricht's ratification.
But the political realities in Germany - Chancellor Kohl has one or two
domestic problems on his mind - and the Gaullist instincts of the new French
government had undercut decisively the integrationist reflex of the 1980s.
The economic impact of recession meanwhile had reduced to wishful thinking
the timetable for monetary union.
Britain's agenda - enlargement, subsidiarity (now a respectable word in
continental Europe) and intergovernmental co-operation - was now making the
running.
It all sounded pretty convincing, even if Mr Hurd still shares the incurable
weakness of most at Westminster in underestimating the capacity of the
Franco-German axis to make trouble for Britain.
His skilful presentation to the foreign affairs committee also reinforced
the essential political point. For the last several years British domestic
politics has been dominated by two issues - the economy and Europe. They are
now being handled by the two most powerful members of the cabinet.
Mr Hurd and Mr Clarke also happen to share the same view of the world (the
latter ran the former's campaign for the party's leadership). Who better to
apply the patches necessary to hold together a bitterly divided party?
But like Mr Clarke, Mr Hurd is offering short-term respite rather than
medium-term strategies. By changing the rhetoric the chancellor has bought
himself time to consider options while economic recovery takes hold.
Similarly, the foreign secretary is cleverly exploiting post-Maastricht
exhaustion across Europe to sustain the impression that Britain can shape
its future.
For all the talk, though, of setting the agenda, there is a growing
realisation at Westminster that the government has opted for what used to be
called the European slow lane.
It has said the pound will stay outside the exchange rate mechanism at least
until 1996. In a few unscripted remarks in the Commons last week Mr Major
undercut the purpose of the Maastricht opt-out on EMU by indicating that,
whatever others decide, sterling will never be part of a single currency.
Britain is outside the Schengen group of France, Germany and the Benelux
countries. The government is defending stridently its social chapter
opt-out.
All this makes for relative tranquility on the Tory backbenches. But however
eloquent the exposition, Mr Hurd will find it hard to sell as a strategy
which keeps Britain at the 'heart' of Europe.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler tries to defuse funds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, IVOR OWEN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party has received no money from the governments or ruling
families of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Brunei, Sir Norman Fowler indicated
yesterday, as he tried to defuse the row over the party's funding.
The Tory chairman spelt out four categories of donations the party would not
accept.
He told the home affairs committee his party would refuse any donation to
which strings were attached; which the party had reason to believe contained
illegally obtained monies; which came from a foreign government; or which it
did not know the source of.
He sidestepped questions about alleged donations from other individuals
including Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping tycoon, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the
Hong Kong businessman. 'We don't reveal details of people . . who make
contributions,' he said.
As Labour stepped up its attacks over the Pounds 440,000 in contributions
the Tories have admitted receiving from companies controlled by Mr Asil
Nadir, the fugitive businessman, Sir Norman said the party accepted the
money 'in good faith.' 'Contributions made do not buy influence in the
affairs of the Conservative party,' he said.
Sir Norman's comments came as Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on
the Conservatives to repay Mr Nadir's donations, claiming the issue 'is now
a matter for serious public concern'.
Labour plans to pursue the subject further next Tuesday by arranging a
Commons debate on the 'secrecy' of Conservative party funding. The party
said it was 'not going to let this matter rest.'
Yesterday, a Labour backbencher's bill designed to shed more light on
Conservative party finance cleared its first parliamentary hurdle, although
it has virtually no chance of becoming law.
Meanwhile, the TUC added its voice to calls for tighter controls over
political donations by companies. Trade unions last year spent Pounds 8m
from 'political funds' on non-party political activities, in addition to the
Pounds 8m they gave Labour, it disclosed.
Questioned on whether his statement that the Conservative party had had no
donations from the governments of Saudi Arabia or Kuwait included
contributions from the respective royal families, Sir Norman said: 'Yes, I
think that would also apply.'
He said he was 'totally opposed' to the direct state funding of political
parties. In a written submission to the committee, the party argued state
funding would 'either unduly favour established parties or encourage the
formation and growth of extremist parties.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish water privatisation plan
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTRIGHT privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been rejected
by the government, at least until after the next general election.
But ministers remain keen for private capital to be injected into the sector
by franchising, competitive tendering for services and possibly allowing
management to buy a stake in the industry.
With a white paper on the future of Scottish water expected within a month,
ministers are grappling with how to ensure - in the absence of an outright
sale - that as little as possible of the extensive capital spending the
industry requires in the next decade will come from public funds and hence
count towards the public sector borrowing requirement.
An estimated Pounds 5bn in capital spending is needed in the next 15 years,
half to improve water quality and half for the maintenance and replacement
of infrastructure.
One favoured option is for a handful of publicly owned water authorities to
be set up under the administration of a soon-to-be-created network of 25 to
35 unitary authorities.
Under this model, private contractors could be encouraged to get involved in
financing large-scale capital projects through the offer of long-term
franchises to provide services such as sewage treatment and water
purification to the authorities.
With about Pounds 240m a year already earmarked by the Scottish Office for
capital spending over the next three years, ministers would have scope to
offer public money for such projects, possibly on a joint-venture basis.
The Treasury would be anxious for private investors in such cases to take
responsibility for commercial risks such as cost overruns, enabling public
liabilities to be fixed.
This blueprint would have the further advantage of restructuring the
industry in such a way that would allow it to build up a financial track
record, easing the path to a possible sale after the next general election.
Scottish water is currently owned and administered by regional councils,
with the result that 100 per cent of the industry's liabilities must come
out of the public purse.
A bill covering the reorganisation of both the local authorities and the
water industry is expected to be introduced in the next parliamentary
session beginning in November.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: National Insurance change to hit 2
1/2 m low-paid people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 2 1/2 m people whose earnings are so low that they do not pay
income tax will have to pay 'slightly more' in National Insurance
contributions next year because of the changes made in the Budget.
Mr William Hague, the junior social security minister, admitted yesterday
that an earlier statement to MPs, saying that only 500,000 people in this
category would be affected by the one per cent increase in contributions,
was incorrect.
The social security department said revision of the number of those affected
was because of a technical change. But the stark increase in the number of
low-paid worse off as a result of the changes may cause some unease among
Tories when the bill to implement them is introduced.
Legislation is now planned for the new session that will begin in November,
when the figures will give Labour more ammunition with which to oppose the
measure.
For many on lower earnings, the rise in contributions will more than offset
any benefit from the widening of the 20 per cent income tax band.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tough task for spending committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET will today launch this year's public spending round by setting
up a powerful cabinet committee that includes Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, to oversee negotiations between the Treasury and spending
departments.
The EDX committee is expected to be given a tough remit at today's meeting,
with ministers expected to agree public spending should not exceed the
Pounds 253.6bn ceiling set for 1994-95.
The inclusion of Mr Howard, regarded at Westminster as likely to back harsh
spending curbs rather than tax increases, will help appease rightwingers in
the Tory party.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to give a bleak outlook for
public finances in the year ahead, emphasising that he does not believe that
Britain's Pounds 50bn annual deficit can be reduced only by economic growth.
He will warn colleagues that extra spending in the next financial year by
one department will have to be offset by savings elsewhere.
Mr Clarke has emphasised that no Tory would want to raise taxes merely
because the government had failed to tackle properly the scale of public
spending. He has also made clear his view that there are areas of
expenditure where there is plenty of room for downward pressure.
With the debate within the Conservative party over tax and expenditure plans
likely to last throughout the summer, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, warned
yesterday that the government 'has declared war on the welfare state'.
He told the annual conference of the health service union Cohse: 'When faced
with the failure of their economic policies they don't consider closing tax
loopholes for the rich . . . they penalise people on Invalidity Benefit.'
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, responded that the public
spending review 'will produce a better system that protects the most
vulnerable whilst being affordable'.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR sought last night to persuade Unionists to rejoin talks on
Ulster's future, saying an 'early objective' would be 'to re-affirm in
Northern Ireland the sort of democratic structures most people would want to
enjoy'.
Speaking after talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, he
made clear that the two governments would not impose a solution on the
province. The search for a lasting agreement via talks 'is a matter for
persuasion and patience,' he said.
Although he played up the prospects of a political reform in the province -
the main ambition of unionists - the prime minister said the government
still wanted a 'three-stranded' approach, also covering institutions linking
north and south Ireland, and London with Dublin.
Mr Reynolds said the two governments did not expect a resumption of round
table talks until the autumn.

THE FIRST of the Tory class of '92 to have signed the Euro-sceptic Commons
motion last year calling for a 'fresh start' in European policy began their
government careers yesterday on the lowest rung of the ladder, as unpaid
ministerial aides, Alison Smith writes.
Dr Liam Fox, MP for Woodspring, becomes parliamentary private secretary to
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and Mr Nigel Evans, MP for Ribble Valley,
becomes PPS to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary.
Four others who became MPs in 1992 were among eight PPS appointments. Mrs
Angela Browning goes to the employment department; Mrs Angela Knight goes to
trade and industry; Mr Michael Trend joins the environment department; and
Mr Rod Richards joins the Foreign Office team.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard allows police to test
truncheon alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD yes-terday used his first speech as home secretary to
accept a police request that new batons should be tested as a replacement
for truncheons. But he also signalled a fresh approach for the Tories on
crime prevention.
In a speech to senior police officers, Mr Howard adopted language previously
more familiar to the Labour party, saying he felt 'passionately that we must
do everything we can to build a strong and effective partnership between the
police and the public'.
Mr Howard also indicated that he was keen to steer away from the
confrontational style of his predecessor Mr Kenneth Clarke, and that he
wanted to co-operate with police forces in enhancing the role of local
police authorities.
Trips to police stations have been a high priority for Mr Howard. He spent
Tuesday night on patrol with the Metropolitan Police in Brixton.
Local police authorities are to be given responsibility for setting their
own budgets and will draw up with the chief constable local policing plans
setting out priorities and how they will be met, Mr Howard said.
He said responsibility should be devolved as far as possible so that police
officers closest to the problems can do their job with the minimum of
interference. A white paper on the organisation, structure and management of
the police service will be published soon by the Home Office.
Mr Howard said that an effective partnership between the police and the
public would give the 'best possible' chance of fighting crime
successful-ly.
He announced that an new side-handled baton was to be tested in an effort to
give more protection to the police, particularly to women officers. The
baton is collapsible, meaning it is less conspicuous to carry than rigid
versions.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the move was, 'sensible,
particularly because of the problems policewomen are facing - with
increasing numbers of attacks on them'.

the government's review of public spending 'will produce a better system

encourage Mr Smith in his efforts to win enough support to avoid a
confrontation with union leaders in the autumn.

MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday condemned unrealistic
demands for action by the European Community and its allies to ensure
compliance with UN security council decisions by the warring factions in
Bosnia, Ivor Owen writes.
In question-time exchanges in the Commons, he also warned that if British
and other troops had to be withdrawn because of unacceptable risks to their
safety a 'massacre' would probably follow.
Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, described the recent
Washington agreement as 'deeply flawed' because it gave clear signals to
Serbia that its aggression would be rewarded by extra territory. Mr Hurd
accused Mr Cunningham of resorting to a 'something must be done' approach,
and said it was the least useful advice that could be given in present
circumstances.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scots water privatisation plan
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTRIGHT privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been rejected
by the government, at least until after the next general election.
But ministers remain keen for private capital to be injected into the sector
by franchising, competitive tendering for services and possibly allowing
management to buy a stake in the industry.
With a white paper on the future of Scottish water expected within a month,
ministers are grappling with how to ensure - in the absence of an outright
sale - that as little as possible of the extensive capital spending the
industry requires in the next decade will come from public funds and hence
count towards the public sector borrowing requirement.
An estimated Pounds 5bn in capital spending is needed in the next 15 years,
half to improve water quality and half for the maintenance and replacement
of infrastructure.
One favoured option is for a handful of publicly owned water authorities to
be set up under the administration of a soon-to-be-created network of 25 to
35 unitary authorities.
Under this model, private contractors could be encouraged to get involved in
financing big capital projects through the offer of long-term franchises to
provide services such as sewage treatment and water purification to the
authorities.
With about Pounds 240m a year already earmarked by the Scottish Office for
capital spending over the next three years, ministers would have scope to
offer public money for such projects, possibly on a joint-venture basis.
The Treasury would be anxious for private investors in such cases to take
responsibility for commercial risks such as cost overruns, enabling public
liabilities to be fixed.
This blueprint would have the further advantage of restructuring the
industry in such a way that would allow it to build up a financial track
record, easing the path to a possible sale after the next general election.
Scottish water is currently owned and administered by regional councils,
with the result that 100 per cent of the industry's liabilities must come
out of the public purse. A bill covering the reorganisation of both the
local authorities and the water industry is expected to be introduced in the
next parliamentary session beginning in November.
Ministers are also keen to drum up private-sector interest in proposals to
build a Pounds 1.5bn pipeline to enable Scottish water to be exported to
England.
While they believe there is a widespread acceptance among consumers that
water prices in Scotland will have to rise, ministers see the opportunity of
selling water profitably to English water companies as a way of containing
these increases.
Two months ago it emerged that Scottish Enterprise, the development body in
Scotland, is considering studying the feasibility of building a pipeline to
carry water from southern Scotland and northern England to the south of
England.
The government's original decision to consider outright privatisation among
a range of options for Scottish water has ignited a political storm in
Scotland. Opinion polls have indicated that a large majority of Scots are
against it.
In April, the government angered Scottish MPs by shelving the privatisation
of Northern Ireland water until after the election for 'technical reasons'.
Labour and the Scottish National party seized on that decision to demand
that the possible privatisation of Scottish water should also be postponed.

FT  17 JUN 93 / EC subsidy urged for Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community officials in Brussels were urged yesterdayto make Swan
Hunter eligible for Shipbuilding Intervention Fund subsidy.
The Tyneside shipbuilder, which is in receivership, does not qualify for the
9 per cent subsidy for merchant shipbuilding orders because it has been
classified since its 1986 privatisation as a warship yard. Despite this it
has since built two non-naval vessels.
Mr John Foster, North Tyneside council's executive director, yesterday
presented EC competition directorate officials with a report by his council.
This argues that Swan Hunter could be redesignated a 'mixed' yard,
qualifying for the subsidy, without establishing any precedent.
Swan Hunter, the report says, is the only EC shipyard building both naval
and merchant ships without access to state aid. 'As such, it is operating in
exceptional circumstances,' it says. The subsidy alone would not save the
company, but could assist its recovery.
The council hopes its report will strengthen the government's request to the
EC to reconsider UK warship yards' exemption from the subsidy.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Vodafone steps up price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVELOPING mobile phone price war was further fuelled yesterday when
Vodafone, the largest mobile operator, published tariffs for new and
existing services.
Vodafone's new local digital service, to be launched in October, will
feature a 20p a minute peak-rate tariff for calls in local call zones that
offer the service, including the '071' London zone.
A London tariff of 33p a minute applies under its existing 'analogue'
network, which will operate in parallel with the new digital networks. That
tariff, in turn, is to be cut to 25p - in line with the present provincial
tariff.
The tariffs are partly a response to the imminent launch of a PCN service by
Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and US West.
One-2-One is testing its service, which will be launched within the M25 area
later this summer at a peak-rate tariff of less than 20p a minute.
Vodafone is launching two advanced digital networks this autumn. The local
network, called MetroDigital and to be launched on October 1, will cover the
zone within the M25 and other parts of the south-east.
By the end of 1994, MetroDigital will cover all British centres with
populations of more than 4,000.
In September a pan-European digital network, called EuroDigital, will come
into service. Built to the pan-European digital standard - known as GSM - it
will allow subscribers to make or receive calls on the same digital handset
in all the main European Community and Scandinavian countries.
Considered alongside moves made or expected by other operators, yesterday's
announcement marks the biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market since the
start of cellular services in 1985.
Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director, described the new tariffs as
'appropriately competitive'.
However, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 322.5m last year, representing a
remarkable 46 per cent of sales income, analysts believe Vodafone could be
forced to reduce prices further if the competitive pressure intensifies.
Handsets for the new digital networks will retail for about Pounds 400,
double the cost of those for the existing analogue network.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Sixth-forms at record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of those aged 16 and 17 staying on at school has reached a
record this year, according to Department for Education figures.
For the first time, more than half (53 per cent) of all 16-year-olds to
18-year-olds are in full-time education in the present academic year, while
the number of full-time pupils in the age-group has also reached a record
high at 920,000. However, the high proportion was helped by a drop in the
total of 16-year-olds, and the recession has encouraged more pupils to stay
at school.
Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, was delighted by the
figures. He said: 'The expanding opportunities and choice in education are
being widely recognised by the young people for whom they are intended.'
The trends over a longer period are even more marked. The proportion of
16-year-olds in full-time education has increased from 48 per cent to 71 per
cent over the last five years, an increase 2.5 times greater than over any
previous five-year period.
The proportion of 17-year-olds staying in full-time education rose from 33
per cent to 55 per cent over the same period, while the figure for
18-year-olds rose from 18 per cent to 34 per cent.

FT  17 JUN 93 / School finance practices are questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'GREEN shoots' of impropriety have appeared in locally managed schools
in England and Wales, says a report published today by the Audit Commission.
The report includes examples of questionable financial practice.
Most schools have taken well to managing their own finances, it says, but
problems were found with both grant-maintained schools and those still under
local education authority control. Locally managed schools are those with
budgets devolved from local education authorities and grant-maintained
schools that have opted-out.
All the schools surveyed had increased their levels of administrative staff.
However, there were wide variations in the amount of time and money spent on
administration. For example, one primary school with 183 pupils paid for 646
administrator's hours in one year, while another with 198 pupils paid for
2,886 hours.
Examples of questionable practice included the husband of a member of a
school's staff who was given repair work even though his quote was Pounds
2,500 above the lowest, and a head teacher who employed her daughter on
'much higher' than normal wages without telling the governors.
In one case, a contract for repair work was given to a company owned by a
friend of a governor even though there was a lower bid.
Mr Bob Chilton, a director of the Audit Commission, pointed out that
grant-maintained schools were 'almost unique' among public-sector bodies in
being allowed to appoint their own external auditors. He said: 'There's a
danger of fear and favour becoming involved.'
The report also revealed a trend for pupil-teacher ratios to rise after
schools took control of their own management. It attributed this to rising
salary demands from staff, and added: 'In order to keep expenditure within
means, schools have not increased teacher numbers commensurately with an
increase in pupil numbers.'
The commission visited 100 schools which had had devolved budgets for at
least two years.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Phone numbers may be for life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of 9bn new telephone numbers in 1995 will open a variety of
intriguing possibilities for phone users, it was announced yesterday.
The new numbers will become available when the digit '1' is inserted after
the initial zero for all UK area codes.
One possibility arising from this is that it may soon be possible to buy a
'phone number for life', according to draft plans unveiled by Oftel, the
telecommunications industry regulator.
With advanced network technology, such personal numbering could enable
telephone calls and faxes to be routed to wherever the user happens to be.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said personal numbering was 'a
very exciting development' for which the 'intelligent networks' technology
exists.
It could also be used for purposes such as giving members of families a
personal ringing tone on household telephones. 'You could even have singing
and shouting phones', said Oftel's technical director.
'Personal numbering services are developing quickly in the United States,'
says Oftel's consultation paper. 'They are likely to commence shortly in the
UK and become an area of rapid growth.'
British Telecommunications played down the idea, saying the investment
required on its 6,000 exchanges would be 'enormous'. 'It's like saying we
can build Concorde - but how many people can actually fly in it?' the
company said.
Oftel's consultation paper covers the 9bn telephone numbers that will be
available for allocation after the national code change in April 1995. Oftel
is proposing to open only 3bn numbers for immediate allocation. Unallocated
numbers will be kept in reserve.
Only 26m numbers are currently in operation, but restrictions imposed by
codes mean the network is close to saturation in parts of the country.

Monthly charges for access to the Vodafone network are unchanged at Pounds
25 for standard-rate customers, and Pounds 15 for low-user customers who pay
higher call charges. MetroDigital will charge a Pounds 20-a-month access
fee, EuroDigital Pounds 27.50.
The new digital network will have capacity for 175,000 subscribers at its
launch, rising to 2m by 2000. The existing network has 838,000 subscribers,
which Vodafone expects to rise to over 1m later this year.

IT MAY soon be possible to buy a 'phone number for life' under draft plans
unveiled yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulator.
There may also be a service programmed to send telephone calls and faxes to
wherever the user happens to be during the day. Personal numbering is one of
the opportunities opened by the 9m new telephone numbers due to become
available in 1995, when the digit '1' will be inserted after the initial
zero for all UK area codes.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said personal numbering was 'a

It could also be used for purposes such as giving members of families a
personal ringing tone on household telephones. 'You could even have singing

'Personal numbering services are developing quickly in the United States,'
says Oftel's consultation paper. 'They are likely to commence shortly in the
UK and become an area of rapid growth.'
British Telecommunications played down the idea, however, saying the
investment required on its 6,000 exchanges would be 'enormous'. 'It's like
saying we can build Concorde - but how many people can actually fly in it?'
said BT.
One operator has been licensed to provide portable numbering, but attempts
to contact it yesterday led to an unresponsive answering phone.
Oftel's consultation paper covers the 9bn telephone numbers that will be
available for allocation after the national code change in April 1995.
Oftel is proposing to open only 3bn numbers for immediate allocation.
Unallocated numbers will be kept in reserve for future use.
Only 26m numbers are currently in operation, but restrictions imposed by
codes mean that the network is close to saturation in parts of the country.
Apart from the new digit, existing numbers will be unaffected, and Oftel
said it would not be necessary to impose any national code changes 'in the
foreseeable future'. Existing codes for cellular mobile services will also
remain unchanged. Oftel is also proposing to take responsibility for
allocating numbers away from BT, in the name of fair access to all
operators.
The issue of whether users should be able to take their phone number with
them when transfering between operators is not addressed directly by the
paper. Oftel will publish a cost benefit study on the issue shortly.
Mr Cruickshank gave the strong impression that he would enforce number
portability in the near future. 'Numbers are for users, not for operators to
grab as their product,' he said.
Mr Cruickshank emphasised that the numbering changes were in line with
practice in the US, Japan and Australia, leaders with the UK in the
development of liberal telecommunications regimes.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Goldman broke rules over Maxwell 'loans'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Goldman Sachs, one of the most famous names in inter-ational merchant
banking circles, was fined Pounds 160,000 by the UK Securities and Futures
Authority, the self-regulatory body, it was the first formal censure of its
activities in relation to the late Robert Maxwell.
The fine was for violations of securities rules in transactions with Maxwell
companies. Goldman Sachs was also ordered to pay costs estimated at around
Pounds 125,000. The SFA did not conclude that Goldman or its personnel
participated in or were aware of illicit conduct.
The bank was a party in transactions which have been the subject of
inquiries by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and
the Serious Fraud Office. Goldman Sachs officials have said that the bank
acted at all times in good faith and was unaware of possible irregularities.
Yesterday's fine does not rule out further actions against the investment
bank by the SFA or any other bodies.
The SFA charges relate to three separate purchases of portfolios of
securities, two of them from Maxwell-controlled fund managers which invested
assets on behalf of pension scheme members. The third and most significant
charge relates to the purchase of a block of securities from a company at
the heart of Robert Maxwell's network of private companies.
In each case, Goldman Sachs paid for the portfolios immediately, but did not
receive all the securities until up to three months later, effectively
providing a loan to Robert Maxwell. Goldman Sachs failed to record this
practice properly, and to reflect it in its reports of its capital position
to the SFA.
In the third case, which occurred just months before Robert Maxwell's death,
Goldman officials did not seek internal credit approval for the 'free
payment'.
Also in that case, Goldman Sachs Equity Securities (UK) 'for seven business
days had a deficit in its regulatory capital ranging between Pounds 9m and
Pounds 20m and submitted materially inaccurate information in its July
(1991) monthly reporting statement,' to the SFA.
The significance of the charges is that 'loans' occurred during a time when
it is now known that Robert Maxwell's companies were becoming desperately
short of cash. One of the questions raised by investigators is whether any
of the banks which dealt with him in that period should have probed more
deeply into his financial condition.
For years before Robert Maxwell's death, Goldman Sachs was one of the main
banks used by the 800-odd companies under his control. The bank was never
formally appointed as an adviser but was extensively used by the Maxwell
empire for trading currencies and shares.
It was also one of the stock market's most prominent buyers of shares in
Maxwell's two publicly quoted companies, Maxwell Communications Corporation
and Mirror Group Newspapers, in 1990 and early 1991.
In late 1990 the bank bought a 'put option' in MCC shares from Robert
Maxwell, giving it the right to sell a large block of shares to him later in
the year. The stock exchange has investigated the transaction following
complaints by investors that the deal was an attempt to support the share
price, but cleared Goldman Sachs of improper action.
In early 1991 the bank bought large stakes in overseas investments from
Maxwell companies as they tried to raise cash.
In the same period Goldman Sachs also bought MCC shares heavily in spite of
a profits warning from MCC. In some of these deals it was acting on behalf
of companies and trusts registered in Switzerland which were introduced to
it by Robert Maxwell and which are now believed to have been controlled by
him. These transactions are alleged to be part of a scheme to support MGN
and MCC shares which has been under investigation by the SFO.
In August 1991, Goldman Sachs revealed that it had failed to disclose stakes
worth a total of Pounds 143m in MCC and MGN within the time required by the
UK Companies Act. The bank has said that it regretted the omission.
In the weeks before Robert Maxwell's death and in the days immediately
afterwards, Goldman Sachs reduced its holding in MCC shares - it appears
because of his failure to repay loans. The share sales led to a cooling of
the relationship between Mr Maxwell and the bank.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Optimism over housing recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST house prices have stopped falling and some have started to rise as the
housing market recovery has taken root according to a survey last month by
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of more than 100 estate agents.
The survey said that 95 per cent of agents reported prices either stable or
rising. It warned that homeowners waiting for prices to rise before selling
were stifling prospects for a strong revival in sales.

THE RMT railworkers' union yesterday rejected a 1.5 per cent offer from
British Rail and said it would ballot its 65,000 members next month over
possible industrial action.
A strike looks unlikely following the members' rejection less than a month
ago of the leadership's advice to continue industrial action over job cuts
and the use of contract labour.

FT  17 JUN 93 / CBI finds London businesses optimistic
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in London are more optimistic about their prospects for the next
six months than their counterparts in eight other European capitals, a
survey has found, Andrew Taylor writes.
The Confederation of British Industry's London branch conducted the survey
with business organisations in Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, Madrid,
Paris, Rome and Valetta.
Companies in London were more optimistic about prospects in every sector
except construction. In banking and finance, London was the only capital
'reporting a more optimistic position compared with six months previously'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Rule changes for open-ended funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE LOBBYING by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has
been rewarded by three government concessions on the taxation and structure
of open-ended investment funds.
First, an anomaly introduced in the March Budget by the changes to advance
corporation tax (ACT) is to be removed by an amendment to the 1993 Finance
Bill now going through parliament.
The ACT changes in the Budget threatened to impose, in an unintended way,
extra taxation on life assurance companies and other corporate owners of
unit trusts. As life companies own unit trusts worth some Pounds 30bn, or 40
per cent of the total funds assets of the unit trust industry, they might
have been forced to liquidate their holdings.
Now, a 'streaming' arrangement will permit UK company dividends to be taxed
differently from other income, including interest on deposits or bonds. As a
result life companies will pay no extra tax.
The same streaming device is to be used to permit unit trusts to pay
interest and other non-UK dividend income to foreign investors without
deduction of tax. Legislation for this is promised by the Treasury for the
next Finance Bill, due towards the end of the year.
The move will enable UK unit trust companies to market bond funds and money
funds (but not equity funds) to non-UK residents on a more equal footing to
companies based in low-tax centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin.
The third concession is a commitment to issue a discussion document before
the end of the year on the introduction of open-ended investment companies.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Managers seen to be missing the IT message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH managers are drowning in paper and surrounded by fancy technology
they do not know how to use. They are spending ever more time in meetings
and sending each other increasing numbers of meaningless memos, a study has
found.
The Institute of Management and Aspen Business Communications investigated
the tangled lines of communication inside British companies and Mr Roger
Young, institute director-general, said the results were 'depressing'.
He added that managers were 'resorting to the tools of Dickens to
communicate with each other'.
The survey showed that less than 15 per cent of the 700 managers surveyed
understood the potential of their IT systems, and only half thought their
system was installed in a sensible fashion.
The survey questioned the conventional wisdom that communication had
improved as a result of the restructuring of British companies from
hierarchical to 'flatter' structures. The idea was that flatter companies
would mean easier and faster communications, with managers given more
authority to make decisions.
But more than 40 per cent of the managers said they were sending and
receiving more memos than before, while two thirds were spending more time
in meetings. Only four-in-10 said their company communications strategy was
clearer than before.
Respondents complained that the cutting out of the old layers of management
had made their organisations less caring. More than half said they had
become more accountable in their jobs, but had not been given the
corresponding authority to take decisions. However, most agreed that the
shift from paternalistic management had the positive effect of making their
companies more open, informal and progress-ive.
Most managers reported that the introduction of technology had speeded the
flow of information through the company, and had increased their access to
it. However, only four in 10 said it had improved its relevance. 'Much of
the information is poorly targeted and of little relevance to the
recipient,' said Mr Young.
In spite of the elevation in the role of the memo, less than half the
respondents thought it an effective way of communication. Over two thirds
said that to talk to someone face-to-face was more effective than to
communicate on paper or technology.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Reprieved pit may still be closed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has started procedures which could lead to the closure this
year of one of 12 mines reprieved by the government just three months ago.
It has told miners at Rufford in Nottinghamshire that the pit's future is
limited and has offered them the option of voting for its closure.
The move will be seen as the beginning of the end for at least some of the
12 as it becomes clear that the market is not big enough to support them.
The Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group said yesterday it showed
that the white paper accompanying the reprieve in March was 'nothing but a
sham'.
British Coal has told the 500 miners at Rufford that deteriorating
conditions at the mine mean that one option is to close it before the end of
this year.
It has also suggested developing another face which could provide work for
some of next year and a third face with an uncertain potential life.
The attraction of accepting the first option is that British Coal could
offer enhanced redundancy terms - available only until the end of the year -
and the option of work elsewhere.
Most of the miners are members of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. In a
ballot tomorrow they will be asked to vote on the options proposed by
British Coal and also on whether to oppose closure.
Regional executives of British Coal believe that even if the vote goes
against closure it is likely that many men will take voluntary severance by
the end of the year.
They have told the workforce that Rufford's uncertain future would in any
case make it a likely candidate for closure later this year if British Coal
is unable to find markets for all 12 reprieved pits.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour energy spokesman, said British Coal was guilty of
'financial blackmail of the most vicious kind'.
He added that the workforce was effectively 'being offered only one choice -
leave the pit before December 31 and receive up to Pounds 37,500 or stay on
with only the prospect of a maximum of Pounds 6,150'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Timex pickets expect factory rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX MAY have announced that it is to close its Dundee factory after five
months of bitter industrial dispute, but the dawn patrol of strikers was
picketing the locked factory gates on a hill outside the city yesterday, as
it has every day for the past five months.
Today the strikers meet in the city's Caird Hall to hear an offer from the
company to re-employ some of them so as to ensure an orderly wind-down of
work before the factory closes at Christmas.
But there appeared to be little enthusiasm among the strikers to work for
what they see as a 27 per cent cut in pay and benefits to assist the
company's withdrawal from the city, which was announced on Tuesday. Few
seemed inclined to go back to work even if the company changed its mind
about closure, which it has insisted it will not.
Mr Alec Miles receives about Pounds 30 a week in strike pay and Pounds 40 a
week on the dole. He will continue to protest, and said: 'What else am I
going to do? I am 51 and I have had three heart attacks. No one is going to
employ me.'
Many of the pickets, particularly women who have been with Timex a long
time, refuse to believe that the factory will close and expect someone to
come to the rescue.
Ms Margo Bell, who worked for the company for 27 years, said: 'They are
trying to get coolie labour. How would you like it if you were asked to
accept a 27 per cent pay cut? We want reinstatement at proper wages - if not
with this company then someone else who would take it over.'
Many protesters believe that Timex was determined from the beginning of the
dispute in January to close the plant. But Mr Charles Fairley, the chief
executive of Scottish Enterprise Tayside, does not believe there was any
grand design. He had discussions with Mr Peter Hall, the former president of
Timex UK, before the dispute began.
Mr Fairley said: 'Timex has become a sub-contractor of printed circuit
boards. He wanted to launch new products and expand production in Dundee.
But he needed to increase productivity. This hardly suggests he had a master
plan to shut the factory down.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Company says unresolved strike sealed plant's fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX'S failure to end the conflict with its sacked workforce in Dundee
clinched its decision to close the electronics plant, the company indicated
yesterday.
The underlying reason for the closure was its weak financial state and
continuous losses over the past five years which came to Pounds 10m.
The US company denied that its long-term aim had always been to close the
plant. Its intention had been to upgrade its capabilities and reduce
operating costs, to make it a 'world class manufacturer'.
The company explained: 'The backdrop of conflict places too much strain on
the organisation. We fully expected a picket on the factory gate for a long
time. But we never thought there would be mass picketing with violence.'
It said it had never been the intention of the company to re-hire
selectively from among the sacked workforce after the legal prohibition on
doing so expired 90 days after they were sacked on February 17.
The company made an offer on June 3, repeated on Monday, in the hope of
ending the conflict. It offered to re-employ those sacked workers who were
judged by consultants to have the 'skills and commitment'.
The company accepted that many sacked workers would not want to return and
work alongside the 'scab' replacement workforce.
The offer was not accepted by the sacked workforce which demanded the
reinstatement of all 343 dismissed staff.
The company said it had been left 'financially exhausted' after the strike
in January. But it had a full order book, had lost no customers because of
the dispute and was in a state of 'fragile recovery'.
It had announced Pounds 5m of new orders in early June and had wanted to
increase its 260-strong labour force by 200.
Mr Peter Hall, who resigned as president of Timex Electronics on Sunday,
yesterday refused to explain his departure from the company.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Brewers angry at Customs statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Customs and Excise officials and the Brewers' Society broke
out again yesterday over Customs' statements that the new system of beer
duty introduced earlier this month would not penalise brewers but bring them
'a bonus of millions', Philip Rawstorne writes.
Brewers protested two weeks ago that the system - under which duty is
charged on the alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase
the industry's tax burden by Pounds 64m a year.
Bass, Courage, and Carlsberg-Tetley, the three leading brewers, announced
reductions in the strength of a number of beer brands to ease the impact.
Customs and Excise said that switching the duty charge from an earlier
production stage would produce a one-off cashflow benefit to the industry of
Pounds 200m.
Mr Robin Simpson, the society's director, said the Customs statement was
'absolutely outrageous'. He added: 'The one-off benefit to brewers comes
from paying duty a few weeks later. To suggest this offsets in any
significant way an increase of 3 per cent in the industry's taxation bill is
blatantly misleading.'

FT  17 JUN 93 / Share options put under spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXERCISING of share options by directors would have been significantly
curbed if guidelines being considered by institutional investors had been in
force in 1991 and 1992, says research by Incomes Data Services published
today.
Institutional investors have been increasingly concerned about generous
remuneration packages for directors, and have turned their attention to
share option schemes, which require shareholders' approval.
Guidelines suggested by the National Association of Pension Funds say
options should be exercised only if the rise in the company's share price at
least matched the rise in the FT-A All-Share Index over the option period.
According to the June issue of IDS Management Pay Review, one-in-five
options exercised by directors of top companies during two quarters in 1991
and 1992 would have been disallowed by the association's guidelines.
The National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British
Insurers disagree over how tough guidelines should be. They have delayed
until next month their announcement of joint guidelines on share options as
the main part of their platform for curbing excesses in directors' pay.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Market testing process attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR manager of a French company which yesterday won the first
significant contract in the market testing programme for contracting-out
Civil Service functions has attacked the way the process is being operated.
Mr Charles Cox, a director of computing services company Hoskyns, warned
that the programme's objectives were being prejudiced by unrealistically
framed tenders.
Private-sector interest would wither unless companies could see better
opportunities for profit, he said.
Mr Cox, director of Hoskyns' public-sector division, said policymakers and
civil servants had a poor understanding of the benefits of contracting out
services to the private sector.
'Tenders are often framed in such a way that the scope for suppliers to
deliver savings and still make an adequate return is very limited,' he said.
Hoskyns, the UK arm of Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computing
services company, has been awarded the contract to run the Ministry of
Defence's Operations West Data Centre in Devizes, Wiltshire. It won against
competition from the Anglo-French Sema Group and an in-house bid.
The company has revenues of about Pounds 100m a year from outsourcing or
facilities management contracts.
Some 60 staff at the Devizes centre will be transferred to Hoskyns' payroll.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Nissan Motor behind alleged Pounds 97m fraud, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, was behind an alleged
Pounds 97m tax fraud on the Inland Revenue, the Old Bailey was told
yesterday.
The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC in his closing defence speech
on behalf on Mr Michael Hunt, the director of British car importer Nissan
UK.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Hunt was part of a fraud in which Nissan UK
executives conspired with shipping agents to overstate freight charges for
transporting the cars in an attempt to avoid corporation tax. More than
Pounds 200m was siphoned off and eventually laundered into two Swiss bank
accounts, including one at Credit Suisse, it is alleged. Mr Hunt, who did
not give evidence, denies the charges.
A fraud on the Revenue had plainly taken place, Mr Sherrard said. However,
the evidence showed there was a 'more than credible' case that it was the
Japanese, rather than the British, company that was responsible.
Documentary evidence of this was provided in a letter written in the early
1980s by Mr Seisaku Homma, then managing director of Nissan Motor Car
Carrier (NMCC), the carmaker's transport division, Mr Sherrard said.
The letter was written while the Dutch tax authorities were investigating
Autocontex, one of the shipping agents allegedly involved in the fraud. In
it, Mr Homma stated that all the money paid into the Credit Suisse account
was used to settle NMCC's transport accounts.
Mr Sherrard said the purpose of the Swiss bank account remained unknown.
'Were they assembling a corporate slush fund to buy their way into markets
throughout the world? We don't know,' he told the jury. However, the fact
was that the Japanese involvement in the fraud was real, he said.
Mr Hunt had made diary entries about his meetings with his alleged
co-conspirators, Mr Sherrard said. He would have been 'half-witted' to do
that if he was part of a fraud.
The Japanese, on the other hand, did not take any risks. Those that had
given evidence had not been able to produce any documents worth talking
about, Mr Sherrard said.
The trial continues today.

FT  17 JUN 93 / PSBR jumps to Pounds 9.7bn for first two months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC FINANCES moved further into the red last month as the public sector
borrowing requirement grew to Pounds 5.01bn from Pounds 4.71bn in April and
Pounds 3.13bn in May last year.
Official figures released yesterday showed that the PSBR or budget deficit
increased to Pounds 9.7bn in the first two months of the current financial
year, from Pounds 6.6bn in the same period last year. The rise reflected
continued strong growth in government spending and sluggish increases in tax
revenues.
Government cash receipts rose only 2 per cent to Pounds 32.8bn in April and
May from Pounds 32.1bn in the same two months last year. Total cash outlays
of Pounds 41.4bn in the two months were 8.5 per cent higher than the Pounds
38.2bn disbursed in the same period last year.
The cumulative PSBR so far this year is nearly one-fifth of the Pounds 50bn
deficit that the government forecast for the 1993-94 financial year in its
March Budget.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers International in
London, said government spending should slow during the rest of the year
while revenues should pick up. However, he warned that trends needed to
improve for the government to avoid overshooting its deficit forecast.
The May PSBR was slightly below market expectations in spite of a fall in
value added tax receipts. The drop reflected a shift in companies'
accounting for VAT to a monthly from a quarterly basis.

THE Japan Machinery Exporters' Association yesterday warned its members that
they should be careful about investing in China, partly out of concern about
legal protection but also because of fears that Japan's domestic industry
will be undermined by a shift of production.
A survey of 314 of its members revealed that 72 had invested in China or
were planning to do so - a trend encouraged by the rise of the yen and by
the poor profitability of many manufacturers, who want to cut production
costs.
Mr Tetsuzo Yamamoto, chief of international research at the association,
said the Japanese industry risked becoming 'just a shell' if machinery
manufacturers continued to transfer operations to China.
The association warned companies to be wary of inadequate legal protection
in China, sometimes poor production quality and restrictions on sales to the
Chinese domestic market. Japanese trading house Kinsho-Mataichi and
shirtmaker Tomiya Apparel are to make shirts in Beijing for export to Japan.
Initial annual output of 600,000 shirts is expected to increasing to 1.2m by
about 1996.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Ilyushin wins first big order from west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first airliner jointly built by Russian and US companies has won its
first western order, at the Paris Air Show this week.
Partnairs, an Amsterdam-based aircraft trading and leasing company, has
placed an order for up to 10 Ilyushin IL-96M, worth about Dollars 700m
(Pounds 454.5m).
The aircraft is Russia's challenge to the new generation of long-haul
airliners from the European Airbus consortium and Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas of the US.
Deliveries of the 318-seat Russian aircraft, powered by four US Pratt &amp;
Whitney engines and fitted with advanced US fly-by-wire technology and
digital flight navigation equipment produced by Rockwell Collins, are due to
begin in 1996.
United Technologies (UTC), Pratt &amp; Whitney's parent company, said Partnairs
had placed five firm orders for the new aircraft and taken options on an
additional five.
The deal was worth about Dollars 280m for Pratt &amp; Whitney, according to a
UTC official.
Ilyushin, together with the rest of the Russian aerospace industry, has been
seeking to introduce western engines and avionics on Russian airliners to
gain access to western markets and badly needed hard currency.
Tupolev has equipped its TU-204 mid-range 200-seater twin jet airliner with
Rolls-Royce engines.
Russian airframe manufacturers could eventually pose a longer term challenge
to western manufacturers because their products are priced about 25-30 per
cent lower than equivalent western jets.
Ilyushin has about 40 firm orders and options for its new airliner,
including Russian International Airlines, Aeroflot's international division.

BOUYGUES, the French construction and engineering company, is negotiating to
finance and help build a second unit at Romania's Cernavoda nuclear plant.
It has signed a letter of intent with Renel, Romania's state electricity
monopoly, according to a company spokesman. Repayment of the project's cost,
which could total Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m), would be in electricity once
the unit came on stream.
Work at Cernavoda, a Candu-type heavy water plant which was begun in the
late 1970s, has been interrupted many times. The first 700MW unit, which is
being built by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ansaldo of Italy, General Electric
and Renel, is expected to start generating power at the end of next year.
Five units are planned at the site.
Cernavoda would be Bouygues' largest project in Romania to date. The
company's first venture, the World Trade Centre costing Dollars 120m, is due
to open next year.
The company is also negotiating to build an office block in Bucharest's
financial district and a 23-storey national communications centre for
Romtelecom, the state telecommunications operator.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Gatt acts on Russian application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
yesterday set up a working party to examine Russia's application to join the
world trade body and established a disputes panel on the European
Community's new banana import regime.
Russia's membership bid was widely welcomed by many, including the US and
the European Community, but tough negotiations lie ahead on its terms of
entry.
President Boris Yeltsin, who met Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general,
in Moscow last Friday, said he hoped Russia could join by the end of this
year. However, officials in Moscow and Geneva believe membership in two to
three years' time is more realistic.
Mr Sergei Glaziev, Russia's trade minister, said yesterday his country's
accession to Gatt was an essential step in its integration into the global
trading system, which in turn was vital for the success of economic and
political reform.
The Gatt council also approved draft entry terms negotiated for Paraguay,
which will join the 111-member organisation later this summer once
procedural formalities are concluded. At the same time, the council expelled
Serbia and Montenegro from the seat held by the former Yugoslavia.
In another development, the EC lifted its veto on establishment of an
independent disputes panel to examine a complaint by five Latin American
countries that the EC's new banana import restrictions violate international
fair trade rules. The restrictions, which come into force on July 1, limit
imports of Latin American bananas to 2m tonnes a year above which punitive
tariffs are applied. Imports of bananas from African and Caribbean countries
linked with the EC through the Lome Convention will continue to enter
duty-free.
The council failed to agree on whether the issue should be treated under
'rules of urgency' as requested by the Latin American banana producers.
These require the panel to report within three months rather than the usual
six months. The decision will now be left to the panel.
The EC opposed adoption of an earlier panel report which condemned its
existing restrictions on Latin American banana imports and, by extension,
the Lome Convention itself as inconsistent with Gatt rules. Trade officials
say the EC could seek a formal Gatt waiver for the convention, as the US has
done for its Caribbean Basin Initiative.
Trade ministers of the seven-nation European Free Trade Association, meeting
in Geneva, said yesterday they expected the European Economic Area linking
the EC and six Efta members in a giant free trade zone to come into force
before the end of 1993.
Delays in ratification by three EC countries - the Netherlands, Spain and
Britain - mean the EEA cannot take effect on July 1 as hoped.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US and Japan meet on chip share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND Japanese officials are meeting in Washington this week to calculate
the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market for the first quarter
of 1993, as a measure of progress in resolving the long-running
semiconductor trade dispute, Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco.
Coming amid US-Japanese efforts to establish a framework for negotiations to
address a wide range of trade issues, the semiconductor talks are taking
broader significance.
They will provide further evidence of the success, or otherwise, of using
'measurable indicators' of progress in US-Japan trade agreements.
In a 1991 semiconductor trade pact, Japan 'recognised' a US industry target
of a foreign market share of 20 per cent, to be achieved by the end of 1992.
The agreement stated that 'particular attention should be given to market
share' in assessing progress.
Yet, from a US perspective, the 1991 semiconductor trade agreement has been
remarkably effective. To the surprise of many in the US semiconductor
industry, the 20 per cent target was surpassed in the final quarter of 1992,
when the market share proportion rose sharply to 20.2 per cent.
The increase was partly due to Japan's economic recession, which shrank the
overall size of its semiconductor market. The figure for the first quarter
of 1993 will similarly be influenced by market conditions in Japan.
The first-quarter market share figure is expected to be within a few decimal
points of 20 per cent, up or down. Any significant decline in the
first-quarter figure would be likely to raise a sharp response, from US
trade officials and from industry executives. The Clinton administration is
pressing for the inclusion of similar targets in future trade pacts with
Japan.
The Japanese government is strongly opposed. Despite its agreement to the
terms of the semiconductor pact, Japan says such targets represent a form of
'managed trade'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Fund to back private power generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FUND with a target of Dollars 500m (Pounds 324.6m) has been launched in
the US to seek capital from investment institutions for private sector power
projects in Latin America. The fund, said to be the first of its kind, has
an initial size of Dollars 75m and has been created because more and more
governments are turning to the private sector to increase generating
capacity.
The intention is to invest mainly in the equity of new private sector
thermal and hydroelectric power stations and in the privatisation of
existing plants in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Countries such as Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia have led the
movement to private power generation. Mexico allows the private sector to
invest jointly with the public sector, and in Brazil this week Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, economy minister, said the government would go ahead with
the sale of power generation assets.
Governments are turning to the private sector in an attempt to reduce budget
deficits. According to a World Bank study in 1989, state electricity sectors
caused a Dollars 2bn deficit in Latin America.
In some countries, regular power cuts are affecting growth. Colombia's
economy suffered last year from cuts caused in part by a drought which
exposed the country's over-dependence on hydroelectric power.
The capital needs are huge - estimated by the 1989 World Bank study at
Dollars 17bn-Dollars 18bn a year in Latin America alone. There has been a
shortage not only of equity, which the new fund will aim to help address,
but also of long-term debt.
The latter has traditionally been provided for such projects by
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the
InterAmerican Development Bank, but they are constrained in their ability to
lend to the private sector. Export credit agencies usually provide loans
only up to a maximum of 12 years, whereas 20-year or 30-year debt is more
appropriate for most power generation projects.
Another problem surrounds the region's underdeveloped domestic capital
markets. The most advanced is Chile's, but that is only able to provide
money up to 15 years.
A question mark for investors will be the regulatory regimes imposed on
private power generation. Foreign investors will want to ensure a lasting
pricing regime, which will not subject electricity prices to political
pressure, and to keep foreign exchange risks to a minimum.
Mr Luis Luis of Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, the Boston-based investment
management company managing the new fund, said he hoped the fund would
stimulate similar financing efforts to provide a pool of capital for private
sector power projects.
The fund, the Scudder Latin America Trust for Independent Power, will not be
the prime sponsor or developer of projects but is meant to provide finance
for projects started by others.
It starts with three investors committing Dollars 25m apiece: the
International Finance Corporation, the private sector affiliate of the World
Bank; CMS Energy, a Michigan-based energy company which owns Michigan's
largest utility; and Minneapolis-based NRG Energy, the owner of Northern
States Power. The three will act as advisers to the fund, which is available
to institutional investors.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment will hold talks in London today seeking
additional British funding to clean up former British nuclear test sites in
South Australia.
Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister, and Mr Simon Crean, energy minister,
are to meet Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, with new evidence
suggesting Britain may have deliberately misrepresented the extent of
radioactive contamination at the Australian test sites.
Under a previous agreement with Australia, Britain's responsibility to fund
the clean-up of sites in Maralinga and Emu Plains in South Australia ended
in 1968.
However, an article in the New Scientist reports that recently declassified
American documents showed the British knew in the early 1960s that
radioactivity at the test sites was worse than first thought.
Australia is now seeking ADollars 60m (Pounds 26.50m) to clean up the areas,
plus ADollars 45m to compensate aboriginal tribes that originally occupied
the sites.
The Australian government under Sir Robert Menzies, the then prime minister,
offered the test sites to the British during the cold war years. Tests were
conducted between 1952 and 1963.
Nine atomic explosions were carried out at Maralinga and Emu Plains, in
addition to three explosions off the coast of Western Australia.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Inkatha may be bypassed in S African talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday warned
that talks on a new South African constitution would go ahead with or
without the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his main
black rival.
The future of the talks will be decided today when delegates from Inkatha
and other conservative groups return to the negotiating table to report on
whether they intend permanently to withdraw from the talks.
Six conservative parties, known as the Concerned South Africans Group
(Cosag), provoked a crisis on Tuesday when they staged a walkout.
Mr Mandela took a tough line against the dissenters yesterday when he told a
crowd in Soweto: 'We want to warn them that no party will be able to hold
the multi-party negotiations to ransom.' He was speaking at a rally to mark
the annual 'Soweto day' unofficial holiday, observed by blacks to
commemorate anti-apartheid riots in 1976, the spark which led to eventual
uprisings in the 1980s which helped prompt political reform.
Yesterday Chief Buthelezi defended his delegation's decision to lead the
walkout, accusing the government and ANC of arrogance and saying his group
had drawn a line against 'those who have been attempting to manipulate the
process of the constitutional development of our country while disregarding
the real aspirations of the majority of South Africans'.
The dispute centres on whether Inkatha and its allies, which include the
white right-wing Conservative party, will be allowed to exercise real power
within the negotiations, or simply be called on to rubber-stamp a
constitution which has already been agreed in outline between the ANC and
the government.
In their haste to implement their draft constitution, calling for a
five-year multi-racial government of national unity, the government and ANC
have tended to ignore concerns of regionally-based parties such as Inkatha
for maximum devolution of power.
On Tuesday the ANC and government bloc threw out a resolution from Inkatha's
sister delegation, the KwaZulu 'homeland' government, calling for debate on
a federal constitution. In a crucial test of the 'sufficient consensus' rule
by which decisions in the 26-party forum are taken, the talks chairman
declared the resolution did not have sufficient consensus.
In effect, this means the assent of Inkatha and its allies is not necessary
for sufficient consensus - and that the forum can overrule Inkatha in all
matters.

<TEXT>
US aircraft early today bombed the centre of Mogadishu, the Somali capital,
in the fourth air strike against warlord General Mohamed Farah Aideed,
witnesses said, Reuter report from Mogadishu.
It was the first attack since Monday when Pakistani troops shot dead at
least 20 Somalis protesting against punitive military action by the United
Nations in retaliation for the killing of 23 of its peacekeepers on June 5.
Heavy aircraft and helicopter gunships flew over the sector of the city
controlled by Gen Aideed. Foreign aid workers, seeking refuge near Gen
Aideed's house, said that the attack was accompanied by loudspeaker appeals
to the people in the area to lay down their arms.
Gen Aideed's house was said to be surrounded by ground troops from the
United Nations Operation in Somalia (Unosom) which holds him responsible for
the killing of the Pakistani troops.
In Washington, a US defence official said: 'The objective of the strike is
to deny Aideed's capacity to disrupt UN operations.'
A US Navy flotilla carrying 2,200 Marines and helicopters was steaming
southwards in the Indian Ocean but no order had been given to send it to
Somalia, defence officials said.

FT  17 JUN 93 / LDP's reform bluff is called: Robert Thomson interprets the
drama in Japan's parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORDS seiji kaikaku (political reform) have echoed through the Japanese
parliament for so long that they have lost resonance and relevance. But,
with the ruling Liberal Democratic party on the brink of a split and the
country facing a possible snap election, the words have suddenly acquired
new meaning.
'Did you see the politicians fighting on television last night?' asked an
excited Japanese bank official yesterday. Having been encouraged to be
apathetic by the frequent broken promises for change, the Japanese have been
exhilarated by the action-packed political theatre of the past few days and
can look forward to a few more days of an intriguing plot.
One reason for the excitement is that two years ago Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the
then prime minister, declared that he would push ahead with political reform
regardless of opposition from the LDP's elders. Not long after his
unexpected assertiveness, the well-meaning Mr Kaifu was humiliatingly dumped
by those same elders.
Things are different this time around. His successor, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
has allowed the LDP elders to stall reform once again, but the party faces a
revolt from younger members who are threatening to support a planned
no-confidence motion today against the cabinet and may force Mr Miyazawa to
call a general election.
The prime minister and most other LDP faction leaders had presumed that the
political reform debate would take its usual course. Statements were made
supporting reform, breasts were beaten and fists shaken, though these
faction leaders had no intention of threatening their positions at the top
of the political hierarchy by permitting radical change.
Until this week, the debate went as planned. The anti-reformers in the LDP
proposed a system of single-seat constituencies to replace the present
multi-seat system, which has been prone to corruption. LDP factions compete
for seats in the same constituency, putting pressure on each other to raise
ever larger amounts of money and to promise local voters ever more bridges
and railway lines.
The system also makes young politicians dependent on faction funding for
their campaigns, and ensures their loyalty to that faction in the
parliament. In return, after five or so terms in office, the faction will
provide the MP with a ministerial post, often regardless of suitability for
the job.
It may appear that the supporters of a single-seat system are in favour of
reform, and the proposal has been accompanied by the statement that 'we must
not compromise on our duty to reform the political system'. But the LDP
members proposing the single-seat system know that it will be rejected by
the opposition, and the reform debate will be stalled.
The strategy of these LDP members, who are in the majority, was to suggest
that they personally had pushed for reform, but to lament that the path was
blocked by the four belligerent opposition parties. Opposition leaders
generally favour a mix of proportional representation and single seats,
fearing they would be slaughtered by the powerful LDP in a single seat
shoot-out.
But the anti-reformers, led by Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP secretary
general, now find that their bluff has been called. They were nervously
attempting to negotiate a peace settlement last night with the reformers,
including Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister who recently turned
down a cherished appointment as foreign minister to concentrate on changing
the political system.
In normal circumstances, the LDP would have the numbers to defeat a
no-confidence motion, as the party has 278 members out of the present total
of 496 representatives in the lower house, where the vote would be put. The
problem is Mr Hata has 35 members in his faction, and all are apparently
prepared at least to abstain - or perhaps even vote against the government.
'We have said that we are in favour of reform and we must take appropriate
action to secure reform,' Mr Hata said last night. If he can convince enough
young LDP members outside his faction to abstain, then Mr Miyazawa will be
defeated without Mr Hata having to vote in support of the opposition and
risk acquiring the tag of traitor.
A shaken Mr Miyazawa has suggested that he is not afraid to call an
election. However, recent opinion polls put his cabinet's popularity rating
at a meagre 25 per cent, and he is likely to have lost some of that support
in recent days because of his indecisiveness during the last week.
Even if there is an election and the LDP is pounded at the polls, and even
if a new electoral system is introduced, the old relationships and factions
will not necessarily lose their influence. As Mr Hata has suggested, 'it's
not just a matter of changing the system, you have to change the way of
thinking'.

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party faces a showdown today over the
reform of the country's scandal-stained political system, as opposition
parties have promised to launch a no-confidence motion against Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, and his cabinet.
If the motion is successful, Mr Miyazawa will be forced to dismiss the
cabinet or call a general election, prospects which prompted concern
yesterday among business leaders.
The outcome of a no-confidence vote will hinge on Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
former finance minister who heads a pro-reform LDP faction. He has indicated
he is prepared to abstain from the vote. If the members of Mr Hata's faction
choose to abstain, the LDP will still have a small majority in the lower
house, but if they vote against the party the balance will be tipped and the
Miyazawa cabinet will fall.
Mr Miyazawa had previously threatened to call an election if a no-confidence
motion was formally proposed, but his advisers were attempting to reach a
compromise with LDP reformers last night, fearing that the party would be
badly bruised if a snap election was called.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO main Cambodian political parties yesterday agreed on a form of
interim government under which they will share power while a new
constitution is being written.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of the royalist party Funcinpec, which won
most votes in elections last month, and Mr Hun Sen, until now prime minister
in the Phnom Penh government, will be joint presidents. The two spent most
of the election campaign making personal attacks on each other.
The agreement was proposed by Prince Ranariddh's father, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who resigned from Funcinpec two years ago to become the neutral
head of state. It has still to be ratified by the elected assembly, but the
two parties hold most of the seats in the assembly and approval should be a
formality.
Until now, Prince Ranariddh had said he would not work with Mr Hun Sen, whom
he says is an unreformed communist who has ordered the killing of dozens of
Funcinpec members. Mr Hun Sen's political star has risen sharply in the past
days after a poor election performance. He is being credited with having
defused an attempt to set up an autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia.
The announcement of an interim government comes two days after the new
assembly met for the first time and voted to give undefined and unlimited
powers to Prince Sihanouk. However, according to a statement released by the
royal palace last night, Prince Sihanouk will have no official role in the
new government.
Nevertheless, the prince will preside over weekly meetings of the council of
ministers held in the palace. Diplomats in Cambodia believe that will give
him every opportunity to influence government policy.

FT  17 JUN 93 / An African Victorian without rival: Michael Holman relates
scenes from the extraordinary life of Malawi's Banda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAMA has marked the questions you may not ask, said the minister. Sitting in
an ante-room in Blantyre's Sanjika presidential palace, we were awaiting the
summons from the Ngwazi (saviour).
The vetting by 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira, former presidential nurse and
Malawi's official hostess, was a pre-condition to Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda's
first press interview for more than 15 years. It may well have been his
last.
Now in his mid-90s, the combination of age and domestic opposition,
unambiguously reflected in the results of Monday's referendum on multi-party
elections, is bringing Dr Banda's career to an end.
But when the interview took place in 1985, his ruthless authority brooked no
challenge. Two years earlier three cabinet ministers had been assassinated,
their deaths blamed on a car crash, victims of suspicions real or imagined.
The forbidding figure who sat before me was a disquieting mix of Victorian
and voodoo. His sombre three-piece suit fitted his status as an elder of the
Church of Scotland. But the accompanying fly-whisk seemed a symbol of a
supernatural power that leaves cabinet ministers visibly terrified in his
presence.
In an effort to break the ice, I began the interview by recalling that as a
young schoolboy in the Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) town of Gwelo I used to
cycle past the jail where he was detained in 1959, and wonder how he was
faring.
Malawi's life president remained silent, seemingly glacial in his
indifference. I started on my truncated question list, from which 'Mama' had
removed questions about diplomatic ties with South Africa and his scorn for
the Organisation of African Unity.
The Ngwazi interrupted: 'Tell me more about Gwelo.' My recollections of
small-town Rhodesia included a year confined to the white area of Gwelo by a
government restriction order. 'The police knocked on the door at about 5.30
in the morning . . .', I began.
Dr Banda interrupted again, chuckling. 'It always seems to happen around
that time,' recalling his own arrest. The ice was broken.
For nearly an hour he reminisced about his campaign against the Central
African Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland (now Malawi), the struggle
for independence from Britain, and expounded his philosophy of hard work and
self-sufficiency.
From the day he took office in 1964 the medical doctor who trained in
Edinburgh and ran a popular surgery in London imposed these values on
Malawi.
On a continent where authoritarian government was usually accompanied by
economic mismanagement, Dr Banda's approach at first succeeded.
He inherited an impoverished state with no exploitable mineral resources,
120 miles of tarred road, and a handful of university graduates. By
concentrating on agriculture and encouraging commercial farming (notably tea
and tobacco), and with support from aid donors, real growth in gross
domestic product averaged 5 per cent until 1979.
But the 1980s saw a reversal of past gains as domestic failures were
compounded by external difficulties.
Ministerial reluctance to offend Dr Banda impeded reform of Press Holdings,
at that time a state-owned conglomerate. The president treated it as his
commercial fiefdom, funding the building of several presidential palaces and
other follies.
Peasant farmers suffered under a crop pricing policy which benefited state
coffers but eroded growers' incentives. Meanwhile the war in neighbouring
Mozambique cut off landlocked Malawi's shortest routes to the sea, forcing
the country to use costly alternatives through Tanzania and South Africa.
Contributing to economic problems which led to a 4 per cent fall in GDP last
year was the fall in foreign aid flows in response to continuing human
rights abuses. During 1992 hundreds of government opponents were arrested,
held for several weeks, and often tortured, said a report by Amnesty
International last month.
What seems unlikely is that Dr Banda will surrender power lightly or
gracefully. 'I have no regrets whatsoever,' he told me as the interview
ended.
I saw him again, two years later, at a party rally. A frail, diminutive
figure, Homburg, suit, and dark glasses, fly-whisk in hand, stepped down
from the podium to join his dancing mbumba, the buxom women bedecked in
cotton prints bearing his portrait. The vigilant security men relaxed. The
president was safe in the bosom of the nation, only the occasional flash of
the whisk above the bobbing heads revealing his presence.

<TEXT>
THE FIFTH round of Sino-British talks ended in Beijing yesterday with little
sign that the gulf separating the two sides over Hong Kong's future
political development had narrowed, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Sir
Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador at Beijing and chief negotiator,
described the talks as 'normal' - an indication that the Chinese had not
discussed substantive issues - but said the two had agreed to a sixth round
of talks on June 23-25.
The Hong Kong government yesterday confirmed that Mr Chris Patten, the
colony's governor, would fly to London later this month for high-level
consultations about Hong Kong policy.
While in London Mr Patten will attend a meeting on July 1 of the British
cabinet's Hong Kong committee, chaired by Prime Minister John Major. Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and other senior British ministers will
also take part in the discussions which are being billed as crucial for
charting Britain's policy towards the Hong Kong talks.
Both Mr Patten and senior ministers in London are losing patience with China
over the progress of the talks in Beijing.
Next month's meeting, the announcement of which is intended to concentrate
the Chinese leadership's mind, is expected to endorse Mr Patten's policy of
going 'one extra mile' and leave with him the power to recommend termination
of the talks.

Malawi voted by almost two to one to endorse multi-party democracy. Results
yesterday from a referendum on Monday delivered a stinging snub to
repressive President Kamuzu Banda, and thousands took to the streets in
celebration, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Dr Banda, who has run the country since independence from Britain in 1964,
called the poll under pressure from donors. The opposition will now press
for speedy installation of a multi-party transitional government to draw up
a democratic constitution and elections by the end of the year.
Mr Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the opposition Aford group who was freed from
jail last Saturday after serving six months for sedition, said Dr Banda's
days in power were now numbered. 'There is no way Banda can be resurrected.'

SYRIAN-ISRAELI peace talks in Washington were inching forward yesterday as
both sides focused discussions on the 'security regime' for the Golan
Heights, land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said yesterday
the Syrians wanted a comprehensive settlement. He said the way the talks
were taking shape as security discussions between two states at peace had
shown that Syria's concept of peace is more far-reaching than the Israeli
government thought.
Mr Yitzak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has so far refused to specify the
extent of any withdrawal until Syria agrees openly to a 'full peace'
including diplomatic relations, trade and open borders.
However, it would be unlikely for Damascus to sign an agreement with Israel
before substantial progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track of the
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
Signs of Israeli optimism on the Syrian track came a day after the Clinton
administration said for the first time it might be willing to guarantee
security arrangements for the Golan deal.
However, on a visit to the northern border on Tuesday Mr Rabin said: 'We'll
make an effort not to pay this time the price we paid for the peace with
Egypt' - a reference to Israel's complete return of the occupied Sinai to
Egypt in exchange for peace in 1979.
Despite continued government spending in the Golan Heights, Mr Avraham
Shochat, Israeli finance minister, said yesterday that he had told
businessmen planning to invest millions of dollars in the occupied territory
that investment was inadvisable in the long term.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Workplace union deals to be encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government plans to introduce legislation before the end of
this year designed to accelerate the spread of workplace bargaining
agreements between companies and employees, Mr Laurie Brereton, minister for
industrial relations, said yesterday.
The Labor government of Mr Paul Keating is seeking to replace a centralised
system, under which industrial relations commissions set most wages, with
direct negotiation at company level in which productivity is a key element.
This would be subject to a 'safety net' stipulating minimum standards.
Nearly 1,000 companies have signed such deals but this represents only 11
per cent of the work-force. Mr Brereton, in an interview in London, said: 'I
would like workplace agreements to be the norm. . . That is the change of
attitude that we want to create.'
Mr Brereton said that trade unions, with which successive Labor governments
have had a series of accords, were the driving force behind the trend
towards workplace agreements and their target was for 70 per cent of the
workforce to be covered by them.
Mr Brereton said the workplace agreement system would move Australia away
from the craft-based union system inherited from Britain.

INDIA'S political and financial communities were shaken yesterday by sworn
allegations from Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the
Bombay securities scandal, that he made a Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) secret
payment in 1991 to Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
Mr Rao yesterday denied receiving money from Mr Mehta. Senior figures in the
ruling Congress party also dismissed the allegations, and two of Mr Rao's
main rivals within the party - Mr Arjun Singh, union minister for human
resource development, and Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra
state - described it as a conspiracy to topple the government.
An emergency meeting of the Congress working committee has been called for
this morning, with many chief ministers flying into the capital from the
states through the night.
At a press conference in Bombay, Mr Mehta, who faces charges of currency
violations, fraud and bribery arising from the Bombay financial scandal
which broke in April last year, released a sworn affidavit. It described in
detail how he had personally delivered the money in two instalments to the
prime minister's office in order to gain political patronage.
Mr Mehta's statement said that while he had been 'painted the author of a
scam' and made out to be 'a person who had misappropriated national wealth
to the extent of Rs50bn and badly damaged the country's economy,' he was now
seeking to clear himself and expose 'the real culprits' of the scandal.
Mr Mehta, quoting an affidavit notarised by the Bombay High Court on
February 24 this year, detailed his alleged meeting with Mr Rao.
In it he says: 'On the 4th of November 1991, I met Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao at about 10.45 in the morning, in the company of my brother Ashwin and a
Congress Upper House member, the late Mr Satpal Mittal, at the Race Course
Road residence of the prime minister. . . we had brought to the prime
minister's residence, a suitcase containing cash amount of Rs6.7m. This
suitcase was brought into the prime minister's house and handed over to the
prime minister himself, who instructed that it should be retained in the
charge of his personal assistant, Mr Khandekar.'
According to Mr Mehta, the remaining Rs3.3m, which he could not immediately
muster, was delivered to Mr Rao's assistant the following day, at the
instance of the late Mr Mittal.
The Bombay stock exchange index closed 2.33 points lower at 491.43 yesterday
as rumours spread that Mr Mehta was to unleash a political bombshell at his
press conference.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council agreed early today to impose an oil and arms embargo
on Haiti in a tougher attempt to restore Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
the presidency after his ouster by the military in 1991.
A mandatory resolution was adopted unanimously by the council after several
days of talks on the lengthy text.
The resolution also calls for the freezing of overseas bank accounts and
other financial assets of the current Haitian leadership, which the UN has
declared illegitimate.
However, the measures will not go into effect until next Wednesday to allow
more time for negotiations aimed at reinstating Fr Aristide.
Mr Dante Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister serving as UN mediator
in the crisis, has scheduled new talks, excluding the military, and he
insists all participants must accept in advance the ousted president's
legitimacy.
The embargo would supersede voluntary - and largely ineffective - sanctions
recommended by the Organisation of American States, which has been working
closely with the UN throughout the crisis.
Since the US halted its oil shipments, Haiti has obtained most of its oil
from Europe, with the Netherlands reported to be a main supplier. Haitian
oil stocks are likely to run out at the end of July, so sanctions must be
applied as quickly as possible to avoid stockpiles being built up.
Enforcing the embargo could create problems as Haiti shares a border with
the Dominican Republic and, theoretically, could receive oil smuggled
overland.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Modest pick-up in economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is growing at a steady but moderate pace, figures for factory
output and the housing market indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said industrial production rose 0.2 per cent last
month and 3.5 per cent in the year to May.
It revised upward production figures for March and April to show monthly
gains of 0.2 per cent, rather than the zero and 0.1 per cent increase
previously reported.
The figures for factory output represent a sharp slowdown from winter, when
monthly gains averaged about 0.7 per cent.
The weakest sector last month was vehicle production, which fell 3.6 per
cent relative to April. However, most analysts expect firmer industrial
growth later this year provided domestic demand continues to revive after a
weak first quarter.
Housing starts rose 2.4 per cent between April and May to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.24m. Figures for April were revised upward to show
an 8.1 per cent increase from March.
The recovery of starts followed sharp declines in the first quarter when bad
weather hit the housing market. Last month's increase was concentrated in
the mid-west and south.
Building permits - a good guide to future construction plans - also rose
modestly last month after a sharp gain in the month of April.
The two sets of figures point to a modest acceleration in economic growth
this quarter after a disappointing 0.9 per cent annual rate of expansion
during the year's opening three months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US was pursuing a policy of 'export activism' in an attempt to open
markets and stimulate global growth, but was still hoping for bolder
expansionary measures in other leading economies, a senior Clinton
administration official indicated yesterday.
Mr Lawrence Summers, under-secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury, said that in pressing for the elimination of trade barriers the US
was 'unmanaging trade' rather than managing it. The US was not trying to
expand the role of government but to achieve an outcome that free markets
would have provided in the absence of artificial barriers.
In a speech at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, Mr Summers
called on Japan to curb its trade surplus by stimulating domestic demand and
for European countries to lower interest rates.
Action by the US's trading partners was essential because the US was cutting
its budget deficit and was not able to pull the rest of the world out of
recession as it had in the 1980s.
He said the obstacles to global growth were mainly political as there was a
consensus among economists about policies required in Europe and Japan.
A successful completion of the Uruguay Round trade talks was the
administration's highest priority in trade policy. However, bilateral
pressure to reduce Japan's 'seemingly chronic and growing' surplus was also
necessary.
Mr Summers said Russia had made 'real progress' on economic reforms.
He urged multilateral institutions to speed up transfers of funds to Russia,
saying this was 'not a matter of weakening conditionality but of providing
support at a critical time'.
He said profound cultural changes were necessary at the World Bank and other
development institutions which had put too much emphasis on making loans and
not enough on supervising projects.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Connally always in LBJ's shadow: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Bowden Connally, who died on Tuesday at the age of 76, might have been
the second coming of another legendary politician from Texas, Lyndon Baines
Johnson, but in the end the most important national post he held was as US
Treasury secretary from 1971-72.
Silver haired and silver tongued, the Democrat-turned-Republican lawyer from
Floresville, Texas, always aimed high and thought big.
He cut his political spurs running LBJ's first campaign for the House and as
his administrative assistant in the Senate in the late 1940s, and his
business ones as a legal adviser to Mr Sid Richardson, the notorious Texas
oilman, in the 1950s.
With these connections and credentials, President John F Kennedy named him
secretary of the navy in 1961. Two years later he was governor of his native
home state. On November 23 that year in Dallas he was in the car in which
the president was assassinated and he was himself severely wounded.
Three times elected governor, he was nonetheless increasingly out of sorts
with the national Democratic party as it swung to the left. In 1971, while
retaining his nominal party loyalty, he took the extraordinary political
gamble of accepting President Richard Nixon's invitation to become Treasury
secretary. He only formally became a Republican after LBJ's death in 1973.
The two years he served Mr Nixon were distinctive, to put it mildly, as he
imposed his style and bluster on the US and the global economic community.
Not only did he preside over the imposition of wage and price controls in
1971 but he also supervised the demise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed
exchange rates when he took the US off the gold standard at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington in the same year.
Mostly untainted by the Watergate affair, but not by subsequent financial
scandals of his own, Mr Connally so impressed Mr Nixon that the president
had to be dissuaded in 1972 from ditching vice-president Spiro Agnew in his
favour.
Mr Nixon returned the compliment in his final days by trying to block
federal charges that Mr Connally had accepted illegal political donations
from the milk lobby (he was subsequently acquitted).
But by then it was already assumed that his sights were set on the White
House itself. In this he never got far past the starting post, neither in
1976 nor, most ignominiously, in 1980 when he spent more than Dollars 12m
from his own pocket and secured precisely one delegate to the Republican
convention that year.
He was heard making complimentary noises about a fellow Texan, Mr Ross
Perot, in last year's election.
The 1980s were generally a disaster. A real estate venture with a former
Texas lieutenant governor went sour, forcing him to file for bankruptcy and
to put up his considerable private collection of art, furniture and assorted
mementoes for public auction.
But he remained active in Texas politics until the Senate primary two months
ago when he sought to prevent the victory of Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison,
installed this week as the new Republican senator.
Mr Connally was always known for his quotability. One that has endured for
for nearly 20 years was a famous blast against Japan, when he threatened
that if he had his way their cars 'would never leave the docks at Yokohama'.
His failure to achieve his ultimate ambition may be ascribed to several
factors.
He was a political turncoat and was thus spurned by Democrats, while never
fully trusted by Republicans, and was ultimately upstaged by Mr Ronald
Reagan, ironically also a turncoat but without Mr Connally's reputation as
an opportunist.
His financial wheeling and dealing, if very much in the Texas mould, also
looked out of place in the post-Watergate era of a new morality.
He ended where he began, in LBJ's long shadow, teaching an occasional class
in political science at the department of the University of Texas named
after the former president. It was said to be wildly popular.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Mexico fires agents in drugs purge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO has sacked 67 members of the federal anti-drugs squad, including 13
commanders, in a crackdown on collusion with traffickers. They will be
arrested if investigations show proof of criminal activity, the attorney
general's office said yesterday.
A further 75 agents based in the state of Sinaloa, an important centre of
trafficking, are reported to have been transferred to Mexico City for
interrogation about links with the illegal drugs trade.
The authorities have also detained for questioning Mr Rodrigo Esparza
Cristerna, the attorney general's representative in the state, suggesting
that investigations may reach beyond the security forces.
President Carlos Salinas's administration has stepped up its campaign
against drug trafficking in the wake of a shoot-out last month between rival
gangs at Guadalajara airport when seven people were killed, including a
Roman Catholic cardinal. The incident shocked Mexican society and brought
home the ease with which cocaine rings operate in the country.
Since then, a string of arrests has been made in an attempt to curb the
Sinaloa cocaine cartel, culminating in the detention on June 8 in Guatemala
of Mr Joaquin Guzman Loera, its alleged head.
However, even these successes have proved controversial. Questions have been
asked why all the initial arrests related to the airport shootings have been
of Sinaloa cartel members, while no members of its Tijuana rival have been
detained.
Churchmen have also voiced doubts about the official theory that the
cardinal, shot at point-blank range, was mistaken for a trafficker.
There is some scepticism about the extent and durability of the drugs
crackdown. The operation against Mr Guzman 'fits with the Salinas strategy
of spectacular strikes that don't ultimately change the balance of power,'
said Ms Denise Dresser, political scientist at the Autonomous Technological
Institute of Mexico.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the US chemicals group, yesterday challenged its critics to prove
that its Benlate DF fungicide had damaged crops when used as labelled, and
appointed an outside director to serve as ombudsman on the issue.
The company, besieged with lawsuits over Benlate and allegations that it
withheld important documents from growers, said it would pay for testing the
product at any of the top 10 US agricultural universities for any plaintiff
with a current lawsuit.
The move follows a decision by federal judge Robert Elliot to direct a jury
to find Du Pont liable for Benlate damage. Judge Elliot concluded at a
pretrial hearing on Friday that plaintiffs had clearly demonstrated that Du
Pont withheld documents relating to the cross-contamination of Benlate with
crop-killing herbicides also made by Du Pont.
As part of its offer, the company said it would pay for crop damage if the
tests proved Benlate caused the damage claimed in the suit. However, Du Pont
will ask plaintiffs to agree to withdraw their suits if the tests show
Benlate did not damage plants.
In addition, Du Pont asked its outside director, Mr Howard Johnson, former
chairman of MIT Corporation, to serve as ombudsman with power to retain
independent counsel to probe the allegations of wrongdoing and to report his
findings to the public. It said anyone with knowledge of an instance where
evidence had been withheld in bad faith or data falsified about Benlate
should contact him.
Du Pont has already paid growers Dollars 500m (Pounds 324.6m) in voluntary
settlements but the company suspended payments in November after its
research failed to duplicate the effects attributed to Benlate.

<TEXT>
ONE OF the stalwarts of Canada's outgoing Mulroney government, trade
minister Michael Wilson, will leave politics after the general election
later this year.
Mr Wilson, 55, was finance minister for seven years, and then led Canada's
participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
He is one of several senior ministers who are stepping aside to allow Ms Kim
Campbell, the prime minister-elect, to put her own stamp on the Conservative
government ahead of the election.
She will unveil her cabinet when she is sworn in on June 25. Her immediate
challenge is to maintain unity within the party's Quebec caucus which was
strained during the recent leadership race.
Ms Campbell won the backing of several senior Quebec nationalists. But her
main rival for the leadership, Mr Jean Charest, is a staunch federalist. He
is expected to be offered the post of either deputy premier or Ms Campbell's
chief Quebec lieutenant.
Others in the Mulroney inner circle stepping down are Mr Donald Mazankowski,
deputy prime minister and finance minister, Ms Barbara McDougall, external
affairs minister, and Mr Joe Clark, constitutional affairs minister.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Croatia and Serbia propose Bosnia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIA and Serbia have agreed to make a joint Bosnian peace proposal which
would divide the country into three ethnic states with a federal or
confederal constitution, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia said in Geneva
last night.
Mr Tudjman's announcement followed a three-hour meeting with his Serbian,
Bosnian and Montenegrin opposite numbers, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Mr Alija
Izetbegovic and Mr Momir Bulatovic - the first time the leaders of the
former Yugoslav states had met since their short-lived Athens agreement on
the Vance-Owen plan last month.
Mr Milosevic said: 'My strong belief is that we have made a substantial step
towards peace.'
Though Mr Izetbegovic left the meeting early, claiming he could not continue
to negotiate while the Moslem town of Gorazde was being shelled by the
Bosnian Serbs, Mr Tudjman claimed that the Moslem president, too, had agreed
in principle to 'certain modifications' to the Vance-Owen plan.
However, Mr Izetbegovic, who was due to meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn
today, had made it clear that he would first have to consult the other
members of the Bosnian presidency.
It was not clear how Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators who presided over the meeting, viewed the proposals.
The mediators have said they would accept any modifications to their plan
agreed by all parties.
However, the Serb and Croat proposals amount to much more than the
'modifications' of the Vance-Owen map referred to by President Tudjman. They
would virtually sound the death knell of the plan, under which
Bosnia-Hercegovina was to have been divided into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces but would have remained a unitary state.
The Serbs and Croats would each submit proposals within the next few days,
but they would try to harmonise their views, Mr Tudjman said. It was already
clear that the Bosnian Moslem unit would be composed of two geographically
separated areas: the central Bosnian region around Sarajevo, the capital,
and the north-west region of Bihac.
The Serbs and Croats had also agreed to make new proposals for the
constitutional principles on which the new confederal Bosnian state would be
based, thus changing one of the few sections of the Vance-Owen plan which
had been agreed by all parties.
Mr Tudjman said that he had offered the Bosnian Moslem state access to the
sea via the Adriatic port of Ploce, which would be turned into a free port.
It was not immediately clear whether the proposed Bosnian Serb and Croatian
states would suffer from the same geographical division as the Moslem
entity, but the impression given by Mr Tudjman was that this would not be
the case. There have been reports that the Croatian president, Mr Milosevic
and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, have already explored the
possibility of territorial swaps.

FT  17 JUN 93 / EC deficits 'threaten new currency chaos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday warned that a fresh crisis in the exchange
rate mechanism could be triggered if member states allow budget deficits to
grow in order to counter rising unemployment.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, called for tighter
fiscal policies in 1994. A relaxation of fiscal discipline would damage the
Community's credibility and could lead to tighter monetary policy, higher
interest rates and new disturbances in the European Monetary System.
Mr Christophersen was speaking on the day the Commission forecast that EC
economies would shrink an average of 0.5 per cent this year, the worst
performance since 1975.
Growth next year is likely to be a modest 1.25 per cent, pushing
unemployment in the EC towards 20m, according to the Commission forecasts.
Employment is expected to fall by more than 1 3/4 per cent, the poorest
figures in the history of the EC.
One bright spot is the UK economy, which is forecast to grow 1.5 per cent
this year and 2.5 per cent next year. Mr Christophersen agreed that Britain
had enjoyed a short-term benefit from leaving the ERM, but he described the
UK recovery as 'fragile'. At a news conference, Mr Christophersen justified
his rejection of deficit spending to counter unemployment by pointing out
that the EC's budgetary position remained precarious. The current level of
government net borrowing is likely to increase to around 6 1/4 per cent of
GDP in 1993. This is the highest recorded in the EC (it reached 5.2 per cent
in 1982), and is more than double the target of 3 per cent set down in the
Maastricht treaty for membership of a European Monetary Union.
Despite the poor prospects for growth, Mr Christophersen insisted that it
was still possible to reach the Emu goal, and he ruled out changing the
convergence criteria on inflation, government debt and budget deficits set
down in the treaty.
Mr Christophersen said that reducing budget deficits was not being done 'to
please people in Brussels' or to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for
joining a monetary union. 'The biggest risk of a further relaxation of
fiscal policies is that it will reduce credibility in other areas,' he said.
Without naming the Bundesbank, Mr Christophersen said: 'There will be no
further easing of monetary policy if you increase fiscal deficits. A
tightening of monetary policy could lead to new disturbances in the European
Monetary System.'
His remarks underline the belief in Brussels that nothing should be said -
or done - which might cause the Bundesbank to have second thoughts about
lowering interest rates. Virtually all bets are being placed on lower German
 -and European - interest rates in the next 12 months to revive the economy.
Mr Christophersen said he expected inflation to edge down to an average
annual rate of 4.25 per cent this year from 4.6 in 1992, and to keep falling
to 3.75 per cent in 1994, making it easier to relax monetary policies and
pave the way to lower interest rates which were a key to growth.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by the European Commission to enforce higher disclosure standards
for state aid to public sector companies were set back yesterday by a
European Court of Justice ruling against the procedures Brussels had
followed to introduce the measure.
The Commission said yesterday it would be repackaging the measure, as it has
done after similar procedural slip-ups in the past.
The aim of the 1991 move was to uncover more of the illegal state aid which
member states were not notifying to Brussels. State-owned manufacturing
concerns with turnover in excess of Ecu250m (Pounds 197.5m) were required to
submit balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for examination,
including for 1989 and 1990, the two years preceding the change in the
rules.
Previously, state aids were notified by member states. But Sir Leon Brittan,
EC competition commissioner at the time, reckoned that the inadequate rigour
of the previous regime had let Ecu15bn in non-notified aid slip through the
net over the previous five years, only Ecu5bn of which had been uncovered.
Though the crackdown was controversial and strongly contested by France and
Italy, Brussels maintained this was an important distortion of competition.

FT  17 JUN 93 / EC states agree telecoms reform: Liberalisation package
brings another denial of two-speed Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MINIMUM of six EC countries, including the largest member states, agreed
last night to open all domestic and international telephone calls to
competition by January 1, 1998.
But poorer and smaller countries have won between two and five more years to
adapt to the liberalised system.
EC telecoms ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, postponed discussion of
European Commission plans to allow certain groups of users access to
alternative networks for ordinary phone calls.
Mr Arne Melchior, the Danish minister who chaired the meeting, said after
the eight-hour discussion that the deal was not another example of a
'two-speed Europe' with richer member states, including Britain, France, and
Germany forging ahead of their partners. 'We want everyone to be on board,
but we are realistic enough to take account of the factual situation,' he
said.
Earlier, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's industry commissioner, warned member
states that it would be against their own interests to postpone the
Commission's proposed 1998 deadline for opening all telephone calls to full
competition. The plan is supposed to reduce telephone charges across the
Community, particularly for international and intra-EC calls. The Commission
has yet to agree formal draft legislation to liberalise so-called 'voice
telephony', so yesterday's meeting produced only a broadly worded
resolution.
Before July 1996 Brussels must come up with draft measures laying out the
regulatory framework for liberalisation, and in the meantime it is to 'work
closely' with the less developed countries to accelerate the modernisation
of their telephone systems.
At yesterday's meeting Luxembourg and Belgium asked to be classified as
'very small networks', which would not have to liberalise telephone services
until the year 2000. Less developed networks - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and
Greece - would benefit from an automatic postponement of the deadline until
2003 to allow them to modernise their infrastructure.
The Commission said it was pleased with the outcome of yesterday's meeting,
but it marks a step back from Brussels' original ambitious plans, which
followed earlier liberalisation of the market for telecoms equipment and
specialised services. Internal pressure had already forced Brussels to drop
an earlier plan to liberalise cross-border telephone calls within the EC by
1996 before moving to full competition by 1998.

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, is expected to be closely
questioned on the critical state of the country's public finances at today's
meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council.
The 16-man council, which will also review interest rates and the state of
the economy, will seek assurances from the minister that spending will be
cut. Although Mr Waigel is regarded as a lame duck in Frankfurt, his renewed
attempts to cut expenditure are seen as the key to a resumption of the
Bundesbank's interest rate reductions.
Ballooning government deficits, and a borrowing requirement expected to
reach DM150bn (Pounds 60.9bn) this year after DM130bn in 1992, are now the
main obstacles to further moves. Signals from the central bank yesterday
suggested that the internationally important 7.25 per cent discount rate
would not be reduced. In the morning the bank left the securities repurchase
rate, at which it supplies funds to the banking system, unchanged for the
sixth week in succession.
Mr Waigel's credibility suffered when the government's first attempt at
savings resulted in a hefty package of tax increases, against Bundesbank
urgings. It was damaged further when he later found a DM100bn hole in the
government's expected revenues, and then tried to leave Bonn via a failed
bid to become prime minister of Bavaria.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Kohl ready to relax laws on nationality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday agreed to draw up plans for further
relaxation of Germany's strict laws on citizenship and nationality, and
including possible extension of dual nationality in exceptional cases.
Both the chancellor and Mr Rudolf Seiters, his interior minister, rejected
calls for a general acceptance of the principle of dual nationality, which
has been urged by leaders of the Turkish community in the wake of recent
racial attacks.
They promised, however, that the 80-year-old nationality law would be
redrafted before the end of the current parliament next year.
In a formal statement of government policy in the wake of a series of arson
attacks on the homes of foreigners, especially Germany's 1.8m strong Turkish
community, Mr Kohl sought to counter criticism that he had failed to show
enough sympathy for the victims.
He listed measures taken by the authorities to clamp down on right-wing and
neo-Nazi groups, including the banning of three organisations, legal action
to strip two leading neo-Nazis of their constitutional rights and
surveillance by the security services of the extreme right-wing Republicans,
who have won a number of seats in local council elections.
At the same time he issued a stern warning against extremists within the
Turkish community, suggesting that there were now as many as 18,000
supporters of Islamic fundamentalism, 7,000 members of extreme Turkish and
Kurdish nationalist groups, and 4,000 supporters of 'revolutionary-Marxist
groups'.
Mr Kohl's statement is unlikely to meet many of the demands of both
immigrant and opposition groups for firmer government action, and dual
nationality, but he did throw open the debate on German nationality.
'We must change our law on nationality in such a way that the existing
opportunities to become a German citizen are better used,' he told the
parliament. 'I am thinking above all of young Turkish citizens, who regard
Germany as their home, and are also ready to fulfil the duties of a citizen
in our democratic state.
'I think it is right to avoid the application of multiple nationality in
principle,' he added. But in the course of drafting the promised reform of
the 1913 Nationality Law, a joint commission of the federal government and
16 states would investigate 'whether multiple nationality can be possible in
exceptional cases, beyond those which already exist.'
An idea put forward by members of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union is
that anyone opting for German nationality would be given an extra five years
to decide whether to renounce his or her original nationality.
Some would doubt, however, that the whole debate over extending German
nationality will help solve the rise of racism in the country.

PARLIAMENT'S DRAFT
Federalism:
The state is based on principles of federalism and the nations' (ethnic
groups') right to self-determination within the Russian Federation.
Social aims:
The Federation will provide equal and just opportunities for personal
development and welfare for individuals and society.
Property rights:
Property rights are inviolable, but forced confiscation of property is
permitted in cases where society is proven to need it. Concentration of land
in the hands of one proprietor or owner exceeding legal limits is
prohibited.
Press freedom:
Media freedom is guaranteed, but misuse of media freedom is prohibited.
Parliament:
Parliament is the Supreme Soviet, consisting of two chambers: the State Duma
and the Federal Assembly. The Assembly includes two members elected by each
republic and region and one from each autonomous district.
The Supreme Soviet amends the Constitution and adopts federal laws. It
approves, amends and supervises the execution of the state budget, and sets
federal taxes. It approves the President's nominations for chairmen, deputy
chairmen and members of the Government responsible for the economy, finance,
internal and foreign affairs, defence and security.
Legislation is submitted to the Duma, with approved legislation then passed
on to the Federal Assembly. The Assembly sends legislation within a week of
approval to the President, who has 14 days to sign it or return it to the
Supreme Soviet. If rejected legislation is then approved by a two-thirds
majority in both chambers, the President must sign it within a week.
The President:
The President is the head of state. The Vice-President carries out duties
assigned by the President. The President can be impeached for grave
violation of the Constitution in procedure triggered by a majority decision
of the Duma, with approval by the Constitutional Court, and confirmed by a
two-thirds majority in the Assembly.

PRESIDENTIAL DRAFT
Federalism:
Russia is a federal state, uniting subjects of the federation on the basis
of the Constitution and the Federation Treaty.
Social aims:
Pensions, social payments and aid in accord with economic capacity of
society must provide a living standard no lower than the subsistence level
defined by law.
Property rights:
Private property is an inviolable, natural human right. Citizens can hold
land and any other property obtained in accord with the law and dispose of
it as they wish. Owners are free to use and manage land and other natural
resources if this does not lead to waste of natural resouces and does not
violate the interests of local inhabitants.
Press freedom:
The press is free. Censorship is prohibited.
Parliament:
Parliament is the Federal Assembly consisting of two chambers: the State
Duma and the Federation Council. The Council includes two members from each
republic and region and additional Members (number unspecified) from
autonomous districts.
The Council nominates the Chairman of Government upon presentation of the
candidate/candidates by the President. The Council holds votes of confidence
in the Government.
The Duma is responsible for approving all federal legislation, passing on
the legislation for approval by the Council. If the Council fails to take a
decision within 10 days, the legislation becomes law. If the Council rejects
a Bill, the chambers set up a conciliation commission. If no agreement is
achieved, the Duma re-examines the legislation and can overrule a Council
veto by a two-thirds majority vote.
The President:
The President is the head of state and the highest official (there is no
Vice-President). In addition to presenting candidates for the Chairman of
Government, the President presents candidates for Chairman of the Central
Bank, judges for the highest courts and the Prosecutor-General. The
President appoints ministers proposed by the Chairman of the Government.
The President sets the dates for parliamentary elections and is able to
dissolve Parliament if it fails to take decisions necessary to form a
government and in cases when a political crisis cannot be overcome on the
basis of constitutional procedure.
The President can be impeached by the Council only on the basis of
accusation of treason, the intentional violation of the Constitution, or the
undermining of the state or of human rights and freedoms.

RUSSIA'S constitutional convention broke up yesterday without meeting
President Boris Yeltsin's deadline for finalising a new draft constitution,
a task which a conciliatory commission will now try to complete over the
next 10 days.
The 700 delegates, including heads of regional administrations and
parliaments, political parties, and different interest groups, are due to
reconvene on June 26. A statement adopted by a majority of delegates simply
confirmed that they supported the goal of a 'free, law-based, secular state
whose highest value was the individual, and his inalienable rights and
freedoms'.
The conciliatory commission of 60 representatives will try to iron out
differences among delegates over what changes should be made to President
Yeltsin's draft and what should be added to it from parliament's rival
draft.
In addition, under the direction of President Yeltsin's chief of staff, it
will seek to elaborate a mechanism for adopting the constitution if the
Congress of People's Deputies, or full parliament, fails to adopt it, as
well as rules for early elections to a new parliament provided for by a new
constitution.
'The convention is like a sword of Damocles hanging over the Congress,' said
Mr Kakha Bendukidze, a leading entrepreneur and delegate.
While falling short of its master's aims, the convention was at least
remarkable for what it did not give away - and that is Russian statehood.
In his haste to get a new constitution adopted against the wishes of the
Congress of People's Deputies, it had been feared that Mr Yeltsin would make
too many concessions to the Russian Federation's constituent republics.
In the event, the 20 republics, created by the Bolsheviks to give Russia's
ethnic minorities a semblance of statehood even though they account for just
18.5 per cent of the population, had every reason to be upset with
yesterday's closing statement.
Although it is not clear whether this was a tactical manoeuvre or a
hardening in Mr Yeltsin's stance towards the republics, the statement
dropped a reference to them as sovereign states, but the 66 regions, which
want at least equal rights to the republics in the economic sphere, as mere
'state formations'.
This prompted leaders of three of the biggest republics, Yakutia, Tatarstan,
and Karelia to threaten to stay away from the convention when it reconvenes
next week. In his closing speech, Mr Yeltsin warned the republics against
pressing for too much independence, saying this could lead to their own
break-up. It was a sign of his confidence that deputies would be less of a
problem than the republics that Mr Yeltsin simply taunted parliament for
talking of holding its own rival constitutional convention in July.
'Our work is going so swiftly that we will be finalising everything in
June,' President Yeltsin claimed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia yesterday met international mediators
in a fresh attempt to work out a peace settlement, which everyone now
recognises would entail substantial modifications to the Vance-Owen plan.
Lord Owen and his fellow mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former
Norwegian foreign minister, met the three leaders - Presidents Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia - in a villa near Geneva for their first face-to-face meeting since
the abortive peace plan agreed in Athens last month.
The meeting is unlikely to produce an immediate solution, despite the risk
of a new flare-up over the Serb-populated Krajina region of Croatia. At the
weekend Krajina Serbs are likely to vote in a referendum to join an
independent Bosnian Serb state. This risks triggering a Croatian military
offensive to prevent such a development, unless Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman
can agree their respective territorial ambitions. Mr Izetbegovic has refused
 -publicly, at least  - to envisage giving up any land allocated to the
Moslems by the Vance-Owen map. Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg, who has
replaced Mr Cyrus Vance as the United Nations mediator, have been forced to
admit that the original map dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10
semi-autonomous provinces is no longer realistic.
Apart from the new reality resulting from Serb conquests, the Vance-Owen
plan has been undermined by the joint action plan agreed by the US, Russia,
France, Britain and Spain in Washington last month, providing for the
creation of six UN-protected Moslem enclaves.
The Washington decision gave the impression that the main western countries
had accepted Serb territorial gains and would not insist on a roll-back of
Bosnian Serb forces to the Vance-Owen borders.
That does not mean that the mediators are yet prepared to accept the demands
of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who said before meeting Mr
Milosevic yesterday that he would like to see Bosnia divided into three
mini-states. Anxious to avoid accusations that they are prepared to reward
the Bosnian Serbs for their aggression, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg will
not want to go as far as that. While reluctantly accepting that their map
will have to be adjusted, they will insist that the Bosnian Serbs, who
occupy 70 per cent of Bosnia, should give up a significant proportion of
their territorial gains.
Thousands of people yesterday were on the move towards Vares, central
Bosnia, after the mostly Moslem Bosnian army seized control of nearby
Kajanj.
Sarajevo radio said Serbs intensified their shelling of Gorazde, the
south-eastern Moslem enclave proclaimed a UN safe area.
Unconfirmed reports said 17 people were killed in an overnight attack by
besieging Serb forces.
It accused the Serbs of sending in reinforcements and more heavy weaponry
despite a renewed ceasefire pledge by their commander, General Ratko Mladic.
Two teams of UN military observers last night were due to arrive in Gorazde
as part of the ceasefire agreement.

sector scrutiny

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by the European Commission to enforce higher disclosure standards
for state aid to public sector companies were set back yesterday by a
European Court of Justice ruling against the procedures Brussels had
followed to introduce the measure.
The Commission said yesterday it would be repackaging the measure, as it has
done after similar procedural slip-ups in the past.
The aim of the 1991 move was to uncover more of the illegal state aid which
member states were not notifying to Brussels. State-owned manufacturing
concerns with turnover in excess of Ecu250m (Pounds 197.5m) were required to
submit balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for examination,
including for 1989 and 1990, the two years preceding the change in the
rules.
Previously, state aids were notified by member states. But Sir Leon Brittan,
EC competition commissioner at the time, reckoned that the inadequate rigour
of the previous regime had let Ecu15bn in non-notified aid slip through the
net over the previous five years, only Ecu5bn of which had been uncovered.
Though the crackdown was controversial and strongly contested by France and
Italy, Brussels maintained this was an important distortion of competition.
Illegal state aid in the public sector was 10-times the flow of non-notified
public subsidy to private companies, the Commission maintained.
But after France challenged the measure, the Court in Luxembourg has found
fault with the way the Commission introduced the measure, via an October
1991 'communication' to the Council of Ministers of the 12.
The Commission yesterday said it would be reintroducing the measures by
seeking to amend the 1980 directive governing the financial relationship
between member states and government-owned companies.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Fiat admits Pounds 21m paid in kickbacks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, will tell shareholders it
spent over L48bn (Pounds 21m) on kickbacks to win contracts when its full
1992 accounts are published at the end of this month.
The admission, part of a trend among companies enmeshed in the corruption
scandal, represents a belated attempt to improve transparency for
shareholders and possibly sidestep legal action for falsifying company
accounts.
Fiat's balance sheet will show the vast majority of bribes were paid by its
construction subsidiaries. Fiat Impresit, the construction holding company,
and its Cogefar Impresit subsidiary show total payments since 1990 of
L15.9bn and L25.5bn respectively. In both cases, the bulk of the money
changed hands in 1990, when the parent company paid L12.7bn and Cogefar
Impresit over L15.3bn.
The payments disclosed by other parts of Fiat are much smaller. Most of the
money changed hands via foreign bank accounts, paid directly to political
parties or their middlemen. In many instances Fiat justifies the kickbacks
on the grounds that non-payment would have excluded the group from important
markets.

FT  17 JUN 93 / A viewer's guide to TV - for next four years: Andrew Hill
explains what the EC's wide-screen TV 'action plan' will mean for all those
who watch - as well as those who make - television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT has happened?
Telecommunications ministers have agreed to spend Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) of
the European Community budget over the next four years promoting wide-screen
television services in Europe, after Britain dropped its veto on the plan.
The funds will be available only to broadcasters and programme makers to
help them upgrade equipment, convert existing programmes into the new
wide-screen format, and produce new programmes. Funds will only be released
if industry or public institutions come up with matching investment.
Why is the deal important?
EC equipment manufacturers, satellite and cable TV operators, broadcasters,
programme producers and electronics retailers believe it should provide a
new product to energise the depressed consumer electronics market.
Politically, the deal represents the end of a year-long struggle to persuade
sceptical member states, in particular Britain, to accept that EC funding
for advanced television is justified.
The 'action plan' is supposed to lead to high-definition cinema-quality
television. Advocates, such as the French and Dutch governments and certain
European Commission departments, believe HDTV will be particularly suited to
films, sport and wildlife programmes.
Some sceptics, however, think that consumers will be satisfied with ordinary
or enhanced pictures on wide screens and the final, costly step will only be
taken some time next century, if at all.
But was not HDTV supposed to be the flagship of EC industry policy?
High hopes were pinned on HDTV. When the idea was launched in the mid-1980s
the EC tried to set exclusive satellite transmission standards in an attempt
to gain a lead over the US and Japan. But a combination of bad luck,
misjudgement and political disagreement meant satellite broadcasters were
able to begin transmissions using different, normal-definition standards.
The action plan - much amended over the last year - is now less a flagship
than a lifeboat for the original strategy.
How much has been spent so far on advanced television in Europe?
Difficult to say, because cash has come from the industry, national
governments and the EC. Recent studies suggest that at least Ecu625m was
spent on developing a European HDTV system between 1986 and 1992.
And what has been the result?
Mixed. Technically, equipment manufacturers - in particular Thomson Consumer
Electronics of France and Philips of the Netherlands - have come up with a
working HDTV system based on the original standards backed by the EC. But
there is no programming and, consequently, no mass market for such a system
because commercial broadcasters have taken a different path. However, the
action plan agreed yesterday is not tied to a particular technology.
So what about Europe beating the Japanese and Americans?
It is now more a case of 'if you can't beat them, join them'. The Japanese
already have a working HDTV system, but its development is hampered by the
high cost of sets - about Y1m (Pounds 6,000) apiece - and the scarcity and
blandness of the programming.
The US, meanwhile, has been running a contest for the best HDTV project
using different technology, known as digital. The main contenders in that
contest, including Philips and Thomson, are clubbing together to work on a
single US digital HDTV standard. This was one reason why Britain refused to
give its full support to the EC's plan based on existing analogue
technology.
What is so great about digital then?
Digital technology can be broadcast from terrestrial transmitters as well as
by satellite and cable, and it allows broadcasters to offer far more
services on the same channel than the analogue technology backed by the EC
and Japan.
Digital television does not have to be high-definition. Europe is already
preparing recommendations on digital standards, which will take into account
work in the US and which could be ready by the end of the year.
So what sort of television will European consumers be watching by the end of
the century?
Probably wide-screen, normal- or enhanced-definition pictures, perhaps
broadcast digitally. Wide-screen sets are already available in continental
Europe and were prominent at the television trade fair in Montreux last
week. But the technology to create large, lightweight, flat-screen
televisions is not yet ready for the market and the current sets are both
bulky and expensive. Do I really need these expensive new gadgets?
Probably not. But as advocates of wide-screen, cinema-quality television
point out, it took a while for colour movies to catch on.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Sparks fly as Lopez inflames Germans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLKSWAGEN fire brigade was out again yesterday, trying to douse another
brush fire sparked in Spain by the group's incendiary production director,
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
According to German press reports, Mr Lopez had described Germans as either
'square-heads' or 'concrete-heads' to an audience of more than 1,000 bankers
and business people in Madrid on Tuesday.
After a day's investigation and much dictionary-thumbing, VW officials
claimed to have divined that the Basque firebrand had referred in unscripted
remarks to German Hartnackigkeit, which means obstinacy or, more charitably,
persistence.
In terms which reportedly 'amazed' his audience, he said Germans had a
chance for future success only if they applied their methodical ways to
developing more creativity. Spanish people brimmed with creative flair. What
they lacked was the methodical German approach.
Mr Lopez, who left General Motors abruptly in March followed by a clutch of
his 'warrior' managers and legal actions alleging industrial espionage, also
claimed that in the next century there would be only three big carmakers in
Europe: one German, one Japanese and one Franco-Italian group.
The German survivor, Volkswagen, might take over its indigenous rivals in
the meantime.
The latest upset follows a series of events that could put Mr Lopez at odds
with his new employer. On Monday he contradicted clear statements from Mr
Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, on how the two men met.
Mr Piech said in a Financial Times interview he had been approached by Mr
Lopez shortly before Christmas. This was seen as an attempt to distance
himself from the controversy surrounding his new employee.
Mr Lopez said this week that they had been brought together by a components
supplier. This version was later confirmed by the group's chief spokesman.

FT  17 JUN 93 / UK agrees wide-screen TV plan for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday cleared the way for a four-year Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) plan
to promote wide-screen television services in the European Community.
The UK dropped its previous veto of the project at a meeting of EC
telecommunications ministers yesterday after more than a year of heated
political argument.
EC electronics manufacturers and retailers hope the subsidies included in
the plan, which will be available only to broadcasters and programme
producers, will encourage transmission of wide-screen programmes and
kick-start a lucrative market for wide-format television sets.
The deal could also lead to the development of cinema-quality,
high-definition television (HDTV) in Europe, possibly sharing elements of
the advanced digital television technology being developed by US companies
and European companies in the US.
Advocates of HDTV, including the European Commission and the French and
Dutch govern-ments, gave the deal a muted welcome, reflecting the fact that
the latest plan is a shadow of the five-year Ecu850m programme proposed by
Brussels in April last year.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the new UK junior trade minister, justified the
British decision on the grounds that funding had been extended from 3 1/2 to
four years.
He said the UK had also won guarantees that Japanese television
manufacturers based in Britain - such as Sony - are not excluded from future
HDTV research projects and standardisation discussions.
But the Commission said the additional clause would make no difference to
existing EC practice.
Last month, Mr Edward Leigh, Mr McLoughlin's predecessor, said that Britain
would not support a plan worth more than Ecu150m.
The EC could start disbursing funds in the second half of the year. Until
June 30 1997, Ecu160m will be made available to broadcasters and
programme-makers to help upgrade equipment to wide-screen technology,
convert existing programmes and produce programmes in the new format.
Industry or public institutions will have to match the EC funding.
A further Ecu68m will then be made available after January 1 1995, for those
smaller countries which have less well-developed audiovisual industries, and
that sum will have to be matched by Ecu17m from other sources.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Gooda Walker Names face fresh Pounds 157m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES in the insur-ance market's worst-affected syndicates, which
have already reported losses of more than Pounds 900m, learned yesterday
they must pay Pounds 157m of that amount by the end of next month.
The 4,500 Gooda Walker Names - the individuals whose assets support the
Lloyd's of London insurance market - will be asked to pay an average of
Pounds 35,000.
GW Run Off, the agency supervising the affairs of seven stricken syndicates,
reported combined losses for 1989, 1990, and some earlier years of Pounds
900m, a slight fall from an earlier estimate of Pounds 924m.
However, Mr Ken Randall, a director of GW Run Off, who is investigating the
syndicates, expects the total loss to rise to more than Pounds 1bn, about a
sixth of Lloyd's total losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the last five
years.
Lloyd's will report record 1990 losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds
2.8bn next week.
The Serious Fraud Office reaffirmed yesterday that it was considering a
report by Mr Randall into the Gooda Walker syndicates submitted to it in
April. The SFO insisted, however, that its 'vetting' of the report 'is
certainly not an investigation'.
The Randall report alleges that Gooda Walker syndicates artificially
inflated their profits during the 1980s through the improper use of 'time
and distance' (T&amp;D) policies - reinsurance policies that allow Lloyd's
syndicates to manage their reserves against so-called long-tail claims more
effectively. Long-tail claims are those that emerge many years after the
inception of policies.
Both Mr Randall and Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action
Group, which is organising legal action on behalf of 2,000 Names, said they
had been approached by the SFO for information. Mr Randall said: 'They have
been making inquiries and we are now getting supplementaries.'
Mr Deeny said it 'is absolutely scandalous for Lloyd's to try to extract
Pounds 157m from ruined Names in a case under serious examination by the
SFO. This further demand is intolerable'.
He added: 'We were lured on to these syndicates by invented profit figures
created by the use of these T&amp;Ds. Lloyd's itself encourages the use of these
dangerously misleading financial instruments.'
Describing the result as 'truly awful', Mr Randall said: 'We expect the
claims and reinsurance recoveries to go and we've tried to match the calls -
we've deferred everything we possibly can.' The fresh cash call includes
Pounds 30m for losses which were incurred in 1991.
Payment of a further Pounds 145m has been deferred. Already Names have been
asked to pay Pounds 553m, of which some Pounds 73m is still outstanding.
An estimated Pounds 100m had been paid by the Lloyd's central fund, which
meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations, Mr Randall
said.
Members of one or more of the Gooda Walker syndicates include: 15 peers;
three QCs; Mr Paul Marland, the Conservative MP; Sir Antony Richard
Pilkington, the chairman of Pilkington, the glassmaker; and Sir Leslie
Porter, the former chairman of Tesco.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Goldman fined over Maxwell share deals: US bank negotiates
Pounds 160,000 settlement with securities body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN SACHS, the blue-chip US-based investment bank that dealt extensively
with companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, has been fined Pounds
160,000 by regulators for breaches of UK securities rules, and ordered to
pay an estimated Pounds 125,000 in costs.
This follows the fines imposed two weeks ago on Invesco MIM, the fund
manager, by Imro, the industry overseer, for irregularities in the
management of Maxwell pension funds.
Yesterday's fine on Goldman by the Securities and Futures Authority, the
self-regulatory body for the brokerage industry, is the first official
censure of Goldman Sachs' activities in relation to Mr Maxwell and the
largest fine ever imposed on a firm by the SFA.
The charges relate to share deals the SFA describes as 'free payments' to
Maxwell companies. The payments occurred during a time when it is now known
that Mr Maxwell's companies were frantically trying to raise cash.
The SFA said that its review did not conclude that 'Goldman Sachs or any of
its personnel participated in any illicit conduct with, or were aware of
illicit conduct by, Maxwell or any entity controlled by or associated with
him'.
Yesterday's fine does not rule out further actions against the investment
bank by the SFA or any other bodies.
Goldman Sachs was a party in transactions that have been the subject of
investigations by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange
and the Serious Fraud Office.
Goldman Sachs had asked that findings should not go to a tribunal as is
normal when rule breaches are uncovered. Instead, it sought a negotiated
settlement with regulators that resulted in the public announcement and
fine. It is understood that some findings have been sent to the US
Securities and Exchange Commission for review.
The rule breaches relate to three transactions, two of which were purchases
of roughly Pounds 24m in securities from Maxwell-controlled fund management
companies that invested assets on behalf of pension scheme members. The
third entity was Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a company at the heart of Mr
Maxwell's private interests. The company sold an estimated Pounds 25m in
securities to Goldman Sachs just months before Mr Maxwell's death.
The SFA said it concluded that in those three transactions, Goldman Sachs
had paid for, but failed to receive, all the shares involved. In effect, the
SFA said, Goldman Sachs made 'free payments' to Maxwell entities and failed
to tell regulators about the effect on its capital position.
Yesterday, Goldman Sachs emphasised that regulators had not concluded that
it engaged in or knew of any illicit conduct and sought to describe its rule
breaches as technical in nature. Mr Greg Palm, joint chief counsel, said
they occurred because information about the free payments 'was not
effectively combined with knowledge of the regulatory capital effect of such
a payment, giving rise to the computational and financial reporting errors'.

FT  17 JUN 93 / Government climbs down on tax relief for oil companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday bowed to pressure from Tory backbench MPs over
proposed changes to North Sea oil taxes, extending short-term help for
companies worst affected by the changes.
Although the Treasury said no new government spending would be involved, the
change means that companies will find it easier to claim the Pounds 200m in
aid which was earmarked - with tight restrictions - in the March Budget.
But the amendments proposed by the Treasury may not go far enough to stem a
backbench rebellion and the government may be forced to make further
concessions.
Mr John Butterfill, one of the leading Tory campaigners against the original
Budget proposal, called the concession a very small move in the right
direction. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury
committee of MPs, welcomed the move but said he hoped the government could
be persuaded to move a bit further.
The proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes announced in the Budget
caused a furore among many smaller companies in the oil industry because
they abolished relief for exploration work. Companies said it would lead to
a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 30,000 jobs.
But larger companies such as British Petroleum welcomed the proposed
reduction in the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per
cent.
The Treasury yesterday admitted its original Budget proposals had made it
too difficult for companies to claim transitional help to cushion them from
the initial effects of the tax changes.
In yesterday's amendment, the government said it would allow companies to
claim up to Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work
that will be affected by the abolition of tax relief.
Mr Butterfill said he and others would press for the relief to be extended
until 1996. 'It's a helpful step but far too modest,' he said yesterday. 'It
will help one or two companies but it won't solve the fundamental problem.'
Companies will be able to claim interim relief on wells they had committed
to drill as part of obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry
in order to win licences to explore in the North Sea.
The DTI was understood to be pushing the Treasury to loosen its restrictions
on transitional aid. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said this week that
applications for seven blocks in the latest oil licensing round had been
withdrawn as a result of the PRT changes and that some companies had scaled
back the number of wells they planned to drill.
Backbenchers are likely to discuss the change with the oil companies before
deciding how much further to press the government.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Business Post founders paid Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business Post, the express parcel and mail business coming to the market
later this month, yesterday revealed that Pounds 1.28m was paid to the Kane
Brothers, who founded the company, in 1992.
Mr Peter and Michael Kane, chairman and managing director respectively,
received the money in the form of discretionary bonuses and contributions to
their pension funds.
When the exceptional non-recurring directors remuneration is excluded from
pre-tax profits for 1992, the group made Pounds 2.9m which rose to Pounds
4.2m for the year ended March 1993. Sales rose by Pounds 23.8m to Pounds
33.7m.
The pathfinder prospectus also shows that Peter and Michael Kane are on an
annual salary of Pounds 105,000 and Pounds 95,000 respectively.
Both are entitled to annual bonuses determined by the board.
Business Post was formed in 1971 by Mr Peter Kane, who along with family
trusts, owns 85 per cent. He was joined three years later by his brother Mr
Michael Kane, who owns the remaining 15 per cent.
The float is expected to capitalise it at more than Pounds 50m.

FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Royal Ins placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Royal Insurance declined 5 to 283p after the rump of the recent
rights issue was placed by SG Warburg and Hoare Govett.
With an 87.2 per cent take-up of the issue reported, the outstanding 20.7m
shares were successfully placed with institutions at 281p. The impact of the
placing, along with general profit-taking, caused a retreat in the rest of
the sector. General Accident eased 7 to 576p, Commercial Union lost 8 to
589p, Sun Alliance closed 4 lighter at 357p and Legal &amp; General relinquished
6 to 460p.
Banking group Standard Chartered was the strong feature in banks after a
recommendation from SG Warburg sent the shares 15 ahead to 769p. Trading
was, however, thin.
The recommendation came after Monday's meeting with several analysts and
helped boost the stock that has underperformed the rest of the sector in
recent weeks. The rest of the banking group traded easier with the market.
Lloyds slipped 4 to 570p.
Another decline in crude oil prices continued to unsettle an oil sector
already weakened by the uneasy peace agreed at last week's Opec meeting in
Geneva. BP attracted a fresh wave of US sellers and settled 2 1/2 off at 307
1/2 p on turnover of 6.2m shares. Shell, in spite of the encouraging noises
from Monday's investment presentation, eased to 624p. Enterprise Oil dropped
9 more to 465p.
There was more downside pressure exerted on Zeneca, where the Pounds 1.3bn
rights issue closes next Monday. But dealers continue to take the view that
the issue is safe. 'It is a question of holding your nerve and waiting for
the reward,' was the view of one market optimist. Zeneca 'old' settled 1 1/2
off at 615 1/2 p on turnover of 3.7m, and the 'new' nil-paid eased a penny
to 16p with a hefty 8.2m shares traded. ICI, where the recent US buying
support has dried up, softened a penny to 706p.
Fisons extended its recent strong showing, the shares moving up strongly to
close a further 6 1/2 ahead at 168p on heavy turnover of 5.5m.
Guinness finished the day 8 lower at 485p as the acceptance was announced of
a management buyout at the South Wales-based Crown Brewery. Volume was
modest at 1.6m. Elsewhere, other large brewers suffered knocks, Bass losing
3 to 475p, Allied-Lyons giving up 6 to 539p and Grand Metropolitan dipping 6
to 413p.
Increased talk of takeovers stalked broadcasting shares, moving Anglia
Television up 12 to 329p, Central Independent ahead 7 to 1925p and Scottish
Television up 3 to 486p.
Reaction to its annual meeting statement pushed down Ladbroke by 6 1/2 to
171 1/2 p in turnover of 9.6m shares. One analyst said that the statement
was 'a shade disappointing' although he did not see any deep-rooted problems
with the leisure group, while another maintained that the shares had been
overpriced and were now beginning to find their level.
Ladbroke is a large player in the DIY aggressive pricing battle and its
statement revealed that its Texas Homecare chain had fallen short of trade
hopes so far this year.
Airtours moved forward 2 to 325p while Thorn EMI fell back 7 to 880p. David
Lloyd Leisure, which was floated in March in an issue that was seven times
oversubscribed, was bouyed by good results and advanced 13 to 191p.
After the High Court's refusal to sanction Mr Terry Venables' reinstatement
as chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, the share price lost another penny
to 87p. It marks a slide of 7 in the stock, which is USM quoted, since the
boardroom battle between Mr Venables and Mr Alan Sugar resumed at the court
last week.
Confirmation by Coats Viyella that it has increased its holding in its
Indian subsidiary from 39.9 per cent to 51 per cent pushed up its share
price 4 to 230p in a volume of 1.6m. The Indian government granted
permission for the stake increase in the subsidiary, which is renamed Coats
Viyella India.
Courtaulds managed to close only a penny easier at 539p on a volume of 1.3m.
Among engineers and aerospace issues, continued profit-taking left British
Aerospace 7 down at 393p. Smiths Industries shed 3 to 357p following the
completion of a big buying order on Monday. Vickers put on 4 at 140p,
powered by a recommendation from SG Warburg. The 84 per cent jump in profits
at FKI had already been discounted by the market following the stock's
strong performance for most of this year. The shares eased 3 1/2 to 138p.
A talk-to-the-investors session and positive comments from NatWest
Securities enabled Unilever to push up 4 to 1048p with 2.6m shares traded.
Share price buoyancy of the company, which is optimistic about its growth in
East Asia, followed a strong showing on the previous day which had been
triggered by a similar presentation in Amsterdam last Friday.
Other gainers in food included Dalgety, which moved up 6 to 456p, albeit in
thin trading; United Biscuits, 2 firmer at 391p; and Unigate, which added 2
at 352p. A food analyst said investors were making tentative moves back to
the sector. But the picture was patchy - Cadbury-Schweppes lost 2 to 463p in
a volume of 1.7m; Tate &amp; Lyle moved down 2 to 384p; J. Sainsbury lost 2 to
484p in a small volume; and Tesco gave up 2 to finish at 217p on 2.9m
traded.
Volex was one of the best performers in the electricals/electronics areas of
the market, the shares racing up 18 to 405p after the doubled profits. News
that Quality Software, recently launched on the market, had won its first
order for its Universal Olas systems triggered a surge of buying interest in
the company's shares, which closed 32 higher at 558p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA will start design-in development with Ford Motor's automotive
development group in a deal which could lead to the Japanese car group using
Ford components in its cars for the first time, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in
Tokyo.
Through the design-in development agreement, Toyota will be studying whether
Ford's cruise control system might be appropriate for use in its own cars,
Toyota said.
The Japanese company already buys components such as shock absorbers and
radiators from General Motors, for use in its cars manufactured both in the
US and Japan.
Toyota cited the need to co-operate with foreign companies and to study what
components could be bought from foreign companies as an important factor
behind its decision. Toyota currently uses cruise control systems developed
in Japan by its main Japanese components suppliers such as Nippon Denso.
Growing trade friction with the US, however, has forced Japanese carmakers
to consider buying more components from US manufacturers.

Nissan - The Japanese carmaker's president talks to William Dawkins and
Michiyo Nakamoto

<TEXT>
NISSAN recently aroused a stir when it became the first Japanese carmaker
since the second world war to announce a plant closure.
The pain, while mild by the standards of the wholesale job cuts experienced
by the US and European car industries, is not yet over, it was revealed
yesterday.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said his restructuring plan had not
taken account of the blow to export earnings dealt by the yen's unexpectedly
steep rise.
This was the first time that the yen had appreciated significantly against
both the dollar and the D-Mark, hitting Nissan's price competitiveness in
both the US and Europe, its main export markets, he explained.
Nissan's options included price rises and another round of cost-cutting,
although there was no definite plan yet, he said.
This comes after a year in which Nissan made its first loss as a listed
company and had to announce the shut-down of the Zama car assembly plant
near Tokyo, the main part of a plan to shed 5,000 jobs out of Nissan's
53,000 Japanese workforce over the next three years.
The company will not make any redundancies but will rely on natural wastage,
yet the need to shrink the business is a heavy blow to the pride of Japan's
second largest car and truck group.
Nissan's workforce might already seem lean by European car industry
standards, a reflection of the fact that Japanese carmakers sub-contract
more components to outside suppliers than do European manufacturers.
Nissan reckons that subcontracted components represent 70 per cent of its
manufacturing costs, as against the 60 per cent or so claimed by French car
makers.
Even so, Mr Tsuji warned that he might have to wield the knife again.
Nissan had cut costs in previous downturns, 'but then we tended to put on
more weight, more fat than before' when a recovery materialised, he said.
This time, Nissan would need to stay smaller, said Mr Tsuji, a man of
gravity whose engineering background is said to have earned him the respect
of Nissan manufacturing staff at the sharp end of the job cuts.
The closure of Zama would not have a big impact on Nissan's financial
position, Mr Tsuji says. But clearly Nissan believes the move was essential
to adjusting to what it fears is a long-term market decline.
'Until now we could always expect an increase in demand and we set our
production capacity accordingly. But we can no longer expect demand to meet
the 2.5m units per year capacity Nissan has.' The three-year plan aims to
slim capacity to 2.3m units annually.
The Japanese car market looked set for a recovery in the next six months or
so, but Mr Tsuji saw no sign of an upturn in Europe, where Nissan sales
volumes fell 10.4 per cent in the first five months of the year in a market
down 17.3 per cent.
Asked about the outlook for his Japanese competitors, Mr Tsuji said that the
11 car and truck makers could all survive on condition that they did not
poach each other's market specialities.
This contrasts with a widespread view in Japan that the nation's car
industry will need deep restructuring.
The other cloud on the Japanese car industry's horizon is the growing trade
friction with the US and the European Community.
Tensions with the Clinton administration posed more of a problem than did
the EC's fresh bout of anxiety over Japanese car imports and local
production, Mr Tsuji said.
Local content for Japanese carmakers was lower in the US than in Europe and
Mr Tsuji recognised the need to increase that content in the face of the
tensions.
Here, it was a strength for Nissan to have a Mexican plant which exported
engines and transmissions to Nissan's car assembly plant in Tennessee.
Vehicle demand in Latin America was so strong that Mr Tsuji saw no room for
Nissan Mexico to export vehicles to the US.
The European Commission's attempts to reduce Japanese car export quotas to
the Community and to count Nissan UK's production in the quotas were 'unfair
and unreasonable,' he said.
The pressure for tighter quotas, mainly exerted by France and Italy, was a
response to the much steeper fall in European car demand than had been
anticipated in the 1991 Japanese car imports accord.
However, Nissan had no intention of changing its UK business plans in the
light of all this. 'We should be regarded as a fully-fledged member of the
EC,' Mr Tsuji said.
Like other Japanese car-makers, Nissan was studying the fast-growing Chinese
market. But Mr Tsuji was cautious about Nissan's ambitions there. 'We still
do not know how aggressive we should be in the Chinese market. The future of
China is still uncertain,' he said.
Clearly, Nissan will think hard before embarking again on the breakneck
expansion of the past. Mr Tsuji does not deny that the Japanese group is at
an important watershed.

KEMPER, the Chicago-based insurance and financial services company,
yesterday said its beleaguered Kemper Securities brokerage unit was no
longer for sale after it failed to receive an adequate offer for it.
'The offers simply didn't reflect the value inherent in this company and its
long-term prospects,' said Mr Stephen Timbers, Kemper's chief operating
officer.
Kemper Securities has long been considered a thorn in its parent's side.
Although the unit's performance improved in the 1993 first quarter, it has
lost more than Dollars 200m since 1982, with a deficit last year of Dollars
38.4m when many other brokerage houses posted record profits.
On May 27, Kemper said it was reviewing several expressions of interest from
parties considering acquiring Kemper Securities.
Kemper did not reveal specific plans for the securities division, but said
it would make a significant commitment to the business and added that it
would position the business to allows its management 'to demonstrate better
the operating performance of the unit'.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak to spin off
chemicals business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographics products company, yesterday announced
plans to spin off its Eastman chemicals business by the end of 1993 as a
separate, publicly-quoted company with some Dollars 4bn in annual sales.
The move follows shareholder pressure for Kodak to improve its lacklustre
financial performance, and comes a month after Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman,
said the group would make a large asset divestiture this year.
He said yesterday the spin-off was one element of a plan for Kodak which the
company would unveil fully in September.
The spin-off will take the form of a pro-rata distribution to Kodak
shareholders of stock in the independent business, which will be called
Eastman Chemical Company and will seek a listing on the New York stock
exchange. Kodak will retain no equity.
Eastman, founded in 1920 to supply chemicals to Kodak's photographic
operations, has grown into the 10th largest US chemicals company, ranked by
revenues, with sales to Kodak making up less than 8 per cent of the total.
It makes about 400 industrial and specialty products and has particularly
strong positions in PET plastic bottle resins and filters for the tobacco
industry. Earnings from operations last year totalled Dollars 494m.
Wall Street analysts have long urged Kodak to dispose of Eastman, which
accounts for about 20 per cent of group revenues, to allow Kodak to
concentrate on its core photographic operations and other consumer-focused
businesses.
Mr Whitmore said the spin-off would create two stronger companies, with the
management of each focusing more intently on its businesses.
Kodak shares, which rose on Monday in anticipation of yesterday's
announcement, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 at the close of the New
York stock exchange.
Spin-offs have become particularly popular over the past two years among
restructuring US companies. Mr Whitmore said Kodak had chosen the method
rather than a sale to an industrial buyer because the chemicals cycle was in
a down phase and this would allow Eastman shareholders to participate in any
upturn.
The deal will remove some Dollars 2bn of debt from Kodak's balance sheet,
but Mr Whitmore said this would not change the group's debt to capital
ratio. Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said it had
placed Kodak's Dollars 7bn of long-term debt under review for a possible
upgrade.
Mr Whitmore said that the company was reviewing its non-photographic
businesses for operational changes, spin-offs, sales and closures.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mandatory Pounds 87m bid for Watts Blake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATTS BLAKE Bearne, a 280-year business based in Devon and the world's
biggest supplier of ball clay, received yesterday a 420p a share bid from
Sibelco, a Belgian producer of silica sand for the glass industry, which
values the British group at Pounds 87m.
The company rejected the offer saying it 'represents a wholly inadequate
premium for control.' The board urged shareholders to sell no shares in the
market and wait for a circular explaining in detail its opposition.
Watts Blake shares failed to rise above the offer price, and later fell back
to 415p, a net gain of 24p. There is a loan note alternative on the basis of
Pounds 21 for every five shares. The notes carry interest at 4.75 per cent
and are redeemable at par in September 1994.
The bid was sparked by a decision earlier this year by Ceramics Holdings,
controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, to dispose of its 15.6 per cent
stake.
This triggered a concert party agreement under which Sibelco and Quarzwerke
of Germany, each owning 14.8 per cent, were also required to put their
stakes up for sale. The agreement also provided a formula allowing the
partners to buy each other out.
The combined offer for sale lapsed last month leaving Sibelco free to launch
its own bid yesterday.
Sibelco said it has arranged to buy the stakes of Ceramics and Quarzwerke.
This would take its holding to 45.2 per cent, leaving it only 4.9 per cent
short of winning majority control.
It said the Stock Exchange requirement to make an offer once the holding had
gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for the bid, rather than a desire to
take over over the company. Sibelco had always held the current management
of Watts Blake in high regard, it added.
'The purchase of the Ceramics stake really was a tidy up operation. Rather
than have the stake overhang the market, we decided to buy it.'
An adviser to Sibelco said it would be happy to end up owning 'any
percentage from 45 to 100' of Watts Blake's shares.
Ceramics is thought to need new funds to support its other business
interests; it has unconditionally agreed to sell its shares to Sibelco at
the offer price.
Quarzwerke, a private company producing silica sand, has also agreed to sell
its shares 'subject to Sibelco's ability to purchase shares under the City
Code.'

WATTS BLAKE Bearne, a 280-year business based in Devon and the world's
biggest supplier of ball clay, is in danger of losing its independence
following the launch yesterday of a Pounds 87m bid.
Sibelco, a privately owned producer of silica sand for the glass industry
based in Belgium, is bidding 420p cash per share for the British group.
The offer failed to win unqualified approval from the City. 'This is a
quality company with a unique product and unique assets. The price does not
reflect the true long-term potential of the group,' said Mr Ian Hilliker, an
analyst with NatWest Securities.
Watts Blake shares, however, failed to rise above the offer price, and later
fell back to 415p, a net gain of 24p.
There is a loan note alternative on the basis of Pounds 21 for every five
shares. The notes carry interest at 4.75 per cent and are redeemable at par
in September 1994.
The bid was sparked by a decision earlier this year by Ceramics Holdings,
controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, to dispose of its 15.6 per cent
stake.
This triggered a concert party agreement under which Sibelco and Quarzwerke
of Germany, each owning 14.8 per cent, were also required to put their

Sibelco said yesterday it has arranged to buy the stakes of Ceramics and
Quarzwerke. This would take its holding to 45.2 per cent, leaving it only
4.9 per cent short of winning majority control.
It said the Stock Exchange requirement to make an offer once the holding had
gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for the bid, rather than a desire to
take over over the company.
'The purchase of the Ceramics stake really was a tidy up operation. Rather
than have the stake overhang the market, we decided to buy it.
Sibelco intimated that it was still 'early days' to say what it would do
with Watts Blake if it acquired control. However, it had always held the
current management of Watts Blake in high regard.
Heavy sticky ball clay, which once produced tobacco pipes, is used worldwide
to manufacture ceramics such as sanitary ware, wall and floor tiles and
table ware. The largest deposit in the world, found in Bovey Basin near
Newton Abbot in Devon, has been mined by the company since 1710.
Watts Blake also owns extensive clay reserves in Germany and in the US where
in 1989 it bought United Clays, the second biggest ball clay producer in
that country.
The company generates 85 per cent of its sales outside the UK, and estimates
that it provides clay for 40 per cent of the European sanitary ware market,
a third of the US market and half of the Far East market. It also claims to
supply a quarter of the European and US floor tile market.
Ceramics is thought to need new funds to support its other business
interests; it has unconditionally agreed to sell its shares to Sibelco at
the offer price.
Quarzwerke, a private company producing silica sand, has also agreed to sell
its shares 'subject to Sibelco's ability to purchase shares under the City
Code.'
The concert party agreement, negotiated in 1990, arose after Sibelco and
Quarzwerke acquired the 21 per cent holding in Watts Blake previously held
by English China Clay. They subsequently increased their stake when Ceramics
sold part of its holdings to the continental European companies.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: FKI advances to Pounds 38.1m - Workforce
falls by 1,000 and another 800 to go this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI, the electrical engineering group which has seen its shares nearly
triple in value in the last 18 months, confirmed that it was making progress
in focusing the business.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 38.1m in the year to
March 31, although the increase was flattered by the adoption of FRS 3,
which moved Pounds 9m of extraordinary charges above the line.
Turnover rose from Pounds 739.1m to Pounds 756.1m and earnings per share
increased to 6.2p (2.65p). Before FRS 3, the previous year's figure was
4.88p, so underlying earnings growth was 27 per cent. A final dividend of
1.8p gives a total of 3p (2.3p), up 30 per cent.
The profits were struck after Pounds 5.4m of reorganisation costs. The
workforce was reduced by 1,000 to 11,800 and is likely to fall to about
11,000 in the current year, during which which a similar level of
reorganisation costs will be incurred.
Mr Jeff Whalley, chairman, said: 'These are excellent results achieved
against a background of continuing tough market conditions in our main
markets in the UK and North America and reflect solid progress in improving
profitability and restructuring the businesses. I look forward to the future
with confidence.'
FKI has sold half of the Pounds 40m of assets it last year identified as
non-core. Considerable progress has been made in improving profitability
across the group, with operating margins on continuing activities up from
4.5 to 5.9 per cent.
Four of FKI's five trading groups - material handling, hardware, automotive
and engineering - improved results, with automotive returning to the black.
The exception was process control, which saw operating profits fall from
Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 5.2m. More than a third of the total reorganisation
expenditure was directed at process control.
Strong operating cashflow helped gearing fall from 27 to 24 per cent.
COMMENT
So far, so good. Mr Bob Beeston, who was brought in from BTR at the
beginning of last year as managing director, has been rewarded with the post
of chief executive for his success in slashing costs and pricing more
aggressively. Unfortunately, the three groups with most potential -
hardware, materials handling and automotive - are all mainly in the US, so
FKI may be tempted to go for a significant business in the UK. Analysts
would welcome bolt-on acquisitions to exploit excess automotive capacity.
However, they would be less keen on a large paper-funded acquisition.
Forecast earnings of about Pounds 50m put the shares, down 3 1/2 p to 138p,
on a prospective multiple of 17. FKI's confidence in the scope for enhancing
margins to more than 10 per cent bodes well for the long term. But after
such a good run, the shares may mark time until acquisition intentions
become clearer.

MOVENPICK, the Swiss hotel and restaurant chain, yesterday said that Mr

to claims of up to SFr5m (Dollars 3.4m).
The directors said they have over a dozen cases involving staff appointments
and dismissals and other alleged violations of company law committed by Mr
vom Hagen that could lead to claims. The statement alleged that Mr vom Hagen
had given orders to external consultants without the knowledge of the
management board, leading to charges of about SFr30,000 per working day in
1992 but no results.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Italian regional banks link up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Italy's biggest regional banks have agreed to take small equity
stakes in each other in what could be the first step towards the creation of
a private sector financial group.
Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based bank in which Mr Carlo De Benedetti's
Cir group is one of the most important shareholders, is to buy about 10 per
cent of Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna, the city's savings bank. In return,
CRB will buy up to 5 per cent of Credito Romagnolo.
Both sides have indicated the swap promises to be the prelude to a gradual
integration of financial services in one of Italy's industrial heartlands.
The two banks specialise in retail services and lending to small and
medium-sized businesses, which form the economic backbone of the Emilia
Romagna region.
'The agreement is the first step towards the creation of a big Bologna
bank,' said Mr Gianguido Sacchi Morsiani, chairman of the savings bank. To
launch their co-operation, the two banks will rationalise duplicated
operations in some financial services and study setting up joint ventures in
others.
Credito Romagnolo, in which France's Banque Nationale de Paris has over 6
per cent, has about 350 branches and deposits of L46,000bn (Dollars 31bn).
CRB has 110 branches and deposits of L11,500bn.

ROMANIA will have to amend its 1993-1994 budget and make further spending
cuts before a new stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund
can be signed, Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister, said in an
interview yesterday.
The delay in signing a new IMF agreement to replace the previous one, which
expired in March, is holding up some Dollars 3bn in foreign credits.
Mr Negritoiu, who has responsibility for economic reform, said the IMF put
the 1993 budget deficit at 5 to 6 per cent of GDP, rather than the 4 per
cent projected in the budget approved in April.
He said that if parliament accepted the amendment before the summer recess,
a new agreement could be negotiated by July.
A nationwide train drivers' strike severely disrupted services for the
second day running yesterday.
SNCFR, the railway administration, declared the strike illegal and pledged
to take action against union leaders. Under Romanian regulations, one-third
of services must be maintained even during a general strike.
The train drivers' union called its 32,000 members out on strike on Monday,
demanding a 40 per cent pay rise rather than the 16 per cent offered by the
government.

PRIORITIES in disbursing EC structural funds in Ireland need to be changed
significantly, says a a report published yesterday by the Dublin-based
Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).
The report, commissioned by the Irish government's Department of Finance,
recommends more resources be directed at training early school-leavers and
the long-term unemployed. It says the emphasis of rural development funds
should be shifted from extensive grazing to forestry and industrial policy
should give greater emphasis to supporting medium-sized Irish-owned
companies than to foreign investment.
The recommendations are likely to have a significant influence on the
government, and on EC budget controllers, as the former draws up its
spending plans for an estimated IPounds 8bn (Dollars 12bn) that is expected
to be available to Ireland in EC structural and cohesion funds between now
and the end of the decade.
The report notes that the inflow of EC structural funds to Ireland over the
past two years was equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GNP.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (16): Falling
prices attract new users - Value-added services / The fax market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, the fax machine is as much a part of office life as the old Remington
typewriter once was. Prices have fallen fast and models are available for
less than Pounds 400. This is starting to attract new users who want a
machine at home either because they do some of their work there, or because
it is a cheaper and more convenient way of communicating with relatives
overseas.
The Swedish paper and pulp association estimates that fax machines will
multiply from 5m worldwide in 1989 to nearly 16m this year and will reach
27m by 1995. A survey published in April by market researchers Gallup and
Pitney Bowes Facsimile Systems shows that fax traffic is increasing at an
astonishing rate in the UK - a rise of 133 per cent in the number of faxes
sent and a 38 per cent rise in the number of documents received by
respondents.
Meredith Fischer of Pitney Bowes says: 'At these volumes, companies should
be taking control of their fax networks and forming specific policies.' She
believes there are huge sums to be saved.
Companies can save money by:
Using plain paper fax machines. These cut costs because they don't require
expensive thermal paper. Plain paper is almost half the price - about 1.6
pence a sheet compared with three pence for thermal. In addition, plain
paper faxes don't need to be photocopied because they don't fade. Fischer
estimates that it costs 60 pence to copy each document including secretarial
time and paper.
Plain paper fax machines do cost more to buy - anything between Pounds 1,000
and Pounds 5,000. But the potential benefits are encouraging a lot of
companies to trade up. According to the British Facsimile Industry
Consultative Committee (BFICC), about half the fax machines sold in the UK
are replacement machines and most of these are plain paper faxes.
There are two kinds of plain paper fax. Those which use ink-bubblejet
technology (this gives near-laser-quality output) starting at Pounds 1,000
and those which use laser-light-emitting-diode (LED) technology starting at
Pounds 1,500. The main players in the ink-bubblejet market are Canon and
Panasonic. But most other suppliers, including Sharp, Panasonic, NEC, Canon
Matsushita, Ricoh and Toshiba, sell laser or LED plain-paper machines. The
market is very competitive and prices are likely to fall further.
Buying faster machines. Facsimile machines with transmission speeds of up to
14.4 kilobits per second (kbps) are available from Pounds 1,500. They can
provide considerable savings on telephone charges over standard machines
which operate at 9.6 or 7.2 kbps.
Using a 14.4 kbps fax working to the Group 3 industry standard, a short
letter will take six seconds to send as opposed to 20 seconds on the average
Group 3 fax. The improvement in speed has been made possible by a new CCITT
standard (MMR) for compressing data, which takes away all redundant
information.
Routing fax traffic to data lines. Faxes normally send information in
analogue form (like the human voice). But it is possible to convert Group 3
fax data into a digital format which can then be sent over the company data
network. For example, NEC, the Japanese electronics company and fax
supplier, sends fax data over its worldwide data network.
There is no incremental cost for doing this because the network is already
in existence.
According to Mr Lester Davis, chairman of BFICC and product manager for
telecoms products at NEC: 'One problem in this area is the lack of standards
for converting fax signals from analogue to digital. However, the CCITT
recently ratified a version of the Group 3 standard - Group 3 bis - which
will work over the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).'
Fax machines which support Group 3 bis should start to appear next year.
They will be able to send data to similar machines at 64 kilobits a second,
cutting transmission costs, or transmit to standard Group 3 faxes at lower
speeds.
Using advanced features. Top-of-the-range fax machines offer a lot of
advanced features, many of which can help to cut costs. For example, some
machines have the ability to send non-urgent faxes overnight.
Of these, a number allow batch transmission of over-night faxes. They group
together all faxes going to the same number and send them at the same time.
This can cut costs substantially because the 'handshake' part of the call,
in which a fax machine identifies itself to another, only needs to be
carried out once.
Cutting down on queueing. Many highly-paid executives waste valuable time
hanging around at the fax machine waiting to send messages. Mercury has
estimated that sending an average of 6,000 faxes a week will cost a company
more than Pounds 100,000 a year in staff time alone.
Waiting time can be reduced in a number of ways, for example by giving users
low-cost desk-top fax machines or by subscribing to third-party services
such as BT's Featurefax or Mercury's Surefax, which re-send faxes or fax
many destinations for users.
Some high-end fax machines also allow users to scan a document into memory,
type in the recipient's fax number, and then leave the machine to do the
rest.
Another way of reducing the fax queue is to equip stand-alone personal
computers (PCs) or PC networks with technology which enables them to send
documents straight into the fax network.
For example, the BBC's news and current affairs department has installed a
Xerox Lan-Fax Express 21 (a combination of hardware and software) to connect
all 20 of the department's PC network users to a single fax machine. This
enables them to create, send, receive and view faxes without having to leave
their desks.
There are a host of products for computer-fax ranging from plug-in fax cards
(which can be cheaper than fax machines), to fax modems and servers. Some
can be used to centralise management of faxes and improve cost control.
For example, Comwave's centralised fax switch will help Lloyds insurance and
reinsurance broker C T Bowring cut fax costs by Pounds 500,000 over five
years.
Of course, the fax is not always viewed as an overhead. At 'white goods'
supplier Seeboard, field service engineers have been given NEC briefcase
faxes (which plug into portable phones) so that they can order spare parts
in front of the customer or get call-out details without going into the
office. The company expects increased levels of efficiency and customer
satisfaction.
Home users, too, are unlikely to face large fax bills. Their problem may be
too few faxes rather than too many.
Mr Davis says the industry is working on standards which will simplify the
use of database services for domestic fax users. Before long they could be
using their Amstrad faxes to call up information from shopping catalogues or
book holidays.
One day the home fax could be as much a part of everyday life as the
electric toaster.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (17): VW revives
fortunes - Vsat services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN car manufacturer Volkswagen has revived the fortunes of a
satellite-based business communications technology which was in danger of
being suffocated by regulatory obstacles before it had even made its mark in
Europe.
Volkswagen has awarded a contract to Scientific Atlanta of the US to install
the largest internal satellite communications network in Europe. It will
eventually connect 6,000 Volkswagen dealers in different countries and is to
be used for data communications and business television services.
Signals will be received and transmitted via very small aperture terminals
(Vsat) dishes developed in the US that are only a fraction of the size and
price of the conventional satellite dish.
Vsat networks the same size as Volkswagen are commonplace in the US, but in
Europe Vsats have been slow to take off. Previously, the largest two-way
contract in Europe was a 150-terminal network run by the Italian
government's department of social security.
There are a number of reasons why Vsats have failed to make their mark in
Europe.
First, the services that can be transmitted by Vsat can also be delivered by
terrestrial data communications networks. State-owned telephone operators
across Europe control this business because they supply the private circuits
which companies need to build their own private data communications
networks. They also operate public data networks.
The public operators have been reluctant to unlock the potential of Vsats
which are identified with small private service providers who could even
threaten their own businesses.
The development of Vsat services has largely been driven by private
companies. But they have found the way blocked by the PTTs (post, telegraph
and telephone companies) who control the sale of satellite capacity -
Europe's telephone operators jointly own Eutelsat, the European satellite
organisation - and who can resort to a number of tactics to hinder and delay
the deployment of networks.
The biggest potential for Vsats lies in the installation of pan-European
networks for companies with offices in several different countries.
It can be technically difficult and immensely time-consuming to piece
together a pan-European network using leased lines, so a satellite network,
which can be installed in a matter of weeks, provides an attractive
alternative.
Volkswagen went for a Vsat network because it met the German company's
requirement better than terrestrial links, according to Mr Klaus Schultz,
Volkswagen's director of communications systems.
Availability of leased lines in Europe is poor, he says, and Vsats also give
greater flexibility. The company will use Vsats to send information to its
dealers and also plans a business television service in the future.
Three other leading European car manufacturers have also been pioneers in
the deployment of Vsat networks. Renault of France has a two-way data
communications Vsat network for its 140 dealers in eastern Germany.
The network was installed by Teleport Europe, the leading supplier of Vsat
systems in Europe. Daimler Benz has linked 20 of its European subsidiaries
on a Vsat network supplied by Deutsche Telekom. And last year, BT won a
contract from Ford's UK arm to install a one-way Vsat-based television
network for several hundred UK dealers.
Car companies are particularly suited to Vsat satellite systems because they
have a requirement for point-to-multipoint communications. Their central
offices need to send and receive data from many outlying sites where their
dealers are based.
Campsa, the Spanish chain of petrol stations, is using a Vsat network to
route information from its main offices to petrol stations up and down the
country. Campsa had to bully Spain's semi state-owned telephone operator
Telefonica into installing its network. Telefonica is one of the public
operators which have largely ignored the arrival of Vsat systems.
But the success of Vsats in the car industry has not been mirrored in other
sectors.
While the unfavourable regulatory environment and the hostility of the
public telephone operators have been crucial factors in the slow take-up for
Vsats, there has also been a problem persuading businesses that Vsats
provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative to terrestrial networks.
'Service providers are affected by the image of the sector as immature,
unstable, risky and under-resourced,' according to report published by the
Cambridge-based telecommunications consultancy Analysys earlier this year.
It says this perception will change in coming years, but for the moment, 'No
service provider has yet had time to establish a track record that could
completely reassure the average corporate telecommunications manager.'
Many of the service providers are names new to corporate telecommunications
managers.
Teleport Europe was set up in 1990 specifically to offer Vsat services,
while Scientific Atlanta is an established service provider in the US, but
has only started to make an impression in Europe in the past year.
Pricing Vsat services has been another problem. Few customers will switch
from terrestrial solutions to satellite solutions unless there is a cost
saving.
Service providers are undercutting public telephone operators for large Vsat
networks, but offer only small price savings for smaller systems.
Volkswagen, therefore, was able to achieve a lower price than if it had
opted for a terrestrial network. But this will be the first two-way network
with more than 1,000 terminals and most networks only have about 50
terminals.
Analysys believes that service providers will have to drop their prices for
these smaller networks if they are to develop their businesses.
There has always been an expectation that Vsat services will make the same
impact in Europe as in the US where leading corporations such as General
Motors, Chevron and Chrysler have Vsat networks covering thousands of sites.
There are well over 100,000 one-way and two-way Vsat terminals installed in
the US, compared to less than 10,000 in Europe.
But several industry players now say that comparisons are invalid. In the
US, the retailing, distribution and financial sectors have been the big
sectors for Vsats.
Analysys notes that 'the geographical spread of these services in Europe is
much more restricted.' There are, for example, no European equivalents of
nationwide US retailers such as K-Mart.
Patterns of use may, therefore, develop very differently in Europe,
according to Analysys.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (13): Competition
is slow - New entrants beside Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a lot of huffing and puffing since the government lifted the
remaining restrictions on competition to BT and Mercury in 1991. But few of
the new telephone companies that announced plans around that time to build
new telephone networks are close to delivering a service.
British Rail Telecommunications, British Waterways and National Networks -
the start-up company which was going to use the Post Office's internal
network - all came up with plans to build networks that would connect the
main UK centres of population. But none are laying down telephone lines yet.
Meanwhile, US telephone companies Sprint and American Telephone and
Telegraph are banging their drums loudly but have no intention of
duplicating BT's, or even Mercury's less extensive network.
In fairness, most of the applicants are still waiting for the government to
process their licence applications. But even after licences have been
granted and the operators have secured financial backing and started
building their networks, most new telephone companies are only ever likely
to target a very small number of high-spending large business customers.
With BT, the cable television companies and Mercury Communications already
poised for a two- or three-way fight for small to medium-sized business and
residential customers - it will be a three-way fight if the cable television
companies stop working in partnership with Mercury  - it would be risky for
any other company to embark on a multi-billion pound venture to cable up the
whole of the country.
Most of the new competitors, therefore, are planning to build networks which
rely heavily on the national infrastructures already in place courtesy of BT
and Mercury.
A new breed of telephone companies called resellers are the clearest example
of how it is possible to compete with BT and Mercury using their telephone
network infrastructures.
Resellers lease private circuits on long-distance and international routes
from BT and Mercury, and resell capacity on these routes to their customers.
A reseller can connect its customer to the BT or Mercury private circuit
either with another private circuit, or by the public telephone network. In
either case, a reseller buys the service from BT or Mercury, repackages it,
and sells it to its customer.
Worldcom, the UK subsidiary of a Swiss telecommunications group, is one of
15 or so companies which consider that the UK offers attractive
opportunities for resale. But Worldcom is the only company which has firmly
established itself as a reseller and signed up big corporate accounts.
Worldcom offers services to the US and other leading international
destinations at lower prices than either BT or the cheaper Mercury
Communications.
It has more than 100 customers already and is well placed to benefit from
the liberalisation of resale services in Europe.
Today, the opportunity for resale services in Europe are limited. But the
European Commission intends to force member states to drop all restrictions
on resale within the Community by 1998.
Other resellers are planning to enter the UK market over the next one to two
years, all offering discounts to BT and Mercury on main routes. Most of
these are new companies which plan to exploit the huge discrepancies between
the actual cost and the price that is charged to the customer for delivering
international services. Others are public telephone operators such as
Swedish Telecom and Telecom Australia which will offer international
services to UK subsidiaries of Swedish and Australian companies.
This is clearly the attraction for AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant
which applied in April for a licence to operate a domestic and international
telephone network.
AT&amp;T has not decided whether it will build a trunk network across the UK. To
build a network from scratch would cost billions of pounds and it would take
tens of years to recoup the initial investment. One option would be for AT&amp;T
to partner one or more of those new competitors whose projects are already
far advanced.
One such project is the proposed trunk network to be built by Energis, a
company wholly owned by the National Grid company which operates the trunk
electricity network in England and Wales. Energis plans to open the UK's
third trunk telephone network in spring 1994. It will connect 17 of the
largest towns and cities in England and Wales. Energis is investing Pounds
100m a year in the network over the next five years and would welcome a
partner such as AT&amp;T to share some of the investment burden. Energis
received its licence from the DTI in May.
Energis will initially target business customers in city centres and offer
them cheaper private circuit and public network services than BT or Mercury.
It says it will make considerable savings on the construction costs of the
network through the use of existing national grid infrastructure. It plans
where possible to wrap optical fibre on overhead power lines as a cheap
alternative to installing cable below ground - and it hopes to link its
trunk network into local telephone networks that several regional
electricity companies are planning to build.
The other project most likely to succeed involves the delivery of local
telephone services by radio. Ionica is a start-up company which has
developed the technology to deliver local telephone services to residential
and small business customers using radio tails and bypassing the BT local
telephone network. Ionica reckons it can provide a service to half the UK
population over the next few years at prices considerably lower than BT or
Mercury.
Today, the only real alternative to BT and Mercury for most business
customers are the services delivered by the cable television companies. The
cable operators' franchise areas cover 14.9m households and businesses,
although most of these are still in the planning or network building phase.
Nevertheless, they have already installed more than 150,000 telephone lines
and more than 20 per cent of the BT customers they approach are signing up.
Cable television operators are mainly targeting small business and
residential customers, offering them prices some 10 to 20 per cent cheaper
than BT or Mercury. Many of them are offering new services such as call
waiting or call forwarding. Diamond Cable, the cable television operator in
Nottingham, has introduced free local calls if they are made between cable
television network subscribers.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (15): Latching on
to demand - Syncordia and the emergence of global supercarriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'OUTSOURCING' is now all the rage among international telecoms companies.
Most state telecoms companies are in or entering the business of providing a
'one-stop shop' for companies, servicing and managing as much of their
telecoms needs as they are prepared to put out of house.
In the UK, both Mercury and BT have managed services divisions. Last month,
BT named its domestic outsourcing unit 'Communications Management', targeted
at companies with large and complex private networks, on the day it
announced a Pounds 5m five-year contract to take over the ownership and
management of Thorn EMI's internal UK telephone network.
However, BT's outsourcing strategy does not stop at the Channel: one of its
over-riding ambitions is to become a leading 'global outsourcer'. It faces
stiff competition for the title from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the
largest US operator.
BT and AT&amp;T have latched on to a demand - part evident, part anticipated -
from the world's 2,500-odd multinationals for a 'one stop' global provider
able to do everything from maintaining private networks to sorting out
customer requirements with local telecoms companies in several countries
while providing single billing and a single telecoms port of call.
Add into the equation the capacity of the international telecoms operator to
provide the latest in network features, billing, servicing and high-speed
data transmission facilities, and that makes your global outsourcer.
As Mr Vic Pelson, president of AT&amp;T's communications services group, puts
it: 'Multinationals want communications services that give them global
capabilities. And they want them now.'
There is nothing new in partnerships between telecoms companies to provide
international services. So-called 'correspondent' arrangements to
inter-connect virtual private networks across borders, and to provide
services such as abbreviated direct dialling and single billing for traffic
carried between two operators, have been in place for years.
AT&amp;T's Global Software Defined Network (GSDN) gives it a correspondent link
with 21 other international carriers, including BT; BT's counterpart,
FeatureNet, embraces 14 carriers and has more than 100 customers.
However, the latest outsourcing ventures by the two companies - AT&amp;T's
Worldsource launched last month and BT's Syncordia, started in 1991 - are
far more ambitious. Designed both to enhance the range and quality of
existing services, their aim is to provide a truly one-stop international
facility for multinationals.
Initial Worldsource services, available later this year, will include
virtual network services for voice and data communications, upgraded
private-line services, frame relay service for high-speed data transmission
and 'one-stop shopping' for ordering, maintenance and billing, with bills
consolidated in a customer's choice of country and currency.
Although AT&amp;T and BT are marketing similar services, and both are investing
heavily in upgrading overseas facilities, the strategies of Syncordia and
Worldsource are starkly at odds. Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was
originally intended to be a strategic partnership with Germany's Deutsche
Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. But neither proposed
link-up came off, with Deutsche Telekom breaking away and forming a rival
enterprise with France Telecom.
Syncordia will in due course be subsumed in a new Dollars 1bn joint venture
formed with MCI, the second-largest US carrier. The deal with MCI marks the
end of BT's 'go-it-alone' approach, and its attempt - presently before the
Federal Communications Commission - to become a public operator in the US in
its own right is expected to be quietly dropped. AT&amp;T, on the other hand,
intends vigorously to pursue its application for direct access to the UK
public networks.
Syncordia now has nine takers worth Dollars 200m a year. These include a
five-year contract managing BP's voice, data, video and messaging services
among five sites in the UK and Stavanger, Norway; and the communications
network of BP Chemicals among 11 sites in seven European countries.
It is hardly taking the international telecoms world by storm - but then,
says BT, 'multinationals cannot be expected to outsource overnight.'
By contrast, AT&amp;T's Worldsource was launched in Japan with two partners
(Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan and Singapore Telecom) and the strong
likelihood of three others joining soon (Unitel of Canada, Telstra of
Australia and Korea Telecom).
An entry into Europe is critical if Worldsource is to succeed. AT&amp;T is
budgeting to spend Dollars 350m over the next five years providing
facilities and upgrading equipment in Europe. Mr John Foster, director of
AT&amp;T's communications services in Europe, professes himself keen to talk to
'almost any' of Europe's telecoms operators about a link-up, and expects to
launch Worldsource in Europe next year.
Because Worldsource does not give AT&amp;T exclusive rights over its partners,
most of Europe's state telecoms operators appear to have little to lose from
participation. Unless, that is, they want to be global outsourcers
themselves, and are anxious to give no succour to AT&amp;T.
For companies such as Deutsche Telekom and Telecom France, AT&amp;T's move is a
challenge to them to clarify their international strategies and link up with
partners. BT has already shown its hand, which could give the US operator
problems in the UK. But AT&amp;T is not restricted to BT: Mercury and Energis
are potential partners.
How many of the 2,500 multinationals are in the market for the outsourcers?
At Worldsource's launch, AT&amp;T presented a formidable group, including
Unisys, Honeywell, Motorola and United Parcel Service. Its decision to
launch first in Asia-Pacific is significant: the region has the world's
fastest-growing telecoms sector, wide open to outsiders with cash and
expertise - and is replete with multinationals demanding better services.
However, one-stop shops and fancy services alone will not be enough to
attract the multinationals. They already have top-notch telecoms managers.
The bottom line will be critical.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (12): Teams of
experts ponder the options - Discount schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the many criticisms that UK businesses used to make of
telecommunications services in the UK was that the price of a call was the
same regardless of whether you were a residential customer running up bills
of Pounds 50 a quarter, or a multinational corporation generating millions
of pounds a year of revenues for BT.
This is no longer the case. Since 1991, BT and Mercury have been offering a
sliding scale of discounted telecommunications services, and large users
have been buying telephone calls for as much as 20 per cent less than the
infrequent caller.
But the introduction of discounts has brought with it a new problem:
deciding which discount scheme is best, and predicting in advance the level
of spend on telecommunications services over a period of three months.
Even when it is clear which of the packages offered by one operator is best,
it can be difficult to compare discount schemes offered by BT on one hand,
Mercury on the other, and increasingly, cable television companies and other
competitors.
Large companies have telecommunications managers and teams of experts who
can work their way through the different options and decide what mix of
services suits them best.
But the small and medium-sized business, where telephone services have only
ever merited the same care and consideration as gas, electricity or water
supply, often lack the expertise and resources to make the right choice.
Those companies which make the wrong choice, or make no choice at all, may
lose the opportunity to make savings on one of their biggest items of
expenditure and one which will rise as we move towards an information-based
society.
BT introduced the first bulk discounts in 1991. Mercury, which was offering
discounts of between I0 per cent and 25 per cent on all long-distance and
international routes, was stealing some of BT's biggest accounts and the
former monopoly needed a defence.
BT's discounts apply on a site-by-site, or a multi-site basis. A company
which houses all its operations under one roof would choose a site-by-site
discount scheme. But for businesses with many different sites dotted around
the country each generating a small amount of traffic - for example a chain
of shops - a multi-site scheme could prove more attractive.
The site-by-site discount packages are called Option 15, Option 45, Option
50 and Option 70. For quarterly payments ranging from Pounds 3.40 to Pounds
275, users qualify for discounts on BT's basic call charges of between I0
per cent and 16 per cent. Residential and small business users usually opt
for Option 15 or Option 45 because their quarterly spend is not high enough
to make it worth their while paying the high up-front cost to qualify for
maximum discounts.
Option 2000 is BT's multi-site discount package. With this tariff option
there are discounts on total call charges generated by several sites. The
same principle applies as with the other Options packages; users qualifying
for discounts of between 14 per cent and 16 per cent in return for up-front
quarterly payments of between 14 per cent and 16 per cent.
For every BT Option, Mercury has a discount scheme of its own. For Options
15, 40, 50 and 70, read Frequent Caller Programme Levels One, Two, Three and
Four, all of which offer higher discounts on basic Mercury prices the
greater the quarterly payment.
Mercury has a set of discounts for its directly connected customers on the
one hand, and indirectly connected customers on the other. As a rule, large
users are connected directly - they have Mercury lines running into and out
of their premises - and small to medium-sized companies take indirect
services in which case they are connected by BT lines as far as the local
exchange, but connect to Mercury for long-distance and international calls.
For directly-connected sites, Mercury offers discounts averaging 5.7 per
cent to 8.8 per cent in return for quarterly fees of between Pounds 300 and
Pounds 700. Indirectly connected customers get discounts of 11.5 per cent to
17.4 per cent for national calls, and 18.3 per cent to 20.9 per cent for
international calls after paying site fees of Pounds 5 to Pounds 450.
Mercury has another discount package called its Corporate Plan which is for
multi-site businesses and to compete with BT's Option 2000.
Deciding which combination of discount packages is right for your business
is not easy.
A niche has been created for independent consultants to provide expert
advice, and there is increased demand for reports such as the Octagon Guide
to Telecommunications Tariffs and the Guide to BT and Mercury Business
Telephony Tariffs published by Infrastructure, Technology and Communications
(ITC), a London-based consultancy.
The Octagon guide concludes that Mercury 2100 - its directly connected
service - is the cheapest telephone service. 'Mercury savings over BT,' it
says, 'are up to 9 per cent, after taking account of the best BT or Mercury
options, rental charges and option charges.'
ITC's key findings are that Mercury savings for single sites are between 5
per cent and 15 per cent for directly-connected sites, and up to 10 per cent
for indirectly-connected sites. On a multi-site basis, Mercury savings to BT
range from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.
Medium to large businesses, however, will often require a mixture of BT and
Mercury services and of single-site and multi-site discount packages. The
savings on basic call charges for a company that mixes and matches different
discount schemes is substantial.
Prudent management of telephone services is fast developing as an effective
means of cost control.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (14): Blunt message
from survey - Quality of service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE is not everything. Companies want a reliable telecoms service and if
new entrants to the market will not provide it, business will not go their
way.
That is the blunt message of a detailed survey of user perceptions of the
the UK's public network operators carried out at the end of last year by the
Telecommunications Users Association which represents 1,100 companies
nationwide spending at least Pounds 600m a year on telecoms between them.
The survey, of 1,000 companies, analysed the service provided by BT, Mercury
and a few smaller providers.
Overall, satisfaction levels were high. BT generally scored better than
Mercury, but there was little in it and on most measures of service quality
more than two-thirds of users professed themselves 'very' or 'fairly'
satisfied.
However, there were still some serious gripes. BT users were particularly
concerned about:
Billing. Concern was not so much about accuracy as frequency, layout and
content. BT has recently made improvements to the last two, but complaints
about frequency from smaller users, and the timing of reminders and
threatened disconnections for all, are likely to persist.
BT says it has no 'set rule' on the availability of monthly billing. Larger
companies qualify; whether small and medium-sized ones do depends, according
to a spokesman, 'on their size relative to others in their area'. In London
that means they 'probably have to have a bill of several hundreds of
thousands a year' - although a trial of monthly billing for all companies is
underway in one area.
As for reminders, the standard intervals are three weeks to a reminder;
followed by second reminder and final notice. 'However, precise intervals
depend upon payment history', says the company. 'Good payers generally get
greater leeway.'
The frequency with which account managers were changed, and poor handover.
Some customers complained of having two or three account managers within 18
months.
BT's heavy redundancy programme over the past three years which, says the
TUA, 'has resulted in many customers feeling uncertain about BT's future
ability to deliver'. Some 'major customer problems' were reported. Despite
this, the report continues: 'a majority still felt that BT was grossly
over-staffed' - so evidently the company cannot win.
Information about tariff options. A recurring theme was the difficulty of
calculating prices and comparing tariffs between operators, with
ever-more-complex discount schemes. As competition intensifies, no
improvement is to be expected on this score. Least cost-routing software and
smart boxes can do the thinking for you when it comes to selecting operators
for particular calls, but the latter have created problems of their own and
some new users require large initial payments that also need to be taken
into account.
With Mercury, the main complaints were:
Network congestion, particularly in the Manchester, Birmingham and East
Anglia regions 'and a general lack of responsiveness'.
Half of all respondents reported one or more recurring faults with Mercury,
often as a result of network congestion or failure.
Mercury says that since last autumn it has completed new switches, upgraded
existing ones, and improved inter-connect arrangements with BT to relieve
congestion in all three areas, 'so there are no longer such traffic jams'.
Billing, with 'bills for large amounts being sent sporadically' and
inadequate machinery for dealing with complaints. Mercury says it is
'examining' a new billing system, but has yet to make an announcement.
'An overall feeling that outside London Mercury was thin on the ground and
simply lacked the necessary resources.' The company, which began life
targeting City business traffic, still has work to do assuring out-of-London
customers that they receive equal treatment.
It is too soon to pass judgment on the service provided by the 58 cable TV
companies laying networks in the local loop. Indeed, most of the complaints
against them have not been about the service provided, but rather the
absence of any cables providing service in the first place. BT's Westminster
contract area is a prime source of complaints, although BT recently promised
to take the contract seriously and make the outlay required to fulfil its
licence.
However, one new entrant wins plaudits from the TUA: Worldcom, a
fast-growing London operator linking private networks into leased national
and international leased lines, which has applied for a public
telecommunications operator licence to enable it to offer services via the
switched network.
Worldcom branched out from the leased line business barely 18 months ago,
yet now has 80 customers and has only lost one since - and that was not to
do with quality. Claiming to charge up to 15 per cent less than Mercury, it
is no wonder that the City is discovering it fast.
Mr David Hardwick, Worldcom's managing director, says its ability to
maintain quality is no surprise. 'After all, our equipment is the same as
that used by BT and Mercury - and virtually all our staff come from one or
the other.' Including Mr Hardwick himself, who left BT four years ago.
Unsurprisingly, the TUA members are keen to see greater competition. Only 31
per cent thought there was 'adequate' competition. The rest wanted to see
more, in three areas in particular: the provision of analogue private
circuits; in local calls (where BT still has a virtual monopoly - and will
continue to over much of the country even when and if the local cable
companies start attracting customers en masse); and in geographical areas
where Mercury is weak.
'An overriding majority of the users outside the Greater London area felt
there was no real alternative to BT', conclude the TUA. As one user put it:
'The problem is, who will want to service the rural or unglamorous areas?'
Who indeed.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (11): The telecoms
revolution - Outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main tenets of modern management theory is that business
organisations operate most effectively when they focus on those core
operations where they have special expertise - and buy-in the other services
which they require.
Services ranging from catering to data processing and even manufacturing are
now 'outsourced' by companies and increasingly by government departments on
both sides of the Atlantic.
Beginning in the 1970s, many companies built their own telecommunications
networks for voice or data or a mixture of the two and installed complex
private branch exchanges (PBXs). But today many large customers are either
asking outsiders to manage their networks, or buying-in the sophisticated
telecommunications facilities and network services which they need.
Several other factors are also pushing companies towards the outsourcing
solution for their telecommunications requirements in the 1990s. Among these
are the growing complexity of telecommunications services, the rapid pace of
technological change, the increasingly global nature of business, and the
liberalisation of telecommunication regimes.
Liberalisation is leading to increasing competition between established
network operators and a proliferation of service offerings for corporate
clients.
These range from relatively simple value-added services such as automated
facsimile 'exchanges' to complex full outsourcing contracts where a
contractor is responsible for providing a wide range of flexible
telecommunications services to a customer on a national or international
basis in what is generally viewed as a 'partnership' arrangement. Sometimes
these outsourcing arrangements will involve the customer transferring assets
and staff to the contractor.
There are several main categories of bought-in service on offer, although
the dividing lines between them are blurred. They include:
Centrex, where the features of a conventional company PBX - such as
desk-to-desk dialing - are provided by the network operator who partitions
off part of the public telephone exchange to act as a customer's office
telephone system. The customer then usually pays a regular fixed sum for the
exchange equipment used and a variable increment for the calls made, but
avoids the need for substantial capital investment.
Centrex services have been available in the US since the early 1980s, but
have been much slower to develop in Europe. 'Centrex in the US is quite a
substantial revenue earner (for the network operators), but in Europe it is
only really available in the UK and Sweden,' says Ms Cathy Borrows, an
industry analyst with Dataquest. In the UK, Mercury and BT have both begun
to offer centrex services.
Managed Network Services (MNS), where most or all of the day-to-day running
of a corporate voice or data network (Managed Data Network) is undertaken by
an outside contractor.
These services are offered in the UK by a wide range of companies including
the two domestic network operators and international competitors such as
AT&amp;T. For example, Mercury offers its Telecommunications Facilities
Management Service under which Mercury staff supervise, operate and maintain
a corporate network and provide round-the-clock technical support.
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), where the features and functionality of a
private network based on leased circuits are provided instead on the public
telephone network on a national or international basis.
At its simplest, a VPN offers businesses a way to link the switchboards on
different office sites - even if they are in different countries - without
having the expense of installing and running their own private network.
VPNs are one of the fastest growth areas in business telecommunications. A
recent report by Ovum, the telecommunications consultancy, predicted that
VPN 'will revolutionise business communications in the 1990s.' The authors
predicted that by 1997 the market for national VPNs in Europe and the US
will be worth Dollars 12.5bn for voice and Dollars 1.2bn for data.
By the same date they forecast that international VPNs will comprise 21 per
cent of telcos' international revenue, amounting to Dollars 2.3bn for voice
and Dollars 500m for data.
The growing popularity of VPNs reflects the fact that both sides of the
communications industry - supplier and customer - stand to gain. 'VPN gives
users a better combination of cost and flexibility than any other service,
while for the telcos it offers the opportunity to increase market share and
reduce networking costs.'
From the customer point of view the advantage is not just one of cost,
although often there can be substantial savings. One significant advantage
offered by a VPN is that it can be reconfigured rapidly to meet the
customer's changing requirements. 'Resources can be added to the system very
quickly,' says Ms Borrows.
Network operators are keen to provide VPN services because they are cheaper
to provide than leased lines, they enable network operators to 'capture' the
outsourcing revenues of private networks, and they provide a commercial
justification for building 'intelligent' network infrastructure. VPNs also
offer the chance to increase market share by winning lucrative corporate
business and new international business.
In the US the three inter-exchange carriers, US Sprint, AT&amp;T and MCI,
introduced VPN services for voice in the mid-1980s. Since then, VPNs have
become the dominant service offering of the carriers to large corporations
and almost all of the top 1,000 companies use the service, as do many
smaller organisations.
But they are still quite rare in Europe. In Britain, VPN services so far
have mainly been aimed at the large national and multinational companies.
However, increasing competition between Mercury and BT, particularly for the
big business customers, and tariff re-balancing in the late 1980s which
changed the economics of private leased circuits in the UK has helped
stimulate interest in VPNs.
The recession also focused management attention on what Mr David Sexton,
customer director for managed network services at Mercury, calls 'sticking
to the knitting.' He also suggests that because we are entering a period of
'technology churn' corporate users are more inclined to turn to outside
service providers rather than risk investment in rapidly changing
technology.
'Customers have been looking very closely at what they want to provide and
manage,' he says. 'For some it will remain economic for them to continue to
operate their own networks.' But for a substantial proportion he believes
Centrex, VPN or full outsourcing will make sense.
Both Mercury and BT have invested heavily in recent years in providing both
national and global VPN services. Mercury, in conjunction with its parent,
Cable &amp; Wireless, and partners such as US Sprint, provides an end-to-end
service under the GVPN banner and BT provides a global service called
International FeatureNet service which was launched in 1990 and offers
on-network connections to the US VPNs and off-network connec tions to a
number of other countries.
In Britain, BT's VPN service is called FeatureNet 5000. One of its latest
customers is Saga, the UK-based international travel and financial services
group. Saga's new system includes a VPN and an automatic call distribution
(ACD) system providing digital switching technology to handle domestic
dial-up calls and most of the voice and data traffic that would normally
require dedicated leased lines.
Saga can increase or reduce call capacity at two hours' notice, for example
to accommodate extra traffic generated by marketing activity.
Meanwhile, Mercury is actively pursuing outsourcing business. Early last
year it won two big contracts, one from TSB and the other from GEC and,
according to Mr Sexton, itis negotiating several others at the moment.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (10): An
interesting battle looms - Video dial-up services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTYN WARWICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK has two fundamental networks: telephone and television. All others,
apart from a few specialised satellite, microwave or cable based-systems,
are either adaptations or extensions to one or other of the two base models.
The success of satellite-broadcast TV services and the few, scattered, cable
TV networks that are available here is helping to foster demand, led mainly
by domestic consumers - but business and academia is interested as well -
for new entertainment and information TV services.
Just as telecommunications, datacommunications and computer applications are
converging to the point where it is practically impossible to tell them
apart, so the telephone and television networks have significant, and
growing, areas where their interests and capabilities overlap.
For example, as more and more of the UK is cabled for multi-channel TV, it
will be a technologically simple matter for the cable companies to provide
access to the public switched telephone network over their TV cable and so
compete, head on, with the likes of BT.
Similarly, the technology now exists to permit high bandwidth video to be
transmitted over existing copper-cabled telephone networks as well as on new
fibre optic lines, putting telephone companies in direct competition with
the cable TV businesses. The telephone system also has the supporting
infrastructure to handle switched or on-demand applications, and the
capability to bill for services rendered.
After more than 10 years of duopoly competition, telephone bills in the UK
remain uncompromisingly high. Individual and business subscribers may
complain about the size of their quarterly accounts but these are also
regarded in very much the same light as death and taxation: unfortunate but
inevitable.
Video dial tone networks will allow telephone companies to provide
information, education, medical, banking, catalogue shopping - and home
entertainment services such as cable television, pay-per-view channels,
interactive learning and true video-on-demand. They will all have to be paid
for.
Most research and development work in video dial tone has taken place in the
US where the both the regulatory environment and the market is more
conducive to the deployment of such interesting new services.
The situation in the UK is somewhat different, cable TV is far from
ubiquitous here and legislative strictures are preventing the biggest
potential players in the market, the telephone companies, from competing
with the cable companies.
The government, allegedly to allow infant cable TV companies time to grow
up, has forbidden both BT and Mercury to provide home entertainment services
over their networks until 2001.
BT attempted to pilot video-on-demand services in East Anglia but the Cable
TV Association (CTA) successfully contended that video-on-demand effectively
constituted entertainment delivery.
The argument hinges on just what constitutes broadcast entertainment.
Television is a one-to-many medium that can provide a minimal degree of
interaction via teletext type services.
Telephony is a one-to-one medium, (except for business-based audio and
videoconferencing services) that by its very nature is full duplex and
therefore has the potential to be made highly interactive. The question is,
is it broadcast?
Wrangles such as this nicely illustrate how shortsighted and
counterproductive it can be to make arbitrary rulings on how, when, where
and why a technology may be deployed while that technology is still actually
being developed.
From the technology angle, subscriber transport of video signals can be
achieved over existing copper loops using Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber
Line (ADSL), fibre in the loop (FITL) or hybrid fibre-coaxial cable
distribution networks.
ADSL is the transport link that will allow local exchange carriers to use
existing copper wires to deliver broadband services that provide high-speed
data, digital audio and video to the home or business.
It can carry a one-way transmission of a bit-stream up to 6Mbp/s from the
public network to customers, while at the same time providing an interactive
control bit stream from the individual customer back to the network; and
still retain the use of the copper pair as the plain old telephone system
(POTS) line.
Asymmetric refers to the difference in bit rate between the two directions
of transmission.
When ADSL was first proposed, in the US in 1989, there were two competing
technologies that seemed to be capable of delivering the 1.5Mbit/s service -
as it was then envisioned - over the installed copper base. These were
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) which is
also known as multicarrier.
Further research and development showed that DMT was capable of providing
high-quality performance at speeds in excess of 6 Mbit/s.
It does this by dividing available bandwidth into 256 channels and uses
digital signal processing to dynamically adjust parameters as necessary to
minimise errors and crosstalk.
DMT technology supports four 'A' channels at 1.5 Mbit/s, each of which may
carry a video signal of VCR quality, or two channels can be merged to carry
a high-quality, outside broadcast-type real-time video signal. For the
future, all four channels operating in concert will be able to transport an
extended definition TV signal.
DMT also carries a 384Kbit/s ISDN channel which can be used to access to
corporate LANs for teleworking applications using a frame relay service.
A further basic rate ISDN channel is supplied, which contains two 64 Kbit/s
'B' channels and a single 16Kbit/s 'D' channel.
Along with these comes a signalling-control channel, again operating at
16Kbit/s, which allows the user VCR-type controls over what is being shown
on the 'A' channels.
Control options include all the usual video recorder functions such as
search, pause, reverse and fast-forward. A separate embedded operations
channel permits internal system maintenance, monitoring, audit, telephone
company administration and billing functions.
Finally, the user can make or receive telephone calls over the same copper
pair without affecting the digital transmission channels just described.
What is more, because the ADSL is passively coupled to the POTS line, the
subscriber's POTS capability is unimpaired even in the unlikely event of a
systems failure.
Taken together, these channels provide an aggregate transmission rate of
close on 7Mbit/s that could take remarkable new broadband services direct to
the home over existing copper cabling.
Video dial tone also requires an interactive system that must permit
automated, random access media-independent storage and retrieval
capabilities.
Sophisticated software must process subscriber requests and must provide
subscriber interactive services, network interface support, robotics and
drive control, statistical and accounting functions and video library and
shelf management routines.
It is anticipated that such an automated system will deliver any video
selection or other service, in less than 10 seconds, from a library of
10,000 to 15,000 titles.
Given the massive installed base of copper cable and the comparative expense
of laying fibre optics, it seems likely that those systems that can exploit
copper as a transmission medium will win a large share of the potentially
huge video-on-demand market in the short and medium term.
Fibre will continue to be deployed and can carry more services than wire,
but fibre to the home is a long-term prospect whereas fibre to the workplace
is with us now.
The battle between the established and emergent telephone and TV interests
could well be more interesting than some of the programmes on the box.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (9): UK lags behind
in take-up - Smart cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many uses are there for a smart card? Almost as many as for the computer
chips which sit inside these credit card-style devices. Potential uses range
from keeping networks secure to helping inept cooks - just plug your smart
card into the computer and it tells you what to do and even controls special
kitchen scales.
Despite the possibilities, smart cards have failed to live up to optimistic
forecasts of suppliers and market analysts who said they would replace
magnetic strip cards for bank customers and be in widespread use by the
1990s. One reason this has not happened is cost. Even when bought in bulk
smart cards cost about Pounds 5 each instead of 40p for a magnetic card.
The UK has lagged behind in the take-up of smart cards. In France, they are
used for phone cards. In some Belgian banks, such as the state-owned ASLK,
customers carry a personal smart card. This is swiped through the teller's
terminal to check the customer's identity. Once this is established the
customer can get the same service at any of the bank's 1,249 branches.
However, worries about bank and charge-card security are generating new
interest in smart cards around the world. The drawback of magnetic cards is
that they can be forged using fairly low-cost equipment. There have been
several well-publicised cases of counterfeit cards being used to steal money
from cash machines.
In Singapore, the government is considering basing the identity cards that
all citizens must carry on smart cards. The technology could also be used
for their banking transactions.
Card forgery is a growing international problem and the advantage of smart
cards is that they are harder to reproduce. They can also benefit the
customer. For example, because smart cards contain a computer memory, they
can store a list of transactions. A customer could keep a record of cash
withdrawals without having a wallet bulging with ATM (Automated Teller
Machine) receipts.
This could be checked from time to time at the cash machine itself, or
perhaps on a small card reader usable at home. It might even be possible to
load information from the smart card into a home computer and use it to
update a spreadsheet of domestic finances. However, there are other ways of
making bank cards more secure. For example, some banks and building
societies are embedding photographs into their charge cards.
One of the newest plans for smart-card use also concerns security. They will
be used in the forthcoming GSM digital mobile phone network to cut illegal
use of mobile phones. Users will have to insert a card and tap in a personal
identity number before they will be able to use their phones. Without the
card, the phone will be useless and cards reported as stolen will be
cancelled. This could make mobile phone theft a thing of the past. More than
one card will work with a single GSM phone to enable separate business and
social use.
There is also talk of using smart cards to pay UK road tolls if the British
government's idea of introducing selective road charging goes ahead. GEC
Marconi is testing a system called Timezone in which an electronic unit is
activated by a beacon as the motorist enters a toll area. The toll is then
debited from a smart card. The system is to go on trial in Richmond upon
Thames. GEC says it lets the traffic flow because cars do not have to stop
as they pass the beacon.
Another breed of smart cards which is particularly well-suited for transport
use is the 'contactless' smart card. Demand for these is growing
exponentially, according to Mr John Meikle, sales manager of GEC Card
Technology. The cards work when they are brought within a few centimetres of
a reader device, making them easy for drivers to use.
Contactless cards are also useful for those who prefer to take public
transport. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive is to issue
contactless cards developed by GEC Card Technology of Walsall, England to
its passengers. A similar, less ambitious scheme, using GEC cards, will
begin testing with London Buses in Harrow in July. Another is planned for
Oslo.
To begin with, the Manchester scheme will involve 500,000 cards to be used
on the city's 2,700 buses plus the 'Metrolink' and rail systems. The cards
will act as prepaid tickets, usable many times. Each time the passenger
makes a journey, the fare will be deducted from the card as he or she boards
the bus. The cards will prevent delays caused by people fumbling for the
right change because they can be read through wallets or purses. Customers
will be able to get a print-out of their last 20 journeys and the transport
executive will get better information about travel patterns.
The transport executive is also talking to retail outlets about the
possibility of renting out memory space on its smart cards. This would
enable passengers to use the card for buying such items as petrol or their
morning paper. The cards are rechargeable and can be topped up at selected
post offices and newsagents.
One of the biggest applications for smart cards is in network security.
Northern Telecom's European research arm, BNR Europe, uses a metal-encased
smart card from US company Security Dynamics to prevent computer hackers
stealing valuable research information from its computers.
Mr Andy Macpherson of BNR Europe says it has bought 40 of the company's
SecureID cards and plans to order more. They provide a way of restricting
access to the company's network without giving travelling executives a lot
of extra gadgets (such as card readers) to carry.
To access the computer from a hotel room, for example, an executive types in
his ID and a password. If he or she gets this right, the computer will
request a passcode number. This is a random number generated by the SecureID
card and the numbers change every 60 seconds. Without the passcode number
the user cannot log on.
Mr Jim Geary, of Security Dynamics in the UK, says the cards are also used
by several telecoms companies, such as American Telephone and Telegraph
(itself a maker of smart cards) to prevent fraudulent access to their
networks. For example, customers of BT's Global Network Services data
network can opt to use SecureID to provide an extra level of security for
their computer systems.
Smart cards can also be used to improve the in-house security of computers.
In its headquarters in Lisle, CTR Nord-Est - a regional clearing centre for
the savings banks of northern France - has personal computers with built-in
card readers. Without inserting the correct smart card, users cannot log on
to its clearing system.

rather than revolution - Cable telephony / What's happening

<TEXT>
IN the brave new world of deregulated, liberalised, privatised and
competitive telecommunications, many new services and applications are the
direct result of actual market demand.
The days are long gone when a monolithic PTT could present a captive
business user base with an expensive new technological development that
might have no relevance to real market needs.
Today, business users judge the potential of telecoms applications in terms
of just what practical benefit they can bring to their organisations. They
can choose from a plethora of new technologies, all with their attendant
benefits and some occasional, and rather less well-publicised,
disadvantages.
Telecoms and datacoms are converging to the point where it is difficult to
tell them apart. It is now possible to have digital audio, video and data
applications delivered straight to the desk-top via the public switched
telephone network, a PBX, leased lines, microwave links, satellites, fibre
optics, radio and Lans, Mans or Wans. However, despite the strong growth of
broadband fibre optic cabled systems, most telecommunication still goes over
copper wire at some point during its transmission.
Many of the new technologies have been designed to provide enhanced
bandwidth on existing cables and a big attraction is that they protect the
large investments already made in conventionally cabled infrastructures. For
example, High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop (HDSL) enables 1.544Mbit/s to be
delivered over existing copper pair wires and industry analysts believe that
such services will find a ready market in Europe.
Regulatory issues are forestalling the development of the pan-European and
cross-border carrier systems that are vital to development of business in
the European single market. Very Small Aperture Terminal (Vsat) and other
satellites services have been particularly badly affected.
Practical Lan-to-Lan and Lan-to-Wan interconnect applications are very
popular in business and there has been a concerted drive throughout the EC
to deploy frame relay services for packet switched data communications. In
fact, frame relay, a relatively simple and inexpensive broadband technology,
is seen as a viable long-distance data carrier for pan-European corporate
networks in the very near future.
ISDN, on the other hand, long touted as the ideal universal
telecommunications solution, has not yet proved to be as popular as
expected. Take-up of the basic rate service has been slow and, until
recently, there were very few ISDN products on the market. Nevertheless,
ISDN has made possible the development of intelligent cell processing
software in switches and advanced signalling systems such as C7, DASS and
DPNSS.
In 1988, the CCITT published the basic principles of broadband networking;
B-ISDN. The main feature of the B-ISDN concept is the support of a wide
range of audio, video, data and image applications on the same network. The
target transfer mode for broadband ISDN is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) a technique whereby digitised information is inserted in small,
fixed-length cells for transmission and switching through a network.
ATM, a derivative of fast packet switching technology, can carry all types
of information in a common format and provide the high throughput needed for
emerging broadband applications. Potentially enormous matrix-style cell
switches, which do not suffer the bandwidth constraints imposed by shared
media switching techniques, can be built to handle multi-media traffic.
The time taken for Lan devices to process data is called latency. ATM can
handle real-time signals with close-to-zero latency because the switch reads
the packet address and sends it to its correct destination, probably before
the end of the message has even left the originating device. Sheer speed
such as this allows ATM to handle delay-sensitive traffic such as voice and
video, as well as data.
ATM is on trial throughout Europe now and indications are that it meets
current communications needs, can carry the new video and multi-media
applications well and also has the sufficient potential to cope with any
likely future services.
Another technology is Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) which is a new
flexible transmission standard defined by the CCITT. It defines a new type
of frame structure for data transport that creates additional transmission
capacity and a new structure for handling different data channels.
Development and trials of SDH continues but it is unlikely to be directly
connected to customer sites much before 1997.
Many organisations are continuing with the private networking arrangements
that were first established in the 1980s. They typically involve managed
bandwidth networks supporting distinct voice and data applications and
telcos continue to provide leased bandwidth, in the form of private
circuits, to support these architectures.
However, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are more flexible, provide more
capacity, and are generally cheaper. The latest popular architecture is a
hybrid of traditional private and VPN facilities. It seems likely that voice
applications will move to VPNs together with lower bandwidth data services.
New higher bandwidth services will stay on private dedicated platforms until
frame relay services such as ATM become available.
Business organisations are demanding skilled, fast and responsive management
of their increasingly complex networking environments. BT, Mercury and other
telecoms companies could find an additional source of revenue by providing
network management services in which they would be responsible for much of
the day-to-day running of someone else's corporate network.
Perceived corporate benefits rather than the technology itself now determine
the direction that business telecommunications services are taking. Users
generally prefer evolution to revolution and they want new applications and
products to work with existing equipment, smooth integration into existing
networks, and interoperability with products from other, different vendors.
This has to be achieved at reasonable cost. They do not want unnecessary
added complexity, high investment costs, and esoteric new network management
platforms.
Vendors and service suppliers had things their own way for a long time.
Customer-centred organisations who can make telecoms easier, simpler, faster
and cheaper for the users will be successful. Those that cannot deserve to
fail.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (7): Interest is
running high - Cable telephony / What's possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTYN WARWICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Holy Grail of communications technology for business is the so-called
'ideal desktop' wherein a data workstation also serves as a networked video
terminal to provide real-time interactive audio, full-motion, high-quality
video, animation, spreadsheet, database, telecommunications, document
processing and other applications - all on the same screen.
Interest in such networked multi-media applications is running high and
significant developments in software, hardware integration and switched
network accessibility are expected to make them attractive as strategic
business tools between now and the year 2000.
The bugbear is that multi-media and the other emergent telecoms technologies
are bandwidth-hungry. Broadband is expensive and must therefore be capable
of instantaneous allocation on demand rather than being dedicated to any
particular users or applications. It seems probable that specific sectors of
business will take up broadband before the telecommunications community as a
whole, probably with Lan-to-Lan and Lan-to-Wan interconnectivity driving the
market in the first instance.
At the same time, European businesses are widening their corporate
communications bandwidth as computerisation becomes ever more ubiquitous.
Ironically, the recession has also spurred technological change with many
organisations re-defining and streamlining themselves into co-operating
networks of smaller and more efficient units.
Replacing copper with fibre optics is a massive and enormously expensive
undertaking. In fact, widespread deployment of universal broadband networks
based on optical fibre to business and residential users will not begin in
Europe until after the turn of the millennium. Industry experts generally
agree that it will not be fully completed until the end of the second decade
of the next century or even later.
This, combined with the investment already made in copper cabling, will
ensure that conventional coaxial or twisted pair-type wiring will co-exist
with a growing fibre optic infrastructure for many years.
Copper cable is still being installed and the bandwidth capabilities of
traditional wiring systems are being enhanced. For example, two new services
just introduced in the US, High Bit Rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL) and
Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), are capable of transmitting
high levels of data over non-repeated twisted-pair copper cable. Field
trials of copper-transported television are also under way using ADSL
technology.
Nevertheless, optical fibres have several advantages over copper. These
include a significantly greater data capacity - the FDDI standard calls for
a data rate of 100Mbit/s compared with Ethernet at 10Mbit/s and token ring
at 4 or 16 Mbit/s - enhanced network security and immunity to electronic
noise. They also allow a greater distance between stations and nodes. The
FDDI specifies that stations can be 2km apart using multi-mode fibre or up
to 40km with the latest mono-mode cable, with a total network coverage of up
to 100km. Over the past few years, single mode fibre has emerged as the
popular 'fibre of choice' and new developments, such as a cladding glass
layer that contains a titanium oxide dopant, have produced a particularly
tough, durable and reliable medium.
However, fibre optics also have their drawbacks. For example, every 22 miles
the light signal must be converted back to electronic pulses, amplified and
then regenerated as a light signal once more. This slows transmission, and
it is these staging points and other electronic pathways at either end of
the optic fibre link that dictate maximum signal transmission speeds and
cause data bottlenecks.
This could soon be about to change. Some eight years ago scientists of the
Optical Fibre Group at Southampton University showed that optical fibre
cores doped with the rare earth, erbium, were more reliable and efficient.
Later work has demonstrated that erbium doping facilitates almost perfect
light amplification and erbium amplification systems have been tested to a
distance of 100m kilometres with minimal signal attenuation and complete
data integrity reported.
The ramifications are enormous. With optical switches installed at the
exchanges there will be no electronics to delay signals and communication at
very close to the speed of light will be possible. Not only that, some 25
THz (25,000 GHz) of very cheap bandwidth would be instantly available on
demand - more than enough to cope with any planned or imaginable application
for any business of any size.
Erbium amplified systems have been specified for several new long-haul
submarine cables and also for various terrestrial networks. Some will be in
place before the end of the century.
Today's fibre optic networks are lit. That is to say telcos provide the
fibre optic infrastructure plus the services that run over it - and garner
revenue from both. In future we will see dark fibre systems where the end
user will decide what applications and services to operate and also provide
them. A telco would then be in a similar position to that a of utility
company today - providing a pipeline service, but unable to dictate what is
to be connected to it, how equipment is to be used, when or by whom.
With BT and other suppliers forbidden to provide home entertainment services
over their networks until 2001, the economics of deploying fibre optics is
being distorted by a rigged market. In a free market, BT and its rivals
could generate additional revenues from entertainment services and use them
to offset at least some of the huge costs involved in laying a fibre optic
infrastructure. Businesses, because they need faster and better
communications, will determine when and where the new broadband systems are
built. They will deploy the new technology because, in the end, they cannot
afford not to.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (4): Truly global
mobile network - Satellite-based services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the end of the decade it is likely that satellites will have added
another dimension to mobile communications and provided the first truly
global mobile telecommunications network.
Satellite-based systems already provide a number of key telecommunications
services, particularly maritime and aeronautical communications services
where land-based systems are not an option.
The market for these systems is dominated by Inmarsat, the London-based
Inmarsat International Maritime Satellite Organisation.
According to Mr Justin Jameson, an analyst with Datamonitor, the number of
Inmarsat terminals in use is expected to grow from 28,357 last year to
73,258 in 1997, a compound annual growth rate of 20.9 per cent.
Mr Jameson believes that the highest growth will take place in the
aeronautical market 'where both commercial and private aircraft are
increasingly being fitted with Inmarsat terminals allowing the crew and
passenger to make calls and send faxes.'
Meanwhile the land and maritime markets will continue to grow as a result of
the introduction of lower-cost Inmarsat-C and Inmarsat-M terminals including
the lightweight briefcase-sized portable systems used by geologists and
others who need to send or receive private and secure information from
inaccessible or remote places.
However, some time before the end of the century Inmarsat will probably face
competition from a new generation of low earth orbit satellites (Leos).
Unlike geostationary satellites (Geos) which orbit at a height of about
12,000 miles, Leos orbit much lower at 550 to 6,000 miles.
Because they are closer to the earth, Leos should suffer less from the
characteristic voice delay or echo heard on some satellite voice services.
In addition, Leo-based systems will allow the use of lighter and cheaper
portable equipment.
However, Leos do have some disadvantages. They are solar powered and since
they spend more time in shadow they have a much shorter lifespan than Geos -
about five years compared with 10-12 - and they are much less powerful so
more of them are needed although that may generate economies of scale in
satellite production.
Currently there are five US groups proposing Leo-based telecommunications
systems. The best known, and probably the most ambitious, is the proposed
Dollars 3.4bn Iridium system, lead by Motorola.
The others are Constellation Communications with Aries, Ellipsat (Ellipso),
Loral Qualcomm Satellite Services (Global star), and TRW Space and
Electronics (Odyssey).
A sixth group, American Mobile Satellite (AMS), a joint venture between
McCaw, Hughes and MTEL, already has a geostationary satellite system in
operation. However, it only has a few hundred subscribers and just covers
North America.
The other companies, with more ambitious plans for worldwide service, hope
to begin operations in 1996 or 1997. The number of satellites in each system
or 'constellation' varies. Motorola's Iridium would have 66, Aries 48,
Ellipso 24, Globalstar 48 and Odyssey 12. The cost estimates also vary
dramatically from a minimum of Dollars 200m to more than Dollars 3bn.
All except Ellipso would use circular orbits but Ellipso's satellites, as
its name suggests, would use elliptical orbits which the group claims will
provide significant advantages including longer coverage of key markets
using fewer satellites.
The targeted subscriber base also varies considerably. Motorola predicts
about 2m customers for Iridium by the turn of the century including about
700,000 subscribers for data alone. Motorola expects to charge between
Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 3,000 for handsets and about Dollars 3 a minute
for calls.
Some systems such as Odessey could handle up to 16m subscribers, but most of
the groups are basing their costings on much more conservative estimates.
Even so, some analysts such as Mr Dean Eyers of Dataquest, question whether
they can make economic sense as a mass market voice telecommunications
delivery system.
However, most of the Leo systems would also be used to provide other high
value services including data communications and radio tracking.
Even then their backers face some formidable cost and other problems. One
unresolved issue is about how to regulate Leo operators - an issue which is
exercising the European Commission. Other issues, such as deciding which
frequencies to allocate to Leos, have already been agreed in principle.
But perhaps the biggest problem is the apparent potential oversupply of
satellite system operators, a problem which is not eased by Inmarsat's own
plans for a new Dollars 2bn satellite-based global mobile telecommunications
service designated Project 21.
Most analysts believe there is probably only room for two new Leo-based
services.
What does seem certain, however, is that the dream of a universal mobile
telecommunications service will move a step closer with the launch of new
satellite-based global mobile systems.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (6): Faster,
cheaper, more reliable - Value-added services / EDI and electronic mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE paperless office remains a dream that seems to slip ever further into
the future. Nevertheless, the growth of electronic trading, using electronic
data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail, is having a profound effect on a
growing number of business and other users.
EDI is a value-added telecommunications network service which enables two
organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange routine business
documentation such as orders and invoices using standard electronic forms
and their own computers linked through a service provider.
It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging
information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can
play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain.
For example Tesco, one of the pioneers of EDI use in the UK, has automated
its entire transaction chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock
records, re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making
payments.
By reducing the time taken to process a transaction, manufacturing companies
and retailers can reduce their level of stocks and adopt management
techniques such as just-in-time inventory control.
Trading information electronically can also help suppliers and their
customers match their operations more closely to sales patterns and other
variables, and lead to a closer 'partnership' between supplier and customer.
EDI also automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables an
organisation to check and validate electronic documentation.
These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it
originated, and in the UK which leads Europe in EDI usage in the private
sector, although France has made a co-ordinated effort since 1989 to
implement EDI in the public sector.
In other countries such as Germany and Japan, electronic trading does take
place domestically but is limited because the systems depend on non-standard
software implementations or industry-based proprietary systems which are not
interconnected.
About 7,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are estimated to be
using electronic trading and the number is growing by between 20 and 30 per
cent a year. But there is still much room for growth. Some recent estimates
have suggested that less than 5 per cent of business transactions in the UK
are currently handled by EDI. Of the top 1,000 companies, roughly 300 use
EDI.
International Network Services (INS) is the biggest of the UK-based EDI
services providers with more than 55 per cent of the market and a 35 per
cent share of the overall European market.
INS, jointly owned by ICL and GEIS, the US-based network services company,
provides three main EDI 'communities', INS-Tradanet, the main service for
retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and
Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector.
Its nearly 4,500 UK corporate customers cover 35 market sectors and include
78 of the top 100 UK companies, nine of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest
pharmaceuticals companies, 17 of the top 20 non-life insurers and four
clearing banks. Altogether 15,000 organisations worldwide use its network
services which link 100 countries and 750 cities.
INS-Tradanet handles more than 6m documents a month and Mr Lee Tate, INS
managing director, says the group signed more than 1,100 new companies up
for the service last year. However he acknowledges that the market is
becoming more competitive.
'The competition is much tougher,' he says. Other EDI network service
suppliers in the UK include ATT-Istel, IBM and, since October 1991, British
Telecom. In response, INS has dropped its prices. 'We are going after higher
volumes,' says Mr Tate.
Earlier this year, INS cut its charges following price changes by
competitors in 1992. A basic start-up package including Intercept-Plus PC
software, joining fee and 12 months usage of INS-Tradanet now costs Pounds
1,450.
The price cuts were designed primarily to encourage small companies to adopt
EDI. A new 'unbundled approach' to charges means that companies wishing to
exchange documents with a single trading partner can buy a minimum package
at the outset and then take advantage of the integrated INS-Mail facility to
add features as their EDI usage develops.
Companies use these EDI service suppliers because they provide a central
'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate
recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different
computers or message standards.
Service suppliers, software companies and even the big EDI trading partners
offer software packages which handle links into the different services and
the conversion of data from business systems into the correct message format
standards.
UK sectors which have pioneered the use of EDI include the motor and
electronics industries and the retail trade, particularly the supermarket
chains, and in the financial services sector, the insurance industry.
EDI is a relatively new value added service - INS, for example, was only set
up in 1985. Nevertheless some key trends have already emerged.
In particular, EDI is becoming far more international. There is an
increasing use of Edifact, EDI for Administration, Commerce and Transport,
an emerging group of international message standards which avoids the need
for conversion from one national or industry standard to another.
Between 15 and 20 per cent of INS's customers now have international links.
For example, retailers, led by Tesco and Boots which have developed
extensive domestic supplier networks using EDI, are now doing the same with
overseas suppliers.
In addition, Mr Tate says that a large number of countries are beginning to
set up EDI services in their own right, often using the software and
technical know-how of established EDI players such as INS, IBM and BT.
For example, INS has franchised local companies in Ireland, Northern
Ireland, Portugal and South Africa to operate the INS-Tradanet service
locally and is negotiating other deals in Malaysia, Taiwan and with the PTT
in India. Other UK-based service providers have franchised operations in
Singapore and Korea.
'Our software runs under Unix so we can put it onto any hardware platform,'
says Mr Tate. The system in Ireland, for example, runs on an IBM RS6000 but
INS is working with Unisys in south-east Asia and with Hewlett-Packard in
India. In Ireland, Portugal and India, where the franchisee is the local
PTT, the service runs, or will run, over their own networks. In other cases,
for example South Africa, it is delivered via a managed network.
EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI
tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and
invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has
the range of information transmitted over EDI links.
Tesco now exchanges 13-week sales forecasts with a quarter of the 1,200
suppliers which trade with it electronically. Tesco has also started
communicating with individuals in its supplier companies through the INS
electronic mail service. There are 4,000 electronic mail users in Tesco and
they can communicate with 3,000 contacts in 200 suppliers.
EDI is also being integrated with existing internal electronic mail systems
and other computer applications. Using EDI in this way enables a customer to
link two incompatible Email systems, for example in different departments or
divisions of the same company.
Finally, EDI is gradually reaching a wider audience including government
departments such as the Education Department and HMSO in the UK, and new
sectors such as the book industry.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (5): Changing
habits of a lifetime - Value-added services / Packet-switched and other data
services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Telecommunications and computer companies are running around like headless
chickens in an attempt to find the right mixture of products and services to
meet the surge in demand for linking together networks of personal
computers.
It would have been inconceivable 10 years ago to have a telephone company
moving at the pace of a one-legged chicken, let alone a headless one, to
meet its customers' needs. But data communications, along with mobile
communications, are the two services which the European Commission has
mandated member states to open to competition.
Telephone companies are having to change their habits of a lifetime because
unless they innovate, smaller, more dynamic companies will become the main
drivers of the market.
A new range of products and services is emerging to meet the growth in
networking and internetworking. Large companies are demanding solutions to
improve their ability to interconnect ever-growing numbers of local area
networks (Lans) pieced together on different geographical sites. Lans are
proliferating as companies switch critical applications from the mainframe
computer to personal computers. Lans traffic is increasing at a rate of 30
per cent a year.
There is no single solution for interconnecting Lans. In the past, a
corporate telecommunications manager has tended to use private circuits. But
running them internally can prove very difficult. Most local area networks
have been pieced together over several years and vary widely in size,
capacity and in technical characteristics.
Many companies would prefer to hand their business over to a public network.
Traditional X25 packet-switched data networks are one possibility, but high
prices across Europe, coupled with uncertainty about whether X25 can meet
current and future requirements for high bandwidth services, are causing
many to delay their decision.
Telephone and computer companies are now developing products known as
fast-packet switching services. In some cases, they are offering improved,
higher speed versions of X25. But the real revolution in the data
communications industry is the development of the much-trumpeted frame
relay, a slimmed-down version of X25.
There are already several hundred users of frame relay in the US where it
was developed. Judging by the interest in frame relay from telephone
companies in Europe, there is an expectation that it will have a similar
impression this side of the Atlantic. France Telecom and Swedish Telecom are
already providing frame relay interfaces to their X25 networks.
Deutsche Telecom, Telecom Lenmark and Spain's Telefonica all plan to launch
services this year, while in Finland and the UK public frame relay services
are already available.
But despite the public enthusiasm of European telephone operators, they are
privately cautious about promoting services to compete with their existing
X25 and private circuits services. Yankee Group Europe, a leading
telecommunications consultancy, says that the mood of European vendors and
operators looking at frame relay is to 'wait and see.' Nevertheless, Yankee
Group expects frame relay to see 'significant growth in Europe's nascent
cross-border data transport market over the next three years.'
Frame relay is simpler than X25 and its lower cost is one of the main
reasons why the Yankee Group expects it to break through in Europe. In the
longer term, its faster speed will be an advantage. Laboratory tests show
that frame relay can run at up to 45 megabits per second; much higher than
the 2 megabits commonly thought to be the practical ceiling for standard
X25. In practice, no operators offer frame relay at more than 2 megabits but
this is still much quicker than most existing X25 networks in Europe.
Ranco Europe, a supplier of components to the vehicle and domestic appliance
sectors, chose frame relay for its pan-European network because of its
speed. Its existing IBM-managed network service operates at a maximum of
19.2 kilobits per second which is not fast enough for Ranco's plans to
develop just-in-time manufacturing.
Ranco's customers want deliveries to arrive at the precise times the
products will be used and thereby avoid costly storage. By consolidating
information on orders, sales, shipments and stocks on one frame relay
network, Ranco can better meet tight delivery schedules.
Lucrative Pan-European contracts such as Ranco Europe's are a big draw for
leading value-added network operators such as Infonet, Sprint and American
Telephone and Telegraph. This market is set to increase sharply with the
ending of restrictions on competition in Europe at the start of this year.
But there will be less competition for smaller domestic contracts where
companies need to invest in networks linking together the largest towns and
cities. Yankee Group believes that BT and Transpac - a wholly-owned France
Telecom subsidiary - are the two companies best positioned to capitalise on
pent-up demand in Europe's domestic markets for high speed data services.
BT inherited its European presence from Tymnet, the US data communications
company it bought in 1989. It has built on this and now has a formidable
frame relay presence in all big western European cities. Transpac is
concentrating on X25. It has bought private X25 networks in six European
countries and converted them into an extensive European infrastructure.
Transpac has fought a rearguard action against frame relay, which, it says
is unsafe because there is no guarantee that the data will arrive in one
piece. But Transpac is looking closely at another fast packet technology
called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which has the potential to handle
large volumes of data more smoothly than its cumbersome name suggests.
A number of little-known US and UK vendors such as Cisco, Synoptics,
Fibrenet, Wellfleet, Network Equipment Technologies and Netcomm are rushing
to supply ATM products for the private Lan interconnection market.
The jury is still out on whether X25, frame relay or ATM emerge as the
leading technologies for data networking. But the telecommunications
industry is in no doubt that the sector as a whole will explode over the
next few years. US telecommunications consultancy Frost and Sullivan, for
example, forecasts that the market for fast packet switching will rise from
Dollars 74m in 1992 to Dollars 2bn by 1997.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (3): Market is
immature - Mobile data services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE data has an identity problem. There is little argument that the
market for mobile data is potentially enormous - but for the moment many
customers appear confused by the plethora of emerging services and
equipment.
Market size estimates vary wildly but Arthur D Little has identified 3.8m
potential users for wireless data services in the US by the end of the
century and PA Consulting has predicted that there will be 2m users of
two-way mobile data in the UK by the end of the decade.
To date most mobile communications have focused on voice. However data
transmission has several key advantages over voice telephony: it is
generally cheaper, quicker and more accurate and while pagers and cellular
phones play an important role, they have limitations when it comes to
transmitting complex or large volumes of information.
Typical applications for mobile data involve transferring information to and
from portable computers or mobile data terminals and office computer systems
or other mobile users. Potential users include the projected owners of a new
generation of hand-held devices called 'personal digital assistants'. Mobile
data will provide corporate sales forces with up-to-date customer
information or keep track of emergency services, truck fleets or railway
wagons.
But so far, mobile data has failed to live up to early expectations and most
mobile data operators have been scaling back their subscriber projections,
and in some cases their investments. The shortfall may simply reflect the
fact that most services are still in their infancy, or it may be because
there are a bewildering array of delivery systems.
In the UK, for example, mobile data services are offered by the cellular
operators, dedicated mobile data network operators such as Hutchison, Ram
Mobile Data, Cognito and Vodafone's Paknet, specialist network operators
such as Securicor Datatrak, and over public and private mobile radio
networks - all using incompatible standards and equipment.
Unlike the cellular telephone network operators, who have managed to attract
more than 1.5m subscribers for their voice services in the UK, the uptake of
data services has been somewhat disappointing. In contrast, most estimates
put the total number of subscribers to all data services in the UK at about
10,000.
Generally, transmitting data over a non-dedicated service means sacrificing
transmission quality, coverage or compromising in some other area such as
message length. In addition, transmitting data over an analogue cellular
system is considerably more difficult than over the public switched
telephone network.
Nevertheless, much of the research shows that many customers require a
combination of voice and data communications. One solution is to build the
specialist electronics into dedicated equipment or use a special cellular
modem.
Vodafone's Mobile Data Service, which claims several thousand users and
claims to be 'the UK's most widely-used mobile data communications
solution', uses a special cellular data link control modem to enable
customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the Vodafone cellular
network which provides automatic standards conversion.
Another option is to wait for digital cellular telephones based on the
pan-European GSM standard. Vodafone has already tested a feature developed
for it by Sema called the short message service centre which enables
messages of up to 160 characters to be sent to a GSM handset and displayed
on its LCD screen.
Paging is perhaps the most obvious application of this facility although
Vodafone acknowledges that 'the size cost and short battery life of a GSM
phone relative to an advanced alphanumeric pager will ensure that GSM does
not compete head-to-head with the European paging market.'
However, the GSM specification also includes a 'V24 interface' which will
eventually link the mobile directly to any terminal - for example, a mobile
fax machine or a portable computer. This could bring the GSM phone into more
direct competition with the dedicated mobile data networks.
The UK government issued five 25-year licenses for nationwide public mobile
data networks in October 1991. Prior to this only privately-owned radio
networks had existed. The new licence winners were Cognito, DMC, Hutchison
Mobile Data, Motorola and Ram Mobile Data.
Of these, DMC and Motorola did not take up their licences but Paknet, now
owned by Vodafone, was subsequently awarded a mobile licence in addition to
its existing fixed licence under which it had been providing a packet-switch
data service.
Cognito was closed after the sale of its parent, Dowty Group, last year, but
was relaunched last autumn after a management buy in-buy out deal. Cognito's
new service provides customers with a mobile two-way text messaging system
using a hand-held communicator called a Messenger which has a small screen
and keyboard and operates via the group's nationwide data cellular network.
Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data have also launched their mobile
data services - using rival and incompatible equipment. Hutchison's system
is based on Motorola's RD-LAP system which is also used by Deutsche Telekom
in Germany while Ram, a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting
and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues,is using Mobitex
packet-switching technology developed by Ericsson.
Mobitex is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard in Europe. So far,
Ericsson has won contracts from seven out of the 10 European mobile data
licenses awarded. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi)
is still working on an official standard which is not now expected before
1996 at the earliest.
In the meantime the relative growth of competing mobile data technologies
probably depends on how quickly useful applications software is developed.
This is clearly recognised by Mr John Jarvis, Ram's new chief executive in
the UK, who says the group is encouraging the development of new vertical
and horizontal applications, and the migration of existing applications
running on private data networks.
Already, more than 100 application projects are in trials with Ram. Among
the applications which have recently been adapted for use on the Ram system
are Dispatcher, a Window's-based fleet dispatch software and hardware
package, and Remote-1, a comprehensive field call activity management tool
and communications package.
Ram and Computer Services for Industry have jointly developed Mobilink-400,
an interface enabling portable terminals to interact with IBM AS-400
systems. In addition, Ram and Lotus Development have recently announced an
agreement to develop a wireless version of Lotus cc:Mail, the market leader
in Lan (local area networks) -based electronic mail systems which will
enable portable computer users to send and receive electronic mail messages.
Mr Jarvis believes that having applications in use by real customers will
give public mobile data an important head start against GSM and reinforces
mobile data's distinct advantages over other mobile technologies. 'We have
an edge in response time and in terms of cost,' he says.
One area which appears to hold particular promise for public mobile data is
fleet and freight management, monitoring and security. This is also the
specialist niche chosen by Securicor Datatrak. A new version of the
established automatic - tracking Fleetrak system enables drivers to send and
receive messages using in-vehicle terminals and printers.
Securicor Datatrak owns and manages its own wide area radio-based
communications network in the UK and claims that its system has a number of
advantages over other mobile data services including faster set-up times.
Over the next seven years its should become clear which mobile data
technologies are going to survive the inevitable shake-out. Like many other
segments of the fast-expanding mobile communications industry, mobile data
is still an immature market with competing technologies jostling for
position.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (2): New generation
in wings - Digital services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
Over the past decade, mobile telephony has become the fastest growing
segment of the dynamic global telecommunications market. Now a new
generation of mobile telecommunications equipment, based on digital rather
than analogue technology, is poised to deliver a wide range of sophisticated
new voice and data services to business and residential customers.
The total number of cellular telephone subscribers grew by 43 per cent last
year to 23m, according to figures collected by Mobile Communications, the FT
newsletter. In the US, the biggest cellular market, subscriber numbers
jumped by 46 per cent from 7.6m to 11.1m.
By the end of this decade half of all telephone calls worldwide are expected
to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing proportion of
those telephones will be operating on the new digital technology.
EMCI, the Washington-based market research organisation, has forecast that
there will be about 13m digital cellular subscribers worldwide by 1996,
accounting for about a quarter of the total cellular market.
This expected growth in digital cellular subscribers reflects some key
advantages which digital technology can offer over older analogue systems.
Among these, digital mobile telephones provide more reliable, clearer and
more secure telecommunications.
In addition, by converting ordinary sound into computer code, digital
services can pack at least 10 times as many calls into the same 'space' in
the radio spectrum. But perhaps most importantly they allow
telecommunications network operators and others to provide a wide range of
value-added customer services.
Significantly, although North America led the first mobile
telecommunications revolution in the early 1980s, it is Europe that has
taken the lead in the move towards the next generation of digital systems.
Europe has adopted a pan-European digital telecommunications standard called
GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile). 'The big impact of GSM is that it is a single
standard,' says Mr Dean Eyers, an industry analyst with Dataquest's European
telecommunications group, 'and this means enormous economies of scale for
equipment manufacturers.'
In contrast, in the US a dispute between network operators over two rival
digital standards, one called time division multiple access (TDMA) and the
other called code-division multiple access (CDMA) is threatening to delay
the widespread introduction of digital systems.
Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries are committed to building
GSM networks, and another 20 countries around the world have adopted GSM as
the basis for their next generation of cellular services.
The first GSM networks were launched last July in Germany, France and
Denmark, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe. Since
last July, GSM subscribers have accounted for almost one third of all new
subscribers to cellular networks in western Europe. By the end of this year
Dataquest is forecasting that there will be 1.1m GSM subscribers in Europe,
growing to 8.31m by the end of 1996.
In the UK, Cellnet - one of the two analogue cellular network operators -
plans to have 60 per cent of its GSM network in place by year-end and will
begin to actively market its system to business customers early next year.
Vodafone, the other UK cellular operator, launched a limited GSM network in
December and plans to have 90 per cent of its system in place by the middle
of this year.
Vodafone has already reached GSM roaming agreements with Denmark, Finland,
Germany and Sweden and expects to sign shortly with France, Italy and
Switzerland. These agreements will eventually allow GSM subscribers carrying
their personal smartcards to make calls using a GSM phone anywhere in
Europe.
The GSM standard also includes a mobile data facility which will eventually
enable mobile terminals, such as portable computers and fax machines, to
communicate through a GSM handset at speeds comparable to the best of
today's fixed telephone data links. It is also compatible with the emerging
integrated services digital network, or ISDN.
'As GSM digital networks roll out across Europe and other parts of the world
they brink with them a whole new range of features, says Mr Dominic von
Trotha Taylor, marketing manager at Vodafone's sister company, Vodata. One
of the most significant of these is the GSM Short Message Service which
enables GSM handsets equipped with small LCD screens to receive messages
like pagers.
In December, Vodafone, working with Sema Group's telecom division, became
the first GSM network operators to successfully test the short message
service feature. This allows an alphanumeric message of up to 160 characters
 -twice as long as the typical maximum length paging message - to be
displayed on the handset.
The messages are sent via the short message service centre and when they
arrive at the mobile they are stored in the user's SIM (smart) card ready
for retrieval. SMS's unique features include the ability to send or receive
messages at the same time as speaking or sending data, an alert feature for
informing a third party when a mobile re-registers on the network, the
ability to store a message and forward it to the mobile when it is switched
on, and acknowledgement of successful message delivery.
Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema's telecom division, believes
that SMS and other features like it will provide network operators with a
way of differentiating service offerings.
However, GSM and other new premium-priced digital services will not replace
the older analogue networks immediately. Existing analogue network operators
believe there will be a slow and gradual migration to digital services.
'Analogue systems will be with us for some time,' says Mr Eyers of
Dataquest.
The pace of transition from analogue to digital cellular systems will vary
from country to country. In those countries such as the UK which have
well-established analogue systems which are not capacity constrained, the
growth of GSM is likely to be relatively slow.
Analogue technology will also continue to play a key role in developing
countries, including those of eastern Europe where cellular systems are
already providing a relatively cheap alternative to dilapidated or
non-existent fixed-wire telephone systems in many countries.
Elsewhere, fixed-wire telephone systems could also face a challenge - but
from other new mobile digital cellular services which are just around the
corner. For example, in the UK Vodafone plans to launch a second service on
the back of GSM called the Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a
low-cost digital portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers.
Local MCN call charges are expected to be significantly cheaper than GSM
services, putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone
networks. MCN is due to be launched in the south-east of England later this
year in direct competition with another digital system aimed at the mass
market called the personal communications network (PCN).
One-2-One, - previously Mercury Personal Communications - a joint venture
between Cable and Wireless and US West, plans to launch its PCN service in
the London area this summer, expanding throughout the south-east to reach a
quarter of the population by April next year. Hutchison Microtel, a joint
venture involving Hutchison Telecom UK and British Aerospace, is also
building a PCN network but is not expected to launch its service before next
year.
Elsewhere in Europe, PCN networks are likely to be built in Germany, France
and Spain. Some countries have also licensed call-only Telepoint services,
such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK and France Telecom's
recently-launched Be-Bop service in Paris.
In the office environment, cordless systems have been somewhat slower to
take off than expected - perhaps because until recently they offered few if
any advantages over the fixed-wire systems they were supposed to replace.
However that could be changing.
Two competing digital alternatives have been developed, one based on the
established CT-2 'telepoint' standard and the other built around the
emerging Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard for
private cordless telecommunications.
Dataquest expects 10 to 15 per cent of office telephone systems to be
cordless in five years. Certainly, research suggests there is a market for
cordless pbx systems. About 60 per cent of business calls fail to reach
their intended recipient on the first attempt causing annoyance and
expensive games of 'telephone tag.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (1): Opportunities
galore - The UK telecoms sector, already Europe's most competitive, is about
to engage in a further bout of price-cutting and aggressive marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In assessing their telecoms needs and outgoings, never has it been harder
for companies to keep track of costs, competition and the potentiality of
new technology.
UK companies have a tougher job than most. Britain's telecoms sector,
already at the head of Europe's competition league, is about to engage in a
further bout of price-cutting and aggressive marketing as new entrants
establish themselves and established telecoms companies - not just the giant
BT, but Mercury and the two mobile operators Cellnet and Vodafone - fight to
keep their volumes and profits.
In telecoms, sorting the wood from the trees is made extraordinarily
difficult by the thick haze of acronyms and jargon obscuring the route at
every turn. It is not just new technology: as competition intensifies, so
does the complexity of tariff structures and the range of options and
services on the market.
For the finance director of a small or medium-sized company, who has to do
the phones, the balance sheet and the contract cleaning, bewilderment is
increasingly common.
Fortunately, a few rules of thumb will go a long way. First, virtually all
agree that prices have further to fall - in both the fixed-line and mobile
markets. Because much of the pressure for price reductions in the US and UK
is likely to come from new entrants, look carefully at anything they have to
offer - once you have checked the respectability of their operating
credentials. One simple test is: did their directors previously work for one
of the big telecoms companies?
Second rule of thumb: don't think you need to stick with just one or two
suppliers. For most business users, least-cost routeing software or 'smart
boxes' can take the pain out of call-by-call and day-to-day decisions on
users. In the mobile market, very favourable deals on offer from new
entrants with restricted networks - such as, in the London region, those of
Hutchison Telecom and Mercury One-2-One - could make it worthwhile for
companies to patronise more than one company, or even to give employees two
portable handsets.
The majority of PABX systems sold today either come with or are compatible
with least-cost routeing software. For those without it, but with compatible
systems, installation typically costs about Pounds 300. 'Smart' equipment is
more expensive and less reliable, but reliability is improving and for most
users the cost works out at about Pounds 100 a line.
In the fixed-line business, the best prices are often those from new
entrants re-selling leased lines and connecting them to private networks. A
telling case study is the rise of Worldcom, a London-based company plying
the international re-sale trade for the 18 past months. It now has more than
100 customers and expects to have 'a few thousand' by next year. Its rates
are highly competitive with BT and Mercury, particularly for transatlantic
traffic - and according to the Telecommunications Users' Association, there
have been virtually no complaints about reliability.
Worldcom is about to lease lines to Manchester, Birmingham, Heathrow and
Glasgow, making it economic for non-City of London companies to link up with
the operator. It also has a public network operators' licence pending; if it
secures one, it will be able to route calls over BT's network, giving it a
strong appeal even to smaller companies.
At the other end of the fixed-line market, the cable TV companies - many of
them with US parents anxious to learn the TV trade from which they are
barred at home - are fast establishing local telephone networks which could
soon challenge BT in conurbations.
The cable TV franchise operators currently have only 160,000 telephone
subscribers, and some made a shaky start. They also suffer from the absence
of number portability - an issue before Oftel, the industry regulator -
which makes it hazardous for companies to sever all connection with BT. But
the cable companies are still in the early stages of construction: once they
have reached the 15m in their franchise areas, BT's virtual monopoly of the
local network will be under serious threat. In the US, MCI, the
second-largest operator, now has about 18 per cent of long-distance traffic.
In the UK, BT has ceded nearly 10 per cent of the market - and half or more
of all outgoing traffic from the City of London - to Mercury.
Another two UK national networks are under construction. Ionica, a private
Cambridge-based company, is building a radio-based network for launch in
early 1995. Energis, a subsidiary of National Grid, is wrapping fibre-optic
around its pylons and is promising a price war with BT and Mercury as early
as next spring, with a network connecting 17 of Britain's leading towns and
cities. Energis will have to inter-connect with BT to convey its calls the
'last leg' but the cable companies offer the medium-term prospect of
avoiding BT even in much of the local loop.
It is the same story in the UK mobile market, where the huge margins of
Vodafone and Cellnet are coming under sustained assault. Hutchison's Rabbit
'telepoint' service may lack the flexibility of Vodafone and Cellnet but at
20p a peak-rate minute inside the M25 its tariffs are less than two-thirds
their standard rates. Mercury One-2-One is currently testing its PCN mobile
service; it plans to launch it within the M25 this summer with a peak rate
as low as 16p a minute and an access charge for high-volume users of about
Pounds 20 - although One-2-One handsets will cost slightly more than the
cheapest on offer from Cellnet and Vodafone.
With One-2-One's PCN network due to cover 24 per cent of the population by
April 1994, Vodafone and Cellnet can ill afford to sit by for long without
cutting their tariffs. So the fire alarm mentality of existing mobile users
('break seal to use') could soon be a thing of the past.
For most companies, getting the best price for existing services is a more
pressing priority than high-flown debates about the virtues of national
optical-fibre networks. Yet so rapid is the speed of change that to plan
even for the next two or three years companies must be familiar with the
main telecoms trends. Among those covered in the survey, two stand out: the
development of 'outsourcing' and the growth in value-added services.
At its most basic, outsourcing is the contracting out of part or all of a
company's telecoms network-facilities management to a telecoms carrier. It
is of particular appeal to companies anxious to modernise existing private
networks, and to multinationals looking for 'one-stop-shop' arrangements to
cater for their worldwide telecommunications needs.
Learning from US experience, in the UK both BT and Mercury are bidding for
domestic outsourcing contracts via facilities management units. BT is also
seeking to carve out a role for itself in the global outsourcing market
through a new Dollars 1bn joint venture with MCI launched earlier this
month, which will eventually subsume its Atlanta-based Syncordia subsidiary.
Mainland European operators have been slower off the mark.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have joined to establish an outsourcing
company of their own, Eunetcom, while the Swiss, Dutch and Swedish state
telecoms recently set up a joint venture, Unisource, to provide data
transmission services to European-based multinational companies, signing up
Sprint, the US carrier, to provide global links outside Europe.
Meanwhile, American Telephone and Telegraph last month launched its
Worldsource service aiming to provide a 'seamless' global telecoms service
through partnerships with national telecoms carriers region by region. It
has already signed up five Asia-Pacific carriers and is roaming Europe in
search of partners for its launch in Europe next year.
New services on offer range from plain paper fax machines able to send
low-priority faxes overnight, to advanced electronic data exchange
permitting users to exchange business documentation using standard
electronic forms, broadband services such as video-conferencing, and virtual
private networks which companies use to link switchboards on different
sites, even in different countries, and far more besides.
Remarkably, many of the once hidebound state telecoms utilities are leading
the way in turning technology into new services. In the US and UK, their
monopolies have been abolished; they are likely to be so soon in the rest of
Europe. So they can no longer sit back, keep their networks ticking over and
expect the profits to roll in regardless. For companies it offers
opportunities galore.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Tory party to return Nadir funds if they were stolen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party pledged yesterday to return money donated to it by Mr
Asil Nadir if the funds proved to be stolen as it emerged that the fugitive
businessman is 'most unlikely' to return to Britain to face trial this
September.
In the first court hearing before Mr Justice Tucker since the former Polly
Peck chairman jumped bail and fled to northern Cyprus, the Serious Fraud
Office also ruled out any trial of Mr Nadir in his absence.
However, the SFO announced it would continue criminal proceedings against Mr
John Turner, the former Polly Peck group accountant facing false accounting
charges.
Conservative party officials promised that the Pounds 440,000 donated to
party funds by companies associated with Mr Nadir would be repaid if it were
proved that the money had been stolen. They also denied reports that Mr
Nadir had made other secret donations to party funds.
In an unusual statement released last night, the party said it received a
total of Pounds 440,000 over five years, with the last contribution made in
March 1990.
'These donations were not made by Mr Nadir personally but by Polly Peck
International plc or Unipac Packaging Ltd,' it said. 'We know of no other
donations from Mr Nadir personally or from his companies.'
Asked about allegations that Mr Nadir might have hoped the donations would
secure him a knighthood, party officials said no one had received an honour
for donating to the Conservative party. The sale of honours would be a
criminal offence, they said.
Officials said the party did not accept donations from sources that were not
clearly identified.
But comments made last night by Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith, former director of
the party's treasury department, suggested this had not always been the
case. Sir Brian said he was 'very often' not aware of donors' identities.
In a crowded Old Bailey courtroom, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Mr Nadir's
barrister, said he had taken instructions from his client at 4pm on Monday.
'It is most unlikely he will be here for trial in September. I do not
propose to give reasons in open court,' he said.
Accepting the position, Mr Robert Owen QC, for the SFO, ruled out any
suggestion of putting Mr Nadir on trial in his absence.
'It would be entirely unprecedented. It would be entirely contrary to our
justice system. We submit it would be unthinkable,' he said. Mr Justice
Tucker agreed, saying such a move would not enhance the reputation of
British justice.
The judge also adjourned consideration of the possible forfeiting of Mr
Nadir's Pounds 3.5m bail sureties. The ownership of the Pounds 2m security
put up by Mr Nadir himself is currently the subject of an action in the
Chancery division of the High Court.

FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recently underperforming water sector staged a strong recovery as a
number of the market's big action funds began to switch out of some of the
generators and regional electricity stocks and into the waters. There was
also a widespread view among sector specialists that the utilities' strong
defensive qualities and the prospect of above average dividend increases in
the next few years would provide strong underlying support for the stocks.
The water issues in the FT-SE 100 Index were the brightest performers, with
North West Water following Monday's rise of 16 with a further gain of 9 to
462p. Anglian moved ahead 10 to 470p, Severn Trent 8 to 487p and Thames 3 to
471p.
Wessex Water's preliminary figures were at the top end of expectations,
dealers said, triggering an advance of 12 in the stock to 570p. Welsh Water
raced up 17 to 573p.
Manweb, the second of the 'recs' to produce preliminary numbers, touched
526p before slipping back to finish unchanged at 522p. The company topped
East Midland's 14 per cent dividend, increasing its payment by 15 per cent.

FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call upsets MEPC

<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE latest in the property sector's tide of rights issues
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a call for Pounds 221m from MEPC - took the shine off the sector, with the
shares sliding in line with MEPC's, which fell 8 to 414p in a volume of 6m.
The company's one-for-five at 350p rights move was largely greeted with
apathy by a sector which has now seen six major cash calls in three months.
Mr Alan Carter at James Capel said: 'We have come so far so fast and I think
we are seeing a bit of tiredness setting in now. It is the last of the big
rights issues and had been expected.'
Cash calls in property since March include Great Portland Estates (Pounds
95m); British Land (Pounds 132m); Hammerson (Pounds 199m); Brixton Estates
(Pounds 100.7m) and Slough Estates (Pounds 147.3m).
MEPC's rights issue, which one analyst calculated will knock down the
company's gearing from about 85 per cent to 70 per cent, is likely to make
MEPC a prime candidate for inclusion in the FT-SE 100 when the index is
reviewed in September.
A debt issue has not been ruled out by the company.
Continued profit-taking in the sector also contributed to a downbeat climate
which saw British Land give up 8 to 303p.
Among other property sector leaders, Brixton Estates lost 6 to 195p and
Great Portland retreated 4 to 177p.

FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares wilt as rate cut hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT bout of strength in the UK equity market, which has seen the
FT-SE 100 Index bump up against the top of its trading range, the 2,900
mark, evaporated yesterday as dealers decided that share prices have been
'overcooked' and that the scope for a further reduction in interest rates
had diminished.
Another substantial cash call, in the form of a Pounds 220m-plus rights
issue from MEPC, the property group, was a further depressant on the market,
as was a disappointing opening performance by Wall Street.
The more cautious view adopted by the market was further encouraged by
remarks made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. His comments
were read as indicating a determination to keep the lid on inflation.
Dealers signed off at the end of what was described as an uninspiring
session seeking, but not generally expecting, encouragement on the direction
of economic policy from Mr Clarke in his speech last night.
Stock prices settled around the day's lowest levels yesterday, although
traders said activity continued to contract from recent levels.
The equity market kicked off on a quiet note, with marketmakers opening
prices around their overnight levels, encouraged by a good showing by Wall
Street, and in spite of early news of MEPC's rights issue, the latest in a
long line of cash calls from a property sector boosted by hopes of an early
upturn and the recent intervention in the sector by Mr George Soros, the US
investment specialist.
What little early support was in evidence quickly evaporated in mid-morning
as a deterioration in the Footsie future took the ground from underneath the
cash market.
The day's substantial batch of economic numbers, on industrial output and
the Confederation of British Industry survey of distributive trades,
provided little incentive for a market seeking direction from the
chancellor's speech and awaiting the crucial May inflation numbers.
'It now seems that there is very little likelihood of a rate cut this week
unless the inflation figures are very, very good indeed, and by that I mean
no increase on the annual rate of inflation,' was the view of one City
economist.
Having started the session no more than a point easier, and enjoying a brief
move into positive territory during the first hour or so of trading, the
FT-SE 100 moved progressively lower, reaching the day's nadir of 2,869.7 as
Wall Street opened.
The US market performed disappointingly, especially after what was viewed as
a satisfactory May inflation figure. 'The CPI number means no short term
rise in US interest rates,' was the emphatic view from a London trader in
international stocks.
Share prices showed no inclination to rally towards the close, however, and
the FT-SE 100 Index finished 15.5 down on the day at 2,870.0. And the
market's overall disenchantment with the ever-diminishing rate cut story
upset the highly resilient FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which retreated from its
all-time high to end 8.1 off at 3,205.1.
Turnover in the market was a disappointing 512.3m shares, only marginally
above Monday's 500.1m, which was worth a fraction above Pounds 1bn in
customer business.

FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures gave up most of Monday's gains as hopes of a cut in
interest rates faded, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,895,
Monday's closing level, and pointed towards another strong session.
However, a feeling that cuts in interest rates were unlikely this week led
to selling of the contract. It fell further as independent traders (also
known as locals) went on the offer, and a poor gilts sector, which had
helped to underpin Monday's rise, also played its part in increasing the
downward spiral.
The release of better than expected industrial and manufacturing production
figures had no significant effect on trading. In the afternoon it was a poor
Wall Street opening that brought a further retreat in the June contract and
the day's low of 2,872 was seen at 3.30pm.
June closed at 2,878, an 8-point premium to the underlying cash market.
Volume in the June future was 9,864 lots, while 4,508 were dealt in the
September contract.
Business in the traded options remained uneventful, with volume only
slightly improving to 25,510 contracts. Some 9,006 were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option, which sees its June expiry today. The Euro FT-SE option was also
active and recorded a total of 2,689 trades. In the stock options, TSB led
the way with a total of 1,219 lots.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines in spite of good
inflation news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ANOTHER batch of good news on inflation failed to lift stock market
sentiment yesterday as blue chip issues fell and other stocks struggled to
hold their ground, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.69 down at 3,492.00. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.44 to 446.27, while the Nasdaq composite was up a slight
0.93 at 697.34. New York SE volume was 234m shares.
After last week's promising May producer prices report, which suggested that
inflationary pressures in the economy were not as strong as originally
feared, dealers and investors were hoping that yesterday's May consumer
prices data would prove a similar source of comfort.
In the event, the numbers were encouraging: the Labor Department announced
that the consumer prices index rose by only 0.1 per cent last month, and
that the 'core' measure of prices (which excludes the volatile food and
energy components) was up by 0.2 per cent. The figures were slightly better
than forecast, and probably rule out the likelihood of an interest rate rise
by the Federal Reserve.
The good news, however, did not persuade investors to buy stocks. Concern
about the weak state of the economy, the absence of a big upward move in
bond prices, and a sharp decline in some leading stocks, meant the Dow
performed poorly and other indices languished.
IBM fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 in volume of 3m shares after Salomon
Brothers warned that there might be further write-offs at the company, which
could lead to IBM halving its dividend.
Among other Dow constituents to suffer yesterday were Merck, down Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 38, and cyclical stocks International Paper, off Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 63 1/2 , and Aluminium Company of America, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at
Dollars 65 1/2 .
Eastman Kodak, which rose sharply on Monday in anticipation of a big
announcement from the company, receded Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 in
turnover of 2.9m shares after it revealed plans to spin off its Eastman
Chemical subsidiary.
HJ Heinz lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 after announcing a Dollars 192m
pre-tax restructuring charge for the fiscal fourth quarter, which depressed
after-tax earnings for the quarter to Dollars 69.7m, down from Dollars
145.7m a year ago.
Reebok plunged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 in busy trading as investors
reacted negatively to the company's warning that its second quarter earnings
will come in well below market estimates.
Tiffany jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 on the news that it will
assume marketing and merchandising for 29 stores currently operated in Japan
by Mitsukoshi.
Canada
TORONTO ended higher after fairly heavy trading, boosted by a sharp rise in
gold shares. The TSE 300 index gained 15.6 at 3,887.8 and rises led falls by
387 to 339 after volume of 59.5m shares valued at CDollars 585.2m.
Turnover included a block trade of about 5.4m Talisman Energy shares. The
golds sector index jumped 4.16 per cent as the New York spot gold price rose
USDollars 4.20 an ounce.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan shaken by more Ferruzzi
shock waves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR markets were weaker yesterday as Wall Street opened easier, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN continued to be affected by shock waves from Ferruzzi group companies,
while the end of the June account today also exerted a negative influence as
the Comit index lost 14.07 to 513.37.
An additional burden was placed on the Ferruzzi group following Monday's
post-bourse announcement of a L1,058bn, two-for-one rights issue from
Fondiaria, the country's third largest private-sector insurer.
Fondiaria is controlled jointly through the Gaic holding company by Ferruzzi
and the family of Mr Camillo De Benedetti, who died earlier this year. It
closed L2,742, or 10 per cent lower at L24,101 while Gaic was suspended to
the end of the session after it, too, fell by some 10 per cent.
Some analysts noted that since neither Gaic, nor the debt-laden Ferruzzi are
in a position to subscribe, the underwriting banks - Mediobanca, BCI, Banca
de Roma, Credito Italiano and San Paolo - would be left with effective
control of the insurer.
Ferruzzi closed yesterday down L68.80 at L593.50 while Montedison, which is
reported to be about to dispose of its Himont and Ausimont subsidiaries,
settled at L779, down L196.
FRANKFURT eased back, wary of the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow and the
'triple-witching' closure of DTB options contracts on Friday. The DAX index
fell 7.88 to 1,684.10 in turnover reported to be lower than Monday's
DM5.9bn.
The DTB effect was suspected in the performance of Commerzbank, which rose
by DM4 to DM303.50 against the market and against the sector - Deutsche Bank
fell DM4 to DM695.50 - and traded in 400,000 shares, four times its usual
volume on Ibis, the German screen-based dealing system.
In retailing, Karstadt and Kaufhof underperformed the market. Mr Roland
Wren, a dealer with James Capel in Frankfurt, said that both had climbed
recently on surprisingly good results, but that this was now old news and
investors were coming back to the study of cyclicals in the hope that German
recovery prospects will be a talking point after the summer.
PARIS eased back in technical trading and light turnover as the CAC-40 index
finished down 18.98 at 1,897.86. Turnover was some FFr1.9bn.
The oil sector was weak, in line with falling crude prices, with Elf down
FFr5.80 to FFr377.80 and Total losing FFr2.20 to FFr263.00.
Michelin slipped FFr3.50 to FFr144.00 on profit-taking after a recent strong
performance, while Peugeot was off FFr17 to FFr510 as investors began to
anticipate bad news at next week's annual meeting.
MADRID advanced, mostly late in the day, to its fourth consecutive gain
following its losses on the Socialist election victory. The general index
closed 1.40 higher at 259.89 in turnover of Pta16.5bn.
Mr Peter McGahan of Schroder Securities said that a major Spanish bank
executed some fairly large UK orders for banks, and Repsol. BBV rose Pta50
to Pta3,115 and Repsol Pta65 to Pta3,290.
ZURICH extended its period of profit-taking, the SMI index falling another
20.2 to 2,274.0. Nestle lost SFr9 to SFr1,092, SBC SFr7 to SFr383 in a weak
banking sector and, elsewhere in financials, Swiss Re dropped SFr100 to
SFr3,050.
AMSTERDAM rose modestly, helped by DSM's Fl 2.00 gain to Fl 88.20 on recent
positive comment for cyclical stocks.
However, Hoogovens, which has a done well over the last few days, lost Fl
1.30 to Fl 32.40 as some investors decided that it was time to take profits.
The CBS Tendency index advanced 0.3 to 108.7.
Another strong performer was Fokker, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 15.90, after
announcing orders for new aircraft.
STOCKHOLM rose on US buying with the financial sector gaining 4.8 per cent
and the Affarsvarlden general index 5.50 to 1,075.70.
TEL AVIV reversed a sharp two-day decline after the Israeli prime minister,
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, quashed rumours that the government would soon impose a
capital gains tax.
The Mishtanim blue chip shares index jumped 5.77, or 2.9 per cent to 202.43
in turnover of Shk195m.
ISTANBUL failed to break through the 10,000 level as the index closed 43.69
higher at 9,804.36 with investors continuing to react positively to the

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls back 1.7% as
the yen continues to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STALEMATE over the government's political reform policy, compounded with a
further rise in the yen, dis-couraged investors, and the Nikkei average fell
1.7 per cent on selling by margin traders and investment trusts, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 351.47 off at the day's low of 20,045.88, having
registered a high for the session of 20,393.23 in the morning.
Volume was 350m shares, against Monday's 261m. Sales were spread across the
board, with declines overwhelming advances by 1,037 to 73, with 61 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 39.58 to
1,619.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.45 to 1,216.32.
The dollar closed at a new low of Y105.03, down Y0.17, after briefly falling
below Y105. Active buying by the Bank of Japan, however, supported the
dollar. Traders said a fall of the Nikkei through 20,000, due to a further
rise in the yen, would heighten calls for a cut in the official discount
rate.
Investors turned sellers as uncertainty over the passage of the political
reform bill intensified, prompting fears that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister, who vowed political reform, would be forced to resign. Concern
that such developments might affect the economic planning ability of the
government unnerved investors.
Exporters continued to face selling. Toshiba lost Y24 to Y690, NEC Y15 to
Y985 and Toyota Motor Y70 to Y1,570.
Banks, which had been recent gainers on speculation of an imminent interest
rate cut, retreated on profit-taking: Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y100
to Y2,940, while Sumitomo Bank receded Y70 to Y2,280.
Other interest rate-sensitive issues were also down, with Nippon Steel, the
day's most active issue, losing Y13 at Y392 and NKK slipping Y10 to Y323.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y13,000 to Y946,000 on margin selling.
Daiei, the country's largest supermarket chain, which announced plans to
absorb three retailing affiliates, dropped Y90 to Y1,060.
Securities companies lost ground, with the sector, the top loser of the day,
down 3.9 per cent.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 558.13 to 22,376.46 in volume of 18.5m
shares.
Roundup
AMONG THE region's markets profit-taking was much in evidence.
HONG KONG closed slightly higher as afternoon profit-taking trimmed early
gains, with the market awaiting news from Sino-British talks in Beijing on
the colony's political future.
The Hang Seng index finished 16.72 firmer at 7,283.46 after climbing 81
points early in the day. Turnover was moderate at HKDollars 4.3bn.
SEOUL slipped back for the fifth consecutive session, the composite index
losing 1.63 to 757.84, off the day's high of 761.63. Turnover contracted to
Won539.6bn.
TAIWAN reversed early losses to end moderately higher on cautious bargain
hunting after recent falls.
The weighted index, which had dropped more than 25 points in early trading,
closed a net 21.10 up at 4,198.30. Turnover shrank to TDollars 10.2bn.
MANILA fell back as many investors awaited imminent new public listings. The
composite index lost 12.85 to 1,568.42 in turnover of 202.6m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR continued to decline, the composite index shedding 3.74 to
739.42. Volume was 494.8m shares, against Monday's 811.9m. In SINGAPORE the
Straits Times Industrial index weakened 23.00 to 1,819.63.
AUSTRALIA traded in a tight range in spite of a weaker gold bullion price.
The All Ordinaries index put on 9.7 at 1,724.0 in ADollars 45.5m turnover.
NEW ZEALAND was led higher by an 8-cent gain in Fletcher Challenge to
NZDollars 2.74. The NZSE-40 index advanced 7.13 to 1,637.00 in light
turnover of NZDollars 19.0m.
BANGKOK was mixed as investors sold major property shares to take profits.
The SET index gained 2.93 at 871.17 in active turnover of Bt6.42bn.
Krung Thai Bank, whose Bt10 par shares will start trading today, rose Bt10
to Bt396 and was the most active stock.
BOMBAY fell sharply on reports that a stockbroker at the centre of the
country's biggest financial scandal had offered to turn state's witness to
testify about possible pay-offs to leading politicians. The BSE index
declined 68.41 to 2,289.13.

FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Catastrophes enrich the top reinsurers
 -Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re have put on speed recently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyed by tightening capacity and rising reinsurance premium rates, Munich
Re and Swiss Re, the world's first and second biggest reinsurance companies,
can look forward to a period of rising prosperity. Their shares have surged
ahead strongly in recent months.
On past experience the 'turn' in the insurance cycle augurs well for the
reinsurers. Between 1984 and 1986, the last time reinsurance rates rose
significantly, the share prices of Munich Re and Swiss Re doubled relative
to their local stock markets and tripled in absolute terms.
With the reinsurance market in a similar state of buoyancy today, reinsurers
could be embarked on a similar bull run. Underpinning the upturn is a fall
in the capital committed to reinsurance markets, following a sharp growth in
the frequency and cost of natural catastrophes. The cost of major storms in
the 10 years between 1983 and 1992 escalated to Dollars 52.1bn compared with
Dollars 18.9bn between 1980 and 1989.
The failure of many Lloyd's syndicates and smaller London market companies -
which acted as 'reinsurers of last resort' - has reduced drastically the
supply of high level excess of loss reinsurance, leading to cumulative rate
increases of up to 800 per cent for high level catastrophe reinsurance over
the past four years, and more moderate rises across the board.
Messrs Michael Huttner and Angus Runciman, analysts with BZW Research,
estimate that capital available to back reinsurance premiums has fallen by
some Pounds 4.8bn over the last three years. 'The hard market,' BZW
predicts, 'will be sustained for the next three years at least.'
The collapse of the London market has led to a 'flight to quality' by buyers
seeking greater security from reinsurance companies. BZW expects bigger
companies to dominate a 'two-tier market', with the market share of the
world's top 15 reinsurers winning market share at the expense of smaller
competitors.
Reflecting these new market conditions, shares of reinsurers have begun to
rise strongly. Last month the share price of Munich Re's registered stock
reached DM3,220, an increase of more than 30 per cent from their 1992
average of DM2,510 and in excess of 50 per cent from their 1992 low of
DM2,065. The price of Swiss Re's registered shares touched SFr3,100 in
mid-April, nearly 50 per cent above their 1992 average price of SFr2,322.50.
Analysts are almost uniformly bullish. Mr Tom Bennett, of Paribas Capital
Markets, says that following its strong performance in recent months, Munich
Re has a further dimension as a heavily discounted investment trust, with
its net worth of more than DM5,000 per share based largely on a strong
portfolio of German equity investments.
BZW suggests that 'Munich Re . . . would probably outsurvive its competitors
in the event of the worst possible event (for the reinsurance markets), a
Tokyo earthquake' and also recommends investors to buy SCOR, the smaller
French reinsurance company, as well as Swiss Re.
Mr Peter Constable, an analyst with Flemings Research, also favours Swiss
Re, which has recently refocused on to its core reinsurance business,
following an ill-fated diversification into service companies in the 1980s.
He says the company will be a major beneficiary from recent rate increases.
But with foreigners still unable to buy the company's registered shares, and
bearer shares thin on the ground, Mr Constable recommends that large
investors buy participating certificates issued by the company.
Mr Constable, however, sounds a cautious note on Munich Re. He says the
company's results in the past two years have been supported by a release of
provisions in 1990 and 1991 and by 'abnormally large' realised gains in 1991
and 1992.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Awaiting Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME money market dealers yesterday moved towards the view that the
Bundesbank could cut interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting this
week, writes James Blitz.
The D-Mark has remained soft inside the European exchange rate mechanism in
recent days, adding to spec-ulation that the Bundesbank might resist
lowering interest rates, a move that would allow the currency to depreciate
further.
But comments earlier this week from Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief
economist, have led some dealers to think that the Bundesbank might ease
monetary policy tomorrow for the first time in a month.
Mr Issing said that M3 money supply figures for May - due out this week -
should fall inside the Bundesbank's target range, having badly overshot the
parameters in April. The tone of the remarks contrasted with the hawkishness
of his colleagues earlier this month.
Moreover, there has been no overt hawkishness from the Bundesbank in the
run-up to this council meeting. 'If the Bundesbank were going to leave rates
unchanged, you might have expected them to soften up the market first,'
commented a dealer.
Yesterday's announcement that there will be a variable rate tender for funds
over 14 days and 28 days gave no clues as to what the Bundesbank will do
with the repo rate today. However, call money applied no pressure on the
repo, the lowest accepted rate for which is 7.60 per cent. Call money was
several basis points more expensive yesterday, at 7.85 per cent, as June tax
payments started to drain funds from the market.
Euromark futures were bullish for rate cuts. The September contract closed
at 93.30, up 4 basis points on the day, and pricing nearly 100 basis points
off three-month money in the next 12 weeks.
Sterling markets were quiet in anticipation of the UK chancellor of the
exchequer's Mansion House speech yesterday.
The September short sterling contract declined one basis point on the day,
finishing at 94.17. The June contract, which expires today, closed in line
with three-month money at 94.06.
The three-month cash rate ended  1/16 softer at 5 7/8 per cent, following
the swift despatch of a Pounds 1bn shortage in the discount market.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Gaddum softens D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR gained more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after a
Bundesbank council member hinted that there could be another reduction in
official German interest rates this week, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks, Bundesbank officials have been hawkish about the prospect
of more monetary easing in Germany, because of fears of inflation, the
weakness of the D-Mark and the growing German money supply. Indeed, the last
easing in German monetary policy came more than a month ago, when the repo
rate was cut to 7.60 per cent.
Yesterday, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the directorate member responsible for
credit market operations, changed the mood, saying a slowdown in the pace of
German money supply expansion could give the Bundesbank room to lower
interest rates.
This was seen by dealers as a strong indication that the M3 money supply
figures might fall within the 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target band set by the
Bundesbank. In the first four months of the year, M3 expanded at a
seasonally adjusted and annualised 7.0 per cent.
In the European afternoon, the dollar rose sharply against the D-Mark on the
back of these comments. Initially the dollar had weakened to below DM1.62
after the US consumer price inflation data for May showed a monthly rise of
0.1 per cent, against market forecasts of 0.2 per cent.
This underlined expectations that the Federal Reserve would not lean towards
tightening short-term interest rates to curb inflation. But Mr Gaddum's
comments reversed the trend: the dollar peaked at DM1.6413 and finished at
DM1.6375, up more than a pfennig on the day. In New York it ended higher at
DM1.6460.
The US currency's strength helped to reverse another strong performance by
the yen in Tuesday's Asian trading.
The yen hit a post-war high of Y104.75 per dollar in Far Eastern trading.
But this was seen as a strong technical resistance barrier, and it lost
ground in the European morning, dipping to Y105.88. In New York it closed at
Y105.85.
There were strong rumours in London that the Bundesbank and other European
central banks were intervening on behalf of the dollar. But these rumours
could not be confirmed, and it was far from clear that it was in the
Bundesbank's interest to support the dollar at the current time.
European currency trading was thin, although the D-Mark showed some signs of
weakness at the start of the European day, dropping to minus 17 percentage
points against its divergence indicator.
Sterling rose most noticeably against the D-Mark, boosted by a Confederation
of British Industry survey which showed that retailers were more optimistic
about business prospects over the next three months than at any time since
February 1987. The pound closed at DM2.4925 from a previous DM2.4800.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt attacks Lome convention
over bananas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor and CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON,, KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOME convention of preferential trading arrangements between European
Community members and their former colonies is expected to face its greatest
threat today, as a dispute panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) condemns the convention as contrary to international trade
rules.
In what was being described yesterday as its hardest hitting report ever,
the Gatt panel is expected to uphold on all counts a challenge from Latin
American banana exporters that the EC's preferential banana import regime
for developing country members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific
grouping is discriminatory, and at odds with fair trade rules.
The EC and a group of ACP countries were planning yesterday to block the
panel report from being adopted by the Gatt Council when it meets this
afternoon.
But there was no disguising their consternation over the ruling.
'The report is drastic in its implications,' one banana trade expert noted.
'It will affect not just Lome countries, but any developing countries that
have preferential trading arrangements with specific groups of countries.'
The Gatt dispute panel, established in February after a complaint filed by
Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela, ruled that the
Lome arrangement could not be defended as a free trade agreement, or customs
union, since the concessions are just one way.
It also rejected the EC defence that these preferences were allowable for
developing countries - arguing they benefit just a small group of countries,
and discriminate against a large number of developing countries. The basic
Gatt principle of 'most favoured nation' status demands that preferences
extended to any one country or group of countries cannot be withheld from
others.
The panel offered a lifeline to the EC by saying it could seek a formal
waiver from Gatt rules to defend its Lome commitments. The US has obtained
waivers for various preferential trade arrangements which it recognises as
falling outside international trade rules - not least its accord with
signatories to the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
The EC was yesterday predicting it would successfully weather this
afternoon's storm, not just because they could block adoption of the panel
report, but because it applied to a banana trade regime that is due to be
replaced on July 1.
The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a
2m tonne per year quota for Latin American fruit, and that this will attract
duty of Ecu100 per tonne. Imports of Latin American fruit above this level
will attract a duty of Ecu850 per tonne.
This will bring brief comfort, however. The Latin American banana exporters
are expected to win approval at today's council for a new panel examining
the new banana import regime. Much energy will be spent by Caribbean
exporters aimed at ensuring the panel is forced to deliberate for six
months, rather than follow an accelerated three-month procedure. They hope
this would allow the new banana regime to become safely established.
'The most important element of our strategy now is to avoid at all cost the
fast track procedure which will be requested by the Latin American countries
when they request a second panel to look at the regulations governing the
banana regime,' said Mr George Brizan, Grenada's agriculture minister.
ACP banana exporters face a further serious hurdle on Friday this week when
the European Court of Justice hears a demand from German banana importers
for an injunction delaying introduction of the new regime.
Germany has in the past largely imported 'dollar bananas' from Latin
America, and has been deeply unhappy about new single market arrangements
which would force importers to share the cost of the ACP preference scheme,
significantly raising the price of bananas for Germans, who are among the
world's largest consumers of the fruit.
Some ACP members were also complaining yesterday that the banana panel
ruling 'somewhat pre-empts' the work of a Gatt working party inquiring into
the Lome convention, which is on the agenda to be established at today's
council meeting.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Derivative products help to cap
gold price rises - The impact of an ever widening range of derivative
products on the global market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EVER widening range of derivative products brought an estimated 86 tonnes
of gold on to the market last year, the Financial Times World Gold
Conference in Istanbul was told yesterday.
While not a huge amount, this was sufficient to cap any price rallies,
especially in the short term, said Ms Jessica Jacks, an economist with RTZ.
The figure would have been much higher if new business from options and
other derivatives had not been offset by a reduction of almost 115 tonnes in
outstanding gold loans.
At the end of last year the total amount of gold associated with outstanding
producer derivatives was 1,215 tonnes, up from 1,130 tonnes in 1991, Ms
Jacks estimated.
Options increased from 203.5 tonnes in 1991 to 282.4 tonnes last year, while
other derivatives increased by 156 tonnes in the same period. At the same
time forward sales fell from just over 280 tonnes to 244.9 tonnes.
Average realised prices hedged for this year were Dollars 385 a troy ounce
for Australian producers and Dollars 370 for North American producers. 'Bear
in mind that at the end of 1991, the average weighted hedged prices well
exceeded Dollars 400 in both Australia and North America,' Ms Jacks said.
'Throughout 1992, therefore, the producers accepted lower and lower hedged
prices.'
If the gold price were to rally and stabilise around Dollars 420, 'a number
of mining companies could begin to feel a little less than happy with their
hedged positions,' said Ms Jacks.
A survey of mining companies showed that for a large majority the percentage
of their production already hedged and their planned output were the main
determinants in their decision making. 'The dollar price and local price of
gold surprisingly ranked only third,' she said.
Most mining companies said they would be prepared to buy back their forward
sales, although most did not consider they were over-hedged.
Many had been offered exotic options, but relatively few made use of them
because they did not fully understand the principles and pricing mechanisms
of the instruments.
She said creators of exotic options should be wary of over-complicating the
product or the way it was presented.
The past 18 months had also seen the emergence of between 10 and 20 central
banks as option granters, Ms Jacks said. By writing call options, they
earned a premium, giving some return on their gold reserves. About 466
tonnes of gold was thought to be involved.
It was impossible to predict what sort of 'weird and wonderful' instruments
would emerge in the future, Ms Jacks said. 'For each price profile, thrre is
considerable latitude for highly complex products, each with a specific
application and target market. Declining prices or sharply increasing prices
lend themselves to a derivative of some description.'
Mr Ian MacDonald, precious metals marketing manager at Credit Suisse, told
the conference the availability of over-the-counter options and derivatives
had revolutionised the gold market. A typical trader would no longer say his
biggest client was a central bank or mining house - but the options
department of his own company.
He described the main effects of the derivatives on the gold market as:
The prolongation of existing market trends, or the acceleration of new
trends.
Increased trading in gold, rather than holding it as a long term asset.
Increased sophistication of market operators - including banks, mines,
central banks, investors, institutions and hedge funds.
The setting up of hedging and speculative positions for small capital
outlay.
Turning to the recent gold rally, Mr MacDonald said the markets had a habit
of going after volume. The largest volume in the option book had been the
Dollars 400 and Dollars 450 strikes, he said.
'Therefore it is highly likely that at some point a move over Dollars 400 is
to be expected because of the sheer volume of calls that have been written.'
Mr Frank Veneroso, a partner in Omega Advisors, suggested that the widening
gap between supply and demand could force the price sharply perhaps to
Dollars 1,000 a troy ounce in the next five years.
The supply over five years from world mines and scrap might be expected to
expand by 10 per cent to perhaps 3,000 tonnes a year. But demand excluding
Western investment would grow by 6 to 7 per cent each year to almost 5,000
tonnes a year.
Such a gap would lead to a real price of Dollars 700 at 1992 prices - or
Dollars 850 after inflation of around 3 to 4 per cent a year. Market
equilibrium would then take it through to 1,000 a troy ounce, he suggested.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for gold at record
levels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for gold from regional markets in the Middle East, India, South-east
Asia and China was at record levels again last year, helping to digest the
highest level of central bank sales since 1968, Mr Timothy Green, chief
consultant to Gold Fields Mineral Services, told the conference. In the
first quarter of this year, with gold around Dollars 330 a troy ounce,
demand was soaring to even higher levels. 'The price simply had to get to a
higher trading range to cool the physical demand,' he said. 'In my view we
would otherwise have been heading for global demand of not far short of
4,000 tonnes this year on mine output of about 2,200 tonnes.'
The regional markets were price sensitive so the demand would not be
sustained, he said. Nevertheless, they provided a genuine floor, and
indicated when people in many currencies regarded gold as cheap.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dairy farmers look forward to
higher prices for milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY FARMERS can look forward to higher prices for their milk when the
market is liberalised and the Milk Marketing Board is abolished in April
next year, according to Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the MMB.
'European milk prices are a lot higher than ours - only three countries pay
prices as low as in the UK - and most UK milk is of a higher quality than
the lower fat European varieties,' Mr Dare said. He expects farmers to see
an additional couple of pence per litre for their milk in spite of an
over-supply in the market.
Interest from farmers in the Milk Marque - the planned successor to the MMB
 -has been encouraging and the board hopes to be able to sign up 80 per cent
of farmers for the new voluntary co-operative.
Some food companies are setting up schemes to buy milk directly from
farmers, but Mr Dare said these were asking farmers to adopt a high risk
strategy by linking themselves to the fortunes of just one customer.
This year's milk price to farmers is 22p per litre and is likely to rise to
23p per litre by the beginning of next year, Mr Dare said.
The MMB's costs came to 1.4p per litre of which 1.1p goes on transport.
Announcing the MMB's annual accounts, Mr Dare said last year had produced a
surplus of Pounds 2.31bn for producers compared with Pounds 2.23bn the year
before.
The amount of milk sold by the MMB dropped slightly by one per cent to just
over 11m litres. The doorstep market for milk declined 7 per cent but this
was compensated by an increase in shop sales.
The number of milk producers, however, continued to decline last year when
the number of registered dairy farmers dropped by 2.6 per cent.

<TEXT>
The GOLD market firmed yesterday, shrugging off signs that US inflation
pressure might be easing. Having dipped early on by Dollars 1 the London
bullion market price rallied to close Dollars 1.80 up on the day at Dollars
365.75 a troy ounce. 'I think the market got itself a bit short and when
buying came in, people ran for cover,' one dealer said. After the price
bounce another dealer commented: 'I would regard anything around Dollars 363
(the low reached in the initial fall) as an opportunity to buy'. At the
London Metal Exchange the TIN market came under renewed pressure as traders
became increasingly concerned over rising stocks, growing production and
sluggish demand. A slide through Dollars 5,100 a tonne for three months
metal triggered stop-loss selling and the price ended at a 20-year low of
Dollars 5,070 a tonne, down Dollars 90. London's robusta COFFEE market
reversed an early setback to end Dollars 2 up on the day in the September
futures position, at Dollars 922 a tonne, near the middle of the recent
trading range. The COCOA market remained quiet with nearby futures contracts
scoring small gains.

A representative of the New York Mercantile Exchange said the cause of the
computer disruption had not been determined.
The exchanges are located in the World Trade Centre building, which was
subject to a terrorist bomb blast in February.
All the exchanges had managed to open by 11.30 EDT and said the shortened

FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe tobacco growers face
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S TOBACCO growers meet in Harare today at a time of deepening
crisis in their industry.
With a quarter of the 1993 crop having been sold on the Harare auction
floors, the tobacco price is averaging 94 US cents a kilogram, down 43 per
cent on last year's average and more than 70 per cent below the record
USDollars 3.25 a kilogram, achieved in 1991.
Last week, Mr Ian Alcock, President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association,
which represents growers, told farmers to cut production by between 30 and
35 per cent. He said the industry should produce a 1994 crop no larger than
150m kg, compared with the 230m kg estimated for this year.
The ZTA is likely to come in for sharp criticism from some growers for its
failure to keep them better informed on world market trends. But the
association will argue - with some justification - that the swing from a
sellers market to one of overproduction and oversupply was very sudden and
all other producing nations were caught out in the same way.
So far this year, 55m kg of flue-cured tobacco have been sold on the
auctions - 24 per cent of the forecast crop of some 225m kg.
In the past prices have tended to harden markedly in July and August, when
the high quality leaf comes on to the floors, but growers and merchants say
this is not going to happen to anything like the same extent this year.
Price forecasts for the season range between a high of USDollars 1.20 and a
low of Dollars 1 a kilogram.
The tobacco crisis has far-reaching implications for the economy. It means
there will be negligible growth in the country's economy and exports will
grow only marginally, if at all. The build-up of a tobacco stockpile of
about 160m kg this year will impose new strains on the banks, which will not
only have to carry tobacco growers through a second difficult season after
last year's drought, but will be called upon to finance a stockpile worth
more than USDollars 1.5bn. This is likely to mean that interest rates will
remain high for the rest of the year, thereby exacerbating the squeeze on
farm cash flows and making it difficult for tobacco growers to diversify.
One forecast suggests that the tobacco sector will lose some USDollars 50m
in 1993.
There are no obvious diversification opportunities. Many tobacco growers
will probably switch into maize, raising the spectre of a re-run of the
1980s crisis when Zimbabwe built up a massive stockpile of maize, which it
could not afford to maintain and was unable to export.
Maize industry experts are warning growers against this, pointing out that
the maximum export market for the industry is probably in the region of
300,000 tonnes.
The beef industry is in serious trouble with weak demand at home and abroad
and farmers continuing to destock with serious implications for long-term
production. Horticulture is constrained by high transport costs, while
profitability in cotton is uninspiring.
With industry leaders warning that the crisis will last for another two or
three seasons, the locomotive that has driven the Zimbabwe economy for much
of the past 40 years seems to have run out of steam.
Perhaps even more disturbing are the signs that agriculture, as a whole,
faces a difficult period over the next few years, highlighting the urgent
need - from Zimbabwe's viewpoint - for an upturn in metal prices.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (10): Protection for a unique legacy -
Focus on Napier, Hawke Bay province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAPIER, the capital of Hawke Bay province on the east coast of New Zealand's
North Island, is a hidden jewel with a tragic history and a glorious, but
little known, architectural heritage.
The mid-summer sun was shining brightly on February 3, 1931 when an
earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale hit the town without warning,
demolishing most of the commercial district. The two and a half minute
series of tremors killed 258 people throughout Hawke Bay, including 162 in
Napier, then a town of just 16,000, and 93 in Hastings, a few kilometres to
the south.
The disaster stunned New Zealand, then still a frontier society with less
than 100 years of European settlement behind it. But within two years, both
Napier and Hastings were rebuilt. The result is one of the best collections
of 1930s buildings in the world, including dozens of excellent examples in
the Art Deco, Stripped Classical and Spanish Mission styles typical of the
decade.
Napier is especially valuable because its devastated town centre was rebuilt
to a coherent plan by a group of forward-looking local architects for whom
the modern styles represented a break with the tragic past.
Amazingly, the town's unique architectural legacy was virtually ignored
until the mid-1980s, when the proposed demolition of a particularly fine
building prompted the formation of an Art Deco Trust to defend the
buildings. Mr Robert McGregor, chief executive, says 11 buildings were
demolished in the 1980s. A conservation-minded council has introduced
planning guidelines to encourage refurbishment, but the threat of further
demolition remains.
'Some of the buildings that were knocked down were not greatly important,
but our argument is that any building which is lost creates a gap in the
smile. It's like losing a front tooth - you still have all your other teeth,
but it ruins your appearance,' says Mr McGregor.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (8): Trade barriers still trouble
farmers - Profits from agriculture generally remain low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURAL and primary products remain the mainstay of New Zealand's
export efforts, and with access problems remaining in many key markets, the
country is pinning its hopes on a satisfactory outcome of the GATT Uruguay
round.
From the mid-1980s the country energetically removed all forms of farming
tax incentives and farmer support systems, hoping to prove to the world that
New Zealand could be a model of efficiency and show what an
agriculturally-based economy could achieve in a liberalised trading
environment.
Profitability is gradually returning to the sector, after a difficult
transition period, when many farmers were forced to leave their properties
because of financial difficulties compounded by high interest and exchange
rates.
Today most farmers welcome the reforms, arguing through their representative
body, Federated Farmers, that they are succeeding through a combination of
hard work, efficient practices, and low inflation. Average farm profits
remain low, however, especially for wool and beef farmers.
New Zealand continues to run into trade barriers, such as the decision by
the US authorities to cut the quota for beef imports from 214,000 to 194,000
tonnes this year.
Access problems continue for lamb exports to the EC. Despite a quota of
200,000 tonnes, exporters believe strong demand could easily see New Zealand
supplying 250,000 tonnes this year.
In dairying, New Zealand is severely limited in the amount of cheese it can
supply Britain, and faces a quota for butter. The New Zealand authorities
attach great importance to further reform in the GATT round. This month,
Trade Negotiations Minister Philip Burdon warned against pressure to 'water
down' measures to liberalise world agricultural trade. He said any outcome
that reduced any of the proposals was unacceptable to New Zealand and other
members of the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations.
'We have already made concessions and must be very firm in resisting any
further reduction in the draft agreement,' he said.
Privately, New Zealand negotiators are confident of a satisfactory outcome.
However, no one expects it to solve all New Zealand's problems. For example,
the removal of the present US quota system for beef would open up that
market to imports from South American countries who are making strenuous
attempts to eliminate foot and mouth disease.
The New Zealand agricultural scene presents a complex picture: producers of
some commodities are achieving high profits, while others continue to
struggle. High lamb prices in Europe and elsewhere have proved a bonanza to
some farmers.
New Zealand has had an extended summer of warm temperatures and light rain
which has been perfect for lamb production. Farmers have been holding back
stock from meat companies to get the best price. In turn, this is leading to
difficulties for the companies to fill orders from the UK and elsewhere, and
they are being forced to pay exceptionally high prices for lambs at
livestock sales.
With a positive outlook for the next 18 months for sheepmeat prices, the
price of a lamb has doubled since last year from around NZDollars 25 to
NZDollars 50. However, the same farmer is receiving remarkably low prices
for fleece wool, due to the international recession. It is estimated that
real wool prices are at their lowest level since the 1930s.
In the US, the quota system has led to a big rise in prices for New Zealand
beef at market, which are an important ingredient in the hamburger trade.
Last year the US took 76 per cent of New Zealand's beef production. This
year it is taking 55 per cent. Supply problems in the US has led to the
equivalent of a NZ 70 cent rise in the American market price in the past six
months to around NZDollars 5.35 a kilogram.
However, this apparent bonanza benefitting New Zealand farmers, as the
export companies are being forced to sell the remaining 45 per cent at lower
prices elsewhere in the world, where they are running into competition from
US exports.
Exports of fruit also present a confusing pattern. The abundant supplies of
fruit of all types last year in the important European market, coupled with
the loss of the US market led to big headaches for kiwifruit producers.
Returns from kiwifruit tumbled from NZDollars 1bn to NZDollars 500m causing
serious problems for the newly formed Kiwifruit Marketing Board which has
ended up in financial difficulties.
The board is hoping that a smaller crop this year will eventually lead the
industry to recover. Last year apple exporters earned exceptionally good
money: most of their crop was sold in European and other markets before the
glut of European fruit depressed prices.
So far this season New Zealand apples are selling well in Europe, especially
the new varieties, but there is some concern at how more traditional
varieties - such as Granny Smiths - will sell, due to increased competition
from South Africa and other producers.
There is optimism that the agreement last month which saw the Japanese
government agree to import New Zealand apples, will lead to good returns for
orchardists over the next five years. This was a significant breakthrough:
New Zealand is now the only country apart from Korea allowed to sell apples
to Japan.
Last year New Zealand earned NZDollars 1.3bn from exporting fish, the first
time the total had passed the Dollars 1bn mark. While optimism remains high
that the industry will be earning Dollars 2bn a year by the end of the
decade, the Fishing Industry Board warned last month that earnings would
probably fall this year because of the depth of the northern hemisphere
recession which is depressing prices for some varieties.
In recent months, however, forestry has turned out to be a real bonanza for
farmers and others. Environmental problems in the US and Asia led to a
quadrupling of the prices of some timber. While prices have since fallen
back sharply, the price of a New Zealand radiata log is still fetching
NZDollars 425 a cubic metre compared with NZDollars 150 this time last year.
New Zealand is a world leader in farming timber. Thanks to its warm climate
with ample rain, trees flourish, and reach maturity in 20 to 25 years. With
forecasts of growing supply problems over the coming years, especially in
Asia, confidence is high that forestry will continue to pay handsome
dividends.
This is leading many farmers to transform large parts of their farms to
farming radiata pine trees - a process that is making a dramatic difference
in the New Zealand landscape.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (9): A supplier to niche markets -
Manufacturing has responded to the new economic climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING industry is recovering from the sharp shocks it received over
the past decade as a result of the efforts by successive governments to
restructure the economy.
The real value of sales grew 6.7 per cent in 1992, a complete rebound from
the 6.3 per cent contraction in 1991.
The latest figures from the Manufacturers' Federation show that the ratio of
pre-tax profits to sales in the 1992 year was 7.4 per cent, up from 6.4 per
cent in 1990. The general manufacturing sector showed real growth in exports
of 15.1 per cent compared with 1.7 per cent in 1990, and some industries
were facing capacity constraints. The sector has also seen the first growth
in employment, and hours worked for six years.
However, the federation's survey says that the sector's biggest worry has
been the growing amount of imports in the domestic market. Industry had
already taken a series of knocks from 1980 onwards as the National
government moved slowly towards tariff reductions, especially in textiles.
It received a setback from 1984, when the the reformist Labour government,
virtually overnight and without warning, decided to deregulate the economy
and open it to import competition, with the aim of making the industry focus
on exports.
From 1960 manufacturing had expanded strongly under the combined stimulus of
import protection and a range of government incentives, aimed at
securingDevelopment full employment and economic diversification.
The changes in the 1980s severely damaged industry morale, and led a number
of international companies to relocate their factories to Australia and
elsewhere where tax and other incentives were available. Many industries
became uncompetitive, and their owners closed them down.
Industry's efforts to respond to the new environment created by these
changes was, furthermore, hampered by the combined effects of financial
sector deregulation, and the subsequent share market boom, which saw the
channelling of investment towards speculative endeavours.
The Labour government, too, deliberately ran a high exchange rate policy in
an unsuccessful attempt to control domestic interest rates and inflation.
The domestic market entered a severe recession from 1988, and the
manufacturing sector was also struggling against the Labour government's
reluctance, or slowness, to deregulate other markets, such as labour,
transport and shipping. The high value of the dollar led to a flood of
imports, which were by then virtually uncontrolled.
Peter Coakley, of the manufacturing advisory group said in a recent detailed
report that the first signs of industry recovering began to be noted in
1989, as the benefits of the economic reforms became stronger and new export
oriented strategies of manufacturers began to generate results.
'For a time this was masked by continuing retraction in various parts of the
sector due to imports, but the extent of the new competitiveness in
manufacturing is evident from its increased competitiveness, rising
confidence, and the resurgence of exports across a substantial part of the
sector in the past year.'
The present National party government has provided two important benefits to
the sector. One has been a relaxation in the Reserve Bank's inflation
target, which was given an extra year to reach nil inflation. This allowed
it to relax monetary policy and led to a fall in the value of the Kiwi
dollar.
In recent weeks, however, the value of the Kiwi dollar has risen strongly,
owing to improving economic signals. This has led to protests from
manufacturers, especially those dealing with Australia, where the currency
has weakened sharply. There has also been a fall in domestic interest rates
from around 17 to 10 per cent over the past two years.
However, the main beneficial change has been the Employment Contracts Act,
which effectively weakened the power of the trade unions (see facing page).
Initially, this led to a fall in incomes, though latest figures show wages
are growing due to increased productivity payments. Real sales generated per
hour in the manufacturing sector are running at a record level.
'Manufacturing have been able to maintain high productivity in spite of
increasing staff numbers and the totals of hours worked. This indicates that
the reform of workplace practices and management systems is providing the
basis for a sustained improvement in the international competitiveness of
New Zealand businesses.'
In 1992, manufacturing unit costs of labour fell by 5.5 per cent compared
with a 4.2 per cent rise in Singapore and a nil change in Australia. Munro
McLennan, an executive with UK meat group, Weddell Crown, said recently that
the export meat industry was a 'magnificent example' of the changes taking
place in processing.
Previously unions banned more than eight hours work at a plant, which led to
costly duplication. Now three-shift plants are common, industrial conflict
seems non-existent, productivity payments are common, and workers are
undertaking more complex processing tasks.
New Zealand manufacturers see their future as a supplier of niche markets.
This has been fostered by the way industry developed. Many companies, such
as white goods maker, Fisher and Paykel, became adept at handling small
production runs during the years of import protection. This the industry
believes has brought competitive advantages in terms of product development,
innovation, quality controls and the ability to supply short run or urgent
orders.
Industry is now export oriented, and figures show that, despite the severe
setbacks of the later 1980s, has more than doubled its share of total export
receipts over the last 20 years, a trend that will continue. New Zealand
manufacturing export growth at 7.3 per cent last year continues to be higher
than the OECD average of 5.6 per cent.
The geographical pattern of New Zealand's export trade has also changed
significantly over the past 15 years as markets have become more
diversified. In 1976 Australia took 43.1 per cent of New Zealand's basic
manufactured exports, Japan 32.3 per cent and a range of other markets 24.6
per cent.
Last year Australia's share was slightly lower at 42.7 per cent, Japan's
considerably lower at 16.5 per cent, while a greater range of destinations,
notably Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, took 40.8 per cent of
total manufactured exports.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Fierce debate over contracts -
Political parties divided over radical reforms in industrial relations law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS after the implementation of one of the most radical reforms of
industrial relations law achieved in any industrialised country, New
Zealanders remain divided about the benefits and costs.
The Employment Contracts Act (ECA), which became law in May 1991, swept away
a century of state regulation of the labour market in favour of a
deregulated system which effectively by-passes trade unions.
Under the old system, which dated back to 1894, most wages and conditions
were set centrally in negotiations between unions and employers'
representatives, and were then legally ratified as occupational 'awards.'
These awards covered all workers in each trade, most of whom were also
legally required to be union members. The effect was that bargaining was
difficult at company level, and almost impossible at plant level.
The ECA scrapped compulsory union membership and national awards in favour
of civil contracts between employers and individuals or groups of workers,
which are enforceable under civil law. Employees can negotiate their own
contracts or appoint bargaining agents, which can be trade unions.
Strikes are legal only during negotiations, but there are minimum
entitlements for wages, holidays and sickness benefits. However, no
consensus about the system has emerged, partly because of conflicts between
various surveys as to its impact on job creation, working conditions and
competitiveness. Mrs Anne Knowles, the Employers' Federations' labour market
manager, says the ECA has been 'crucial to the recovery now taking place in
New Zealand. It was the last link in the deregulation of the economy.
'In the past, companies had to be competitive on every aspect of their
operations, except labour costs. Now they know that if they don't get a
competitive edge through negotiation they can't blame anybody else,' she
says.
The employers complain, however, that the impact of the Employment Contracts
Act has been weakened by a narrow interpretation of the law by the
Employment Court, which hears allegations of illegal activity by employers.
The Council of Trade Unions (CTU), agrees that the act has reduced labour
costs, but claims that the ECA has failed to promote job creation, and has
promoted an authoritarian management style.
'The act was a one-off hit at labour costs. It has produced a productivity
boost, but the improvement in competitiveness is not sustainable because it
has not been followed by an increase in business investment,' says Mr Ken
Douglas, CTU president. The opposition Labour Party claims the act breaches
United Nations provisions on labour market practices established by the
International Labour Organisation, ILO.
Mr Mike Moore, Labour leader, says that the ECA will be scrapped if the
party wins the next election. There would be no return to the awards system,
but trade unions would recover their lost bargaining rights.
Mr Moore says such a change would bring New Zealand into line with
employment practices in other advanced countries. But the prospect worries
the employers.
'Any change back towards a centralised prescriptive system with special
rights for trade unions or employers' associations would be a retrograde
step,' says Mrs Knowles.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (5): Agreement welcomed by Maori
people - Improvements in race relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government achieved a significant breakthrough towards settling
long-standing Maori grievances this year when it gave financial backing to a
deal which helped Maori tribes buying a half share in the country's biggest
fishing company, Sealord.
The grievances date back to the early days of British colonisation; for
generations, the Maoris have claimed that the British, and successive New
Zealand governments did not honour the 1840 pact between both sides, the
Treaty of Waitangi.
Both National and Labour governments have worked hard over the last decade
at settling these problems. The Waitangi Tribunal was established to try to
settle disputes particularly relating to land and fishing matters with the
aim of finalising all grievances by the year 2000. However, the tribunal is
not supposed to concern itself with land now owned by Europeans, and
pessimists suggest there will be ongoing problems in the years ahead.
While some of the tribunal's decisions have been unpopular with some
sections of the European community, there is widespread support with the
view that the matters be dealt with promptly. There is also an acceptance
that, in the past, the Maori people were unfairly treated, especially in
land matters.
In the 1860s, for example, large tracts of valuable Waikato land was
confiscated by the government at the end of the so-called 'Maori land wars.'
The problem was that the areas taken were top-quality farm land confiscated
from Maori tribes who had supported the government. The dissident tribes
were left with their poorer quality land.
THE Sealord deal, which cost the government Dollars 175m, followed a
Waitangi Tribunal ruling last year that Maori tribes were entitled to the
deep sea fish resource around the South Island.
Prompted by South Island tribes, the government entered negotiations which
allowed them to acquire a 50 per cent stake in Sealord, which controls about
25 per cent of the national fishing quota and most of the valuable hoki fish
resource.
Brierley Investments bought the remaining 50 per cent. Earnings from the
company will be shared around Maori tribes by a special commission.
In spite of some initial squabbling between different tribal groups, the
Maori people have now welcomed the agreement, which it is hoped will lead to
greater employment opportunities for a group which has been particularly
badly hit by the protracted recession.
Unemployment problems are particularly acute among younger Maori people and,
as a consequence, they out-number other races in jail. The government and
other agencies, including Maori people, are working hard at solving these
problems through promoting education and raising Maori pride.
The aim, according to the Minister of Justice Doug Graham is to ensure that
the work of the tribunal will not only have the effect of improving race
relations, but help lift the Maori people out of the dependency mode 'where
they have been for much too long.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (6): Year-round holiday venue -
Queenstown / Hub of New Zealand's tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENSTOWN, a township nestled at the foot of the sheer cliffs of a South
Island alpine range known simply as The Remarkables, is New Zealand's most
popular tourist destination. It is estimated that around 750,000 of the
million overseas visitors who came to New Zealand last year spent at least a
day at the resort - and most spent three days there.
Despite the numbers, it is possible not to be aware of fellow tourists in
this most unusual destination, as I found during a fortnight visit with my
family at the height of the summer vacation this year.
The reasons are simple: Queenstown is the centrepiece of a leading holiday
region, with an amazing variety of attractions. Most American, Australian or
European visitors 'disappear' there for the day in rental or hire cars. From
Queenstown, there are short drives to deserted gold mining towns, around
Lake Wakatipu, or further afield to lakes such as Wanaka or Te Anau which
are preferred by the local people as they offer better boating and fishing.
For the more adventurous, the Fiordland National Park is a 12-hour day trip,
although others go by luxury coach, or take a 20-minute flight to Milford
Sound. Milford in turn offers jet boating to the open sea, bush-walks and a
three-day tramp over rugged terrain to Lake Te Anau. Known as the Milford
Track, this is one of New Zealand's leading outdoor attractions.
Queenstown is a genuine year-round holiday centre: in the winter months,
three of the country's top ski fields are within a 20-minute drive.
All summer sports facilities are available. Two excellent local vineyards
produce award winning wines. Each claims to be the most southerly vineyard
in the southern hemisphere, and the wines are distinctive and pleasant.
Other small vineyards flourish throughout the region, and visitors are
encouraged to go on a day long wine trail. The Earnslaw, said to be the
oldest coal-fired passenger steamer still afloat has the distinction of
being launched on the same day as the Titanic. It sails regularly to high
country 'runs' (the local name for sheep farms), where it berths, and
passengers are encouraged to dine at the homesteads.
For the more active, a former Queenstown resident - and now millionaire - A
J Hackett, offers bungy-jumping from the historic Kawerau Bridge into
swirling waters of the ravine below. There is also year-round white water
rafting, para-gliding, jet boat rides on the turbulent waters of the
Shotover and Kawerau Rivers, safari trips and helicopter rides.
Queenstown is bubbling with confidence about its future as the hub of New
Zealand's tourist industry. This is leading to a mini-construction boom: and
the sleepy town of the 1960s and 1970s, is now host to 60 competitively
priced and surprisingly good restaurants.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (7): A surge in tourism - Big increase
in holidaymakers from Asian countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL tourists are discovering New Zealand in ever-larger numbers,
helped in part by the increase in air services to the country and by strong
promotions in Germany, Japan, Britain and the US.
Tourism New Zealand, the body charged with promoting the country abroad, has
invested NZDollars 60m over the past 18 months and the industry is in a
highly confident mood.
In 1992, tourist numbers grew by 9.6 per cent to 1.05m, the first time they
had passed the one million mark. The growth has continued this year with
arrivals running 10.2 per cent, ahead of last year in the January - April
period. The tourism board aims for 3m arrivals by the year 2000.
New Zealand now earns more than NZDollars 3bn a year from tourism, making it
the country's single biggest export earner, and the Tourism Board says it
should be earning NZDollars 9bn by the year 2000.
The board chief executive, Ian Kean, says the growth in numbers will be
carefully handled, especially in terms of the environment.
'The fresh, uncrowded, unspoiled nature of New Zealand is one of our main
attractions - and we'll keep it that way.
'We offer a contemporary society with sophisticated cities, superb food and
wine, a unique Maori culture, and physical and natural attractions which
visitors say are unequalled anywhere in the world.'
The industry sees its greatest growth potential as being part of the Asian
Pacific region. Growing disposable income is seeing a sharp rise in visitor
numbers, although they are still well below those from more traditional
areas such as Australia, the US and Britain.
Recession in the US led to a 5 per cent drop in tourist numbers in the year
to March to 169,519, and Australian visitor numbers were also down 1 per
cent to 341,098. However, main promotions in Germany saw a 40 per cent lift
in holidaymakers to 43,356, and they stayed for an average 30 days, longer
than most other nationalities.
The number of British visitors rose by 22 per cent last year to 120,227, and
they stayed the longest of any nationality, an average 33 days. However,
this percentage is boosted by the number of UK residents making extended
visits to stay with family or friends.
Most European visitors prefer to rent a car and go where the mood takes
them, stopping at hotels or motels in the many small towns that take their
fancy. So do Chinese visitors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Large
numbers of Chinese settlers have lived in New Zealand from the goldmining
days of the 1860s.
Younger Japanese tourists are following the self-drive trend, although due
to language difficulties their older compatriots tend to travel in groups by
coach or airline. Rapidly developing airlinks, mainly pioneered by Air New
Zealand, with Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore, have
led to a sharp rise in visitor numbers from all those countries.
In the year to March the number of visitors from Taiwan rose by 46 per cent
to a total of 91,387, There was also a 79 per cent increase in numbers from
Singapore, and a 96 per cent rise from Korea.
As Asian tourist numbers climb, so does their ownership of hotels.
Singaporean and Hong Kong companies have bought many of the country's top
hotels over the past three years.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (3): A third force enters the
political equation - The election later this year threatens to prove
embarrassing for the ruling National party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO and a half years after coming to power in a landslide election victory,
Mr Jim Bolger is New Zealand's most unpopular prime minister since opinion
polling began.
Mr Bolger's National party government has trailed the opposition Labour
party since shortly after the election, and has at times even fallen behind
the Alliance coalition, a populist third party grouping. A month ago, the
government was 16 points behind the Opposition in the most widely watched
opinion poll, and even loyalists were forecasting that Mr Bolger's
leadership could come under pressure unless things improved quickly.
Yet, the economy grew by 3 per cent in calendar 1993 - double the average
rate in the previous 20 years, inflation is steady at about one per cent,
and unemployment has fallen to 9.8 per cent from a peak of 11.1 per cent.
Recent polls have suggested that the government is finally beginning to make
up ground on Labour, helped by a successful overseas trip by Mr Bolger and
hints of a give-away Budget next month. But political analysts say there are
four main reasons why National faces the possibility of a humiliating defeat
in the next election, which must be held by November:
National won in 1990 because it gave the impression that the free-market
reforms of the 1984-90 Labour government would be reversed. Its extension of
the reforms to the labour market and social security left the government
open to charges that it had misled the electorate.
Few of the benefits of economic recovery have yet flowed through to ordinary
people. The result has been growing income inequality in what was once one
of the world's most egalitarian countries.
Ten years of dramatic economic change has involved much of the population in
painful restructuring. The governing party is the easiest target for angry
voters, as Labour discovered three years ago.
New Zealand's political landscape has been fragmented by the strains which
have accompanied economic restructuring, raising the possibility of volatile
shifts in political support away from both main parties.
The initial split took place during the last Labour government, when Mr Jim
Anderton, an amiable old-fashioned socialist with a colourful turn of
phrase, took much of the party's far left into his New Labour Party. Against
all predictions, Mr Anderton held his Christchurch seat at the election, and
subsequently displayed considerable political skills in welding together a
coalition of five minor parties, called the Alliance.
Support for the Alliance has fallen to about 22 per cent in recent polls
from a peak of nearly 40 per cent in late 1991, but its prospects could be
transformed by a further split between National and Mr Winston Peters, the
highly popular Maori MP for Tauranga. A Heylen opinion poll suggested last
month that a party led by Mr Peters, now sitting as an independent MP, would
win 26 per cent of the popular vote. Together, the Alliance and Mr Peters
won 35 per cent support, which could be enough to win a three-party election
under New Zealand's first past the post electoral system. The poll prompted
rapid contacts between Mr Anderton and Mr Peters but so far the two men have
held only 'talks about talks.' And there are a number of hurdles in the way
of a successful electoral arrangement.
Much of the support for Mr Peters overlaps with support for the Alliance,
especially in Auckland, the country's biggest city. Alliance candidates in
many constituencies might be unwilling to step aside to give candidates
supporting Mr Peters a clear run.
The alternative would be for Mr Peters, 43, to join the Alliance. But he
would probably want to assume the leadership. Mr Anderton says he is willing
to step aside, but only after a party conference, which would be hard to
arrange before the election.
The Alliance is already strained by differences between New Labour and its
partners: the anti-development Greens, the Maori rights Mana Motuhake party,
and two renegade conservative parties, the Liberals and Democrats.
Mr Peters shares with all the parties an abhorrence for the deregulatory
free market government policies of the last decade. But he is still a
conservative - he voted, for example, for labour market deregulation, which
is anathema to New Labour.
Mr Peters has maintained his popularity largely by avoiding setting out his
own policies, leaving considerable doubt about where he stands. Much of his
popularity might disappear if he was forced to make hard choices.
So far, Mr Peters is keeping his options open - 'the ball is in Winston's
court. He has indicated that he will take part in talks, but we are waiting
for him to respond,' says Mr Anderton.
Predictably, both the main parties cling to the hope that an agreement
between the Alliance and Mr Peters will prove impossible to arrange, or that
it will fall apart under the strain of an election campaign.
Mr Don McKinnon, Deputy Prime Minister, says National is confident that it
can recover sufficient support to win the election 'if we can demonstrate
our strengths as managers of the economy.' National is also counting on the
historical tendency for government support to improve in the run-up to an
election.
But Mr McKinnon admits that the government has been distracted by the
internal battle with Mr Peters, who was given 'an inordinate amount of time'
to come into line before he was ejected from the party early this year.
The infighting has also hampered the government's attempts to highlight
divisions between Labour's free market and socialist wings, which have been
successfully papered over by Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader - 'probably we
have not done a good job in exposing the Labour Party in its true colours,'
he says.
Mr Moore has spent the last 32 months distancing Labour from the record of
the 1984-90 government, mainly by concentrating on the government's social
security, health and labour market reforms. He has successfully resisted
pressure to commit the party to reverse the free market thrust of the last
decade, although it would re-introduce a measure of labour market
deregulation.
Nevertheless, the election result remains unpredictable, at least until the
shape of any agreement between Mr Peters and the Alliance becomes clear.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (1): Sombre mood prevails - Radical
economic reforms introduced by the National party government have won
glowing international approbation. The sacrifices which have been demanded
of the ordinary citizen have led, however, to a sense of disillusionment
with the political process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A DECADE after their political leaders embarked on a process of radical
economic reform, New Zealanders are divided about whether the benefits have
outweighed the costs.
A substantial improvement in most economic indicators over the past year has
given the country what the OECD calls its best opportunity for years to
achieve a sustained return to real economic growth. That is something New
Zealanders have not enjoyed since their egalitarian South Pacific paradise
began to run into economic problems after the oil crisis of 1973.
The OECD and most other outside analysts have reported glowingly on the
impact of tariff and subsidy reductions, widespread privatisations, monetary
prudence and cuts in social programmes.
But the reforms are far less popular inside the country. Indeed, outside the
ranks of the conservative National government, the national mood is sombre.
Many observers say New Zealanders have never been so divided.
The reason is the widespread perception among ordinary New Zealanders that
they have borne most of the costs of the reform process without receiving
any tangible benefits.
Many also believe they were misled by both the 1984-90 Labour government and
its National (conservative) successor about the difficulties involved in
restructuring the economy. The result has been disillusionment with the
political process among those who have suffered from the reforms -
especially unionised workers, students, pensioners, and consumers of state
benefits.
Sociologists blame the dislocation caused by the reform programme for rising
crime, growing poverty and increasing intolerance of Polynesian and Asian
immigrants (though race relations are generally good). But the most dramatic
result has been a surge in support for the replacement of the British-style
first past the post (FPP) electoral system by a proportional system based on
the German additional member system, known in New Zealand as mixed-member
proportional (MMP).
Mr Ken Douglas, president of the Council of Trade Unions (CTU) says New
Zealanders are simply 'fed up' with the political process, which many
believe has allowed right wing groups in the main parties to hijack the
country.
'There is no fundamental belief that MMP is inherently a better system, but
the present system has been disgraced because more than 50 per cent of
people believe it is intellectually corrupt,' he says. 'There has never been
majority support for the things that have happened here, and people just
don't accept the values which can justify the huge costs we have had to
carry.
'We are a much more racist, violent and sexist society than we have ever
been before, and much of that has happened because people have felt
alienated from a political system which does not represent them.'
So far, the main beneficiaries of the support for PR have been Mr Winston
Peters, a dissident former National MP, and Mr Jim Anderton, a former Labour
MP who now leads the Alliance, a populist coalition of protest parties.
Mr Anderton's main theme, that only a more consensual style of politics can
reverse the continuing destruction of New Zealand's egalitarian heritage,
has struck a rich vein of public support. He has also skilfully tapped
public anger with both main parties by asserting that they have repeatedly
misled the electorate about the scale and difficulties of the reform
programme.
'Roger Douglas (Labour's 1984 finance minister) said that if we took the
hard decisions in the first 18 months of government then we would pick up
the benefits in the last 18 months of the (parliamentary) term,' he says.
'But the short sharp shock has been going on for so long now that people are
traumatised by it. It's like being in the dentist's chair for years - the
pain goes on and on and there is no gain.'
THE appeal of Mr Peters is more difficult to identify. He has built a large
constituency by criticising his former government colleagues, and is said to
be determined to become New Zealand's first Maori Prime Minister. Yet no-one
seems to know what he stands for, unless it is 'old-fashioned, private
enterprise, development oriented' pump priming, as the Wellington Evening
Post put it in a recent editorial.
The minor parties' best chance of breaking the mould of New Zealand politics
will come in a referendum on MMP to be held at the same time as the next
election, due by November. If the referendum succeeds, as seems probable,
MMP will be introduced for the subsequent election, due by 1996. If that
happens, neither Labour nor National is likely to be able to form a future
government without reaching a coalition agreement with at least one of the
minor party groupings. In the meantime, opinion polls suggest that the
Alliance could win a substantial number of seats in the next parliament,
especially if it comes to an electoral agreement with Mr Peters.
Labour's response to the emerging political volatility has been to ignore it
in the belief that traditional supporters will return to the fold when they
enter the polling booths. Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, who was Prime
Minister for eight weeks in 1990, has spent the 32 months since the last
election distancing himself and the party from the 1980s.
Mr Moore's strategy has been to exploit the climate of bitterness about the
decade of change by presenting Labour as the party which offers New
Zealanders both credible economic management and a fresh start - 'the great
reforms of the 1980s were, in the main, necessary, but this is not the
1980s, and I am not going to be constrained by the legacy of the 1980s,' he
says.
Rhetoric aside, however, Labour has no intention of reversing the thrust of
the restructuring. The party would retain the existing tight monetary policy
favoured by the operationally-independent Reserve Bank, and it would aim for
even greater fiscal conservatism than that achieved by National. In the
main, a Labour government would restrict itself to relaxing National's
deregulation of the labour market, and reversing or amending the
government's unpopular changes to the health system and social programmes,
which are intended to cut costs by improving targetting.
This policy moderation has been reassuring to the business and financial
community, which has few qualms about the impact of a Labour government on
New Zealand's ability to sustain the economic recovery. But there is little
doubt that business would prefer to see the re-election of the National
government, which has firmly committed itself to continuing to open up the
economy and reduce the size of government.
ONLY a month ago, National looked unlikely to remain in office. However,
recent improvements in the economy have triggered a rise in the government's
poll rating which shows that the battle is not yet over. Ironically, the
government is also seeking to exploit the dislike for change by presenting
itself as the only party which will not plunge New Zealand into a further
bout of reform - 'we have two very substantial electoral cards to play. One
is the recovery, and the other is that we are the only party which
represents continuity,' says Mrs Ruth Richardson, finance minister. 'The
opposition parties are now the ones which are seen as the parties which are
offering destructive change.'
The key influence on the election may well be the Budget, due next month.
While a give-away Budget is unlikely, both Mrs Richardson and Mr Jim Bolger,
the Prime Minister, have indicated that they want to extend the fruits of
the recovery to ordinary New Zealanders.
Time is short, but if the government can do that, it may begin to heal some
of the wounds which have so bitterly divided the country.
In the long term, that will be of more importance to New Zealanders than the
colour of the next government.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (2): Exports put the bounce back - The
economy / After a difficult decade, lower wage and interest rates are at
last creating the conditions for sustained economic improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES are rising that the New Zealand economy is emerging from the
stagnation of the last decade in good shape to enjoy sustained, if moderate,
growth through the 1990s.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3 per cent over the 12 months to
December, and is widely forecast to remain at about the same level for at
least the next three years. Although relatively low by the standards of the
Asia/Pacific region, this is nearly triple the average rate of growth in the
seven years since the country embarked on a radical economic liberalisation
programme.
Not everyone believes the worst is over. The Trades Union Council, for
example, points out that gross domestic product remains little higher than
the level reached in September 1986. 'The National government spent the
first year in office (1990/91) converting a stagnant economy into a
contracting one, and the second undoing that damage,' the CTU said in a
recent submission to parliament. 'The growth . . . is simply a bounce back
from the pits of the middle of 1991, when the economy plunged to a
seven-year low.'
But, for the less pessimistic, there are plenty of positive indicators.
Inflation has been below 2 per cent for two years, unemployment has fallen
to 9.8 per cent from a peak of 11.1 per cent, retail sales are rising, and
business confidence is near its all-time high.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in a recent
report, said New Zealand now has 'the best opportunity for many years to
transform economic recovery into sustained growth.' The OECD also pointed
out that the recovery is taking place against a background of subdued world
economic growth and reductions in government spending, which have tended to
depress the domestic economy.
The growth is being led by exports, reflected in a surplus on the
merchandise trade balance of of more than NZDollars 3bn in each of the last
two calendar years, compared with an average for the previous six years of
about NZDollars 1.3bn. Underlying the recovery is the liberalisation
programme, which the OECD once called 'the most comprehensive micro-economic
reform programme undertaken by any OECD country in recent years.'
But the proximate cause of the improvement is threefold:
Falling interest rates: five-year government bonds are down to about 7 per
cent from 13 per cent in late 1990, and mortgage rates have fallen from more
than 15 per cent to less than 9 per cent.
Exchange rate movements: the New Zealand dollar has depreciated by about 8
per cent on a trade-weighted basis, delivering a substantial boost in
competitiveness to exporters whose domestic costs are static or falling.
Lower wages: unit labour costs have declined substantially following labour
market deregulation in 1991. A survey by Bancorp, an Auckland merchant bank,
suggests that labour costs are now 36 per cent lower than in Australia.
Mrs Ruth Richardson, finance minister, says with some satisfaction that New
Zealand will have one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD in
1993/94 - a sharp contrast with most of the previous 20 years, when it has
generally been one of the slowest. Mrs Richardson argues that the economy is
finally overcoming the traumatic effects of economic restructuring, and is
reaping the benefits of efficiency gains and fiscal prudence.
Nevertheless some dangers remain, principally the possibility of a collapse
in the Uruguay Round talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
and the sluggish performance of most of the other OECD economies - 'they
(other countries) also have substantial adjustments to undergo, and New
Zealand is a very good demonstration of just how long it takes to get over
the adjustment into the growth phase,' says Mrs Richardson.
Domestically, the chief danger appears to be the uncertainty which could
flow from a hung parliament or an unexpected change of government following
the election due by November. There is little concern in the business
community about a victory by the opposition Labour party, which began the
reform process when it was in office from 1984 to 1990. However, a strong
showing by the populist Alliance party would not be welcomed by business or
in the financial markets, which fear a relaxation of the prudent fiscal and
monetary policies of the last three years.
Fiscal policy has, in fact, been one of the government's failures - Mrs
Richardson has long since abandoned her election promise to balance the
budget by the end of this year. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been
made, and the financial deficit (which excludes privatisation receipts) is
likely to total more like NZDollars 2.5bn in 1992/93 than earlier
projections of around NZDollars 3bn. This is equivalent to just over 3 per
cent of GDP, which would maintain the downward trend from the peak of 3.6
per cent in 1990/91. The Reserve Bank is forecasting a fall to 2.6 per cent
by 1995.
Mrs Richardson blames the missed target on 'factors outside our control,'
mainly the rate at which the impact of corporate tax losses on government
revenue is passing out of the taxation system. She says she is 'leery' of
setting a fresh target for the same reason, although the government expects
to have been running budget surpluses 'for some years' by 2000.
The other potential constraint on economic growth is the current account
deficit, which deteriorated to NZDollars 2bn in the year to March after
narrowing to just NZDollars 265m in the previous year. However, the
deterioration appears to have been caused largely by one-off interruptions
to exports, which restrained growth in the merchandise trade surplus, and
adverse movements in corporate investment returns, which are expected to be
reversed. Ms Brigette Leckie, an economist at BZW in Auckland, says that
concerns about the deterioration have been over-stated, and forecasts a
small surplus by 1994/95.
'This recovery is different. It has been much harder to achieve than past
recoveries, but it has not been underpinned by pump-priming, and we are not
likely to see the bottlenecks caused by inflation, interest rates and the
current account which have limited growth in the past,' she says.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy outlines a flexible
approach to borrowing - One option is a global dollar bond offering as the
country gets back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Italy could be poised to issue one of the world's biggest
global dollar bonds as borrowing gets back on track after political upsets
and debt downgradings earlier this year.
However, Mr Mario Draghi, director general of the treasury, stressed that
the bond was just one of a range of options currently being considered.
Italy's flexible approach has been reflected in the treasury's two latest
deals. Last month, it launched an innovative swap offer, giving investors in
seven old Eurodollar bond issues the chance to exchange their paper for one
of two new bonds, depending on maturity.
The deal, which raised around Dollars 800m in fresh money thanks to new
issues accompanying the swaps, was followed this month by a Dollars 2bn
issue of floating rate notes.
The two transactions showed that Italy's foreign borrowing plans, heralded
by a DM5bn bond in late January, were back on track. When the D-Mark issue
was launched, Mr Draghi said Italy hoped to raise between Dollars 10bn and
Dollars 15bn on the Euromarkets this year, depending on market conditions.
However, Italy's creditworthiness started to take a battering within days of
the D-Mark deal as the widening political corruption scandal triggered a
string of ministerial resignations and called the former Amato government's
authority into question.
Political turmoil in turn raised uncertainties about Italy's ability to deal
with its huge budget deficit, the core of its structural economic problems.
One reason for the republic's return to the Eurobond market after a two-year
absence was to switch borrowing away from relatively expensive domestic lira
deals. Since the Amato government had some success in cutting spending and
raising taxes, servicing costs on the deficit now account for the bulk of
the government's funding requirements.
The political turmoil led to a volatile period in the domestic bond markets,
which were additionally buffeted by the decision by Moody's, the US rating
agency, to downgrade Italy's credit rating to A1 from Aa3.
However, there has been a marked return of confidence in recent weeks, which
treasury officials say is not reflected in the ratings. The appointment of
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor, as prime minister
convinced dealers further action would be taken to tackle the deficit.
Meanwhile, recent referendum results suggest far-reaching political changes
are now under way.
The decision to launch the bond swap was an attempt to 'sound out the market
and tighten spreads,' says Mr Alberto Giovannini, the Columbia University
professor now working as a full-time adviser to the treasury. Although only
about 10 per cent of the eligible bonds were exchanged for the new paper, Mr
Giovannini said the treasury was pleased with the results.
'A lot of the professionally-held paper was locked up in asset swaps. And
much of the retail sales had gone to Italian investors, who previously
bought bonds free of withholding tax on the coupons,' he said.
But Mr Giovannini stressed the treasury's objective was not to tease out the
maximum amount of paper.
With fixed and floating rate dollar issues and a large D-Mark transaction
under its belt, the treasury is now about half-way to meeting its Dollars
10bn-Dollars 15bn borrowing goal for 1993.
Mr Draghi stresses the range is flexible. 'We don't want to force anything
down the market's throat,' he says.
'We're not pushing for tight spreads at any cost. We're looking for the
equilibrium spreads in line with what the market will take.' With the risk
of political upsets still present and the rating agencies so far sticking to
their guns, the Italians cannot afford to take a more aggressive position at
present.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip back after warning on
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER rising sharply on another set of positive inflation data, longer-dated
Treasury prices fell back yesterday after a senior Clinton administration
official warned about cutting the deficit too fast.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 103
7/8 , yielding 6.815 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
firmer, up  5/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.057 per cent.
In the morning, the long-awaited May consumer prices figures proved bullish
for bond market sentiment. The Labor department announced that the consumer
price index last month rose 0.1 per cent, and the 'core' rate (excluding the
volatile food and energy components) rose 0.2 per cent.
The data was slightly better than analysts had forecast, and following last
week's smaller-than-expected rise in producer prices, it helped ease
investors' fears about resurgent inflation. In particular, the May numbers
make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will now raise interest rates to
curb inflationary pressures in the economy, and have reduced much of the
uncertainty that has been dogging the bond market for the past month.
Against this positive background, prices rose strongly in early trading. In
the afternoon, the short end of the market held on to most of its gains as
big hedge funds loaded up on shorter-dated securities, but the long end lost
ground. It was hit by comments from Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of the
president's council of economic advisers, who warned that if the deficit is
cut too fast, the benefits of lower interest rates could be lost.
GERMAN government bonds fell as hopes of lower interest rates receded before
today's repo announcement.
The September bund futures fell 0.20 to 94.86 during official trading,
principally because of profit-taking following Monday's rally. In after
hours trading, the contract recovered to 94.96.
Sellers latched on to the Bundesbank's statement that today's repo rate
would be variable. They inferred that the German central bank was not
interested in steering the rate lower and that it would be held at 7.6 per
cent again.
PROFIT-TAKING left its mark on French government bonds in early trading. But
the rate cut apologists moved in later and countered the selling pressure to
leave long-dated bonds marginally firmer.
The Bund-OAT spread narrowed to 18 basis points as investors moved along the
French yield curve. The trend towards buying at the long end has prompted
some concern that the imminent auction of FFr15bn-FFr17bn of five-year bonds
will see poor interest, especially as there is already supply pressure from
the impending issue of the so-called Balladur bonds.
On the Matif, the June futures contract was four basis points higher at
118.70 by the official close and continued firmer in after-hours trading.
UK government bonds slipped before the chancellor's Mansion House speech.
September gilt futures lost most of the previous day's gains falling  5/32
to 104 1/2 .
The chancellor's commitment to low inflation will be encouraging to the bond
market but there is unlikely to be a great deal to latch on to in what is
now seen as a general appraisal of the UK's economic position.
Dealers will look to the release tomorrow of the latest unemployment data.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: UK building society in PIBS
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWCASTLE Building Society, the UK's 25th largest building society, has
placed its second issue of permanent interest bearing shares (PIBS), via
Charterhouse Tilney, at the lowest yield spread over gilts yet achieved by
any building society.
The Pounds 10m placement will be treated as core capital for building
society capital adequacy purposes.
The shares will pay fixed interest of 10 3/4 per cent, yielding 240 basis
points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. This represents a substantial
reduction from the spread on Newcastle's first deal, launched last September
at a yield margin of 360 basis points.
Spreads on PIBS issues have tightened substantially, partly due to
unexpectedly strong demand from retail investors keen to buy relatively
high-yielding assets in the current low interest rate environment.
The tightening of spreads is also attributed to a shortage of stock in some
issues, such as the first Newcastle deal, which is now trading at a spread
of 203 basis points. A PIBS issue launched by the Halifax, the UK's largest
building society, in January 1992 at a spread of 275 basis points, is now
trading at a spread of 170 basis points.
Given that the principal amount invested in PIBS is never repaid, some
dealers think that spreads are now looking very tight.

launching a total of more than Dollars 1.2bn in new bonds.
Some issuers were wooed into the market by the release of favourable US
inflation figures and dealers said the positive outlook was likely to
encourage the launch of more Eurodollar deals in the immediate future, even
though arbitrage opportunities were not seen as especially attractive.
Canada's Province of Ontario yesterday announced plans to issue a minimum
USDollars 1bn global bond issue in the near future. LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, a
state agency, is also due to raise Dollars 500m with an unusual Eurobond
issue to be listed in both Luxembourg and Singapore.
Nomura, the lead manager for the triple-A rated deal, describes the issue as
a 'hybrid dragon-Eurobond' given that it is targeted at Asian and European
investors and will have an Asian co-management group. The bonds were being
priced at the end of the Hong Kong business day.
British Gas International Finance returned to the dollar market with a
Dollars 250m, 10-year deal.
The borrower has launched deals in the Eurosterling sector recently and has
seen yield spreads narrow substantially. The bonds were priced to yield 34
basis points over the US Treasury, and traded at 32-33 basis points over
later in the day. The bonds were swapped into fixed rate sterling.
Outside the dollar sector, the main talking point of the market was a
successful FFr1.5bn deal from Nestle Enterprises, the holding company for
the French operations of Nestle.
BNP, the lead manager, claimed the yield spread at launch of 7 basis points
over the French treasury bond is the 'tightest spread done in the French
franc sector' in recent memory.
At one stage the spread narrowed to 3-4 basis points, reflecting the very
strong institutional investor demand for the issue.
Dealers pointed to the rarity value as the main reason for the tight pricing
and good investor demand.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Murdoch expands into Asian
broadcasting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch yesterday signalled his intention to become a significant
force in Asian broadcasting with the announcement that his News Corporation
is to pay HKDollars 1.85bn (Dollars 238.8m) for a 22 per cent interest in
Television Broadcasts (TVB), one of Hong Kong's two domestic television
companies and a leading producer of Chinese language movies.
News Corporation will acquire 11 per cent of TVB from each of the company's
two controlling shareholders - Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr
Robert Kuok.
On completion of the deal, which needs Hong Kong government approval, Sir
Run Run will have 23 per cent of TVB and Mr Kuok 21 per cent.
Mr Murdoch said the three-way partnership in TVB 'will create the premier
Asian company engaged in terrestrial and satellite television broadcasting'.
Sir Run Run said the addition of News Corp's expertise in international
programming and satellite broadcasting to TVB's record of success in Chinese
language programming 'paves the way for the future growth and expansion of
TVB'.
Mr Murdoch, who sealed the deal on a visit to Hong Kong last week, has made
no secret of his wish to participate in Asia's growing broadcasting
industry, especially in China.
Fox Television already sells US movies on the Chinese mainland and earlier
this year Mr Murdoch visited Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders.
He has expanded his print media interest in the region. Through the South
China Morning Post he has acquired a Chinese language newspaper in Hong Kong
and a 15 per cent interest in the Bangkok Post, Thailand's leading
English-language daily.
Underlining his ambition to publish on the Chinese mainland, he has
registered the masthead North China Morning Post.
Over the past year Mr Murdoch has had talks with Mr Li Ka-shing's Star
Television about equity participation in the satellite network, but they
proved fruitless.
TVB recently entered into an agreement with Turner Broadcasting, Home Box
Office, Entertainment Sports Programming Network, Australian Broadcasting
Corp and Discovery Channel to lease satellite space on Palapa, an
Indonesian-owned satellite.
TVB said Mr Murdoch's role in the consortium had not been decided.
TVB will supply Chinese language programming for one channel.
Unlike Star, which currently broadcasts five 'free-to-air' satellite
channels, the TVB consortium will transmit encoded programming for
subscribers only.
Analysts viewed Mr Murdoch's purchase of 22 per cent of TVB as only the
beginning.
Mr Murdoch is seen as the likely buyer of Sir Run Run's shareholding should
he decide to reduce his holding further.

The proposal follows the purchase by Foodland of a 38.6 per cent, NZDollars

<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and workers, backed by a consortium of Polish banks and foreign
investors, have offered to purchase the Gorazdze works, the country's
largest and most modern cement producer.
The bid, which is being considered by Poland's privatisation ministry, is in
competition with a three-year effort by CBR, the Belgian cement company, to
purchase the plant.
The CBR offer, which includes the purchase of the Strzelce Opolskie cement
works nearby, has been resisted by the trade unions at Gorazdze which want
to see control of their plant stay in Polish hands.
The consortium's offer is the first time that shop floor resistance to a
foreign takeover has been transformed into a rival bid backed by Polish
banks and foreign investors willing to take a minority stake.
The rival offer would see 35 per cent of the plant's equity go to management
and employees while a further 16 per cent would be taken up by the Polish
Development Bank and 10 per cent would go to the Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy.
Another 10 per cent would be purchased by Warta, a privatised insurance
company, and 9 per cent by a British investment group. The US Congress
financed Polish American Enterprise Fund is interested in purchasing a 10
per cent share in Gorazdze while the remaining 10 per cent would be sold
through a public offer.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: US investors trigger a
disclosure revolution - More Latin American companies are responding to
analysts' requests for information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telephone company, makes its planned
Dollars 500m offering of American Depositary Receipts later this year, it
will join 34 Latin American companies listed on Wall Street. Five years ago
there were none.
The transformation is a clear illustration of the extent to which foreign
investment is being encouraged to support companies' capital plans and plug
the gaps left by Latin America's weak capital markets and low savings
ratios.
The phenomenon is most widespread in Mexico, where total foreign investment
in the stock market is Dollars 27.5bn, of which more than half is in
US-traded ADRs. While this is around a fifth of Mexico's stock market
capitalisation, analysts believe foreign investment accounts for more than
50 per cent of the volume of the most widely traded shares.
The result is that US investors, usually through purchases of ADRs, dictate
events in the Mexican market. Stock markets in the US open before Mexico's,
and the performance of the ADR of Telmex, the telephone monopoly, in New
York often dominates Mexico's market.
When Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) bought the Spanish cement companies Sanson
and Valenciana last year, US investors rushed to sell, worried at the
prospect of the Mexican company becoming 40 per cent Spanish in terms of
sales.
Mr Gustavo Caballero, Cemex finance director, says US analysts did not
believe a Mexican company was capable of such a bold step.
However, the dependence on foreign capital might improve the way some Latin
American countries are run and analysed. Once controlled by just a few
dominant shareholders, companies in the region often ignored minority
investors.
'Latin American companies need a shake-up in the way they disclose
information and what they say to the market,' says Mr Terence Mahony, of
Baring America Asset Management. More companies are responding to US
analysts' requests for information, and under US regulations face more
stringent disclosure rules than they do at home.
On a recent holiday in New York, the head of the Mexican company
Interceramic visited investors to explain his strategy - a move that would
have been unthinkable a few years ago. Banamex (Mexico's largest bank),
Bancomer (the second largest), Cemex and others have hired public relations
firms in the US, and employ investor relations executives.
Local brokers are changing their practices. In Brazil companies used to be
valued according to price-to-book value. But with the growing presence of
foreigners, price-to-earnings value analysis has become more prevalent.
Similarly, Mexican brokers rarely made earnings forecasts, preferring
historic earnings. Now almost all produce forecasts.
Even governments are waking up to the international competition their stock
markets face. Chile recently reduced from three years to one the minimum
period that foreigners had to hold initial capital in a stock before
selling. Mexico has unveiled a series of reforms, allowing international
stocks to be listed in Mexico and bringing regulations closer to US levels.
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, hopes that the reforms will bring
share trading activity back to Mexico. This would enable local brokers to
earn commissions from trading in Mexican stocks, since more foreign
investment would be made in the underlying stock market in Mexico and not in
the ADRs.

Although Cineplex has been heavily restructured, and theatres in several

RATIONALISATION is continuing apace in the Australian and New Zealand
grocery industries, with two deals announced yesterday worth a combined
total of about Dollars A120m (USDollars 81m).
Foodland Associated, the Australian grocery group, will merge its New
Zealand operations with those of Progressive Enterprises, one of the
country's biggest supermarket chains.
The proposal follows the purchase by Foodland of a 38.6 per cent, NZDollars
128.2m (USDollars 69.7m) stake in Progressive, formerly held by fellow
Australian group Coles Myer. Progressive will pay NZDollars 101m for
Foodland's New Zealand retail and wholesale assets by issuing 54.6m shares
at NZDollars 1.85 each.
Progressive said that with dividend entitlements and timing differences, the
price was equal to the NZDollars 2 a share paid by Foodland for Coles Myer's
shares in Progressive.
The deal will make Progressive a subsidiary of Foodland, raising the
latter's shareholding from 43 to 57 per cent.
The combined group would account for about 34 per cent of New Zealand's
supermarket sales, making it the second largest such organisation in the
country. Davids Holdings, Australia's biggest food wholesaler, paid Dollars
A37.8m for a 19.9 per cent stake in its South Australian rival, Independent
Holdings.

'More bottling lines will be moved here when we finish the first phase of
expansion,' said Mr Li Jing, product promotion manager of the Zhengzhou
brewery.
Under the agreement, MBC will transfer its slack production lines to
Zhengzhou, increasing output there to 150,000 tonnes from the present
100,000 tonnes. MBC's contribution will amount to Yuan14.8m.
The Zhengzhou brewery will keep its Gold Star brand, but will use Landmark
packaging for the additional 50,000 tonnes.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Joint Miramar bid hits valuation
snag

MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific's joint bid for Miramar Hotel and
Investment has hit a snag with Miramar's senior executives claiming that the
bid undervalues the hotels and property group by up to HKDollars 2.5bn
(USDollars 343m).
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Young Bing-Ching, Miramar director and
general manager, said the overture from Mr Li and Citic Pacific, Beijing's
main investment arm in Hong Kong, was not friendly, as Mr Li has claimed,
and that it undervalued the company. He urged shareholders not to sell until
they had received the opinion of an independent valuer.
Last week, Mr Li and Citic launched a cash bid for Miramar of HKDollars 15.5
a share and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant, valuing the company at HKDollars
8.7bn. The market's initial reaction was that the offer was too low and
Miramar's shares have since been trading above the offer. Yesterday they
closed at HKDollars 16.70.
Mr Young claimed in his letter that Miramar's property assets alone were
'good enough to support (the company's) shares at HKDollars 20'.
He said that Miramar was close to reaping the benefits of the work it had
done in developing ties on the mainland.
Neither Citic or Mr Li had any comment to make on Mr Young's statement.

NOVELL and Oracle, two leading US computer software companies, have formed
an alliance to create a combined range of products for corporate computer
networks.
Oracle will combine its database software and messaging systems with
Novell's widely-used networking software and operating systems, to provide a
single package of software that addresses the needs of companies downsizing
their computer systems from mainframe computers to networks of workstations
and servers.
The new line, called Oracle Ware, will combine Novell's Net Ware networking
software or Unix operating system with Oracle's Oracle 7 database and Oracle
Office messaging services software.
'A lot of customers already use Novell and Oracle products together. By
tightly integrating our products we will reduce the complexity of
implementing networks and cut the cost of ownership,' said Mr Jan Newman,
Novell executive vice-president.
'Database services have become a very critical component of enterprise
networks,' added Mr Fred Cutler, Oracle executive vice-president.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Exxon slowly recovers from
shrinking pains / A look at the world's largest oil group as it emerges from
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon prefers to do things without much fuss. So when Mr Lee Raymond took
over from Mr Lawrence Rawl as chairman of the world's largest oil company in
April the message was very much: business as usual.
Mr Raymond, the company pointed out, had worked for six years as Mr Rawl's
president, and the last thing he was going to do was shake Exxon up.
It would be surprising if Mr Raymond did institute big changes since Exxon
is emerging from a substantial restructuring caused by the squeeze in oil.
What it wants is a period of calm to rediscover its roots.
Under Mr Rawl, Exxon abandoned its skyscraper headquarters in Manhattan's
Rockefeller Centre for a faceless office overlooking one of the many
freeways leading out of Dallas in Texas, the home of US oil.
It pulled out of the bold diversification ventures that were fashionable in
the early 1980s. It even retreated from Los Angeles, the city of the car,
because it could not make enough money there.
The restructuring has been a painful process, not helped by the 1989 Exxon
Valdez disaster and the ensuing multi-billion dollar clean-up. Much of it
was implemented by Mr Raymond, who was seen in some quarters of the US oil
industry as Mr Rawl's hatchet man.
Exxon's shrinking pains were brought on by the collapse of the oil price in
the late 1980s. In common with all the leading US oil companies, Exxon had
become bloated in a market where growth provided the escape route out of
difficulty. This time, Exxon was forced to cut costs, and find ways of doing
more with less.
Over the past four years, it has got rid of refineries in Europe and North
America, shut down over 4,000 service stations around the world, and cut its
workforce from a 1989 peak of 104,000 people to 95,000. All told, Exxon's
cutbacks have reduced costs by nearly Dollars 1bn a year and resulted in
sell-offs of a similar order.
The restructuring ate deep into profits last year, when net income fell 15
per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. But this figure conceals a strong final quarter
which analysts say shows that the strategy is beginning to work. In the
first quarter of this year, earnings were flat.
When Mr Raymond took over as chairman, he told shareholders: 'There are
great risks associated with our industry. But the corollary is that there
are also many rewards and opportunities for companies which are able to
adapt to change.'
The most obvious result of the restructuring is that Exxon is a smaller
company. This year Exxon expects to produce 1.7m barrels of oil a day,
refine 3.6m and sell 4.8m. Twenty years ago, Exxon was a 6m b/d company all
the way through. But Exxon expects to make more money the new way, and it
intends to keep up its annual investment programme of nearly Dollars 1bn a
year, though the growth prospects are abroad rather than on its doorstep.
The new Exxon will not try to compete across the breadth of the US market,
but only where it is strong and can operate with low costs. Apart from Los
Angeles, it has retreated from South Florida, and it plans to cover the
whole of the US with just three large refineries and one small one. Its US
exploration effort has been curtailed to three main areas, all offshore:
Alaska, California and Mobile Bay.
Exxon is still keen on the North Sea, particularly the Norwegian sector
where it is the largest non-Norwegian acreage holder. It is especially
interested in gas, believing that continental markets will develop stronger
needs.
The most exciting prospects, Exxon believes, lie in the Asia Pacific region
where it is making the heaviest investments. The company is expanding its
refinery in Thailand, participating in a large power generation project in
Hong Kong, and is developing oil and gas prospects off Malaysia. There is a
possibility to explore for oil onshore in China.
One thing Exxon has turned its back on is diversification out of its
traditional lines of business. This is partly because of costly lessons
learnt from its forays into minerals and energy during the last decade,
partly because it sees little change in the world's energy picture, with
oil, gas and coal dominating.
The biggest change between now and 2010, it believes, will be driven by
rising electricity demand in the Third World. This means that natural gas
will gain in importance as more gas-fired power stations are built. But it
also means that coal will be able to hold its 25 per cent share of energy
consumption over that period.
The loser will be oil because of sluggish growth among its biggest consumers
in the industrialised countries.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank merges US
securities divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's biggest banking group, announced yesterday it was
combining its US securities activities into a single subsidiary, Deutsche
Bank Securities.
Previously, Deutsche Bank's securities operations in the US were divided
between three units: the Wall Street equity research and brokerage firm C.
J. Lawrence, the international securities and asset management businesses of
Deutsche Bank Capital, and the treasury market primary dealership Deutsche
Bank Government Securities.
Under US banking and securities industry regulations, the businesses of C.
J. Lawrence and Deutsche Bank Capital were kept strictly apart, preventing
the German bank from co-ordinating its activities between the two units, and
hindering the overall development of its securities business in the US.
The new subsidiary, however, will operate under Section 20 of the
Glass-Steagall Act, which allows banks to engage in corporate securities
dealing and underwriting activities if revenues from these activities do not
exceed 10 per cent of the company's gross US-based revenues.
Mr John Rolls, Deutsche Bank chief executive officer in North America, said
the reorganisation was to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy for its US
securities operations could be developed under one roof.
He said the regulatory restrictions involved in having two key units, DBCC
and C. J. Lawrence, operate under separate banking and securities laws had
been burdensome.
The newly-united Deutsche Bank Securities will take aim at the rapidly
expanding market in cross-border securities, underwriting, broking and
dealing. It hopes to help feed the growing appetite of US investors for
European securities, and benefit from the growing interest in US stocks
among European investors.
Mr Rolls said the US operations of Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank
100 per cent-owned by Deutsche Bank, would not be affected by the
reorganisation.
Deutsche Bank Securities will be based in New York, with about 500 staff. It
will be run by Mr James Moltz, currently chairman and chief executive of C.
J. Lawrence, and Mr Horst Risse, head of DBCC.

750m in Lyons issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TIME Warner, the US entertainment group, plans to raise Dollars 750m through
an issue of Liquid Yield Option Notes (Lyons), a form of bond convertible
into stock.
The money from the issue, together with available cash, will be used to pay
off more expensive Time Warner debt. Although the issue has yet to be
priced, the Lyons will pay a lower interest rate than the 8 3/4 per cent
convertible subordinated debentures that are to be redeemed. The company
said the Lyons issue was part of its refinancing programme to lower the cost
of its debt and strengthen its balance sheet.
Earlier this year, Time Warner redeemed Dollars 3.6bn worth of convertible
preferred stock in a share-buy back.

BCE, Canada's biggest tele-communications group, is quitting the energy
business with the sale of 16.5 per cent of Talisman, formerly BP Canada, for
CDollars 326m (USDollars 251m).
BCE's 10.9m Talisman shares are being sold to a consortium of investment
houses made up of Burns Fry, Gordon Capital, Nesbitt Thomsom and Toronto
Dominion Securities at CDollars 30 a share.
The investment group proposes to resell the shares through the Montreal and
Toronto stock exchanges with settlement due June 21.
BCE, which is the parent company of Northern Telecom, diversified into
energy via TransCanada PipeLines in the mid-1980s. In the past three years,
it has sold its TCPL shares, but was left with control of Encor, TCPL's
exploration unit.
British Petroleum sold its 57 per cent stake in Talisman in May 1992 for
CDollars 373m.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chip maker which last year restructured its
global operations, reported record sales and earnings for 1992-93, lifted by
a strong fourth quarter.
Net earnings for the year ended May were Dollars 130.3m, or 98 cents a
share, compared with a loss of Dollars 120.1m, or Dollars 1.24, a year
earlier, after restructuring charges of Dollars 149.3m. Sales rose to
Dollars 2.01bn from Dollars 1.72bn.
'Passing the Dollars 2bn milestone in sales with record earnings represents
a real resurgence of both growth and profitability at National
Semiconductor,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive.
'I am gratified by the success of our efforts to rebuild the company, and
confident that we will be able to maintain our momentum.'
For the fourth quarter, National reported net earnings of Dollars 46.2m, or
35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 557.9m, compared with net earnings of
Dollars 27.5m, or 22 cents, on sales of Dollars 491.5m in the same period
last year.
'The past year was a period of tremendous progress at National
Semiconductor. We completed a large portion of our planned restructuring
activities, including significant expansion of our manufacturing centres at
Arlington, Texas, and Greenock, Scotland,' Mr Amelio said.
Over the past year, National cut its workforce by 3,800 people to 23,400,
cut back production in California and sold an assembly and test facility in
Bangkok.
Commenting on market conditions, Mr Amelio said that National expected
orders to weaken during the traditionally slow summer quarter, but that
sales may drop only marginally below the fourth-quarter level.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group which announced a large
investment in eastern Germany last week, moved back into the black in the
first four months. The group returned a profit after financial items of
FM86m (Dollars 16m), compared with a loss of FM76m last time.
Group sales were up 21 per cent to FM4.09bn, while operating profits rose
from FM496m last year, equivalent to 15 per cent of net sales, to FM964m, or
more than 23 per cent of net sales, in the first four months this year.
The improvement was attributed to the effects of the devaluation of the
Finnish markka in autumn, higher capacity utilisation, and improved
productivity.
However Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, warned it was unclear whether the
upward trend would continue. He said uncertainty had increased lately over
the key factors of economic conditions in Europe and price trends for
forestry products. Excess supply had so far kept markets tight, he said.
Enso spent almost FM1.8bn on capital expenditure in the first four months,
mainly on completing a pulp mill and a combined cycle power plant in
Finland. It said the emphasis would now switch to international operations.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anger over Fondiaria L1,058bn
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE analysts have voiced almost unanimous disapproval to Monday
night's surprise announcement of a L1,058bn (Dollars 724.16m) rights issue
by Fondiaria, Italy's third biggest private-sector insurer. The insurer
reported 1992 group losses of L578bn.
'This is a return to the bad old days of ignoring minority shareholders,
just at a time when Italy is supposed to be changing,' said one angry
London-based broker.
Shares in Fondiaria, controlled by the debt-laden Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin) holding company, fell sharply in Milan yesterday in response to the
2-for-1 rights issue, priced at L6,500 a share.
Fondiaria stock fell by over 10 per cent to L24,101 from L26,843 as
investors cut their losses by selling their holdings.
The rights issue, which will halve Fondiaria's total group debts of
L2,368bn, is seen as a barely veiled debt-for-equity swap by Ferfin's five
main creditor banks, which are underwriting the deal.
Gaic, the listed holding company which owns about 40 per cent of Fondiaria,
is not expected to take up its rights. Gaic is 80 per cent-owned by Ferfin
and the heirs of Mr Camillo De Benedetti. Ferfin owns about 11 per cent of
Fondiaria independently of Gaic. Neither is thought to be in a position to
acquire additional shares.
On that basis, the five underwriters - Mediobanca, Banca Commerciale
Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano and Istituto Bancario San Paolo di
Torino - will end up with about 30 per cent of Fondiaria. The underwriters'
stake could be appreciably higher if minority investors in Fondiaria fail to
take up their rights.
Separately, Mediobanca owns about 15 per cent of Fondiaria, while Generali,
the Italian insurer with which it is closely allied, has about 7 per cent.
The fact that the rights issue is roughly the same size as Fondiaria's
L1,105bn group debts to banks has reinforced fears that control is
effectively being transferred to Ferfin's main bankers without launching a
public tender offer, in the first step in the gradual dismemberment of the
Ferruzzi empire. Such transfers of control have been made more difficult
under new stock market rules, but remain possible.
Although Fondiaria's future is still unclear, the group is not expected to
survive in its present form in the long term.
Separately, shares in Ferfin and its subsidiaries continued falling heavily
on the Milan stock exchange, bringing down the stock of the group's five
main creditor banks and most of the market in their wake.
Trading in Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial operation, was suspended for
the second day running as dealers failed to fix a price between vendors and
purchasers owing to the weight of selling pressure. The stock was eventually
fixed at L779 for a fall of 20.1 per cent. Shares in Ferfin also plunged, by
10.4 per cent to L593.5 from L662.3 on Monday, while the Gaic holding
company, which controls the Fondiaria insurance group, quoted at L815 on
Monday failed to find a price.

sell-off plans

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN governments plan to privatise between Dollars 100bn and Dollars
150bn worth of state-owned companies in the next five years, according to a
new study by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, writes Peter Martin.
The biggest wave of privatisations will come in France, says the report,
where the government plans to sell off assets valued at between Dollars 30bn
and Dollars 40bn. Next comes the UK, with Dollars 20bn, Italy (Dollars
10bn-Dollars 15bn), Sweden (Dollars 10bn), Germany (Dollars 8bn) and Spain
(Dollars 5bn-Dollars 8bn).
The likely privatisations are concentrated in a few sectors, especially
telecommunications (between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the total assets
to be sold), energy and utilities. Together, these make up over half the
value of planned privatisations.
Mr David Roche, one of the authors of the study, said he expected
governments to be able to find buyers for these shares as long as interest
rates fell and they offered appropriate incentives to buyers together with a
stable political and regulatory framework.

FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rothschild pays the price of a
Swiss scandal / A look at an affair which has forced the family to bolster
bank reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it had been anyone but the Rothschilds, they would not have been able to
survive.'
That comment, from a leading Zurich banker, sums up the reaction to a
scandal that has held the Swiss financial community spellbound for the past
year. In the latest chapter, the bank revealed yesterday it had written off
SFr270m (Dollars 190.10m) provision for losses on bad loans.
The story began last July when Rothschild Bank, the Zurich-based affiliate
of N. M. Rothschild of London, announced it had to liquidate its SFr63.5m of
hidden reserves to help cover SFr100m in loan losses.
This was an immense loss for a bank with only SFr185m in capital and was
supposed to be in the business of managing rich people's funds, not lending.
A few days later, Mr Jurg Heer, the bank's credit manager, was arrested and
charged with defrauding the bank. More details later dribbled out. The
amount of the losses was more than SFr200m, undermining the bank's capital
base, and most of it had been loaned to one client, breaking Swiss law.
In October, Mr Heer, who had been freed by the Zurich police pending
completion of investigations, made a series of sensational charges in the
Swiss press. The bank was setting him up as a scapegoat, he said, and he
would do his best to implicate others.
He said the bank had been operating a 'criminal system' to help rich
Italians hide their fortunes from the tax authorities.
He claimed Rothschild had been involved in various schemes, even including
the payment to the alleged murderers of Mr Roberto Calvi, the former
chairman of Banco Ambrosiano found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in
London in 1982.
The bank yesterday again denied the allegations: 'We are convinced that
criminal proceedings will prove that Heer's statement as to a criminal
system within Rothschild Bank is untrue.'
The charges have caused immense damage to the reputation not only of the
Zurich bank, but also to the Rothschild family.
'Obviously, we have lost some clients,' says Mr Guy Wais, the general
manager hired last autumn to straighten the bank out.
However, the Rothschild family closed ranks, injected SFr120.5m of new
capital into its Zurich problem child and set about implementing the 100-odd
recommendations for tightening up procedures made in a study by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.
Operating profits have been maintained and Mr Wais says the net loss of
customers is 'not dramatic'. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, the chairman, writes
in the annual report that the bank is 'strongly placed to meet the
challenges of the future'.
A full picture of what actually went wrong must inevitably await the
completion of investigations, but the broad outlines are now clear.
The bank's troubles date from 1981 when Mr Gilbert de Botton, its original
general manager, left to work for Mr Jacob, now Lord, Rothschild's bank in
London (which has no association with the Zurich bank).
Baron Elie de Rothschild, head of the French family and then chairman of the
Zurich bank, hired Mr Alfred Hartmann, a Swiss banker, to replace him. By
all accounts, neither Baron Elie nor Mr Hartmann was particularly attentive
to the business, and a triumvirate of line executives, including Mr Heer,
were left largely on their own.
In the subsequent years, the bank would get into a couple of serious
scrapes, making an illegal loan to the Zug-based international commodity
dealers Marc Rich in 1984 and buying some SFr11.8m worth of Jacob Suchard
shares for its own account in 1991 when it was advising on a takeover bid
for the confectionery group.
The bank's most fateful adventure, however, was financing the projects of Mr
Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, two German Canadians with
an impressive record leading private consortia of European investors in
North American property deals.
Rothschild, through Mr Heer, provided loans to companies associated with
these two, mainly Castor and York Hannover. The documentation for the loans,
which a lawyer for Mr von Wersebe has shown to the FT, reveals very large
front-end commissions.
Moreover, on occasions, Mr Heer would observe that Rothschild's own lending
exposure to the York Hannover-Castor companies was at its legal limit, so
would propose organising some Rothschild clients into a private consortium
to provide the loans through an offshore company.
In 1991, when the squeeze in the North American property market became
acute, the lending increased to a level that began to arouse suspicion at
the bank. And early last year, when both York Hannover and Castor collapsed,
Rothschild found itself with a huge portfolio of worthless loans.
What remains at issue is who committed illegal acts. Mr Heer has admitted
skimming off SFr30m in commissions on his lending activity, an amount that
is remarkably close to the commissions shown in Mr von Wersebe's
documentation.
Rothschild has maintained that Mr Heer was acting alone and hoodwinked the
bank's directors and auditors. Baron Elie and Mr Hartmann, who was deputy
chairman, have since left the board, and the bank's former auditors, KPMG,
Fides Peat, have been replaced.
Outsiders cannot understand how one man could have committed a relatively
small bank to SFr270m in loans without other directors being fully briefed.
The Banking Commission's investigation is aimed at discovering whether
others, perhaps including some officers still at the bank, were complicit.
Investigations are being seriously hampered by the disappearance of Mr Heer.
He fled Switzerland in December.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Growth found in its customers' footsteps -
The strategy of Tibbett &amp; Britten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA, Canada and Portugal might seem an eclectic group of countries
for a UK distribution and warehousing specialist to choose for its overseas
expansion plans.
However, these varied territories are the focus for the rapidly growing
international activities of Tibbett &amp; Britten Group, the company previously
best known for distributing garments in the UK for Marks and Spencer.
The common theme is Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group which
sold its stake in Tibbett to a management buy-out in 1984. The distributor
has maintained a close relationship with its former parent, and Tibbett's
businesses in the three countries all have their origins in that connection.
Mr John Harvey, Tibbett's chairman, said the overseas moves were in line
with his group's strategy of following its multinational customers and then
developing related business around these core contracts.
Mr Harvey was the director of Unilever who initiated the multinational's
investment in Tibbett and led the management buy-out. He said: 'We've got
lots of buddies in Unilever and have always kept in touch.'
The connection was underlined this month when Tibbett appointed Mr Michael
Johnson, 59, as non-executive director. He had retired as head of
information technology for Unilever in January, after 30 years. For the last
three years he had been responsible for Unilever's information technology
policies, designed to take advantage of the capability of open systems.
By maintaining Unilever-type reporting systems and financial disciplines,
Tibbett has found it easy to do business with other multinationals.
This policy of establishing bridgeheads was clearly demonstrated in South
Africa. Last June Tibbett paid Unilever Pounds 2m for SA Warehousing
Services, which distributes throughout South Africa for Unilever and others.
In November the total food distribution operation of Woolworth (South
Africa) was acquired.
Tibbett's market capitalisation has grown tenfold since it came to the
market in 1986, and has almost doubled since 1990. Last year it made a
Pounds 31m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Silcock Express, a
private company which distributes motor vehicles in the UK, France, Belgium,
Spain and Portugal.
The deal added motors to the group's four existing distribution specialities
in fast-moving consumer goods, which include clothing and textiles,
toiletries and cosmetics, groceries and DIY and electrical products.
Tibbett now operates in eight countries. Last year, the UK generated more
than 90 per cent of group sales, but by the end of this year overseas
operations should account for more than 25 per cent.
Despite this rapid spurt of growth Tibbett has made relatively few
acquisitions. Its previous important deal was the purchase of Lowfield, the
grocery distributor, in 1989 for Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Harvey said he preferred to grow business, rather than make acquisitions.
His priority was now to infill in Europe behind the Silcock openings,
particularly in France, Spain and Portugal. There were obvious gaps in
Silcock's network, such as Germany and Italy.
The group also intends to reinforce its investment in Canada and South
Africa. Mr Harvey said there were plenty of opportunities in North America,
but he intended to stick to Canada until they had built a significant
regional base.
On South Africa, he conceded: 'It is an unstable area, there's obviously
some risk. But if you're taking a medium to long-term view, places like
South Africa and China must be considered.'
Tibbett has moved substantially away from its dependence on Marks and
Spencer, which generated 60 per cent of turnover at the 1986 flotation.
Although the M&amp;S business has since grown three-fold, it currently accounts
for only 11 per cent of group sales.
Concern about preserving M&amp;S's commercial confidentiality has prevented
Tibbett from giving a detailed breakdown of its results by division, but it
seems likely that it will in future.
Despite what it described as 'difficult trading conditions everywhere',
Tibbett's sales rose 28 per cent to Pounds 231.8m last year. The group said
69 per cent of its growth was generated organically while 80 per cent of
revenue was contractually based.
Development was particularly strong in the consumer and personal products
divisions.
Although trading continues to be depressed in the clothing and textiles
division, Mr Harvey said he was happy to keep the Fashion Logistics network,
the biggest single specialised clothing distributor in Europe, which
supplies 35 per cent of UK market outside the big chains. The Marks and
Spencer business evolved out of the network, and it remains a potential
source of separate dedicated distribution operations.
Clothing and motors offer the best hope of recovery and growth in the medium
term. The group cites market research last year which forecast a 30 per cent
increase in total new car and light vehicle registrations between 1992 and
1996 in the five countries where Silcock operates, with growth particularly
in the UK, Spain and Portugal.
Mr Harvey is anxious not to raise expectations too much, but seems quietly
confident about winning new business: 'We have never been busier quoting.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Melville Street Investments, an investment trust specialising in venture and
development capital, saw net asset value fall 10p to 140p over the year to
April 30.
Directors said the fall was largely attributable to the reduced value of one
of the group's investments in the Lloyds insurance market.
Net revenue edged ahead to Pounds 800,758 (Pounds 790,887), equivalent to
earnings of 4.3p (4.2p) per share.
A same-again final dividend of 2.5p maintains the total at 4p but directors
warned that some reduction in the distribution may become necessary as the
company becomes fully invested. It currently has Pounds 3m on deposit.

London &amp; Clydeside Holdings, the USM-quoted housebuilder operating
throughout Scotland, turned round from a loss of Pounds 120,000 to a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 34,000 in the six months to March 31.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.47m, against Pounds 10.8m, which included a Pounds
2.5m property disposal. Operating profit was down to Pounds 522,000 (Pounds
697,000) because 1991-92 benefited from Pounds 220,000 from associates.
Net interest payable, however, dropped to Pounds 488,000 (Pounds 817,000).
The interim dividend is held at 1.8p, payable from earnings per share of
0.2p (losses 0.6p).
House reservations in January, February and March showed considerable
improvement and although the month-on-month increase had reduced, there
seemed to be an underlying recovery in the market, directors stated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Without the burden of closure costs this time, Wellman lifted pre-tax profit
from Pounds 231,000 to Pounds 681,000 in the year ended March 31. The
dividend, however, is reduced from 2.2p to 0.9p.
Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman of this specialist engineer, said activity in all
markets was lower but the result was broadly in line with expectations.
Margins were under pressure and with no indication of an immediate upturn,
the cost base would continue to be adjusted where necessary.
The forward order book, he added, was higher than last year but prospective
margins had been eroded.
Turnover came to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 24m) and trading profit to Pounds
796,000 (Pounds 1.02m). There was a Pounds 250,000 provision for further
rationalisation, while last year's extraordinary Pounds 817,000 for closure
costs has been adjusted to above the line under FRS 3.
Turnover included Pounds 1.87m from acquisitions (Pounds 1.36m from
discontinued operations) and the respective figures in the trading profit
were Pounds 101,000 (Pounds 75,000).
Earnings per share doubled to 1p. The dividend is reduced to keep in line
with earnings; the final is 0.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, the textiles and clothing company, is taking advantage of
India's relaxation of foreign investment rules by taking control of its
Indian associate, Madura Coats.
Coats has increased its stake in the company, which is to be renamed Coats
Viyella India, from 39.9 per cent to 51 per cent. The total investment of
Rs604m (Pounds 12.25m) is payable in three tranches spread between now and
next year.
The Indian operations were wholly owned until 1972 when the company was
forced by changes in legislation to reduce its holding below 50 per cent.
Following a relaxation of the rules on foreign shareholdings, Coats applied
last year for government approval to again increase its stake.
It will lift its holding through a preferential share offer at Rs65 a share,
a steep discount to the recent market price of Rs275. The offer, which was
approved by shareholders last month, will be followed by a rights issue next
year at Rs30.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coats regains control of Indian side

<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, the textiles and clothing company, is taking advantage of
India's relaxation of foreign investment rules by taking control of its
Indian associate, Madura Coats.
Coats has increased its stake in the company, which is to be renamed Coats
Viyella India, from 39.9 per cent to 51 per cent. The total investment of
Rs604m (Pounds 12.25m) is payable in three tranches spread between now and
next year.
The Indian operations were wholly owned until 1972 when the company was
forced by changes in legislation to reduce its holding below 50 per cent.
Following a relaxation of the rules on foreign shareholdings, Coats applied
last year for government approval to again increase its stake.
It will lift its holding through a preferential share offer at Rs65 a share,
a steep discount to the recent market price of Rs275. The offer, which was
approved by shareholders last month, will be followed by a rights issue next
year at Rs30.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Manweb staying close to basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANWEB, the electricity company which distributes in Liverpool and North
Wales, yesterday re-affirmed its strategy of concentrating on its basic
businesses as it announced a 15 per cent increase in dividends.
Acknowledging pressure from some City sources to use its low gearing to
diversify, Mr John Roberts, chief executive, said: 'We want to stay close to
the core. We will resist the temptation to take on businesses we cannot
manage sensibly.'
Manweb is the only one of the 12 regional electricity companies which is not
involved in building combined cycle gas stations.
The total dividend increase from 18.25p to 21p for the year ended March 31
1993 was the latest in a series of double figure percentage rises among
electricity companies. It was achieved on profits before tax of Pounds
111.2m, up 17 per cent on the previous Pounds 94.7m. Turnover was Pounds
919.9m (Pounds 834.6m).
Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 69.3p (58.7p). The final dividend is
14.9p.
Although distribution, the main earner, saw profits fall from Pounds 106.3m
to Pounds 101.4m, supply turned a Pounds 5.3m loss into a Pounds 6.9m profit
and retailing converted a Pounds 2.1m loss into a Pounds 500,000 profit.
On the supply side, Manweb won back the custom of 38 local large consumers
who chose in previous years to contract with other regional electricity
companies after the liberalisation of the market for users of more than 1MW.
It also won the custom of 18 new customers outside the region.
Mr John Astall, finance director, indicated the company had less to lose
than other regional electricity companies from the further liberalisation of
the market next year. He said only 9.5 per cent of its customers were in the
section of the market where competition is being introduced (between 100kW
and 1MW), whereas the regional electricity companies average was 15.5 per
cent.
The company's drive to cut staff has slowed, with only 100 jobs shed in the
last year. However, it said profit per employee had improved by 15 per cent
to Pounds 24,000 during the year.
Manweb already claims to have reduced staff by more than other regional
electricity companies, with the total in the business now 4,350. Of these
3,465 are in the core business, a 25 per cent reduction on when the company
was privatised.
The company plans to invest Pounds 12.5m on a network management system
which will monitor transmission equipment and switchgear automatically. It
expects to save Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.5m a year when the system is fully
running.
Mr Bryan Weston, chairman, said the annual report would show that executive
salaries rose by about the cost of living for the year just ended.
The pay bill for all staff will rise by about 3.5 per cent as result of a
deal being considered by union members. The basic increase is 2.85 per cent,
but the pay and reward system is also being restructured.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dairy Crest confirms float plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products arm of the Milk Marketing Board,
has confirmed its plan to float early next year.
It made the announcement when reporting a rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 24.6m to Pounds 28.2m for the year to March 31, after exceptional
restructuring costs of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 20.9m).
Mr Geoffrey John, chairman, said that there were still many unknowns in the
flotation and the industry itself was undergoing far-reaching change.
He said it was too early to be precise about the shareholder structure after
the flotation, but that dairy farmers could hold about 70 per cent of the
capital.
The farmers will receive shares representing the 'free reserves' of the MMB,
worth on average Pounds 8,000 per farmer, and will be offered shares or cash
to settle their entitlement to the MMB's 'rolling fund', totalling about
Pounds 60m.
Dairy Crest also plans to raise new money and the group's market
capitalisation could be about Pounds 250m. Schroders and Hoare Govett will
be handling the flotation.
Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said that Dairy Crest had achieved a
great deal but still had much to do to succeed in the 'new world'. He said:
'We have no illusions as to the nature of the challenge that awaits us.'
He said that when the MMB was abolished next year, Dairy Crest's first duty
would be 'to buy milk on a very competitive basis'. He added that Dairy
Crest was not committed to buying from Milk Marque, the milk buying
co-operative which the MMB is planning as its successor.
Group turnover was unchanged at Pounds 1.16bn, although Dairy Crest, which
is the buyer of last resort under the existing milk scheme, had bought 5.5
per cent less milk as milk quotas reduced production. Prices of milk for
manufacture rose 16 per cent.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 59.2m to Pounds 62.2m, with margins up
from 5.6 to 6 per cent. Greater operating efficiencies were being achieved,
Mr Houliston said. Staff had been reduced by 1,300 during the year, and by
30 per cent over the last three years. Capital spending was running at about
Pounds 30m a year.
Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 8.3m, with about
Pounds 1m of the fall coming from lower interest rates and the rest from the
reduction in net debt from Pounds 101.1m to Pounds 69.5m.
The company also announced a number of board appointments including Mr
Graham Fish, as managing director of the dairies business. Five
non-executive directors, with diary or commercial experience, will be
appointed on August 1 in preparation for the float.
They are Mr Richard Fletcher, an MMB member, Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman of
Hays, Mr Thomas Hugh Jones, an MMB member, Mr Paul Lewis, deputy chairman
and finance director of Tate &amp; Lyle, and Mr William Madders, a special MMB
member.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Reduction in fee income leaves AJ Archer
Pounds 0.3m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL IN fee income from its syndicates pushed AJ Archer, the Lloyd's
agency, into the red at the interim stage.
Pre-tax losses for the six months to March 31 of Pounds 292,000 compared
with profits of Pounds 267,000 last time.
Capacity of the group's syndicates fell from Pounds 368m in 1992 to Pounds
201m. Profit commission on the syndicates in the 1990 year fell to Pounds
300,000 compared with Pounds 700,000 in 1989.
Losses per share were 1p, against earnings of 0.7p. The interim dividend is
cut to 0.5p (2.2p).
The group also announced the completion of its agreement, originally
announced in March, to buy Castle Holdings, a rival Lloyd's agency.
Consideration is 11.2m new shares - valued at Pounds 5.2m - and options over
a further 1.27m shares.
In addition, the vendors will be entitled to receive 50 per cent of the
aggregate profit commissions attributable to Castle's syndicates for
underwriting years from 1990 to 1993.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry launches utility trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON FRY, the financial services company best known for its business
expansion schemes, is launching its first investment trust. The Johnson Fry
Utilities Trust will buy shares in privatised water, electricity,
telecommunications and gas companies.
The trust will have a split capital structure with ordinary income and zero
dividend preference shares. The zeros will have first claim on the assets of
the trust and will grow at a rate equivalent to a gross redemption yield of
9 per cent per year over the trust's 10 year life.
The income shares will receive all the dividends and the remaining assets
after the zeros have been repaid. The initial gross yield on the income
shares is expected to be 9 per cent. Assets will have to grow at 3.7 per
cent per year for the income shares to be repaid at their issue price of
100p.
Some 75 per cent of the portfolio will be in utilities. The remaining 25 per
cent will be invested in irredeemable preference shares, to help boost the
overall yield. Further income will be earned by writing call options against
part of the trust's utility holdings.
The trust aims to raise Pounds 40m, including Pounds 10m worth of zero
dividend preference shares. The issue expenses have been capped at 4.2 per
cent and the the manager's annual fee will be 0.5 per cent of assets.
Applications must be for a minimum of Pounds 3,000. Those who opt for the
income shares can place them in a personal equity plan for an additional
charge of Pounds 30 per year.
There is also the facility for a share exchange for those who own shares
from previous privatisations. The trust will buy shares at the bid price at
no dealing charge. Any exchanges, however, must be made on top of an
additional cash investment of Pounds 3,000.
The issue is sponsored by Smith New Court and will close on July 6 (for
income shares) and July 8 (for zeros).
COMMENT
A portfolio of utility shares is such a natural choice for private investors
that it is surprising no-one has launched an investment trust in this area
before. The question is whether utilities have had such a good run that the
trust is being launched at the top of the cycle. Certainly, with 25 per cent
of the portfolio in preference shares, prospects for capital growth may be
limited, given that income holders already need 3.7 per cent annual growth
in assets just to get their money back. That said, the recent falls in
interest rates have created demand for high-yielding equity investments and
this ought to be safer than most. The zeros, which yield 9 per cent and are
well covered, may be especially appealing to higher rate taxpayers.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: David Lloyd Leisure beats forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID LLOYD Leisure, the tennis court and health club group that floated
earlier this year, exceeded its forecasts by returning interim profits ahead
84 per cent.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.94m on sales up 33 per
cent at Pounds 8.75m. The large increase resulted from the inclusion of five
new tennis and fitness centres that were not on stream in the first half of
last year.
Mr David Lloyd, who launched the group after running similar centres in
North America, said the group was ahead of schedule for the opening of its
latest club in Glasgow.
Profits from existing clubs grew by about 7 per cent, held back by less than
usual growth in profits from bowling. Mr David Gray, finance director, said
the main growth would continue to come from the introduction of new centres
which brought with them an immediate increase in memberships. The group
plans to introduce two new clubs a year.
Earnings per share rose from 2.8p to 4.1p. As forecast there will be no
interim dividend; first payment will be at the end of the first full year.
Mr Lloyd said that profits were normally heavily skewed towards the second
half of the year but, because of the introduction of the new centres, that
would not be so marked this year.
Nevertheless, the group was on target to hit the Pounds 5.5m pre-tax profit
forecast made at the time of the flotation.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bradford Property falls to Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted residential property
company, yesterday announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 23.1m to
Pounds 21.1m for the 12 months to April 5.
The total dividend is increased by 21 per cent from 4.45p to 5.4p with a
recommended final of 3p.
The dividend is increased to a level that matches the surplus from property
rentals after payment of tax and preference dividend.
The company's business centres on buying tenanted properties at a discount
to reflect the statutory rights of sitting tenants under the Rent Acts and
selling them with vacant possession.
Since the 1988 Housing Act, the company has been able to let property that
becomes vacant free of rent controls. About 90 per cent of its portfolio is
currently subject to rent controls.
Dealing profits were down, from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 9.45m, reflecting the
state of the housing market over the last year. However, the surplus from
property rentals increased from Pounds 9.79m to Pounds 11.8m.
This partly reflected acquisitions of new property, including a portfolio
from Asda Property. It also resulted from larger rent increases.
The interest charge was Pounds 1.76m, against a credit last time of Pounds
15,000. That reflected the acquisition of property worth about Pounds 60m
during the past two years.
Earnings per share fell from 10.76p to 9.87p. Net asset value per share fell
from 175p to 170p.
COMMENT
The City was prepared to overlook Bradford's fall in profits yesterday in
favour of its exceptionally strong dividend prospects. This year's 21 per
cent dividend increase may be followed by increases of between 15 per cent
and 20 per cent for the next couple of years, as rental surpluses swell. In
addition to rent rises in its existing portfolio, the company may benefit
from more acquisitions. With gearing of 15 per cent, the company could, in
principle, sink another Pounds 100m into new acquisitions. But like the
property sector as whole, the shares are probably due for a period of
consolidation. The shares, which yesterday dipped from 197p to 192p, are
trading on a 7 per cent premium to assets, assuming a rise in net asset
value to 180p next year. But taking a long term view, the shares should
prove a rewarding play on an improvement in the residential property market.

<TEXT>
FURTHER management changes have been announced at Aer Lingus, Ireland's
loss-making state airline, in the lead-up to a substantial rationalisation
plan which was discussed at cabinet level yesterday.
This is expected to be unveiled by the government before the end of the
month. No official details have been released but the plan is thought to
include voluntary redundancies of up to 1,000 out of 13,000 employees
worldwide and reorganisation and possible closure of some loss - making
routes.
Mr Peter Owen, appointed chief executive three months ago, said the new
management structure is 'designed to give the necessary leadership and
impetus to the major programme of change that lies ahead.'
Other changes are thought to include revision of the fare structure, the
sale of certain non-core assets such as its UK hotel chain, and a link-up
with an overseas airline. Included also is a probable abandonment of the
controversial 'Shannon stopover' which obliges all transatlantic flights in
and out of Ireland to stop at Shannon, in the west of Ireland.
Few of the company's 43 routes are thought to be profitable at present.
Losses are expected to reach IPounds 90m (Pounds 88m) this year, adding to a
debt estimated at close to IPounds 600m.
The government has promised an equity injection, thought to be in the region
of IPounds 120m, as long as the company's management comes up with a viable
recovery plan. A previous plan, presented by Mr Cathal Mullan, Mr Owen's
predecessor, was rejected by the government.
The Aer Lingus unions are warning that they will oppose any sell-off of
company assets. Mr Peter O'Sullivan, the civil aviation representative for
Siptu, the airline's principal union, said 'we are heading for industrial
action.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Organic progress behind Volex advance to
Pounds 7.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company whose chief
executive was headhunted by Farnell Electronics in May, doubled profits in
the year to March 31.
The shares rose 18p to 405p.
The rise from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 7.34m was struck on turnover up from
Pounds 81.6m to Pounds 106.1m. Mr Ken Hooper, finance director, said it was
difficult to say how much of the advance was organic growth and how much
derived from acquisitions because of the way the new companies had been
woven into the group. However, Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said that the
result contained a 'good amount' of organic progress.
During the year, Volex spent Pounds 8.5m on acquisitions. It added Icontec
in July 1992 and Component Manufacturing Systems in January 1993 to its
Cable Products operation in the US.
In October 1992 it also bought a 60 per cent stake in Mayor, the
Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies.
Guided by Mr Howard Poulson, the outgoing chief executive described by Mr
Goodall as 'a good strategic thinker', Volex has become a worldwide supplier
of cable assemblies to the computer, medical and instrumentation markets.
Mr Goodall said this global strategy was a lesson learned from the wiring
systems side, which supplies the automotive industry. Here Volex has
withdrawn from supplying volume car manufacturers - which opted for global
suppliers - and has instead targeted markets such as off-road and
agricultural vehicles, sports and specialist cars, Rolls-Royce and Aston
Martin. The division is being restructured and the St Helens factory was
closed. There was also a Pounds 654,000 bad debt provision from Leyland DAF
taken as an exceptional charge.
Some 40 per cent of the growth at Pencon, the UK maker of power cords, was
organic, the company said, and Pounds 3m of the group's Pounds 7.8m capital
expenditure allowed capacity to be increased. Legislation for the
pre-fitting of plugs to electrical appliances is expected this year.
January's Pounds 17.5m rights issue helped increase shareholders' funds to
Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 29.5m) and at the year-end, Volex had net positive
funds of Pounds 5.9m. The final dividend is lifted to 11.35p for a 17.85p
(17p) total, payable from earnings of 22.5p (14.9p) per share.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alpine part owned by Smith family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALPINE (Double Glazing), the UK windows company which ceased trading in May,
is part-owned by the family of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur,
Alpine directors told a packed meeting of angry creditors yesterday.
It was also revealed that within weeks of buying Alpine's assets from
administrators in 1992 for Pounds 1.1m, Finchfleet, an offshore company
partly owned by Mr Smith's family, sold them to its own subsidiary for
Pounds 3.1m.
More than 150 people packed the Coasters Executive Club in Rayners Lane,
London, yesterday. They fired a series of hostile questions at Mr Robert
Pollock and Mr Robin Spiers, Alpine's chairman and chief executive
respectively, who were flanked by security guards.
Creditors demanded details of Mr Smith's involvement with Alpine and the
links with Cellular Telecom, a mobile communications company of which Mr
Pollock is also a director.
Mr Pollock said Alpine had provided a letter of financial support about 12
months ago to Cellular Telecom for just under Pounds 300,000. Creditors
questioned whether this was appropriate given Alpine's financial condition.
Alpine directors said the company had been forced to cease trading in May
because of bad debts and litigation. The formal statement of Alpine's
affairs, drawn up by directors, showed creditors it had assets of Pounds
1.2m and debts of about Pounds 4m. In light of its financial condition,
creditors appointed Mr Martin Iredale of Cork Gully and Mr Tony Thompson of
KPMG Peat Marwick joint liquidators.
It emerged at the meeting that Alpine is owned by Finchfleet, a
Guernsey-based but British Virgin Islands-registered company. It in turn is
jointly owned by Finchley Investments, the offshore vehicle for Mr Smith's
family interests, and Le-an Holdings, another offshore company.
Mr Pollock, questioned about whether Le-an was connected with his own family
interests, refused to comment.
Mr Pollock said Ibex, the company which bought Alpine in 1992, had been
acting as the 'undisclosed agent' of Finchfleet at the time.
Ibex - which later changed its name to Alpine - bought the assets of the old
Alpine for Pounds 1.1m on behalf of Finchfleet. Finchfleet then sold those
same assets to Ibex for about Pounds 3m, the meeting heard.
Finchfleet, which is owed Pounds 1.8m by Alpine, has waived all claims on
the windows company in the last few days.
Mr Pollock said he received faxed instructions from Finchfleet from time to
time, although he and Mr Spiers had been responsible for the day-to-day
running of Alpine.
In the last 15 months the company has not paid any money, such as PAYE, to
the Inland Revenue. Mr Pollock said the company was owed money by various
government agencies. 'Our view was if they wouldn't pay us, why pay them,'
he said.
Mr Pollock added that fees totalling Pounds 20,000 for Mr Graham Wilson, the
insolvency practitioner who called yesterday's meeting, had been paid last
week.
A creditors' committee was formed representing former employees, and the
Inland Revenue. Mr Paul Snook, of Touche Ross, is also on the committee
representing John Freckleton and Son.
Mr Smith has been involved in the flotation of several natural resource
companies, two of which are the subject of a Serious Fraud Office
investigation. He recently narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when
creditors, owed more than Pounds 20m, approved his proposals for an
individual voluntary arrangement.

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Spurs antagonists score series of own goals
 -The boardroom clash between Terry Venables and Alan Sugar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a rare chairman of a public company who openly admits to knowing
nothing about the service he provides his customers.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, cheerfully
admits he knows nothing about football. Furthermore, having on Monday
successfully won a High Court judge's backing to sack Mr Terry Venables, the
chief executive, he says he will continue to keep his 'nose out of
football.'
Mr Venables, a notable footballer and on-the-field tactician, knew nothing
about running a business, according to Mr Sugar.
The two should have made a great team. But as Mr Sugar's decision to sack Mr
Venables clearly demonstrates, the club's two largest shareholders have
strung together little more than a series of own goals over the past month.
Yesterday Mr Venables, who continues to hold a 22 per cent equity stake in
the north London soccer club, remained publicly defiant, but nevertheless
appeared to be somewhat on the defensive.
At a press conference held in Scribes West, his private members club in the
basement of Barkers store in Kensington High Street, he defended his record
at Spurs and attacked Mr Sugar for his 'unfounded accusations' and
'innuendo.'
He professed to be determined to go ahead with a court bid to force Mr Sugar
to sell him his 48 per cent stakeholding despite Monday's High Court
setback.
'The real issue is to get Alan Sugar to sell his shares in the Plc,' he said
but declined to identify his financial backers. 'I cannot say who my backers
are,' he said,'these people do not want to be dragged into court.'
By contrast, Mr Sugar, speaking from the White Hart Lane headquarters he now
dominates, appeared relaxed and dismissive of Mr Venables' rearguard action.
'That game is over,' he said.
Mr Sugar faces, however, a significant challenge. It is unlikely he has ever
had to deal with a more volatile clutch of assets - some of whom have
requested a transfer to other clubs.
Nor will he have seen a more fiery customer base - although he says sales
evaporated at Amstrad in the late 1980s when IBM overnight cut its prices on
personal computers.
Mr Sugar was most dismissive of the threat of a player boycott. He said no
players were currently up for sale. Requests for transfers from Neil Ruddock
and Nick Barmby had been rejected. Ray Clemence and Doug Livermore, the
assistant coaches, would continue with day to day running of the team.
Buying and selling of players would resume, however, as a normal part of the
close season club activity.
Mr Sugar saved his sweetest message, however, for the fans who appear to
resent his early statements that a football club was a business which had to
make money.
'It has to be profitable and it is a business and I do have a lot of
confidence in sport and leisure,' Mr Sugar said almost apologetically. But
'it has become close to my heart and I enjoy it tremendously. But that will
not make me go raving mad with my cheque book.'
By declining to get involved in the footballing side, Mr Sugar has
effectively spiked one of Mr Venables guns.
Asked if he thought Mr Sugar was the best person to run Spurs, Mr Venables
said he did not think so and added, 'he is going to have to rely on other
people.'
And on the boycott? Mr Venables was careful to protect his stake in the
club. Asked whether he was in favour of fans boycotting season ticket sales
and about the rumours of mass defection by players, he said he wanted the
club to 'go forwards' and 'do well' in order to protect his investment.
Just how badly his and Mr Sugar's investments have been damaged by the month
long legal skirmish will probably only emerge once the season restarts.
However, Mr Sugar already has an answer if attendance is low. 'If we are
drawn against Oldham in our first home game I will use that as an excuse for
why attendance is low.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Share shops role in BT sale promoted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging share shops to target BT shareholders and
employees in a move to deflect criticism of its handling of the BT sale.
Some of the 150 share shops have complained that the government has marketed
its own share information office number at their expense in the run-up to
the sale of the government's remaining 21.9 per cent BT shareholding.
Of the 1.8m potential investors only 700,000 have chosen to register through
a share shop.
Mr James Sassoon, director of SG Warburg, the government's global
co-ordinator, said: 'Share shops may want to focus on converting the 2.4m
pre-registered shareholders from the share information office into share
shops so that they do not miss out on top level preferences in allocation.'
The government's advisers are suggesting that share shops could target their
advertising towards BT shareholders and employees.
Two of the share shops yesterday questioned how they could get a list of the
BT shareholders without the help of the company or the government.
However, Mr David Jones, chief executive of ShareLink, whose shareholders
include Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and Eagle Star, said: 'No one should
expect the government to facilitate contact between BT employees,
shareholders and share shops.'
Big shareholders yesterday said they did not expect to pay more than 10p a
share above the price for retail investors on the first instalment.
The government will announce the price of the first instalment for the
international offer on June 29. The first payment for the retail investor
has been set at 150p. The second instalment, set at 140p, and the third, to
be determined by the demand from big shareholders, will be the same for all
investors.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Warburg seeks cash dealing in BT shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent, STEVE THOMPSON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange, at the request of merchant bank SG Warburg, is
asking marketmakers in British Telecommunications shares to take the
unprecedented step of accepting dealings in the shares on a cash settlement
basis. The move would allow Warburg, the global co-ordinator in the sale of
the third tranche of the government's stake in BT, to learn who had bought
or sold BT shares before share allocations were announced.
Dealings for cash settlement are known within 48 hours while under the
account settlement system, it takes two weeks. Thus, sellers of shares will
be identified. Those judged by BT's advisers to have sold in an effort to
depress the price will be allocated fewer shares in the BT3 issue.
In a letter dated June 11 to marketmakers in BT shares, the stock exchange
said it is asking for their co-operation 'to ensure that the existing Fully
Paid register is as up to date as possible'.
'Warburgs have requested that the Exchange recommend dealings in the two
trading accounts prior to the close of the offer (in mid July) take place on
a Cash Settlement basis. The Exchange are prepared to support this in
principle.'
The stock exchange has told marketmakers that those who do not respond by
today will be assumed to agree.
Last night, the exchange said it did not know the results of its poll of
marketmakers. However, a Warburg official said: 'The feedback we've had has
not been negative.'
News of the Warburg move has led to strong protests from some institutional
shareholders and marketmakers. They argued that such disclosure will
discourage sellers, thereby tending to support the BT share price during the
bidding process for the BT3 shares. They say the move stops them selling
shares, normal practice in the run-up to a new issue.
The absence of this selling will tend to support the BT share price before
the bidding process for BT3 shares.
But Warburg insists its request is not intended to uncover sellers, only
buyers, so that it may reward them with higher allocations of new shares.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Shares in water up on Wessex results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatised UK water sector, overshadowed recently by regulatory worries,
rallied yesterday after better-than-expected results from Wessex Water, one
of the smallest of the 10 companies.
Wessex reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.9m
to Pounds 86m in the year to March 31. Wessex's shares gained 12p to 570p.
Other water companies which have seen their shares fall sharply in the last
month, such as North West and Welsh, rose by as much as 3 per cent.
Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman, said the results were 'excellent'. 'I'm proud of
it, but not smug,' he said.
Wessex's unregulated businesses, mainly the joint venture with Waste
Management International of the US, performed well, contributing Pounds 7.1m
after interest costs compared with Pounds 2.7m last year. Another
unregulated business, contractor Wimpey Wessex, recorded a Pounds 200,000
loss on a contract and is to be closed.
Group turnover increased 8 per cent, in line with average price increases,
to Pounds 205.6m. Operating costs were unchanged and helped toward a 20 per
cent increase in operating profits of Pounds 81m.
In January, Wessex raised Pounds 144.5m through a rights issue and other
funding to pay for its share of the acquisition cost of the waste arm of
NFC, the transport group. Proceeds from the issue helped improve Wessex's
net cash position from Pounds 15m to Pounds 54m by the year end. However,
the timing of cash flows made interest income fall sharply, from Pounds 8.5m
to Pounds 500,000.
Capital expenditure on improving water and sewerage quality peaked at Pounds
130m. Depreciation increased 10 per cent to Pounds 21.1m.
Streamlining acquisitions led to cost savings which were expected to
continue. Mr Hood said price increases of between 5 and 15 per cent had been
achieved at some of the landfills acquired through the NFC purchase.
Fully diluted earnings were affected by a higher tax charge and increased 6
per cent to 60.1p. The company recommended a final dividend of 14.2p to make
a total of 21.5p, an increase of 10 per cent. Mr Hood said the increase was
partly justified by the rising contribution from unregulated businesses.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Saudi Arabian merger will create biggest oil concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is to merge its two main oil companies creating the largest
integrated oil concern in the world, the kingdom said on Monday. Samarec,
the kingdom's refining and marketing arm, will be merged into the oil
production company, Saudi Aramco.
'It will give the company more energy to look at expanding outside Saudi
Arabia and compete head-on with the oil majors. Its potential power as a
joint company is profound,' said Mr Robin West, who runs Petroleum Finance
Company, an energy consulting group in Washington.
Saudi Arabia is looking to expand its downstream outlets for oil through
deals in Europe and Asia as well as continuing to expand its production
capacity beyond 10m barrels a day. The company's drive to become involved in
the industry worldwide will put it into direct competition with
multinational oil companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon.
Aramco is already the world's largest exporter with current output of 8m b/d
and current production capacity of 9m b/d. The company is also custodian of
the kingdom's 295bn barrels of proven oil reserves.
Samarec will bring to the merger 1.23m b/d refining capacity from three
wholly-owned and three joint venture refineries in Saudi Arabia. This will
take the joint company into all stages of the oil industry: production,
refining, transport and marketing.
Saudi officials said the merger came at the request of Mr Hisham Nazer, the
oil minister, who has been looking to streamline the nation's oil industry
for some time.
Before the move Samarec (Saudi Arabian marketing and refining company) ran
the country's three domestic refineries at Jeddah, Riyadh and Yanbu and was
the Saudi partner in joint venture export refineries with Mobil at Yanbu and
Shell at Jubail.
Saudi Aramco already runs the Ras Tanura refinery - the world's biggest with
capacity of 520,000 b/d until a fire in 1990 cut output to around 290,000
b/d.
The newly augmented Saudi Aramco will continue a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn)
to Dollars 15bn expansion plan, set to raise Saudi oil production capacity
to a sustainable 10m b/d by next year from present levels of around 9m b/d.

FT  16 JUN 93 / HJ Heinz moves to cut costs worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HJ HEINZ, the US food group, yesterday announced a range of cost-cutting
moves, involving an 8 per cent reduction in its worldwide workforce of
35,500 and a cut in its UK operations.
The company will take a Dollars 192m (Pounds 124m) pre-tax charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for the shake-up.
Heinz's chairman, Mr Tony O'Reilly, claimed the latest restructuring charge
would help Heinz speed up productivity improvements, and concentrate a
three-year rationalisation programme into 12 months. Analysts, however, saw
the action as further evidence of the pressures which the
intensely-competitive retail sector is putting on the big consumer product
companies.
'All the food companies are responding to the pressure by accelerating this
sort of restructuring,' said Mr Les Pugh at Salomon Brothers in New York,
noting that the anticipated operational efficiencies were not expected to
bring much additional earnings growth.
Specific changes include: shifts in manufacturing capacity between Canada
and US; a reduction in operations in the UK, Italy, and in the Ore-Ida
division; a cut of about 30 per cent, or 240 jobs, at a plant south of
Melbourne, Australia; the consolidation of North American sales service
functions in one Pittsburgh-based operation; and a merging of the US
administrative back-up for Heinz Pet Products and Starkist, the tuna
business.
The charge meant that operating profits in the final three months of Heinz's
financial year to April 28, fell to Dollars 54.8m, compared with Dollars
230.5m a year ago, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn (up from Dollars 1.87bn). For
the full year, operating profits were down from Dollars 1.11bn to Dollars
860.9m, with sales rising from Dollars 6.58bn to Dollars 7.1bn.
The cost-cutting will be spread across Heinz operations worldwide and,
although the company declined to put a firm figure on the potential jobs
losses, could prune the workforce by up to 3,000. At the end of its 1992
financial year, Heinz had 35,500 employees.
The fourth-quarter operating profit of Dollars 54.8m translated into an
after-tax surplus of Dollars 69.7m, compared with Dollars 145.7m a year ago.
For the 12 months, Heinz' net profits stood at Dollars 396.3m, after a
Dollars 133.6m charge for the adoption of the new accounting standard on
post-retirement benefits. In 1991-2, the figure was Dollars 638.3m.

FT  16 JUN 93 / MEPC announces Pounds 221.9m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday announced a Pounds
221.9m rights issue, bringing the total raised by property companies in the
equity market this year to more than Pounds 1bn.
The announcement, two weeks after MEPC's interim results, is likely to
complete the recent round of fund raising by the UK's largest property
companies.
MEPC is taking advantage of a sharp increase in its share price, which will
allow it to issue new shares without greatly diluting its assets. The shares
have risen from 190p last September to close yesterday at 414p, down 8p on
the day.
The proceeds of the one-for-five rights issue, which is priced at 350p per
share, will be partly used to refurbish and redevelop property within its
portfolio. MEPC said the issue would also allow it to make selective
property or corporate acquisitions as opportunities arose.
The money will initially be put on deposit, which will reduce MEPC's gearing
from about 80 per cent to 60 per cent.
The rights issue was criticised by some City analysts yesterday for reducing
the company's gearing at a time when property values were starting to
improve. But Mr James Tuckey, managing director, denied that the rights
issue was a degearing exercise.
He said that the group's programme of disposals, which was partly designed
to reduce borrowings, would proceed at a slower pace. MEPC has sold Pounds
159m of property since the end of the last financial year.
Mr Tuckey said the decision to make the rights issues was taken after the
Board became convinced market prospects were improving.
The company said there was 'evidence beginning to emerge in certain areas of
the UK of new demand from occupiers. This, coupled with evidence of
institutions returning to invest in property, provides the potential for a
return to growth.'
The Co-operative Insurance Society, which owns 16.7 per cent of the company,
is taking up its full entitlement, as are MEPC's directors. The balance has
been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell.
The company predicted the dividend would be maintained at 14.75p (net) for
the year to end-September.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Rothschild Bank provisions rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHSCHILD Bank, the troubled Zurich affiliate of NM Rothschild of London,
has made provisions of SFr270.9m (Pounds 122m) against bad loans in the past
two years, substantially more than previously estimated.
Mr Guy Wais, general manager, said yesterday that an investigation by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, following the discovery of lending
irregularities early last year led to the increase in provisions from the
previously stated figure of about SFr220m.
Most of the lending was to the collapsed York Hannover and Castor property
groups, and it infringed Swiss law restricting the amount a bank can lend to
a single client.
The bank has maintained that the lending was arranged by its former credit
manager, Mr Jurg Heer, and that he concealed the details from other bank
directors. It has accused Mr Heer, who has admitted receiving commissions of
some SFr30m on the lending, of fraud and other offences. Mr Heer has since
fled Switzerland and an international warrant has been issued for his
arrest.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission and the Swiss Bankers Association are
investigating the apparent failures of the bank's internal and external
control systems. But Mr Wais said yesterday that financially 'Heer's file'
was now closed.
The bank's 1992-93 annual report reveals changes in its financial structure.
Total assets halved from SFr1.34bn at March 31, 1992 to SFr622.4m a year
later. Mr Wais said this reflected a deliberate running down of its lending
book in addition to the write-offs.
Shareholder's equity has risen from SFr198.7m to SFr206.1m, reflecting an
injection by a Rothschild family company of SFr120.5m in new capital. This
was achieved by its purchase of a part of the bad loans at face value.
The injection also made it possible for the bank to show a net income last
year of SFr12.8m compared with SFr24.5m the previous year. The annual
dividend was cut from SFr10m to SFr5.5m.
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman, said operating profits, which were down
only SFr2.5m to SFr57.1m, were 'good' and the balance sheet was 'extremely
sound'. The board was confident 'all necessary and prudent safeguards' were
in place.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Venables to fight on to buy Sugar's Spurs stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Terry Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's sacked chief executive, yesterday
vowed to continue his attempt to buy Mr Alan Sugar's 48 per cent stake in
the north London soccer club.
Replying from the club's headquarters, a confident Mr Sugar declared the
legal 'game was over'. He said: 'The message to fans and players was
'business as normal and please be a bit patient'.
Mr Venables' battle cry came a day after a High Court judge declined to
extend an injunction preventing the Tottenham board, chaired by Mr Sugar,
sacking Mr Venables.
Mr Sugar said getting the right management at the publicly quoted company
was essential but that there was no hurry to appoint a team manager. Mr Ray
Clemence and Mr Doug Livermore, the coaches, were continuing to manage the
club on a day-to-day basis.
Earlier Mr Sugar returned to court and admitted to a technical contempt of
court. Vice-chancellor Sir Donald Nicholls accepted Mr Sugar's apology,
given the 'disgraceful' behaviour of some Spurs supporters outside the
court.
The Tottenham chairman also said he would be returning to court to seek
assurances that any further legal costs would be paid by Mr Venables and not
Spurs.
Mr Venables said he would be seeking to acquire Mr Sugar's stake in
Tottenham Hotspur in a court action due to be heard in October.
He is seeking this under section 459 of the Companies Act, which is rarely
applied to publicly quoted companies.
Spurs supporters yesterday continued to call on fans not to renew season
tickets and to boycott the club. Mr Sugar said ensuring season tickets were
renewed had been a tough job even before Mr Venables was sacked and launched
his High Court action and it would continue to be tough.
Despite predictions of mass defections by players only two formal requests
had been received and these had been turned down.
Mr Sugar joined Mr Venables in 1991 to save heavily indebted Tottenham
Hotspur from the unwelcome attention of the late Robert Maxwell.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Male claims of discrimination in job market increase sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEX discrimination complaints at work soared by nearly two-thirds last year.
For the first time, men formed a large proportion of those claiming
companies were biased in their hiring policies.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, which published its 1992 annual report
yesterday said there had been a 64 per cent increase over the previous year
in complaints about workplace discrimination. The most common allegations
concerned recruitment, terms and conditions, and sexual harassment.
Of the 1,253 complaints to the commission about companies' hiring policies,
40 per cent had been from men, said the EOC. Ms Valerie Amos, chief
executive, said the recession had made men 'much more aware of their
rights'. Those men complaining about being turned down for jobs were
typically aged 55 to 60 and redundancy victims.
High male unemployment and greater opportunities in service-sector
industries had driven men to seek jobs in traditionally female areas of
work, said the EOC.
Analysis of information gathered from about 400,000 employers by the
Department of Employment, published last month, indicated that in 11 UK
areas, women were now more likely to go to work than men, although nearly
half of jobs done by women were part-time. Separate government figures show
there are almost as many women in the workforce as men.
The commission warned companies not to discriminate against men applying for
traditionally 'women's' jobs after a 50-year-old man was turned down for a
post in a children's nursery last year. He later won Pounds 600 at an
industrial tribunal.
Overall, the commission reported a 47 per cent increase, to 13,320, in the
number of inquiries over the past year. The 'discriminatory practices of
many employers who are shedding labour during the recession undoubtedly
added to the EOC's load,' says the annual report.

FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wessex has a habit of increasing its dividend faster than its rivals. While
its unregulated waste business is producing decent profits - in contrast to
others in the sector - such generosity will not worry the regulator. If
landfill prices continue to harden, the joint venture with Waste Management
International may yet deliver an operating margin of 20 per cent on turnover
of Pounds 100m this year. Since Wessex is one of the minnows of the sector,
that alone would be useful protection against the threat of tougher
regulation to come.
It is less clear that Wessex's water business is especially well placed
going into next year's regulatory review. Holding operating costs steady for
the second year, with the promise of the same this year, looks impressive.
But all water companies face a trade-off between operating costs and capital
spending. Without more information, the extent of genuine efficiencies is
difficult to judge. Ofwat will doubtless want to sort the wheat from the
chaff before setting price limits for the second half of the decade.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg's attempts to tighten its grip on BT3 are a quantum change from
past practice on the handling of new issues. If stock exchange members agree
to Warburg's request to move to cash settlement, it will become much harder
to short BT shares. Indeed, it would be interesting to know whether money
brokers have also been asked not to lend stock to those shorting the BT
issue. The rapid flow of information about changes to the BT share register
will also help deter selling. Given that there are so few privatisation
mandates left to win, Warburg's pressure may be unwise. And while shorter
settlement is in principle a good thing, why should the Stock Exchange
single out BT for special treatment?

FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Manweb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb has done much that a good utility management should. It cut costs in
the first two years after privatisation and looked overseas for examples of
best practice. Its investment in a flexible database of customers will allow
selling of other services. It has avoided allowing the Trojan horse of other
electricity companies' retailing operations into its patch via joint
ventures. It also stuck to its knitting and will only expand gradually
through natural extentions to its business. Indeed, it is no small irony
that those utility managements best able to cope with the difficulties of
diversification are those that have had the sense to avoid it.
Yet the company cannot hide its embarrassment of riches. Cash flow is
strong, gearing is down to 6 per cent, dividend cover is 3.3 times and
Manweb is not even using the full elbow room allowed by its price cap.
Admittedly the company was blessed with a generous price cap on the mistaken
assumption that the recession would hit the north hardest. But the regional
electricity companies are over-capitalised, and progressive dividend
policies will hardly make a dent in balance sheets. There may be brownie
points for companies prepared to risk the wrath of the regulator and return
the excess equity to shareholders. Otherwise customers, the government, or
owners of acquired firms will walk off with the money.

FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: MEPC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another week, another rights issue from a property company. MEPC is the last
of the big seven to take advantage of the sector's recent surge to raise
fresh funds. Its Pounds 222m cash call brings the total raised in the sector
to more than Pounds 1bn this year. But although MEPC has asked for the most
money, it arguably has the weakest story to tell and may also suffer from
being last in the queue. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that it is
raising too much, too late.
About half the cash will be used to spruce up MEPC's existing portfolio,
which was beginning to fray at the edges. The rest has been loosely
earmarked for property or corporate acquisitions. That is faintly unnerving,
given the company's proclivity for rearing white elephants in the 1980s.
Shareholders must hope it has learned from the recession.
The broader worry is that MEPC's attractions may pall as investors become
more discriminating after the first flush of property spring. The company
does not boast the cast-iron balance sheet of a Land Securities, or the
entrepreneurial spirit of a British Land, or even the international spread
of a Hammerson. MEPC may have crudely calculated that its greatest appeal
lies in its fat dividend yield. But securing the resources to pay a dividend
is the worst reason of all for launching a rights issue.

FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's full agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City knew before last night that Mr Kenneth Clarke is a man of
considerable political skill. That skill was again in evidence in his
Mansion House speech, with its rallying call to business and its emphasis on
growth as well as fiscal and monetary rectitude. What remains unclear is
whether Mr Clarke also has the special qualities required of a chancellor.
The speech was short on detail and left policy options open. It left his
audience guessing about the true importance attached to the exchange rate as
an indicator. Mr Clarke was tantalisingly vague about the extent to which
further fiscal tightening will be necessary.
To be fair, he was unlikely to box himself so soon. The new chancellor may
also want to avoid undermining confidence in the recovery by parading his
hair shirt, if he was wearing one underneath the white tie and tails. But at
some stage he will have to face the fact that, without a further attack on
the PSBR in this autumn's Budget, the twin objective of growth with low
inflation could well be lost.
For the time being, the City will have to take it on trust that action will
be taken. Thus far, the government's funding programme has proceeded
relatively smoothly, but only because real yields are high and gilts are
trading at an attractive 130 basis point premium to German bunds. At least
Mr Clarke showed he is aware of the cost of borrowing at 8 per cent when
inflation is well below two. If the government really means to keep price
rises that low, it is getting a very bad deal indeed.

FT  16 JUN 93 / S Africa talks in chaos as Inkatha walks out: Full
withdrawal would risk legitimacy of constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiations were thrown into crisis last
night after the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and its allies walked out
of the talks.
The rightwing Conservative party and the governments of several conservative
black homelands also walked out, leaving only the South African government
and the African National Congress plus their allies participating in the
talks. Delegates said they would consult their principals over whether to
withdraw permanently from the 26-party constitutional negotiating body. They
would return to talks tomorrow to convey their decision.
ANC and government officials made clear that talks would proceed without the
dissident group, which calls itself the Concerned South Africans Group, but
the legitimacy of a constitution written only by the ANC and government
would be seriously jeopardised.
The move appeared to be an attempt by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the
Inkatha leader, to test his strength within the negotiations, as well as to
determine whether government would back him or the ANC in a dispute. The
government made clear it would risk isolating Chief Buthelezi and his allies
rather than impede progress in negotiations.
Inkatha, which has significant support in Natal province, where one quarter
of the population lives, could badly disrupt any elections held under a new
constitution.
ANC and government officials blamed Inkatha for deliberately stalling
progress in the talks, and seeking to prevent confirmation of April 27 1994
as the date for the first multiracial elections. They said efforts would be
made to persuade Inkatha to return to the talks but this would depend on the
reaction of the irascible and unpredictable Chief Buthelezi.
Yesterday's dispute centred on the form of a future South African state,
whether federal or unitary, as well as whether its constitution should be
written by an elected constituent assembly.
Inkatha was enraged when yesterday's talks rejected its resolution calling
on the negotiating body to consider making South Africa a federal state.
Inkatha delegates said this could provoke Chief Buthelezi to make their
withdrawal permanent.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Banking on Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORD MAYOR'S guests were treated to two very different, but equally
important, speeches at last night's Bankers' and Merchants' dinner at the
City's Guildhall. Top of the bill was Mr Kenneth Clarke, promising much but
revealing little on his first public outing as chancellor of the exchequer.
But it was the valedictory address of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, reflecting
on the lessons of his 10 years as governor of the Bank of England, which
will have unsettled the stomachs of the City dignitaries.
Mr Clarke's performance, the first 'Mansion House' speech to be accompanied
by June strawberries rather than October apple pie, was that of the
consummate politician rather than the economist or financier. He pleased his
immediate audience by stressing the importance his government attaches to
maintaining low inflation and returning the public finances to order. But Mr
Clarke also played to the wider gallery, emphasising his Midlands roots, his
knowledge of industry and commerce while placing a new emphasis upon
economic growth and higher living standards.
No changes
But Mr Clarke mixes political cunning with his populism. His speech
contained no hostages to fortune. Indeed, it contained almost nothing of
substance to exercise the minds and computers of listening City analysts.
On monetary policy, the chancellor announced no changes to the framework his
predecessor announced last autumn. He confirmed the government's target
range for underlying inflation of 1-4 per cent and intends to monitor a
broad range of indicators. But how does businesses' desire for a competitive
and stable exchange rate fit into this picture? No target on display.
On fiscal policy, the chancellor aims to 'restore the public finances to
better health and back towards balance over the medium term'. Growth alone,
he said, would not do the trick. But does this require more discretionary
fiscal tightening on top of those measures announced in the Budget? And will
this mean further tax increases or spending cuts? No clues on offer.
As for the mix of monetary and fiscal policy that the chancellor thinks can
deliver sustainable growth without running into trade difficulties, the
subject was not addressed. Is the exchange rate sufficiently competitive ?
If wage inflation starts to pick up, will the chancellor use interest rates
to force the exchange rate higher or tighten fiscal policy to choke off
demand? How can the British economy, dogged by the twin Budget and trade
deficits, possibly deliver sustainable growth and higher real wages for
those in work? No discussion provided.
Inflation trap
Yet it was Mr Leigh-Pemberton who sent chills down his audience's collective
spine. 'We now have low inflation combined with economic recovery, and this
offers the prospect of sustained improvement for the first time in many
years,' he said, quoting from his own first Mansion House speech delivered
in October 1983. 'The sad fact that I could use exactly the same words today
reflects the principal failure of policy in the intervening period - that we
did not keep inflation under control.'
The Bank, the governor said, has learnt from this failure. 'The new policy
framework which was put in place after our departure from the ERM is one
which will not only, I believe, prove successful and workable in the UK ,
but is also being applied in other countries.' But with one exception: the
Bank of England, in contrast with its European partners, remains the servant
of the executive rather than of parliament. Nor is the Bank's status likely
to change, despite Mr Leigh-Pemberton's advice. The chancellor has made it
plain that independence for the bank is not on his own agenda, although his
speech suggested he is content to let others go on debating the matter.
Yet successive British governments, making promises just like Mr Clarke's,
have repeatedly been willing to win elections by delivering higher living
standards to those in work today at the expense of higher inflation in the
future. This is the prime cause of Britain's repeated boom-bust cycles. Mr
Clarke's most important task is to show that he knows how to avoid this
trap.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Let the eastern exports roll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TIME of recession and high unemployment is an unpropitious one to seek to
persuade EC governments to liberalise trade with their neighbours to the
east of the Community. If, however, the EC's proclamations about helping
central and eastern Europe are to be anything more than lip service, a rapid
relaxation of trade restrictions is essential.
To countries now released from communism's grip, the Community needs to
extend the stability and prosperity that it has so successfully nurtured in
the west of the continent. Fulfilling this task is in the EC's eminent
self-interest. Yet unless the Community provides adequate access for exports
from the east, the region's passage into the world of capitalism will be
unnecessarily arduous.
At the least, setbacks in eastern Europe would deprive EC companies of
growth in markets which otherwise can be expected to show lucrative
expansion during the next decade. At the worst, should the transition in
eastern Europe seriously falter, this could extend far more widely the
disruption and chaos already seen in the former territories of the Soviet
Union and Yugoslavia.
EC Commission proposals on trade with eastern Europe will be near the top of
the agenda at next week's Copenhagen summit. Foreign ministers have already
agreed the main points of a plan to accelerate dismantling of barriers for
imports of industrial goods, although France and Portugal have succeeded in
diluting some parts of the deal.
Starting point
If they are wise, EC leaders will take the proposals simply as a starting
point. The Commission's package retains strong elements of protectionism for
goods like steel, textiles and food - precisely the sectors where eastern
Europe is most competitive. The common agricultural policy is a substantial
hindrance to free trade in farm products. But the EC must pledge to
eliminate the remaining hurdles at the earliest possible date. This would
match eastern European countries' separate commitment to reshape their
economic structures as part of preparations for eventual EC membership.
As the region takes painful adjustment measures, it needs to be offered a
just reward. The EC's provisions for anti-dumping measures against steel
imports, for instance, will be unnecessary as the region, as planned,
improves transparency of pricing by bringing in EC-style competition law.
Increased sales from eastern Europe in sectors suffering from over-capacity
like steel, textiles and fertilisers can accentuate strains on EC
enterprises and their workforces. It can also damage EC companies' positions
on third markets. But making eastern Europe the scapegoat for general
structural and cyclical problems in individual industries is hardly
justified.
Tiny proportion
Imports from the east make up a tiny proportion of the EC's trade. Last
year, the EC's combined total of purchases from Bulgaria, the Czech and
Slovak republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania made up only 1.6 per cent per
cent of EC countries' overall import bill. The EC imported more from both
Austria (1.9 per cent) and Sweden (2.1 per cent).
Since 1988, eastern Europe's gross domestic product has fallen by roughly 20
per cent. Even with the effects of the recession, the EC's GDP this year, by
contrast, will be around 8 per cent higher than five years ago. Since the
fall of the Berlin Wall, eastern countries have expanded exports to the west
to compensate for a collapse in sales to the former Comecon area. Yet in
recent years the EC's exports to these countries have risen much faster than
its imports. As a result, the EC, which up to 1990 registered a trade
deficit with the area, is running a substantial surplus.
Eastern Europe will suffer for many years the legacy of communist
mismanagement. It would be folly to super-impose on this the effect of
short-sightedness by a Community which can afford to be more generous.
Eastern Europe's efforts at recovery will be largely self-generated. But
without a strong helping hand, these countries could slip backwards. Letting
them export their produce without restraint to the more prosperous western
part of the continent is the most effective way of guarding against this
possibility.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Turn on to the bigger picture: Andrew Hill and Andrew Adonis
examine moves towards the next generation of television hardware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tune in to the latest international debate about what sort of television the
world will be watching in the 21st century and you might guess that a repeat
is being broadcast.
European Community ministers will today discuss an 'action plan' to promote
wide-screen television services in Europe. It is the sixth time ministers
have debated such a plan since the Commission put forward the idea in April
1992.
The crucial issues in the debate remain unchanged. What steps should the EC
take to encourage the next generation of television hardware? And how much
should it spend on promoting advanced television for Europe?
The international television industry now has to choose from a menu of
options including wide-screen television, digital transmission technology
and high-definition, cinema-quality pictures. The choice is a complex one
because the options are not mutually exclusive.
In Europe, the priority in the action plan is to promote a shift towards
broadcasting normal definition TV on wider screens. The proposed EC plan
would not tie the industry to any particular transmission technology.
Britain is blocking agreement on the plan because it believes the proposed
funding - down from the original Ecu850m to Ecu228m - is still too lavish.
Meanwhile, in Japan, HDTV has arrived, using existing analogue technology.
But the price of HDTV receiver sets has only just come down through the
symbolic Y1m (Pounds 6,250) mark, and programming is both scarce and bland.
Greater strides have been made in the US, where three rival consortia agreed
three weeks ago to club together and work on a single technical standard for
digital HDTV. But there are substantial technical difficulties to be
overcome before a working system is in place, and US television stations
fear they will not be able to afford the equipment necessary to satisfy the
manufacturers' desire for a high-quality system.
If mass-market, cinema-quality television still seems a long way off,
manufacturers, broadcasters and governments appear to have learnt from both
the mistakes and breakthroughs of the past decade and are working in far
greater harmony than the surface turbulence would suggest. Moreover, after
seven years spent focusing on the potential of higher-definition technology,
they have begun to turn their attention to what consumers actually want from
television services - better quality, greater choice, or a combination of
the two - and how much they are prepared to pay for them.
The trigger for the new debate is the arrival of digital technology, and its
extension to television transmission. Digital compression techniques enhance
quality and allow far more services to be provided on the same channel.
Digital could, for example, permit broadcasters to stagger the start-times
of the same film on a movie channel, giving viewers the choice of when to
start watching.
Digital HDTV has the further advantage that it can be broadcast
terrestrially, as well as by cable and satellite, like existing TV.
Moreover, the opportunities provided by digital appear to have united old
rivals and put paid to Europe's efforts to gain a competitive advantage by
setting exclusive HDTV standards - an outcome the European Commission has
now accepted.
In the US, for example, the Federal Communications Commission, which has to
approve an HDTV standard, was originally considering proposals from US,
Japanese and European companies. The Japanese analogue proposal was
eventually eliminated in February when it became clear that the FCC wanted a
digital standard. The 'grand alliance' formed last month includes both
Philips and Thomson Consumer Electronics, the Dutch and French electronics
groups which were supposed to be among the principal beneficiaries of the
EC's original HDTV strategy.
Meanwhile, the European Commission, EC governments and industry have given
new impetus to the co-ordination of digital research and standardisation. A
group set up by Germany's posts and telecommunications ministry is aiming to
promote the acceptance of a draft digital standard for ordinary, non-HDTV
broadcasts by the end of 1993 and for digital satellite and cable
transmissions in Europe as early as 1995.
The highly damaging failures of the EC's HDTV legislation in the 1980s are
still fresh in the minds of the German organisers. The EC's first efforts to
develop an analogue HDTV system were undermined when commercial broadcasters
and satellite operators avoided the EC's compulsory transmission standards
by transmitting from satellites not affected by the EC legislation. As a
result, equipment manufacturers, which had invested heavily in the EC-backed
technology, found there were no services for the sets they had developed.
This time, the digital group is trying to encourage co-operation between
satellite operators, commercial and public broadcasters, manufacturers and
national administrations from the outset. In a recent press release the
group stressed that it wanted to 'address the needs of European viewers and
to proceed with a fully market-led approach'.
'We have to investigate the needs of the user, and learn from the
experiences of Mac (the earlier EC HDTV standard),' says Mr Wolfgang Becker
of the German telecoms ministry. 'What do the users want, and what are the
broadcasters and (manufacturing) industry going to do about it?'
Among EC companies, there is cautious optimism about the work of the digital
group. Mr Yves Feltes of Societe Europeen des Satellites (SES), one of the
pioneers of the standard-quality satellite broadcasts, says SES will be in
the vanguard of digital transmission, although it is too early to say
whether the co-ordinated approach will work. 'At least this time, the major
players are talking to each other,' he points out.
Consequently, work on digital technology should also dovetail with the EC's
action plan - if it is ever adopted. It would fall to the European
Commission to marry the two elements, when it comes up with a formal digital
television strategy in the autumn. The aim of EC funding is to stimulate new
wide-screen services, thus boosting a consumer electronics market which the
Commission believes will eventually be interested in everything that digital
HDTV has to offer.
As far as the US challenge is concerned, the involvement of Philips and
Thomson in the grand alliance, the efforts of the European digital working
group and the development of wide-screen television sets in the EC indicate
that efforts on both sides of the Atlantic should complement rather than
conflict with one another. Philips, for one, says its experience with the US
grand alliance will be of use in developing a European digital strategy
through the working group.
A digital HDTV standard developed by the US grand alliance is unlikely to
become the global standard because of technical differences between
European, US and Japanese broadcasting infrastructure. But, according to the
European Commission and to the EC companies involved in the US effort, there
are important elements that will be common to both.
The question is whether consumers in the US, Europe and Japan will want to
invest in wide-screen and digital broadcasting - with its promise of greater
choice and such innovations as 'interactive' video. And, if they do buy the
decoders necessary to receive the new channels, will they then be
interested, as the European Commission believes they will, in upgrading to a
higher-definition, cinema-quality picture sometime in the next century?
According to a recent consumer survey in the UK, France and Germany by BIS
Strategic Decisions, an information technology consultancy, wide-screen TV
was preferred to conventional TV by a margin of 56 per cent to 40 per cent.
About two-thirds are in favour in France and the UK, with a 60:36 ratio
against in Germany.
Those favouring wide-screen gave as their main reason that it was better for
watching films. The size of the set and picture quality were the main
reasons against.
On price, although three-quarters of consumers favouring wide-screen format
were willing to pay more for the new sets than for conventional sets, barely
one in three - that is a fifth of all consumers - was prepared to pay more
than a third more.
However, says Mr David Mercer, an analyst at BIS: 'That still means there
are millions of people across Europe prepared to pay more for wide-screen,
even before en-hanced technology.'
He believes that, once wide-screen has been launched and marketed as 'home
cinema', prices will begin to fall and more people will want to buy it.
The retailers see it that way, too. If the EC package goes through, Dixons,
the UK retailer, hopes to have 'affordable' wide-screen sets in its shops by
the autumn of 1994. It expects a 25-inch wide-screen format - the
replacement for the 21-inch conventional screen most common in the UK today
 -to retail for about Pounds 1,000, coming down to the equivalent of today's
Pounds 650 within two or three years.
'The TV market is mature and needs new products,' says Mr Roger Salmons,
Dixons' group planning director. 'Wide-screen is the next major product on
the horizon. Once consumers have made the step up, and manufacturers have
brought the price of wide-screen down, the introduction of HDTV ought to be
commercially viable when it becomes available.'
Manufacturers are equally confident of their ability to cut the cost.
'Prices will be quite high for the first generation but, once we have an
agreed standard (for wide-screen transmission) and volumes rise, the only
cost over and above the current technology should be the size of the larger
screen,' says Mr Robert van Oostenbrugge, manager of Philips' broadcast
media division.
That leaves the broadcasters. Most of the EC's Ecu228m, plus an additional
amount which the industry or national governments may be obliged to provide
under any final agreement, is a sweetener to encourage them to produce
programmes in a format compatible with wide-screen.
The supposition that, without a hand-out, the broadcasters will not film and
broadcast in wide-screen format is debatable.
Mr Chris Daubney, chief engineer at Channel 4, the independent UK
broadcaster, claims that there is 'no obvious revenue to be gained from
going to wide-screen, but there are certain capital costs - studio equipment
and so on - for which we would like compensation'.
On the other hand, Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs at London
Weekend Television, says bluntly: 'We will need to go wide-screen anyway if
the market is going that way. But if the Commission is putting up the money,
of course we will apply.'
In fact, the costs involved do not appear to be enormous: observers put the
total charge to the UK broadcasting industry at less than Pounds 100m.
There is also no question of broadcasters shifting all their production to
wide-screen in one go. The impact on existing small-screen users, who will
very likely have to make do with unattractive 'letter-box' reception of
programmes shot for wide-screen, will initially keep it restricted, probably
to films, sport and drama.
The path ahead is still far from straightforward. Even if agreement is
reached today on a funding package, the debate continues between proponents
of two alternative means of proceeding to wide-screen at 'standard'
definition.
Some of those involved want to proceed as soon as possible with the
so-called 'PAL-plus' system, which enhances the existing signal sufficiently
to take wide-screen; others want to wait until digital is available. The
industry could end up moving from one to the other.
Finally, of course, comes the consumers' actual readiness to buy the new
sets. Expect some cultural differences. According to the BIS survey, by far
the largest objection to wide-screen in the UK was from respondents fearing
that the screen was too large; by contrast, the French and Germans, given
the same options, were mainly afraid that their living rooms were too small.
Compelling subject for a documentary, perhaps.

It might be out of bounds and a soft target. But Kamlesh Bahl, who took over
as boss of the Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday, has already fired
off a stiff letter to one of the dustier corners of the British
establishment which still discriminates quite openly against women.
Ms Bahl says she was humiliated last week, when meeting a friend at the
Oxford and Cambridge Club in London's Pall Mall, to discover that, as a
woman, she had to wait downstairs for her male escort and, later, could only
drink her coffee in a certain corner of the building. Sadly, says Ms Bahl,
the EOC is powerless to do anything about private clubs, such as the Oxford
and Cambridge, which still bar women from full membership.

As the smoke starts to disperse over the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club
battle ground, the casualty list does not appear to be quite as long as
expected.
General Portfolio, the Harlow-based insurance company, for example, reports
that it has not been damaged by events. It will continue to flog insurance
policies to Spurs supporters for another 14 months at least, even though the
deal was set up by ousted chief executive Terry Venables.
Venables did the deal with GP because he liked the look of its national
sales director, Bob Patmore, a former star of the Tottenham youth team. But
GP spokeswoman Valerie McKirdy stresses that it had not been a personal deal
but a three-year agreement signed with one of the Tottenham Hotspur
companies. 'We are certainly not aware of anything to suggest that the
agreement is not continuing,' she says.
To be fair, GP is quite practised in dealing with the sensibilities of new
owners. A wholly-owned subsidiary of a French company, it continues to use a
logo of the Duke of Wellington.

The Winchester MP, who says 'Christopher was and is a personal friend',

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It appears that Britain may have gained a slight diplomatic advantage over
the French with the victory of Chief Moshood Abiola in Nigeria's
presidential elections.
Abiola, who made his fortune selling telecommunication systems to the
Nigerian government in the 1970s, has close ties with Britain. He owns the
London-based African Economic Digest and is a frequent visitor to the city.
However, Observer hears that France's corps diplomatique may need to mend a
few fences.
The problem dates back to Abiola's application for a visa to visit France
three years ago. After some delay, the chief's personal assistant went to
the French embassy in Lagos to complain. Embassy staff, who had not heard of
the great man, demanded Abiola provide a return ticket before issuing the
visa. 'Chief Abiola does not need a ticket,' the assistant explained.
'He has his own plane.'

<TEXT>
With only a fortnight to go before the newly-ennobled Robin Leigh-Pemberton
hands in his keys as governor of the Bank of England, it is far from clear
what he is going to do next. He has had a good innings at the Bank and as a
fit 66-year-old he has a few years service left in him.
If he should run short of job offers he could always seek advice from his
old chum and long-time Bank director, Sir Adrian Cadbury, whose ProNed body
specialises in finding non-executive directors for tough jobs. But it is
unlikely to come to that. Before he became a central banker, Leigh-Pemberton
had been chairman of a clearing bank (NatWest) and an industrial company
(Birmid Qualcast).
The Fed's Paul Volcker and the Bundesbank's Karl Otto Pohl, have had no
difficulty collecting an impressive portfolio of directorships when they
stepped down. Neither should Leigh-Pemberton.
However, there is one particularly delicate matter which needs to be
resolved. Leigh-Pemberton is one of two Brits on the board of the Bank for
International Settlements, the central bankers' talking shop. The other is
his predecessor, Lord Richardson, who has just been re-elected for a further
three-year term. Eddie George gets a seat automatically. But will Lord
Richardson do the decent thing and give up his place. After all Lord O'Brien
did the same for Richardson when he quit the Bank in 1983.

FT  16 JUN 93 / A verdict but no conviction: A review of the English
criminal justice system is unlikely to fulfil expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In three weeks, the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice will deliver its
verdict on the health of the English criminal justice system.
Set up two years ago after a series of miscarriages of justice, the
commission, chaired by Lord Runciman, was charged by the government with
carrying out the most far-reaching review for more than 100 years.
The legal establishment hopes not only for a report that could help restore
public confidence, but for a blueprint for the next century. 'The judiciary
has the highest expectations,' according to Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief
Justice.
But doubts have surfaced about what the report will achieve. Many lawyers
believe that, by tackling everything from police investigations to the
problems of long fraud trials, the commission will not have had enough time
to examine the issues - some far from clear cut - in depth.
Lord Williams of Mostyn, QC, last year's bar chairman and Labour's legal
affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, says it is a 'watershed'. But he
has doubts about what it can accomplish: 'I hope to goodness they've had
enough time.'
The political impetus for change has been the need to restore confidence in
English justice. But the government's hands will be tied both by public
spending contraints and competing political priorities.
The best hope for concrete proposals is on the question of miscarriages of
justice. Studying the events arising out of the IRA's 1974 mainland bombing
campaign should have enabled the commission to identify several factors that
contributed to the wrongful convictions of the so-called Guildford Four,
Maguire Seven and Birmingham Six.
The commission is likely to recommend the creation of an independent
tribunal to take the investigation of suspect cases out of the hands of the
Home Office. It is also expected to recommend the establishment of an
independent forensic science service, to give the defence access to forensic
facilities enjoyed only by the prosecution at the moment.
Such firm recommendations are, however, likely to be the exception rather
than the rule. Much of the evidence received by the commission has been
conflicting.
Disputed confessions, for example, are central to most alleged miscarriages
of justice. A change in the law, to prevent a defendant from being convicted
on a confession unless it is made in the presence of an independent third
party or supported by other evidence, would seem an obvious recommendation.
Yet this has proved a controversial area. The commission found that, in nine
out of 10 cases in which confessions were central to a case, there was
corroborative evidence. In the remainder, the police could have produced it
if needed, but had chosen not to in order to save time and money. This, say
some, shows that a requirement to produce corroborative evidence in all
cases is an unnecessary expense; others say that, if corroborative evidence
is available in most cases, the police should be required to produce it.
While high-profile issues such as ways of preventing miscarriages of justice
are expected to lead to firm recommendations, the bulk of the report is
likely to concentrate on cutting costs and increasing efficiency. It will
also have to tackle the delicate question of the balance between the powers
and rights of prosecution and defence.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, believes the best way
to cut costs is to reduce the number of cases that go to the Crown Court for
jury trial. She has urged the commission to recommend the abolition of the
defendant's right to choose jury trial for offences that can be tried either
by magistrates or in the Crown Court.
Of the 120,000 cases committed by magistrates to the Crown Court each year,
about 35,000 end up there because the defendants have elected jury trial.
The average daily cost of a Crown Court trial in 1992-93 was Pounds 6,850.
The costs of a trial in a magistrate's court is estimated at less than half
that figure.
However, the DPP's proposal is unlikely to find favour with the commission,
mainly because the right to be tried by one's peers is strongly supported by
the judiciary. Lord Taylor calls it 'an inalienable right going back to
Magna Carta'.
Mrs Mills can expect more support for her call for a formal system of plea
bargaining, where an accused can secure a lighter sentence in return for a
guilty plea.
At the moment, guilty pleas do generally lead to reductions in sentences,
but the process is informal and arbitrary. The prosecuting authorities,
judges and the bar want an open system, under which defendants are
guaranteed a sentence discount for a guilty plea secured at the earliest
opportunity.
The DPP sees plea bargaining as the best means of tackling the waste caused
by 'cracked trials' - trials that are aborted (and move immediately to
sentencing) when the defendant changes his or her plea to guilty at the last
minute. In such cases, all parties will already have prepared for a full
trial.
Some 70 per cent of defendants committed by magistrates to stand trial on a
not-guilty plea change their plea to guilty at the Crown Court. About a
third of them enter a guilty plea on the day of the trial or just before,
causing a cracked trial.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, leads the government's support for
formalised plea bargaining. Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud
Office, sees it as the solution to problems of long and complex fraud
trials. 'By avoiding the contested trial, with all that it implies in terms
of expense and time and manpower, a plea of guilty is the single most
effective means of shortening the process,' he says.
But Lord Roskill, the former law lord who chaired the 1986 Fraud Trials
inquiry, is opposed to formalised plea bargaining: 'The real objection is
that it enables people to buy themselves off.'
He is also concerned that plea bargaining may induce the innocent to plead
guilty or feel there is pressure on them to do so. The result could be to
encourage miscarriages of justice. This concern is shared by Justice, the
law reform pressure group.
A further difficult question for the commission is how to correct the
perceived imbalance between prosecution and defence: protecting the rights
of the defendant while ensuring that the prosecuting authorities have the
armoury to bring the guilty to justice.
Many judges, including the Lord Chief Justice, believe the odds are weighted
too heavily in the defendant's favour. Few defence lawyers agree, although
the opinion of the judiciary may carry more weight with the commission.
Some inroads are likely into the defendant's right to silence: the right not
to say anything in his or her defence, either to the police or in court. The
central issues are whether the court should be able to draw inferences from
an accused's failure to explain alleged criminal conduct before trial, and
whether the so-called 'ambush defence' - where an accused remains silent
throughout an investigation but offers an explanation at trial, taking the
prosecution by surprise - should be outlawed.
The commission's research found that silence may have hampered the
conviction of the guilty in only 2 or 3 per cent of cases. Nevertheless, the
number of people who argue that the innocent have nothing to hide by giving
an explanation is growing. The commission will probably recommend that the
defence be required to disclose its case early in the pre-trial proceedings.
Controversy over this and other issues, coupled with the government's
apparent reluctance to see radical reform of the system now, mean the
commission will not produce the hoped-for blueprint.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the former home secretary, has indicated the government
intends to treat the report as a consultation exercise. If it accepts the
commission's ideas, further detailed study of the practical implications is
likely before any legislation. With the recent climbdown over a
means-related fines system (withdrawn in May after only seven months) fresh
in the memory, the government will not be rushed into action.
Two years ago radical change seemed imperative. Now any reform looks likely
to be at the margin.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Banker to the bankers: A powerful and secretive institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the second Tuesday of every month, 13 central bankers meet in the sleepy
Swiss town of Basle to review the monthly accounts of the Bank for
International Settlements, one of the world's most powerful and secretive
banks. The general manager, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, admits that the
gathering, in the bank's nuclear-attack-proof 1970s headquarters, is usually
a formality and rarely lasts more than 15 minutes.
The bankers say their main reason for the trip is for the other meetings
held there, during which they discuss weighty issues of monetary policy and
the health of the financial system. However, the 15-minute meetings are
crucial, since the revenues from the bank pay for all the other activities
and the sumptuous meals and rural excursions that make the sojourn more
pleasant.
The BIS, set up in 1930 to recycle German first world war reparations back
to Germany as government loans, is, in the words of Mr Lamfalussy, a mixture
of arcane traditions and banking strength. But it has come to play a pivotal
role in the world's financial affairs, through a combination of secrecy,
financial strength and technical expertise.
Tucked away at the back of its latest 230-page report on global monetary
conditions and international banking supervision are the balance sheet and
profit-and-loss account. They show that last year the BIS paid a record
SFr240 dividend from record profits of Dollars 271m, while its balance sheet
expanded at an unprecedentedly fast rate.
The location of the figures reflects the banking department's shy public
posture. The BIS is the central banks' bank - 84 per cent of its shares are
owned by 33 central banks, with the balance held by private shareholders.
The glare of the limelight would not be conducive to its business.
'The main banking activity of the BIS is to help the reserve management of
central banks,' Mr Lamfalussy says. This means that central banks place
substantial amounts of their foreign exchange reserves with the BIS,
normally on very short-term deposit.
'Between 85 and 90 central banks deal with the BIS,' he added. 'Our share in
world foreign exchange reserves is normally around 10 per cent.' At the end
of March, the BIS held Dollars 106bn of deposits from central banks - 60 per
cent in dollars - 28 per cent more than the previous year. In winning this
business, the BIS was competing with commercial banks and the direct
placement of central bank funds in money market instruments.
According to Mr Lamfalussy, the BIS's success stems from its liquidity and
its discretion. When there is uncertainty in foreign exchange markets,
central banks need to know they have instant access to their reserves, in
case they have to intervene in the markets. 'If a central bank rings up at
4pm and asks for Dollars 2bn, we can give it to them immediately,' Mr
Lamfalussy said. 'No other bank can do that.'
The BIS's financial skills and liquidity were put to the test during the
instability which rocked the European exchange rate mechanism last year.
Central banks sold an estimated DM188bn, mostly for dollars, between June
and December to try to reduce upward pressure on the D-Mark.
At the height of the crisis, between August and the end of October, central
bank deposits at the BIS increased by almost Dollars 27bn. If central banks
had placed these funds directly into the money markets, speculators would
have found it even easier to work out what the banks had been up to.
The BIS also lends to central banks in an emergency. Mr Lamfalussy hinted
that central banks whose D-Mark reserves were running low because of sales
of the German currency, may have borrowed some from the BIS during the ERM
debacle, before rebuilding reserves through a bond issue or currency swap.
He added that the BIS pays an interest rate on central banks' deposits below
commercial bank rates but above treasury bill rates (government-issued
securities). It then makes a small profit by placing these funds on deposit
with the most financially secure commercial banks or in government
securities.
Central banks accept a low rate of interest because of the BIS's balance
sheet strength, which guarantees the security of their deposits. But
assessing its net worth is complicated: it admits using unusual accounting
techniques and undervaluing and hiding some assets.
The BIS has built up gold and currency reserves worth Dollars 4.3bn,
expressed in the quaint convention of gold francs, a monetary unit invented
by the BIS and used exclusively by it. When translating currencies into gold
francs, the BIS uses a fixed gold price of Dollars 208 an ounce, well below
the current market price of about Dollars 365, which means that one gold
franc is equivalent to Dollars 1.94.
At the end of March, the BIS's published capital and reserves in gold and
currencies were GFr1.75bn (Dollars 4.3bn). But several more calculations are
required to arrive at a more accurate measure of the bank's financial
strength. As Mr Lamfalussy said, its assets are 'substantially more than
that'.
One disguised source of wealth is its 'miscellaneous account', an unusual
balance sheet classification. Unrealised gains and losses on its holdings of
currencies and securities are taken through the miscellaneous account, which
stood at the equivalent of Dollars 2.9bn at the end of last year. Many banks
would include all of that in their capital and reserves. In addition, the
BIS owns and occupies a 21-storey office block in Basle, and owns several
acres of prime property around it. This is all valued in its balance sheet
at GFr1.
Total net assets could be as high as Dollars 9bn. Even though central banks
and shareholders recognise that its strong balance sheet is the key to its
ability to do what they want, they cast a covetous eye on the gold, cash and
real estate. Some central bankers believe the BIS is over-capitalised and
should return part of its capital to its shareholders in the form of a
special dividend.
Such a suggestion is anathema to Mr Lamfalussy. The BIS, he said, must have
sufficient capital to borrow and lend billions in the time it takes for a
central bank governor to raise his eyebrow.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Amnesty report on women in Tunisia baseless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MOHAMED LESSER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your summary of the Amnesty International report on
women in Tunisia ('Amnesty says women tortured in Tunisia', June 3), I wish
to state the following.
The report is totally irresponsible and completely without foundation. It is
based almost entirely on the content of propaganda leaflets from illegal
extremist groups whose declared objective is to undermine the Tunisian
government. Therefore, we reject and deny its allegations, most of which
have been refuted in previous government re-sponses while others pertain to
women who have been subjected only to measures authorised by law. They have
never been maltreated, tortured or been the victims of any other form of
abuse.
Other testimonies contained in the report were given by women whose
identities were not revealed, but who belong to two extremist movements,
both of them banned. Amnesty has repeated and endorsed the allegations but,
under the pretence that it is fearful of reprisals, has not checked any of
them through the usual procedures. This pretence is intended to harm
Tunisia's reputation and undermine its judiciary. Also, no prior notice
about the report was given to the Tunisian government as is usually done by
Amnesty.
It is ironic that Tunisia, of all countries, should be singled out for
criticism in connection with women's rights when the country is widely
acknowledged to have achieved more progress in that area than any other
country in the developing world and is often called upon to chair human
rights committees in regional and international forums.
Tunisia has in the last few years signed and ratified the UN convention
against torture without reservations and has set up a higher committee for
human rights and fundamental liberties, and a commission of inquiry into
earlier allegations received from Amnesty. The president of the republic has
also nominated a counsellor for human rights while units were set up in
various ministries to deal with human rights. Furthermore, an ombudsman has
been appointed with a full team to support him in his job.
All these measures testify to the strong commitment of Tunisia towards human
rights.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr ROLAND DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gordon Mitchell (Letters, June 14), invites the Financial Times to
publish forecasts of share prices. But that is exactly what the FT does.
Need I remind him that in the absence of non-public information the best
forecast of tomorrow's price is today's price?
I hope Mr Mitchell is not wasting his money trying to guess which companies
will outperform the market. Nobody should be picking individual shares now
that the superiority of a diversified portfolio is well-established.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: Karadzic talks peace but killing goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BERND KARL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It must be the climax of western perversion that after the complete
failure of our politicians to stop the killing in Bosnia that the Financial
Times should give Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, a chance to
publish an article (Personal View, June 9).
How can one dare to give a war criminal such an opportunity, given the the
reality of the past 14 months of killing, torturing, raping and ethnic
cleansing, mostly by Serbs. Do you really believe this is the way to prove
our democratic system? The Serbs must be laughing.
A meeting in Luxembourg of foreign ministers of the EC is followed by a
meeting of the Nato foreign ministers making all the well-known
declarations. Meanwhile, the Serbs are closing in on Gorazde and are using
captured Moslems as human shields while advancing on the town - and Mr
Karadzic in his article is talking about peace. I am completely puzzled
about what you intended by publishing the article.
I must be very naive to have believed that the news media, and especially
newspapers, should have played a more forceful role in condemning the
inaction of our European politicians. The article you published is just
doing the opposite.
I still cannot understand how we have allowed these crimes to be committed
after the atrocities of the Germans during the second world war. We witness
them every night on TV and yet the world looks the other way. I am deeply
disappointed that you chose to publish the article. Who other than a
courageous press should point out the bigotry and hypocrisy displayed by the
'civilised' western world in the Bosnian conflict?
I have just heard on the radio that Serb forces are attacking three 'safe
havens' - Zepa, Gorazde and Srebrenica. And Mr Karadzic talks of peace.

   From Mr GUY DEHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article about the organisation Public Concern at Work, headed
'Solicitor launches group to protect whistle-blowers' (June 14), is
premature and somewhat inaccurate.
We have not been formed to protect 'whistle-blowers - employees who disclose
confidential information in what they judge to be the public interest'.
Rather our object is to develop alternatives where employee concerns about
public dangers are first raised and addressed within their organisation.
When we launch in the autumn, all will be clearer.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Letter: IoD presses case for independent bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having campaigned for more than a decade for an Independent Bank of
England, the Institute of Directors is encouraged that the advantages of
this ultimate privatisation are becoming accepted wisdom among a wider range
of influential figures - not least the former chancellor of the exchequer
and his predecessors - to whom we have made repeated representations.
The government is naturally wary of relinquishing its hold over one of the
levers of economic control, and claims that an independent central bank
could not have brought down inflation more quickly than the government. Yet
inflation would not have risen to such a high level and wrought so much
damage on the economy and business so frequently, had the Bank of England
been able to operate a rigorous anti-inflation policy.
The objectives of an independent bank should be set by parliament, to which
it should be accountable, openly and in detail, for the discharge of defined
and limited responsibilities.
The Bundesbank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand provide interesting
precedents. Within these parameters the Bank would be free to operate in the
best interests of the economy rather than for the benefit of political
parties influenced by party politics and the electoral cycle. Given the
uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate mechanism and European monetary
union, the best signal the government could give to our European partners
and financial markets of its commitment to low inflation and sound money is
to grant independence to the Bank of England.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: Everybody seems to be 'morphing' - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember Murray Mints, the too good to hurry mints? We're going well, we're
going Shell? Wondering where the yellow went when you cleaned your teeth
with Pepsodent?
How straightforward matters were in the days when television commercials
were simply supposed to sell things. Now bafflement is the order of the day
and smart references to famous movies or previous commercials are de
rigueur. You see a picture of a man with a bird cage on his head, and then a
woman with a model of a Richard Rogers building in her hair. A grand piano
falls in slow motion from a high bridge. The picture cuts rapidly from a
human skull with smoke emerging to a sinister bald black man wearing a
patent leather corset as he sits in front of a navy blue sky. Big ball
bearings whiz through the air.
What on earth is being advertised? A dungeons and dragons computer game? A
new pill to banish nightmares caused by Gorgonzola and gherkin sandwiches?
We hear what sounds like David Bowie singing as events become even more
obscure: three creatures, part animal, part human, wade through a river,
bending as though to look for something under the water. An old man is seen,
covered in gold paint. A car drives through water sending up a huge sheet of
spray. A head appears in a black leather sado-masochist's mask bristling
with metal spikes and with a zip across the mouth. Finally comes the sales
pitch, written round a rubber tyre: 'Tested for the unexpected, Dunlop'.
Had this been produced as a show reel by a student on a mass media studies
course we would have said it was technically competent but derivative in
rather too studied a manner: it echoes every overdone rock video from
'Relax' to 'Justify My Love' and on the way borrows from every mass media
fashion from James Bond to Derek Jarman. The mystery is why anybody imagines
it might sell car tyres.
The commercials for the current British Telecom share sale are not baffling
but they, too, are full of references to other trendy mass media material;
indeed they consist entirely of parodies of Inspector Morse, with Mel Smith
as John Thaw. It is fairly funny to have the Morse figure bustling into the
manor house and ignorantly blowing away the forensic man's fingerprint
powder, or using a megaphone from the top of an Oxford tower to tell his
people on the ground to 'Grab that one, the one in the gown, no not that one
in the gown . . .' and so on. But again the question arises, why anybody
thinks that this is the best way to sell the product. Why not tell us
something about the advantages of owning BT shares? The amount of
information conveyed in these commercials is startlingly small.
Do you understand the Toyota Celica commercial? Two pantomime Italian
policemen pull into a petrol station which, instead of an Italian sign
saying 'Gasolio', has a huge American sign saying 'Gas'. They peer
admiringly into an empty right hand drive Celica. An attractive girl walks
up and climbs into the left hand seat. The driverless car magically moves
off and the police follow. We see that the Toyota has a British number plate
and has somehow acquired a second person, in the driving seat. The police
pull out to overtake, the Toyota disappears, then reappears going in the
opposite direction, and a voice says 'The car in front is a Toyota'. But of
course by this time there is no car in front, only a car behind. What on
earth is it all supposed to mean and why does anyone imagine it might sell
us a Celica?
These are not isolated examples, dredged up from remote parts of the
schedules. On the contrary, they are some of the most frequently repeated
commercials presently appearing on ITV and Channel 4, and there are plenty
more like them, where mystification seems to be paramount. Since all cars
now have adjustable seats, glove compartments, handbrakes and windscreen
wipers, and many have cassette players, Volkswagen cannot be trying to use
these as unique selling points. So just what are they doing in the ad where
the woman pulls the seat forward, stuffs the sweets in the glove
compartment, takes off the handbrake, puts on the windscreen wipers and
rejects the cassette only to be followed by a man who pushes the seat back,
takes out the sweets and so on? Why do the man and woman in the Pirelli
commercial swap seats and why isn't he allowed to sit beside her? Why does
the second blues musician in the Heineken ad fall through the verandah
floor: does this beer no longer reach the parts that others cannot reach?
The more carefully you watch the commercials, the more powerful becomes the
feeling that many of them are now being made by people who are more
concerned with the furtherence of their own careers than with sales of the
products. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the fame of men such as
Ridley Scott whose progress from Hovis ads to Blade Runner has been told so
many times that most of us can recite it. However, there does appear to have
been a sea change. In Scott's day television commercials were at the
forefront of innovation: you could trace the introduction of new techniques
from commercials to Hollywood and then into the mainstream of television.
Today the innovations seem to be coming from rock videos and Hollywood,
moving into commercials and then spreading elsewhere.
'Morphing' is a good example. This trick, in which a computerised dissolve
is used to give the appearance of one thing literally turning into another -
metamorphosis - first appeared in rock videos just over a year ago (notably
Michael Jackson's last major offering), was used extensively in Terminator
2, and is now unavoidable in the commercial breaks. From Andersen Consulting
where a snail turns into a frog, via Castrol GTX where an Aston Martin turns
into a Vauxhall, then a Land Rover and so on, to the BBC's latest house
commercial in which John Humphrys, Lenny Henry and Kate Adie rapidly turn
into one another, everybody seems to be morphing. No doubt television
programmes will soon discover the technique and overwork it until it becomes
a cliche.
There are still enjoyable commercials with beer, as ever, providing a lot of
the laughs, many of them, once again, depending upon knowing references to
previous commercials. In Boddington's current campaign the lady goes through
the old Camay routine, dabbing her cheek with 'lather' (foam from the head
of the beer) and being told by her man 'By 'eck, you smell gorgeous tonight
petal'. Greene King has hired the chap who used to tell us that he liked his
Remington razor so much he bought the company and got him to say 'I had a
taste of Greene King IPA and liked it so much - I bought a pint'. Meanwhile,
in the background, two men shave themselves with electric razors. Panasonic
has a wonderful ad in which a very old lady extols VHS video cameras . . .
with help from her mother.
But this is about as close as you come today to a simple sales pitch. The
great bulk of any commercial break nowadays appears to be devoted to
auditions from directors who would like to be working for rock video
producers, or who are already doing so and would now like to move on to
Hollywood. It makes for some amazing technical trickery, and some
fascinating virtuoso passages of film making. Whether it increases sales of
sweets, petrol or toothpaste as effectively as the old jingles and pack
shots is a different matter entirely.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Ali' - more Islam than ring craft / Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ali, Geoffrey C. Ewing's one-man show which re-opens the Mermaid Theatre at
Blackfriars, is described as a tribute to the former heavyweight boxing
champion of the world. And there's the rub. Not only has this Ali a pretty
face; his soul could hardly be bettered, too. He is your very Islamic Saint.
The set says it all. Ali, long retired, is talking to his people - the poor
and the disadvantaged - in 'an underfunded recreation room in a
neighbourhood cultural centre in Detroit' in 1989.
He begins slow and hesitant. He is suffering from Parkinson's Syndrome,
although Ewing suggests that Ali uses his illness to protect himself from
pestering questions. Gradually as he responds to the audience his current
disability is shaken off, and he returns to his youth and his prime, to his
joy at winning an Olympic Gold Medal in Rome for the US and his
disillusionment with his treatment back home as a black.
The formula is predictable but workmanlike. The problem is that none of the
interesting bits of Ali's life are allowed to come between the man and his
legend. There is not a critical word in the piece. His relationships with
women might be considered to be, well, rather sexist, but here the wives are
blamed for not becoming enthusiastic Moslems. The arrogance, the political
naivity, the money making, above all the fascinating question of how much
his illness can be attributed to blows in the ring, are ignored, as are his
relationships with his nine children and his upbringing.
The consolation is that Ewing makes a sympathetic Ali. The physical
resemblance is close enough, especially when he strips down to 'float like a
butterfly, sting like a bee'. A ring dominates the set, and the piece takes
off when the fights are re-created, especially the 'rumble in the jungle'
with Foreman and the 'thrilla in Manila' with Frazier. But director Stephen
Henderson's only dramatic effect comes in the fight with Holmes when Ali's
nemesis as a boxer is conveyed through flashing lights and klaxons. Ewing
seems much more interested in Ali's commitment to Islam than in his
ring-craft.
Ali was undoubtedly terribly victimised by the government for his refusal to
follow Presley into the Army for religious reasons, and this becomes the
dramatic finale of the first half. But as the second half opens Ewing dodges
this issue. 'Why ain't I in gaol? Because I've got money.'
Ali was a great success off-Broadway and will appeal to the Ali fan club.
Boxing fans could be disappointed in the lack of real meat. Equally
disappointed will be those who wanted the inside track on one of the most
fascinating characters in 20th century entertainment.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Attila' and 'The Flute' - Opera in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As revived at the Royal Opera by David Edwards, Elijah Moshinsky's splendid
Verdi production retains all the power it had in 1990. Verdi composed Attila
some four years after Stiffelio (which Moshinsky staged triumphantly this
spring), and four years before Nabucco. It counts unambiguously as 'early
Verdi', which most often means bald melodrama and stand-and-deliver arias.
In that restricted style Verdi could already write potently expressive
music, and sometimes break through the period routines; but his libretti and
their schematic situations - which Verdi took quite seriously as his
inspiration - now inspire only patronising attitudes.
Moshinsky's great practical gift is for forcing us, too, to recognise that
those situations are serious at heart, at least as Verdi sets them; that the
apparent veering between banality and lofty extravagance is only a matter of
surface style, as in Handel's operas; that all those arias are human
responses to grave circumstances, not mere operatic showpieces.
No doubt, early Verdi with exotic trappings like Attila - decadent
5th-century Romans fending off hell-bent Attila and his Huns - has looked
ridiculous in revivals this century which tried to play him
'naturalistically'. Moshinsky's solution here is inseparable from Michael
Yeargan's sets: stage-high wooden palisades parting at unpredictable angles
to reveal ancient towns, mudflats and barrens, gloweringly lit by Robert
Bryan. The time and the places are evoked palpably, but with a minimum of
picturesque detail; and in those louring spaces, the performers can make
their old-fashioned gestural semaphore tell.
As the posturing becomes transparent, we see through it to tribal loyalties,
fraught personal trusts, voracious ambitions and old, inconsolable regrets
for a 'noble' world lost. (Verdi honoured all the Risorgimento ideals.) If
almost every aria begins with either a rumpty-tum village-band flourish or a
strummed harp - quite rightly, the conductor Edward Downes swings into those
things with unabashed fervour - in this cleverly stripped-down context its
vocal line soon says something sharper and more poignant. That needs a
superlative cast, and again the Royal Opera have got one.
From earlier runs we have Giorgio Zancanaro again as the disillusioned,
backward-looking Roman general Ezio, confounding the New Grove Opera
diagnosis of his role ('vague and undefined') by a searching account of
'Dagl'immortali vertici'; and as the romantically besotted Foresto, Dennis
O'Neill - our best mock-Italian tenor, by a very long way - can at last
marry his guilty hangdog look to passionate expression.
Above all, the new incumbents in the central roles serve Verdi's (and
Moshinsky's) intentions with severe honesty. Elizabeth Connell's Odabella,
reeling between Italian patriotism and Attila's macho appeal, wields all the
requisite vocal steel - unlovely, but hard-wrought and gripping - and yet
melts beautifully for her last, compromised plea to Foresto. Attila himself
is the American baritone Samuel Ramey, deploying all his best strengths:
coiled-spring intensity, dark eloquence and a sculpted Tartar face. Directed
by Terry Edwards, the Royal Opera chorus makes a decisive mark at each
opportunity. Such tautly contrived mixes are unstable; hear this one if you
can, while it lasts]
                            *      *      *
On the same night English National Opera reached its final presentation of
the season, a revival of The Magic Flute. Whenever the company is in search
of an audience, this is an opera to which it can turn. The present
production, dating from 1988, is sophisticated and morally unimpeachable: it
erases all suggestions of racism from the text by painting Monostatos white
and avoids sexism by introducing a woman into the Brotherhood. An easy sense
of humour, the opera's childlike innocence, come to it less easily.
This revival is not especially distinguished, in either orchestral or vocal
terms. Alan Opie's genial Papageno was worth his bottle of scrumpy, shared
no doubt with Sally Harrison's bubbly Papagena at the end. Otherwise, the
chief pleasure of the evening came from the radiant singing of Gillian
Webster, whose Pamina is in a class of her own, a beautifully pure soprano
and a musician who shapes every phrase in the most personal manner. In the
favourite duet with Papageno this translation has her singing of 'truth and
beauty' - just the qualities that she alone brought to the performance.
There are seven more peformances of Attila at Covent Garden between tonight
and July 3; The Magic Flute is at the London Coliseum until June 25

Remember that parody? 'Say what you will, school dinners make you ill, and
shepherd's pie got Davy Crockett down, our school din-dins come from pig
bins, out of town.' By all accounts today's school children are more likely
to be offered pizza and chips than shepherd's pie. BBC2's access slot Open
Space ends an interesting series with a programme lamenting the
deterioration of that great British institution, the school dinner (7.55).
That is followed at 8.25 by Freya Stark, the first of two repeated
documentaries celebrating the life and work of the extraordinary writer and
traveller who died last month. In 1982, when she was 90, Freya Stark was
visited in her family home in the hills north of Venice by John Julius
Norwich who talked to her of her bohemian childhood and her achievements as
an explorer. Dispatches (9.00 C4) claims that it will reveal the identity of
Deep Throat, the hitherto anonymous source whose information enabled
Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein to blow open the American
political scandal which came to be known as Watergate.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: Lunch with Mr Bloom - Alannah Hopkin celebrates
'Bloomsday' in the Dublin Castle Crypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulysses turns into a spectator sport in Dublin this time of year as the
celebrations of June 16 - 'Bloomsday' - on which the events of James Joyce's
novel took place - become ever more prolific. How refreshing, then, after
innumerable Molly Bloom soliloquies (. . . and yes I said yes I will Yes) to
have a dramatisation of Chapter Eight, chiefly remembered as the chapter in
which Leopold Bloom, after some prevarication, partakes of a Gorgonzola
sandwich and a glass of burgundy in Davy Byrne's bar.
This chapter does not immediately call out for dramatisation. Nothing much
happens. Bloom, hungry in spite of a now legendary breakfast, having
attended Dignam's funeral, walks by the Liffey towards the Grafton Street
area knowing that Molly has an assignation with her lover, Blazes Boylan,
and afraid of meeting the latter face-to-face. He is distracted by the gulls
and buys two Banbury cakes for a penny to feed them. He passes the time of
day with an acquaintance, Mrs Breen, is repulsed by the prospect of eating
in the Burton restaurant, and settles for Davy Byrne's where he exchanges a
few words with Nosey Flynn. After, on his way to the National Library, he
does indeed catch sight of the dreaded Blazes Boylan.
Carey Harrison, who did the adaptation, must be given full credit for
turning this unpromising material into a riveting hour of theatre while
remaining remarkably faithful to the original. The cast of five occupy a
central square in the low ceilinged crypt with the audience seated on two
sides. Sean Tracey's direction makes the best of this limited space.
Just how popular Bloomsday has become can be judged by the fact that
broadcaster Gay Byrne dedicated a good half hour of his weekday radio
programme to an interview with Carey Harrison, and expressed some doubts as
to how the son of Rex, and master of similarly cut-glass vowels, would
manage Bloom's Dublin accent. Harrison pointed out that, through his mother,
Lilli Palmer, he is every bit as Jewish as Bloom, and that in any case Bloom
was a Hungarian Jew, not a native Dubliner. In the programme notes he
excuses his height (just over 6ft at a guess) by pointing out that at 5ft
9ins Leopold Bloom was 5 inches taller than the average Dubliner of his day,
and at 11st 4lb somewhat slimmer that the Bloom of popular imagination.
To see Bloom portrayed by someone as tall, slim and attractive as Carey
Harrison gives a whole new dimension to Bloom's role as husband and cuckold.
We have here a new Bloom. Harrison's portrayal brings out the thoughtful,
humanitarian aspects of Leopold Bloom, making him more noble than pitiful,
and putting Molly's dalliance with the bounder Boylan into a quite different
light.
He opts for a neutral stage-Irish accent, which works well with the
authentic Dublin accents of the supporting cast. Anne Kent as Molly Bloom,
Mrs Breen and assorted voices sounds exactly right. Martin Dunne is an
inspired Nosey Flynn; he, David Ganley and Frank O'Sullivan are versatile in
their various supporting roles.

FT  16 JUN 93 / People: Transfer Technology recruits Bill Hayden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Transfer Technology, the fast-growing specialist engineering company headed
by Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson, has recruited Bill Hayden (right) to the
board as its third non-executive director. Rhys Williams, chairman of the
council at the University of Warwick and until recently a director of GEC,
has also been co-opted to the board.
Hayden, the former Ford of Europe manufacturing director, spent his last two
years before retirement as chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, famously
comparing factory conditions at Ford's new prestige acquisition to plants he
had seen in Gorky. Robinson is perfectly familiar with Jaguar, having been
chief executive at just 35 in the mid 1970's when he remembers luring away a
number of Hayden's key men. As it is, Ford is by far TransTec's biggest
customer on the car components side, buying 75 per cent of the company's
manufacturing output for the automotive industry.
A principal reason for hiring Hayden, who lives just 20 minutes away from
the TransTec's Coventry office, is his knowledge of the Japanese market and
his ability to deal with Japanese car makers, according to finance director
Neil Logue.
A leading authority on Japanese work practices, Hayden was the author of a
paper 'BJ AJ' - Before Japan, After Japan - written after a seminal visit to
the country in 1979. At a time when it was still notably difficult for
foreigners to divine much about Japanese manufacturing techniques, Hayden
had come back 'shaken' by the competitive gulf between Europe and Japan, and
resolved dramatically to improve Ford's efficiency.
Robinson has said that he will split the role of chairman and chief
executive at some point during the next 18 months.
'All the non-executive directors are possible chairmen' says Logue 'but
Hayden would fit the bill very well.'
Hayden is also on the board of automotive design engineer Hawtal Whiting.

FT  16 JUN 93 / People: C and W veterans prolong their stay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Cable and Wireless directors, 54-year-old Brian Pemberton and
57-year-old Tom Chellew, who between them have clocked up 58 years at the
telecommunications group chaired by Lord Young, are retiring in July, but
both will retain consultancy roles on a renewable annual basis.
Their continuing association with C and W contrasts with the departure in
early 1992 of Peter van Cuylenburg who saw his hopes of becoming chief
executive dashed when James Ross was brought in from BP.
Pemberton, who joined the company in 1957, was responsible for restructuring
the Hong Kong business during the 1980's. He had seemed a possible successor
to Sir Eric Sharp as chief executive, but was eclipsed by Gordon Owen, who
then resigned after a power struggle on the arrival of Lord Young. There is
no suggestion of any continuing rankle, however, and after the arrival of
Ross, Pemberton had been made international director, encompassing C and W's
international network and the marine division as well as North America and
Australia.
The regional responsibilities of Chellew, meanwhile, tended to prompt the
question from envious colleagues as to what he did for his holidays. On
joining C and W in 1971, his expertise was the Caribbean; after the Ross
reshuffle he looked after the Indian Ocean, Africa and the Middle East, and
the Pacific Islands in addition to the Caribbean.
As Pemberton and Chellew will not be replaced, the top management team will
now consist of five executive and five non-executive directors in addition
to the executive chairman Lord Young.
C and W was unable to specify how much time each departing director would
continue to devote to the company. However, both remain on a number of
subsidiary boards in their areas of expertise - Pemberton for the Asia
Pacific region and Chellew for the Caribbean.
Nor are they quite the last of the old C and W hands, despite the
considerable changes in management wrought since the arrival of Lord Young.
Mike Gale joined the company in 1959.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Old Etonian Roger Palmer, whose private wolf pack has often had more
publicity than his share tips, has hung up his hat after five years as
Kleinwort Benson's chief investment strategist.
Palmer, 46, a former partner of Grieveson Grant before it was taken over by
KB, has been picked to head his firm's move into the market for emerging
Latin American securities. Whilst almost all of the major North American
brokers are active in this market, it is a relatively new departure for a
London broker.
However, Palmer says that it takes as long to fly to Buenos Aires from New
York as it does from London, and KB is keen to capitalise on its corporate
finance connections in the region. It is one of the co-lead managers of the
partial privatisation of YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company.
Albert Edwards, 32, Palmer's deputy for the last four years, takes over as
global investment strategist. After three years at the Bank of England, he
moved to Bank of America's Investment Management arm, before joining KB in
1988.
Palmer is the latest global investment strategist to switch jobs. Lisa
Hosking, a member of Warburg's number-one-rated team, moved to CSFB a year
ago, and James Capel's Alastair Ross Goobey left to head Postel.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: The smart way to save energy -
A Canadian company is showing utilities the virtues of power conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saving energy is generally far cheaper than building new power plant, but
convincing consumers of this simple and obvious message takes effort and
skilful persuasion.
However, a Canadian company has taken on the task of preaching the virtues
of power conservation to utilities and energy users around the world. Its
scheme has attracted more than 25 utilities, from Mexico to the Czech
republic, and others are expected to join soon.
Power Smart began as the energy conservation initiative of British Columbia
Hydro, the government-owned utility. The company spent CDollars 60m (Pounds
30.7m) developing a wide-ranging package of programmes for its own use, and
then realised it could do even better if it worked with other utilities.
BC Hydro found that the province's population of 3.5m was not enough to
interest manufacturers to go along with its plans. They were reluctant to
take the trouble to meet BC Hydro's standards for products such as
energy-saving motors, low-power refrigerators or high-efficiency insulation,
and then face the same process for the next utility down the road.
So BC Hydro set about bringing other utilities into its scheme. It
transferred its conservation expertise into a separate company - Power Smart
 -two years ago.
Now, most of Canada's electrical utilities have signed up, and Power Smart
is optimistic about further expansion in eastern Europe, South America and
the US, all areas which already have one or more members. In March, the firm
signed up its second US member, American Municipal Power-Ohio (AMP-Ohio),
which supplies electricity to more than 77 communities.
The utilities which have joined vary widely in size. BC Hydro has a capacity
of more than 10,000MW, mainly from hydroelectric dams, and supplies more
than 1.3m customers. The smallest member, Caribbean Utility Company, on
Grand Cayman Island, uses diesel generators with just 71MW of capacity for
12,600 customers.
But they all face the same simple economics - it is nearly always cheaper to
encourage users to save a kilowatt hour of electricity than it is to build
the capacity to generate an extra kilowatt hour. At BC Hydro, which has low
power costs, it is estimated to be five times more expensive to increase
capacity than to save energy. Nor does the strictly financial cost of
expanding capacity include the strains that generating electricity places on
the environment.
The generic term for schemes such as Power Smart is demand-side management.
Once a typical programme is up and running, most of the money is returned to
customers in the form of rebates, customer help lines and other types of
service, says Tom Cave, Power Smart's director of energy services.
Short-term financial incentives are used to overcome customers' resistance
to the higher initial cost of energy-efficient equipment, but the benefits -
to the customer and the utility - last much longer. And a crucial component
of the programme is marketing.
'To get past the engineering barriers, you have to get people to think about
conserving energy. The most powerful energy-saving technique of all is
changing people's attitudes, and changing attitudes is essentially a
marketing function,' says Cave.
Under the umbrella of demand-side management, different utilities have
widely varying goals. Utilities in developed countries usually want to
discourage consumption across the board - for industrial, commercial and
individual customers.
In eastern Europe, on the other hand, the problem is seen as too much
consumption by industrial users and not enough by residential consumers.
Governments there want citizens to have refrigerators and other items which
improve the quality of life, says Eric Cardey, a vice-president at Power
Smart.
Another important driving force behind conservation in eastern Europe is to
preserve the environment. Much of the region's electricity is generated from
low-grade coal, which contains up to 3.5 per cent sulphur and creates
considerable pollution.
Unfortunately, conservation cannot be the region's only concern. Large
generating complexes were built under the communists to serve industry.
Industrial demand, particularly for military production, has fallen off  -
but they have to keep selling the electricity to cover the cost of running
the power plants they already have.
Yet governments in eastern Europe are taking a longer term view about
residential consumption. 'If they don't get energy efficient now, because
there is so much retrofitting and new construction taking place, they're
going to miss the boat,' says Cardey.
And the Czechs and Slovaks have realised the importance of marketing in
achieving these goals. When they joined Power Smart, they obtained the right
to use the name and logo in their advertising and access to programmes for
everything from low-energy water heating and lighting to efficient air
compressors and even buildings.
As an indication of the sort of success they can hope for, Cardey cites the
promotion of the use of energy-efficient motors in British Columbia. The
motors have a higher cost, which pays for itself in 1.5 to two years through
energy savings. The average market share for high-efficiency motors for
manufacturing use in North America is 3 per cent. In British Columbia, that
share has been increased to 75 per cent since the Power Smart programme
began.
Arthur Geikie, president of Power Smart, says the strength of his company's
programme is that it offers a complete range of conservation plans - for
residential, industrial, commercial and institutional users.
Being a member of Power Smart allows small utilities to take advantage of
research they could not afford, he adds.
For an annual fee ranging from CDollars 10,000 for a utility with fewer than
10,000 customers to CDollars 75,000 for a million or more customers, Power
Smart provides the right to use its logo in promotional materials. The
utilities can also pick from a 'library' of tested and proven ideas and,
perhaps just as importantly, avoid costly mistakes.
Given the importance of marketing in encouraging conservation, the Power
Smart brand name is seen as a key element, providing a shorthand for
manufacturers and consumers to rally around. Even in non-English speaking
countries such as the Czech and Slovak republics, the English language logo
is used alongside a translation.
The company endorses products, allowing manufacturers to use the Power Smart
logo on qualifying items and making it easy for consumers to identify
energy-efficient choices.
A large number of Canadian suppliers are already involved. And companies
such as Philips, the Dutch electrical concern, and Tungsram, the Hungarian
subsidiary of General Electric of the US, are looking at certification for
some of their products.
Power Smart has carried out consulting work in countries, including Costa
Rica, Peru, Thailand and Russia, which have little or no history of
demand-side management and which it is hoped will sign up as members in the
future.
Utilities in developed countries have tended to be a harder market. They
usually already have some kind of demand-side management in place, and it is
more difficult to convince them of the benefits of banding together.
Western Europe has less need for help, largely because electricity prices
have been very high for a long time. 'Europeans seem to have positive
attitudes already,' says Cardey. For the future, Power Smart hopes to
continue expanding. It has signed up its first gas utility and hopes to add
more.
In the long run, Power Smart expects regions where a number of utilities
have signed up, and achieved 'critical mass', to become more autonomous,
sharing resources within the region with counterparts which have similar
concerns.
If BC Hydro, with some of the cheapest electricity in the world, can justify
spending money to reduce consumption, anyone can, says Cardey.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Eco-label still not sticking -
The EC's green badge scheme is in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month, the EC Commission launches its eco-labelling scheme without a
single product displaying the much-awaited badge of environmental approval.
The Commission's original intention was to have at least five labelled
products in the shops before the launch. Instead, the scheme is in disarray.
Some countries such as Ireland and Portugal have failed to set up the
necessary organisations to administer the label. Others like France and the
Netherlands appear to be developing national schemes in preference to the
EC's.
Some manufacturers are threatening a boycott and environmental groups
complain that their views have been suppressed in favour of industry's.
'Anyone can punch holes in the scheme. The really hard task is to find
solutions and not just look for problems,' says Julia Hailes, the
environmental consultant on the UK Eco-labelling board.
Each country was supposed to set up a national board to organise and
administer the label. The UK board is known to be critical of the
Commission's level of commitment to the scheme.
The idea of an EC-wide scheme was developed in the late 1980s in response to
consumer pressure for an official stamp of approval on goods with a reduced
impact on the environment. 'We have suppliers who are trying to reduce this
impact and want to tell our customers about it,' says Alan Knight,
environmental co-ordinator at B&amp;Q, the UK do-it-yourself chain.
'But because most of our customers won't believe environmental claims made
by manufacturers, an official eco-label is the best solution,' he says.
Experience with environmental labels in Germany, Canada and the Nordic
countries showed that manufacturers could gain market share and possibly
charge more for approved goods.
The EC hoped its label would satisfy demands from consumers and encourage
industry to improve its environmental performance. But the scheme ran into
trouble. Methods for judging products were inadequate and created
disagreements within industry and between environmental groups and
manufacturers.
At one stage, it was decided that paper products with high proportions of
recycled material would be favoured at the expense of those made with virgin
pulp. This upset pulp suppliers who argued that recycling paper was not
necessarily the best environmental option.
Recently, environmental groups have begun to press for the exclusion of
products tested on animals. They say this must be a criterion but the
label's administrators say animal testing is covered by other EC laws.
The Body Shop, a maker of personal care products which campaigns against
animal testing, has threatened to boycott the scheme unless animal testing
is included in the criteria.
The confusion and delay has disillusioned some manufacturers. Electrolux and
AEG will continue to support the scheme and apply for labels, but Hoover is
concerned that environmentalists are gaining too much say.
Hoover might not apply for a label for its washing machines. Bosch is
undecided. The European Lighting Council has withdrawn from the negotiations
to establish a label for light bulbs.
Manufacturers are also dismayed at the amount of red tape the scheme has
encouraged. Details on the only product category so far to get the official
nod - dishwashers and washing machines - have yet to be published in the
EC's Official Journal. Publication is about three months behind schedule
because the various Brussels departments are taking so long to process the
paperwork.
'The one good thing is that the scheme has at least encouraged manufacturers
to pay attention to environmental issues and improve their products. This is
good for the environment, even if they decide not to apply for a label,'
says Hailes.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Management: A sympathetic ear in the office - Employee
counselling schemes are helping to make the workplace happier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior administrator in a London bank had spent several years successfully
climbing the corporate ladder. Yet over a period of six months he began to
experience headaches, a poor appetite and eczema. Demoralised, he started
scanning the employment pages for a new job.
His departure might have cost his employer thousands of pounds, as it sought
to train a replacement candidate. Yet due to confidential counselling paid
for by the bank, which identified symptoms of stress due to a difficult
relationship with a superior, he remained and was soon promoted to a more
senior position.
A female employee in a computer firm faced similar problems. Yet after a few
counselling sessions, she is back at work and enjoying a better relationship
with friends and colleagues.
'My friends say I have changed a lot, become a lot more outgoing and
assertive,' she says.
Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) are run by 80 per cent of the top 500
US companies. In the UK, EAPs are also becoming an increasingly popular
employment benefit, particularly in the banking, pharmaceuticals and
financial services industries.
Since the late 1980s some 150 UK companies are estimated to have taken up
comprehensive EAPs and the rate of participation is increasing, according to
providers.
Groups as diverse as Whitbread and Mobil Oil are among converts to the
advantages of providing confidential counselling to employees and their
families throughout their working lives.
The counselling programme, usually contracted out to an independent firm of
specialists, is often part of an occupational health programme.
Employees and (where appropriate) their families are generally given a card
with a number to contact a counsellor either for telephone or face-to-face
counselling.
The service may cover problems ranging from depression to debt, or stress
arising from difficulties at home or in the workplace.
The argument for introducing such a programme may not be immediately
apparent to frontline managers more concerned with the day-to-day job of
surviving the recession. Improving the general sense of well-being among
employees is likely to be lower on the list of priorities.
However, with recession forcing companies to cut staff, the pressures on
those who remain has never been greater.
Ian Anderson, community investment manager of Whitbread, is adamant his
company's experience is solid proof of the benefits which EAPs can bring. He
claims that 'the EAP has been a major factor behind our success in retaining
managers'.
Since introducing it on a trial basis in 1988 in conjunction with the EAP
firm, Focus, Whitbread now offers the facility to all employees and their
families. It estimates that about 5.5 per cent of its workforce uses the
programme, with the most common concerns being work and family related.
Anderson believes the EAP has helped to improve the efficiency of employees
and encourage a happier workplace. 'If they have problems, they will be
careless,' he says. The company is also likely to experience problems of
absenteeism and 'general lateness'. However, says Anderson, EAPs had helped
'to nip such problems in the bud'.
Mobil Oil, which uses the 24-hour service provided by Personal Performance
Consultants, considers its EAP to be an essential element of its health and
safety programme.
Initially introduced to deal with the problems of its off-shore employees,
many of whom are away from their families for two weeks each month, the
facility has been expanded to cover 3,000 workers around the country.
John Cooper, Mobil's group medical adviser, stresses the importance of
mental health at work, particularly in the off-shore industry. 'If you are
not functioning at 100 per cent, then you are a safety risk,' he says.
Employees with problems will either refer themselves or can be referred by
managers. If referred, it is up to the employee to decide whether to take up
the offer.
The counselling will then remain confidential. Both Anderson and Cooper
stress the need for this, although the company pays a price by receiving few
statistics on use of the programme.
The lack of statistics makes the payback difficult to determine. In the US,
where EAPs have been accepted practice since the 1940s, statistics are
easier to come by. The aerospace group McDonnell Douglas is often cited as a
company which has seen tangible benefits.
The initial costs of setting up an EAP are likely to be incurred in
commissioning an outside counselling firm or hiring one in-house and
printing the promotional literature.
On average, hiring an external counselling service will cost a company
between Pounds 15 and Pounds 30 per employee, depending on the complexity of
the programme.
Companies must be prepared to invest in training management to spot
potential problems, and appoint at least one person to oversee the
day-to-day running of the programme.
Whitbread supports its EAP with posters, brochures and regular talks.
'It is no use launching a programme with great razzamatazz and expecting
your staff to remember its existence,' says Anderson.
'Like any other service, it needs marketing.'

FT  16 JUN 93 / Management: Standing oration - Japanese companies are
looking for ways to improve efficiency in the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the beginning of this month, staff at the Yokohama town hall are being
urged to conduct meetings standing up.
To help them, the City Office has built a new conference room which, instead
of tables and chairs, is furnished with 16 podia. The new conference room
was the result of mounting concern among Yokohama city staff over the number
of meetings held each day and the amount of time each one took. If meetings
were held standing, city officials reasoned, they were bound to finish
sooner.
A growing number of Japanese companies are similarly looking for ways to
improve efficiency among office staff.
Shiseido, the Japanese cosmetics company, has set aside two hours each day
as 'concentration time'. Staff at the Tokyo head office do not attend
meetings or answer the telephone during that period. Instead, a few members
of each division take turns to man the phones allowing their colleagues to
concentrate on the work in hand.
Shiseido launched the scheme in April after it discovered that interruptions
during the day from telephone calls and meetings were the main cause behind
the need for staff to work overtime.
The scheme is part of a wider programme aimed at improving productivity
among its office staff. Shiseido hopes to reduce the number of overall
working hours from the current 1,920 to 1,860. This may not seem much, but
in Japan any reduction is highly unusual.
Toyota, the car manufacturer, is also implementing a programme this month
which aims to raise productivity among office staff by 30 per cent. The
company plans to achieve this by requiring divisions to re-direct 20 per
cent of staff time to new businesses and, for the remaining 10 per cent, by
reducing working hours.
What has triggered this growing concern with raising productivity is the
economic slump, which is one of the worst for the country since the end of
the second world war. Company profits in Japan, announced last month, were
down for a third consecutive year.
Against this environment, a preoccupation of Japanese company managers has
been the need to ensure profitability even while markets are not expanding.
Since it is socially unacceptable in Japan to make large redundancies, one
way to maintain profits in sagging markets is to raise productivity.
Office workers have become a target of this productivity drive because,
while Japanese companies are recognised for their achievements in raising
productivity on the factory floor, they have not had similar successes in
the office.
Between 1976 and 1990 the production costs incurred by all listed Japanese
companies fell 5 per cent, largely as a result of improvements on the
factory floor, says Kuniyoshi Sasaki at the Japan Productivity Centre.
Meanwhile all-non-manufacturing costs - those related to administration and
marketing - rose 33 per cent
Another reason why concerns about productivity are targetted at the head
office rather than the factory floor is that most Japanese companies took on
many white-collar workers in the past few years when the economy was
surging.
Between 1955 and 1991, the number of professionals and engineers employed by
Japanese companies grew by 385 per cent, that of managers by 280 per cent
and clerical workers by 326 per cent, the Japan Productivity Centre found.
This compares with 111 per cent growth in the number of skilled workers. The
Bank of Tokyo estimates white-collar workers accounted for nearly 70 per
cent of the rise in the number of employees between 1986 and 1991.
Personnel costs have been creeping up, from 11 per cent of revenues five
years ago to 12 per cent last year according to the Ministry of Finance.
Sasaki lists several problems which must be tackled if productivity in the
Japanese office is to be raised.
Too many meetings. Sasaki attributes this to the 'village society' mentality
that still rules in Japanese companies. One reason for Yokohama City
Office's standing-only conference room is because it discovered that city
staff spent too much time there. According to its research, 200 conferences
are held on average by City Office staff per day, with each conference
averaging two hours 25 minutes.
The situation has even led the City Office to publish a booklet on how to
cut down on meetings, which suggests they should not last longer than one
hour on average, and that briefing papers should be restricted to a maximum
of three.
Currently, says Sasaki, whenever something happens everyone meets to discuss
it. There then has to be a more informal get-together, followed by drinks
and so on.
Unclear responsibilities. Multiple management layers in Japanese companies
mean it is often difficult to know where responsibility for particular
decisions lies.
For example, the department head is usually responsible for the department's
activities, but it is the divisional head who is actually involved in
day-to-day issues.
Ineffective use of office equipment. When a new machine is introduced in a
factory, the whole production process is reviewed and work is re-arranged
accordingly to raise productivity.
But in the office, the wider use of PCs and copiers has not resulted in
similar efficiencies.
'There is a need for office work engineering,' Sasaki says. Office
automation has not been accompanied by a reorganisation of work patterns
which would raise productivity. If anything, he says, the volume of
paperwork has increased.
While a return to better times may blunt current enthusiasm for productivity
increases in the office, the labour shortages expected in Japan early next
century mean companies may have to come up with solutions now. However,
Sasaki does not expect a dramatic improvement in the foreseeable future.
The government's policy is to maintain employment levels even if that means
excess labour among companies. Government subsidies pay for the salaries of
workers seconded to subsidiaries, those who are asked to stay at home for
lack of work, or who need to be re-trained to do other work.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Jobs: Where bosses are best off - Smaller companies'
executive-pay league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the table to the right is one of the Jobs column's hardy annuals,
this year it might seed
After 14 years in opposition, its leaders must be looking enviously on the
fourth term recently won by Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish socialists. And oddly
enough, on the table's evidence, one result of their policies has been to
keep Spain's top bosses well off.
Before saying more on same, however, I'd better explain the table which, as
before, appears here by courtesy of the European Remuneration Network, a
consortium of 10 consultancies and institutes carrying out pay surveys.
Their latest combined exercise covers more than 38,000 executives employed
by 3,486 assorted organisations in the United Kingdom and 11 continental
countries.
Anyone wanting the full report - which contains far more data than I have
room for, and is priced at Pounds 525 - should contact Michael Smith of the
network's UK representative, P-E International at Park House, Wick Rd,
Egham, Surrey TW20 OHW; tel (0)784 434411, fax (0)784 471404.
My extracts are confined to seven of the countries, and to companies in only
two particular size-bands as measured by total numbers of employees. The
first are those with up to 250 people on the payroll, the second group
having between 250 and 1,000.
The reason why Germany is not among the countries, by the way, is that the
report did not enable me to break down the data into those two size
brackets.
While the separate surveys included in the exercise were made at different
times of the year, the findings have all been updated in line with
higher-pay movements to the end of last month. The continental currencies
have been converted into sterling at the London closing exchange rates of
June 10.
For each country and size-band, the table begins with managing directors.
Then come four of their immediate subordinates whose order in the ranking
varies from place to place: the heads of sales and marketing, production,
finance, and personnel. But in the UK there were too few personnel heads in
the smallest outfits to furnish worthwhile data; and not enough in the
Netherlands to provide a full range.
In every case the table shows both basic salary and total pay received in
money, including bonuses and the like. The lower quartile figures in light
type relate to the executive who would be a quarter way up from the bottom
of a ranking of all in the same country and type of job. The upper
quartiles, again in light type, refer to the one ranked a quarter way down
from the top.
The median figures in bold type refer to the executive midway in the
ranking, and give not only the salary and total cash pay, but also a rough
indication of buying power.
It is calculated by taking the total pay, deducting the country's standard
tax and so on for someone married with two dependent children, then
adjusting the result in line with P-E's index of differences in living costs
at the exchange rates of June 10.
Alas, such indices cannot be more than a loose guide because technical
difficulties prevent them from taking account of housing costs. But they are
the best available gauge of purchasing power - which is, after all, what
counts.
As may be seen, despite Spain's devaluation five weeks ago, its median
managing directors in both size-bands top the buying-power list, although
their subordinate departmental heads generally do worse than their
counterparts in Switzerland and France. How's that for socialism?

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cook attacks Tories over funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party is being funded increasingly from undisclosed
individual and overseas donations rather than declared corporate donations,
a Labour Research Department survey suggests today.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said there was a Pounds
15m 'credibility gap' between the donations declared by British companies
and the donations the Tories admitted receiving.
An analysis of 5,000 published company accounts traced only Pounds 3.7m
given to the Tory party in the run-up to the 1992 general election compared
with total donations of just over Pounds 19m declared in Conservative party
accounts.
The difference of more than Pounds 15m was almost certainly accounted for by
gifts from overseas and from individuals. A similar survey before the 1987
election showed a gap of about Pounds 8m between donations received and
donations disclosed by companies.
The survey will fuel calls from opposition parties and from some within
Conservative ranks for the publication of more information on Tory party
finances. The party has already said it will publish a balance sheet this
year for the first time, but has no plans to list individual donations.
The survey comes as Sir Norman Fowler, Tory chairman, gives evidence today
to a Commons' home affairs committee inquiry into the funding of political
parties. Sir Norman is expected to be quizzed on donations to the
Conservative party from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
The Labour Research Department found a steep fall - by 188 to 240 - in the
number of companies giving to the Tory party bfore the 1992 general election
compared with 1987, reflecting the depth of the recession and disquiet about
government policies.
Companies must by law declare donations of Pounds 200 or more.
The biggest corporate donors in 1992-93 were United Biscuits (Pounds
130,000), and Taylor Woodrow (Pounds 124,500).
The Conservatives were urged by Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy
leader, to agree to a 'charter for political parties' that would commit them
to refusing donations from foreign individuals, companies or governments.
Under the charter, campaign spending would be limited, donations above a
certain level would have to be disclosed and parties would have to publish
full audited accounts.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM targets invalidity claimants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S determination to press ahead with proposals for restricting
expenditure on invalidity benefit was emphasised by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, in the Commons yesterday.
He said the number of benefit claimants had more than doubled over the past
10. He said it beggared belief that 'so many more people have suddenly
become invalids, especially at a time when the health of the nation has
improved'.
Mr Major told jeering Labour MPs: 'I make no apologies for looking at this
area of expenditure'.
Undeterred by fierce protests from Labour MPs, he said the number of people
receiving invalidity benefit had more than doubled over the last 10 years
from 700,000 to 1.5m while spending had gone up from about Pounds 1.5bn to
over Pounds 6bn. 'No responsible government could ignore an increase of that
order,' he insisted.
Earlier, Mr Major discussed proposals for cutting the Pounds 50bn public
sector borrowing requirement with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, at 10
Downing Street.
Labour MPs based their onslaught on last week's disclosure that, in a draft
letter, Mr Lilley outlined proposals for taxing invalidity benefit, focusing
it more on the long-term sick, as well as making it less generous and
subject to a tough medical test.
According to government estimates these changes would save Pounds 495m in
the 1996-97 financial year, and Pounds 1.3bn by the year 2000.
While Downing Street officials indicated than no decisions were taken at
yesterday's ministerial meeting, new rules are likely to be in place when
the chancellor presents his November budget.
In the Commons the prime minister faced a blunt demand from Mr Ian Davidson
(Lab Glasgow Govan) to sack any minister who proposed 'a drastic reduction
in the already inadequate level of invalidity benefit'.
Mr Major immediately confirmed that invalidity benefit was being considered
by ministers, and maintained that they were 'entirely right' to do so.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said later the prime
minister had made it 'all too clear' that Labour had been right to accuse
the government of planning a Treasury 'raid' on the long-term sick.
He accused the prime minister of showing no understanding of the problems of
those facing illness, and he urged Mr Major to recognise that high
unemployment was the root cause of his problems.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory ex-minister slams union bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs last night backed moves which critics claim will allow employers to pay
union members lower wages than non-members, despite a sharp attack by Mr
Peter Bottomley, the former Tory employment minister.
An amendment to the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill was
approved by 297 votes to 275, with Mr Bottomley voting against.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tenders threshold set for councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL councils need not put white-collar services out to tender where
activity is below a certain level, the government said yesterday.
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said that the threshold could
be based on the value of a particular service, on the number of staff
employed in performing it, or a combination of the two factors.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Railways measure attacked in Lords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE measure to open up British Rail to privatisation gained its Lords second
reading last night, despite fierce criticism from former BR chairman Lord
Marsh.
He told peers: 'If the government persists in this exercise of primitive
dogma, they will pay a very heavy political price, and rightly so, for it.
But it will be the nation which will pay the full cost for very many years
to come.'
The Railways Bill was given an unopposed second reading under Lords
convention, but could face later changes.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warm summit may disguise cool
relations round table - Ralph Atkins considers prospects for Ulster as the
British and Irish leaders meet today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPERAMENTALLY similar and driven by the same politics of reasonableness,
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic,
meet in London today to search once more for progress on Northern Ireland.
Paradoxically, the closer the relationship between the two governments, the
further apart seem the province's nationalist and unionist political
parties.
In spite of the governments' efforts, attempts to restart round-table
political talks have stalled. Originally expected this month or next, a
resumption is now unlikely before the autumn. Nobody in London or Dublin
predicts a breakthrough today.
In large part, the deadlock is due to Unionists' fears. Since the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement allowed Dublin to have a small, but symbolically
important say in the affairs of the north, Northern Ireland's majority
population has seen the Conservative party drift away from the Unionist
cause.
British policy - that Northern Ireland is part of the UK as long a majority
of its population wishes to stay - has not encouraged Unionists to believe
its constitutional position is safe. The warmth between Mr Major and Mr
Reynolds, with none of the testy inter-governmental exchanges that often
characterised the 1980s, does not help calm suspicions.
The hope that originally teased Unionists into the first set of round-table
talks in 1990 - that the 1985 agreement would be torn up under a new
London/Dublin/Belfast deal - has evaporated.
Now the Rev Ian Paisley, populist Democratic Unionist party leader, is
refusing to enter talks until the republic renounces its constitutional
claim on the north. Mr Paisley is also irked by talks between Mr John Hume,
leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and
Sinn Fein.
With local elections last month proving disappointing for the more moderate
Ulster Unionist party, its leader Mr James Molyneaux has also hardened his
position, complaining that uncertainty created by talks involving Dublin is
costing lives.
His argument has a robust logic; Loyalist terrorists are proving as deadly
as the IRA, while last week's Opsahl report on the province, by an
independent commission, said Britain's reluctance to set out a blueprint was
adding to instability and distrust.
British ministers respond that a history of failed political initiatives
shows there is no alternative to the search for widely acceptable agreement
from within the province.
However Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is drawing up
'sketch plans' for new arrangements in the province, to replace the present
'direct rule' from Westminster. The initiative, agreed against the advice of
some in the Northern Ireland Office, followed the last intervention in
Northern Ireland by Mr Major in April.
Sir Patrick's colleagues believe he is philosophical about the intransigence
of nationalists and Unionists, judging that solutions may only evolve over
years, rather than months.
In that long run, prime ministerial summits will not make much difference
either.
An extra Pounds 24m is to be spent on the economic regeneration programme in
Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday. The cash will allow 30 new
schemes, including a crime-prevention project for north and west Belfast.
It brings to Pounds 124m the amount set aside for the Making Belfast Work
initiative aimed at boosting economic development and education in some of
the city's most troubled and deprived areas.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke appeals for end to
Conservative infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY backbenchers should put the recent infighting behind them, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, urged yesterday as he welcomed the - albeit
conditional - support for Mr John Major from Baroness Thatcher.
He also appealed to Conservative MPs to stop giving him daily advice on the
November Budget and to stop airing different views about what changes he
should make on taxation and public spending.
Also helping Mr Major was Lord Tebbit, former party chairman and
Euro-sceptic. 'The party doesn't want a leadership election of any kind.
Indeed the country doesn't,' he said on BBC television.
Mr Clarke sounded relaxed about the suggestions that Lady Thatcher's
intervention was intended to weaken his own position rather than bolster Mr
Major. He said her motivation was immaterial.
In a sharp comment on the volatility of Tory MPs Mr Clarke said: 'I ask my
colleagues not to have these doctrinal rows about whether they feel in
favour of tax or less spending today.'
After Downing Street's attempts to quash suggestions that the government
might not be able to keep to its election manifesto, Mr Clarke restated his
own commitment to the pledges it contained. 'I was elected on that manifesto
and insofar as I need to be reminded of it, it merely reminds of me things
that I know I don't want to do,' he said.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tendering threshold set for
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL councils need not put white-collar services out to tender where the
scale of the activity is below a certain level, the government said
yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said that the de minimis
threshold could be based on the value of a particular service, on the number
of staff employed in performing it, or a combination of the two factors.
Tendering for the first tranche of white-collar services - those related to
construction - is due to begin in late spring next year.
The decision to set a threshold would not prevent councils from putting such
services out to tender if they wanted to, but would mean that they were not
required to incur the costs of the tendering process if they thought the
likely benefit too small.

FT  16 JUN 93 / Growth trend in manufacturing 'up from 4% to 5%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output recovered in April and is growing faster than at any
time since May 1989, the government reported yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing production grew by a
seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent between March and April after a 0.3 per
cent decline in March. This prompted CSO statisticians to revise upwards
their estimate of the annual trend rate of growth from 4 per cent to 5 per
cent.
All manufacturing sectors increased output in the three months to April
compared with the previous three months, lifting the manufacturing
production index out of its previous narrow range.
The Treasury welcomed the figures as a further sign that economic recovery
is under way. A breakdown of the figures suggests that recovery is being led
by investment, and possibly exports, rather than by consumer demand.
The CSO said manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.2
per cent between February and April compared with the previous three-month
period. It was also 2.2 per cent higher than in the three months to April
last year. Manufacturing production in April was at its highest since
January 1991.
April's figures were buoyed by strong growth in the output of steel, metals,
and computers.
Taking the latest three months' figures, which the CSO's statisticians
consider a better guide, the office reported strong increases in the
production of cars, computers and aerospace equipment, as well as materials
for the building industry and packaging.
Production of cars and parts rose 8.1 per cent in the three months to April
compared with the previous three months, while output of computers increased
by 14 per cent over the same period.
Overall production of investment goods grew strongly, with output up 3.4 per
cent in the three months to April compared with the previous three months,
reflecting increases of 5.7 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively in the
production of the electrical goods and transport equipment industries.
Investment goods production in the three months to April was 5.4 per cent
higher than the year before.
Consumer goods output was less buoyant, in spite of the sharp rise in car
production. It rose 1.1 per cent in the three months to April compared with
the previous period, and was 1.3 per cent higher than a year before.
Extended maintenance work in the North Sea caused a 5 per cent drop in oil
and natural gas production in the three months to April compared with
November to January.
Other energy production dropped by 2.4 per cent as mild weather caused a
decline in gas and electricity output. Coal output fell 8 per cent between
March and April as lower supply contracts between British Coal and the big
electricity generating companies took effect.
The drop in energy production offset the rise in manufacturing output so
that total combined production of the manufacturing and energy industries
was unchanged between March and April. Overall industrial production rose
0.6 per cent in the last three months.
