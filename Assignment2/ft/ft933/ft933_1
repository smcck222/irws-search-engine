FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (45): Entertainment at the push of a button
 -Satellite TV has taken the nation by storm / India is at the heart of the
1.2bn strong Asian television audience now being targeted by international
media barons such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner

INDIA has finally become part of the great TV global village.
Gone are the days when the unimaginative and politically-motivated
bureaucrats who presided over Doordarshan, the government-controlled
national network, decided what was best for India's 335m television
watchers.
Today, viewers can choose from five Star TV channels (BBC world service,
Prime Sports, MTV music channel, Star Plus entertainment channel, Zee TV, a
Hindi language channel) as well as CNN, Dubai Television, Pakistan
Television, two channels from ATN (Asia Television Network), five channels
from Doordarshan state television and the Asianet Indian regional language
channel in Malayalam.
That's not all. International television companies, like soft drinks and
cigarette companies, are targeting newer markets, as their domestic markets
level out.
Asia, with its 1.2bn viewers and a wave of government deregulation and
technology, affords the greenest pastures. Media barons such as Rupert
Murdoch and Ted Turner have staked their claim. Two months ago, Murdoch paid
Dollars 525m for a 63.6 per cent stake in Hutchvision, the Hong Kong-based
company which owns Star TV.
A formidable new consortium comprising Time Warner's HBO Asia, Turner
Broadcasting corporation (which owns CNN), ESPN International, the world's
largest producer of sports programmes, Viacom, owners of MTV, Australia's
entertainment channel, AUSTV, and Hong Kong's TVB, with a large bank of
Chinese programmes, is all set to make a foray into the Asian market. The
Pearson group, which owns the Financial Times, is also exploring the Asian,
and Indian market.
All the new entrants, including Murdoch's newly-acquired Star (which
recently signed up a marketing joint venture in India with Bombay-based
MediaScope and the Deccan Chronicle newspaper group), seem to opt for some
kind of overseas partnering, which makes local political and social
obstacles easier to surmount.
If Asia is television's newest frontier then India is at its core. Star's
phenomenal success has been bolstered by the fact that India has the largest
English-speaking population outside Europe and America, and a rising middle
class that is only too happy to add more channels to its widening television
horizon.
Star, dismissed by the Indian government two years ago as a luxury channel
that some of the country's elite would watch, today has a fast-growing
audience of 18.8m, a 150 per cent increase since June 1992.
The Star Plus soaps, Santa Barbara and The Bold and the Beautiful, are
discussed endlessly in drawing rooms across the country; the hourly BBC news
has all but replaced Doordarshan's lacklustre coverage of events; and a
whole new genre of Asian rock and pop stars have found their voices on
Star's Asian version of MTV.
Star, which is distributed through local cable television operators with no
previous experience in the trade, had little competition until six months
ago, but is now the most powerful satellite distribution system in the
region.
There are also other contenders, some of them from inside the region. 'When
viewers have a surfeit of programming to choose from, they are increasingly
going to look for programmes that they can relate to, in languages that are
their own,' says Mr Sashi Kumar, president of Asianet, a Madras-based TV
company.
Mr Kumar had previously bought time on a Russian satellite to beam
programmes in the Malayalam language to the people of Kerala, on India's
southern-most tip, and to Malayalam-speaking communities in the Gulf
countries. He says: 'the new trend in television is going to be
narrow-casting.' By that he means identifying an audience and giving it the
programmes it wants in the language it understand best.
Asianet, besides generating its own software, has embarked upon an ambitious
Rs1.4bn programme to make cable accessible to the entire state of Kerala.
Not content with leaving the distribution of its channel to private
operators, the company has signed an agreement with Pan Asian Systems, a
subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, to lay coaxial cables
along the state's electricity lines, with franchisees to service the
channel.
The cables, fed by dish farms or a conglomeration of satellite dishes (15 or
20 of these 'farms' cover the whole state) have a capacity to carry up to 50
channels, and are currently offering subscribers the five Star channels,
besides Asianet's Malayalam language channel and the Doordarshan channels.
Other channels in different South Indian languages will be added.
International TV companies will also have to reconcile internationalism with
localism if they are to win foreign markets.
The government, in a belated attempt at salvaging its viewership, is
planning a series of 21 channels (through digital compression technology) by
the end of January, and 10 regional channels in the next month. The rush for
the Indian airwaves is still on, but in the next few years, audiences will
ensure that only the best survive.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (44): From modesty to the naked truth -
Films and morality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADHURI DIXIT, India's number one film star, has captured the public
imagination with her pulsating song and dance number in Khalnayak (evil
one), the latest product of Bollywood (Bombay-Hollywood).
Playing a bewitching village belle, she clutches her bosom and asks
suggestively, 'Choli ke peechhe kya hai (What's behind my blouse)?' She adds
innocently: 'Choli mein dil hai mera (my heart's underneath).'
The song, which sold more than 3m copies even before the film was released,
and could be heard at every street corner, caused a raging controversy when
a Delhi lawyer tried to have it banned as obscene. Fortunately, the court
upheld the censor board's decision to permit it.
Indian films, especially some made in the regions, are replete with
innuendo, and the 'Choli' song was tame compared with some of the steaming
sex and mindless violence that escape the censor's scissors.
As film-goers flocked to see Khalnayak, Mr Subhash Ghai, the director,
defended his stand that the song was 'ticklish and naughty, but certainly
not obscene'.
The petitioner, he said, was 'trying to foist narrow-minded morals on the
rest of the community.'
The cinema, like Indian society, has always had double standards about sex.
Film-makers who only recently began showing kisses on the mouth, thought
nothing of draping a heroine in a diaphanous sari, which left nothing to the
imagination.
'What people have always secretly desired to see is now being shown more
openly,' says Mr Manmohan Desai, one of India's most successful directors.
Romance in Hindi films is no longer confined to cavorting around trees and
songs about birds and bees.
The Bombay potboilers reflect a society in transition, in which one of the
most palpable changes is the new sexual permissiveness.
It is more prevalent in the towns than in the villages. But cinema reflects
it faithfully.
The Bollywood formula goes something like this: a young couple has just made
love, gunmen enter the room, spray the husband with bullets, their little
son comes toddling in, and watches his mother being raped. He then grows up
to avenge his parents, often in the guise of a policeman.
The film industry cannot afford to be coy if it is to withstand the deluge
of X-rated films from video libraries and the entertainment dished out
through cable and satellite television.
Film directors often 'borrow' a combination of five or six sexy scenes from
foreign movies, throw in some blood and gore, some pulsating Indianised
disco stuff, and then laugh all the way to the bank.
Indian sexuality is apparent not only in films but also in advertising,
journalism, and fashion.
Inviting readers' to relate their attitudes to sex, Glad Rags, a Bombay
fashion magazine, recently observed that 'our most intimate private moments
are coming out of the bedroom and into the public domain'. It adds: 'If
drinking can suddenly become such an open sociable event, can sex, the
obsession of mankind since the original temptation, be far behind?'
Dr Prakash Kothari, Bombay's best-known sexologist, confirms that people are
more sexually aware than ever before, but says that the modern attitude is
'not a sudden change, but the result of a long struggle to throw off the
shackles of ignorance and view the sexual phenomenon in the light of
reason'.
But he regrets that 'films, the media, and advertising provide only
titillation, and no knowledge, so common misconceptions and ignorance about
sex persist.'
Ms Mira Savara, a sociologist, who last year conducted a rare Indian sex
survey for Debonair magazine, maintains that the sexual revolution is not
new. 'It's a myth that Indians are not forthcoming about their sex lives or
that they have ever been sexually conservative.'
Her survey, answered by 1,500 readers (only 67 of whom were female), proved
that Indians could be quite open about their sex lives - if they were given
a chance to tell. 'There may be a great deal of sexual inhibition in this
country, but when it comes to brass tacks, people are not sexually
conservative,' says Mr Kersi Katrak, executive creative director of Lintas
India, which rocked Bombay with its daring Kamasutra condom campaign in
1991.
This departed from conventional condom advertising in which romantic couples
hold hands in the daisy fields, and showed sex symbol Pooja Bedi in
suggestive poses with a macho male model.
The campaign, attacked by parents as a bad influence on their children,
talked about sex for sex's sake, and 'the pleasure of making love', for the
first time in Indian advertising. 'The product was blatantly sexual and so
is our campaign,' says Katrak.
The ads were essentially a modern depiction of imagery from the Kamasutra,
India's centuries-old sexual manual, and the luxury condoms made marketing
history.
The agency had expected even stronger public outrage than actually occurred.
'This only goes to show that Indians have finally grown up,' says Mr Katrak.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (42): Undersold attractions - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAJ Mahal is in the final stages of a clean-up. When workmen have
finished scrubbing its marble dome early next month, visitors will see 'a
shining new face of the Taj,' says Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the minister for
tourism and civil aviation.
The ministry is so convinced that the Taj will look even more special than
before that it is raising the entry fee from Rs2 to Rs10. Also, for the
first time in many years, officials will open the monument in the evenings
so that visitors can once again see the sight which sent Mughal poets into
raptures - the white dome of the Taj bathed in moonlight.
Unfortunately, it will take a lot more than renovating the Taj to improve
the image of Indian tourism. Even though the country has enough attractions
to fill a continent, it is finding it difficult to lure visitors to India.
Tour operators are reeling from the combined impact of last year's
inter-religious riots, bomb blasts, and air crashes, as well as the
persistent bad effects of repeated airline strikes, bureaucratic delays and
poor service. Non-resident Indians are still coming to India and so are
backpackers. But the big-spending western travellers are not coming in the
numbers that India had hoped.
Last winter's unrest came too late for many visitors to cancel their travel
plans and the number of tourists rose by a hefty 28 per cent to 1.87m. But
this year's figure may show no increase at all because would-be visitors
have time to seek alternative destinations.
Mr OP Ahuja, an executive committee member of the Indian Association of Tour
Operators, says that about 10 of the 14 US tour operators active in India
have this year cancelled programmes. Thomson, the UK's largest travel
company, and Nippon Travel Bureau, the biggest operator in Japan, have both
cut back. 'I am not very optimistic about this year,' says Mr Ahuja.
There is little the Indian tourism industry can do about riots and bomb
blasts, except wait for potential travellers to forget about them. However,
much of the malaise in Indian tourism - such as the persistent airline
strikes - is of the industry's own making. If the sights of India are
unforgettable, so, sometimes, are the frustrations involved in trying to see
them.
India is a developing country with many needs more pressing than keeping
tourists happy. Western tourists coming to India cannot expect the same
levels of comfort and efficiency as in their developed states. Also much of
India's great charm lies in its otherworldly atmosphere. Its villages and
temples are often suffused with a gentleness quite remote from modern life.
Even its cities hide corners of tranquillity, such as the tombs of the Lodi
kings in Lodi Gardens in Delhi. However, other developing countries -
notably Egypt - have managed to promote tourism despite their political and
economic difficulties.
India's most serious problem is domestic transport. Indian Airlines, the
main state-owned domestic carrier, has a poor reputation for service. In the
last two winters it has also been hit by long pilots' strikes which spoiled
many a holidaymaker's visit. An elderly German woman travelling through
Bombay last year was almost in tears after spending 40 hours on trains
covering the ground she had expected to cover by air. 'The other 19 people
in my group cancelled when they heard about the strikes. I should have
cancelled too,' she said.
Service on Indian Airlines is improving rapidly in response to competition
from newly-launched private airlines, which have captured about 20 per cent
of the market. But labour relations remain tense - not least because Indian
Airlines pilots are demanding that their pay and conditions stay on a par
with the private companies' pilots. It would be rash to bet on a strike-free
1993-94.
As far as hotels are concerned, India's luxury chains - including the Taj,
Oberoi and ITC groups - are generally on a par with their counterparts
elsewhere in Asia. However, except in Goa, a long-established tourist
centre, India lacks reliable networks of tourist-class hotels. Too often the
foreign visitor is faced with a choice of paying over Dollars 100 a night or
less than Dollars 10 - with nothing in between.
Even the luxury chains have little control over the management of tourist
sites - museums and wildlife parks, etc - which is mostly in the hands of
the central and state governments. At their best, these can be effective,
such as the organisation of a son et lumiere show at Delhi's Red Fort, home
of the last Mughal emperors.
But too often there are monumental difficulties even in making bookings.
Take for example Corbett Park, a wildlife sanctuary in the foothills of the
Himalayas in the state of Uttar Pradesh which is run by the state
government. It is possible to stay in the middle of the park in a simple
tourist centre, which stands on the edge of a wild and beautiful lake.
But control over the rooms in the centre is split between three offices  -
in Delhi, Lucknow and the town of Ramnagar, which is more than an hour's
drive from the park. Trying to make a reservation can involve ringing all
three to ensure that a room booked in one office is confirmed by the others.
By the time the visitor reaches the sanctuary itself it is too late - even
if there are empty unreserved rooms, the staff are not allowed to let them.
Mr Ahuja says the underlying problem is that even though some state
governments - such as Rajasthan - promote tourism, most care too little.
'They can't see that they would benefit from the revenues and the jobs it
will bring.' The central government tries to promote change with publicity
campaigns but it is hampered by the constitutional division of power which
gives the states the prime role in controlling tourism.
India hopes to attract 5m visitors annually by the year 2000. It is hard to
see how it will do this u n l e s s it learns to look more carefully. after
those it already draws.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (43): An honourable profession - In the age
of the washing machine India's dhobis carry on scrubbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tillan Prasad, who is 72, has been washing clothes with his hands for 61
years. Like thousands of other washermen throughout India, he beats the dirt
out of the laundry by smashing it against stone. His grandfather was a
washerman and his father and two of his four sons have joined him in his
trade.
Like others born into the traditional caste of dhobis (washermen), Mr Prasad
never thought of doing anything else. He says: 'Dhobis have lots of work.
I've never been short of money.'
Mr Prasad lives with about 30 other dhobis and their families in a
collection of huts in central Delhi. All around are piles of washing brought
from middle-class homes. Each load is carefully kept separate from others to
make sure the laundry does not get mixed up. The dhobis' work looks as if it
has not changed in hundreds of years.
Yet, modernisation is slowly creeping into Mr Prasad's life. New-fangled
soaps, washing powders, irons and even washing machines are steadily
changing the lives of India's dhobis.
For some dhobis, India's economic modernisation has brought a loss of
business as their customers have bought washing machines and dispensed with
the dhobis' services. Last year alone, 500,000 washing machines were sold in
India.
But most washermen have easily found other clients as the growth which has
made some families rich enough to buy a washing machine has enabled others
to afford a dhobi for the first time.
Also, says Mr Prasad, no washing machine is as good as a dhobi. He waves his
wiry brown arms in the air saying: 'This is how a washing machine washes. It
cannot rub the clothes very hard.'
Then he presses his calloused hands together and says: 'This is how we rub.
Very hard.'
Mr Prasad says that his customers too have washing machines. But they use
them only for delicate clothes. A washing machine is no good for laundering
sheets, curtains and dhurries. Besides, he says, some people buy washing
machines only for show.
Mr Prasad says that over the decades his work has become easier. When he
started he could use only poorly-made laundry soap. Today, he has a choice
of international-brand powders. 'I use Tide and Surf,' he says.
He is also one of the few dhobis among his friends to own an electric iron.
Most of the others still use irons heated from the inside by hot coals.
His son Vijay Prasad says he believes he has a good future in the laundry
business. Even if many more customers have washing machines, they will still
need dhobis for the heavy work. Also, factories, hotels and restaurants are
growing throughout Delhi and use dhobis for their laundry. Vijay Prasad says
he and his friends would take on more work if only they had space to hang
out the washing. 'There is not enough room here for big sheets.'
Tillan Prasad and his two dhobi sons live together with their wives and the
sons' children. Their hut has only two rooms, but it has electric lights,
fan and a television, which is switched on whether someone is watching it or
not. Tillan Prasad is very proud of it, not least because it was a present
from a client - Chandra Shekhar, a former prime minister.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (40): Cricket is no longer enough - Foreign
policy is dominated by ties with Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fighting which broke out at an India-Pakistan charity cricket match in
London last month was a public demonstration of the intense bitterness
between the two countries.
Even a passionate appeal for calm from Imran Khan, the former Pakistan
captain and a legendary figure in his own country, was unable to prevent
Pakistan supporters from invading the pitch and then burning an Indian flag.
India's relations with other countries ebb and flow, but the enmity with
Pakistan is deeply embedded in both peoples. Indian foreign ministry
officials have other issues on their plates such as improving links with the
US and China and nurturing ties with the states of the former Soviet Union;
regional co-operation; the United Nations; nuclear weapons; championing
Third World causes.
All these matters are on Delhi's foreign policy agenda. But hostile
relations with Pakistan colour them all.
Unfortunately, little has happened in the last year to ease the tension  -
and much has happened to make it worse. The outbreak of inter-religious
violence which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in northern India
triggered a spate of angry exchanges between Delhi and Islamabad, which
culminated in tit-for-tat expulsions of junior-level diplomats.
The bomb blasts which shook Bombay in March raised tensions further as India
accused Pakistan's security forces of involvement in the outrage. In the
meantime, violence worsened in the troubled northern Indian state of
Kashmir, where pro-independence insurgents operating with support from
Pakistan are fighting the Indian security forces.
Indian officials believe that the domestic political upheavals in Pakistan
delay the possibility of any meaningful bilateral talks. As Mr Salman
Kurshid, the minister of state for external affairs, said in a recent FT
interview: 'They have tried to hide behind a break in government and given
the impression of being preoccupied internally.'
But even if a strong government were to take power in Islamabad tomorrow it
is unlikely that the two sides could settle their differences over the
crucial issue of Kashmir. India insists Kashmir is an integral part of the
country; Pakistan says Kashmir, inhabited mainly by Moslems, should have the
right to choose between staying in India and joining the Islamic state of
Pakistan.
Both governments reject the option favoured by many Kashmiris -
independence. The one matter they both agree upon is the bilateral Simla
Agreement, signed in a rare lull in tensions in 1972, which says that the
issue of Kashmir should be resolved by the two governments.
India is ready to try to mollify Kashmiris by offering greater local
autonomy, but not independence. However, it insists that the violence must
stop and Pakistan must cease supporting the insurgents.
The last year has seen a strong upsurge in the insurgents' activities, which
has provoked an equally tough response from the Indian security forces. In
recent weeks, the tide seems to have turned firmly in favour of the Indian
authorities which are claiming some success in suppressing violence. A lull
in the fighting may give Delhi an opportunity for a meaningful offer of
talks with the insurgents. Mr Kurshid says the government is ready for talks
'any time, anywhere'.
In the meantime, the security forces' activities have exposed India to
international criticism of its human rights record. Amnesty International
and other watchdogs have accused the security forces of acts of brutality
against Kashmiris. The government admits to some individual cases of
soldiers stepping out of line but says foreigners pay too little attention
to brutalities committed by insurgents. Delhi is considering responding to
criticism by permitting visits of foreign human rights organisations to
Kashmir and publicising the punishments given to soldiers found guilty of
murder and other serious human rights abuses.
Nevertheless, India can take comfort from the fact that, if its
international reputation has suffered on account of Kashmir, Pakistan has
recently fared much worse.
The US has condemned its alleged support for terrorists, including fighters
in Kashmir, its narcotics trade and its purchase of missile technology from
China. Islamabad was forced to work very hard to persuade Washington not to
put it on the list of terrorist nations earlier this year. It remains under
close obser- vation.
But when it comes to arms, particularly nuclear weapons, Washington's eye is
fixed equally firmly on both India and Pakistan. The US wants both countries
to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to inhibit the spread of
nuclear weapons.
Pakistan says it will sign if India does. India says it will not sign unless
countries possessing nuclear weapons also agree to give them up. India
firmly believes that developed countries cannot enshrine in law a permanent
strategic advantage over less developed states. As Mr Kurshid says: 'You
can't divide the world into haves and have nots.'
The US has applied sanctions restricting trade in arms with Pakistan and, to
a limited extent, with India. Most recently, it put pressure on Russia to
cancel the proposed sale of specialised rocket engines to India. India's
response is to try to develop the engines indigenously.
Even as they talk to American officials, both Delhi and Islamabad continue
with nuclear and missile development programmes.
Delhi's strategy is to have weapons-making technology ready without
necessarily making the weapons themselves. Islamabad has admitted actually
making bombs. Fortunately, as poor developing countries, the two states do
not have limitless resources to pour into weapons. But for each, especially
Pakistan, military spending places a heavy burden on the economy at a time
when both are trying to modernise and promote growth.
The hostility casts a pall over India's relations with its other neighbours.
India would like to promote regional co-operation and trade through the
South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation.
The SAARC would also like to act as a spokesman for the region on global
issues and would welcome its neighbours' support in its discreet campaign
for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (41): Soviet collapse leaves a gap - Cash
constraints are hurting the armed forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are lean times for India's armed forces. In the current climate of
government belt-tightening, defence spending has declined in real terms
while the cost of procuring new equipment has risen following the collapse
of the Soviet Union, formerly India's biggest source of defence equipment.
India desperately wants to upgrade and modernise its defence force. However,
the combination of less spending money and the loss of its most important
supplier will force India to concentrate on indigenous production of
equipment wherever possible over the next few years.
Whatever India cannot develop itself in terms of technology and know-how, it
will have to import from abroad or obtain by forging joint-venture and
co-operation agreements with foreign partners.
With its armed forces of about 1.3m, India has one of the world's largest
volunteer corps to defend against various external and internal security
threats. Its chief concern is the threat posed by Pakistan: the two
countries have been at war three times since 1947 and Pakistan, like India,
has been developing nuclear capabilities as well as conventional arms.
Meanwhile, relations with China, which defeated India in a brief war in
1962, have improved steadily since the late 1980s. China is no longer seen
as a hostile neighbour, so India has been able to reduce its troops along
that border.
India has various internal security problems, of which the most important is
Kashmir. Increasingly, the army is being called upon to help control
domestic unrest such as the religious riots and disturbances that occurred
after Hindu militants destroyed the Ayodhya mosque - primarily because the
police, with a reputation for corruption and inefficiency, have proved
unable to tackle these problems successfully themselves.
However, much to the annoyance of the hawks in India's armed forces, the
government has curbed defence spending as part of a wider effort to control
public expenditure.
The defence budget has continued to rise in nominal terms each year but, in
real terms defence spending has actually declined over the last five years.
Added to which, defence spending as a percentage of India's GDP has seen a
rapid fall in recent years: it peaked at 4.06 per cent of GDP in 1987-88,
and fell to 2.75 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. Mr Jasjit Singh, director of
the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, predicts that
defence spending will represent just 2.44 per cent of GDP in 1993-94.
'India has enough money to run its defence forces, but not to modernise it,'
says Mr Singh. Defence experts claim India is already cutting back on the
support side and limiting training exercises in order to save money and
preserve its diminishing stock of spare parts.
As for new defence projects, the future looks bleak, even though the
airforce needs to upgrade a lot of its equipment. 'There's not much money
around so you won't see much investment in new defence projects,' warns Mr
K. Subrahmanyam, a defence writer and analyst. 'No one is going to put out
the welcome mat for arms sellers.'
The only substantial defence order to emerge from India in the near future
is likely to be for new advanced jet trainers (AJTs), which are a high
priority for the air force. The government is reported to have earmarked
about Dollars 1.1bn for the acquisition of 80 AJTs and has shortlisted the
Hawk trainer, made by British Aerospace, and the Alpha Jet, its
Franco-German rival.
'The final decision on the AJT will be based on many factors including
money, and how we can develop the Indian defence industry - in other words,
whether there would be production in India,' warns Mr Singh.
As for its other defence needs, India already has several projects under
way, although there is some concern over whether these will reach fruition
given the present financial constraints. Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), the
state-owned defence group, is developing India's Advanced Light Helicopter
and hopes to launch production next year. HAL is also working on the
development of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), and says the first prototype
will fly in mid-1996.
The army has already started testing the locally-produced Arjun battle tank,
though problems were reported in the press about its ability to operate in
difficult desert conditions where the high temperatures affect its
performance.
India also has a major missile programme. This includes the 'Prithvi', a
medium range, surface-to-surface missile which was successfully test-fired
earlier this year, and the 'Agni' medium range ballistic missile technology
demonstrator, which is not as far advanced in its development as Prithvi. In
addition, India is developing surface-to-air missiles and a new generation
of anti-tank missiles.
'India has a huge indigenous capability, but it needs to acknowledge that
some countries are further ahead in certain fields. Instead of continuing to
re-invent the wheel, India should try to buy what it needs to push its
defence projects forward,' says a defence expert, who argues that it might
have made more sense for India to buy foreign tanks rather than waste years
developing its own.
The problem for India, however, is that it can no longer obtain foreign
equipment at the bargain basement prices it paid in the past. Its key
supplier of defence equipment was the Soviet Union, and India benefited from
rouble-rupee trade, soft credits and long-term repayment schedules. 'Some
75-80 per cent of Indian defence equipment is of Soviet origin, and 95 per
cent of that was manufactured in India,' says Mr Singh.
However, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, India found the
newly-independent states wanted payment in hard currency instead. On top of
that it has proved difficult to obtain spares from the individual suppliers
which are based in various former Soviet republics. Consequently, defence
experts point out that where India cannot afford to buy the latest
equipment, it may find it more beneficial to establish joint ventures or
close co-operation agreements with Western manufacturers in order to obtain
the necessary technology and systems while providing any foreign partner
with a cheap production base for potential exports in the Asian region.
'Over the next three or four years, India is unlikely to buy much from
foreign companies unless they actually set up production here,' says Mr
Subrahmanyam. HAL already has joint venture and co-operation agreements with
foreign partners. Mr Singh believes that India would benefit by establishing
joint collaboration in components and sub-systems, ranging from wiring,
switches, connectors, and sonar systems.
But while in theory such a route may be attractive for both sides, in
practice such ventures could take a while to get off the ground. 'Don't
forget, with such a joint venture, outside companies would have to deal with
the government, and that's not easy because of the bureaucracy,' says a
defence expert.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (39): Seeds of conflict - A turbanned Robin
Hood rallies the peasants of Karnataka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECKED out in green, from his fur hat to his shirt and traditional farmer's
scarf, Mr MD Nanjundaswamy could be mistaken for a latter-day Robin Hood,
writes SARA WEBB.
That is not the only similarity. As leader of the Farmers' Association in
Karnataka, a south Indian state, he sees himself as the protector of poor
Indian farmers against rich foreign multinationals.
Mr Nanjundaswamy and his farmer-followers are worried that the Dunkel Draft
for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
will allow multinational companies to develop plant genetic material from
countries such as India, then patent the resulting plant seeds and sell them
back to farmers in the Third World at a much higher price.
Supporters of Mr Nanjundaswamy's Farmers' Association (known as the KRRS)
raided the offices of Cargill, the US seed company, in Bangalore last
December in protest at the company's operations in India, and attacked
Cargill's seed cleaning and packaging plant in Bellary, Karnataka, in July.
'Most of the farmers here are not aware of the Dunkel Draft and GATT,' says
the village chief of Budigere, a village north of Bangalore. But, he adds,
they are worried that a company such as Cargill could come into the market
and dominate seed sales.
Indian farmers usually set aside a small portion of their crop at the end of
the harvest for sowing the next season. An estimated 85 per cent of seed
production in the country is by farmers themselves, although there are large
government-owned and private sector seed companies.
Mr Nanjundaswamy, who represents the KRRS in the Karnataka state legislative
assembly, has said his farmers will continue to target multinationals who
want to plunder the Third World for genetic material which is then turned to
commercial advantage for the companies concerned, rather than for the
financial gain of the countries where they evolved. 'What the multinationals
are doing is international piracy, and, in view of the mischief they do, we
are justified in taking this action,' claims the bespectacled Mr
Nanjundaswamy, who now divides his time between looking after the family
farm in Mysore and political campaigning.
A lawyer by training, he claims that his political beliefs are founded on
'Gandhian socialism' and advocates indigenous production, self-reliance and
independence in agriculture.
But the bouts of violence which his followers pursue appear to be losing him
some of his popular appeal. 'We do not condone that kind of violence,' said
the village head at Budigere. Indeed, plenty of farmers are flocking to buy
Cargill's seeds because of their high yields and, in the case of sunflower,
the higher oil content.
'The basic question is 'who has the intellectual property rights to these
seeds?' Our stand is that there are common intellectual property rights,'
says Mr Nanjundaswamy.
Cargill denies any intention of patenting seeds in India and says the KRRS
is misinforming farmers about the consequences of GATT and the whole issue
of intellectual property rights.
Mr John Hamilton, managing director of Cargill Seeds India (which is a joint
venture with Tedco, an Indian commodities broker), says patenting makes no
sense because of the speed with which crop yields can be raised.
'It only takes seed companies two to three years to develop better,
higher-yielding varieties which overtake the old varieties in the field. And
anyway, it would be impossible to police: patents would not be enforceable,'
he says.
However, he emphasises that Cargill is 'looking for some workable form of
intellectual property rights - not to prevent a farmer from retaining seed
but to prevent the plunder of our genetic developments by other seed
companies'. In other words, if the farmer wanted to keep some of the harvest
back for planting, or if he wanted to exchange seed with his neighbour, that
would not be a violation of the intellectual property rights.
Since July 1992, Cargill has launched two hybrids of sunflower and three
hybrids of maize in the Indian market, following four years of research into
various hybrid combinations to see which would be suitable for Indian
farming conditions. Neither crop is indigenous to India, and Cargill claims
that the tougher competition between the seed companies has served farmers
well, bringing down seed prices by 50 per cent in five years.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (38): Old ways die hard in the countryside -
Sara Webb explores a village called Pilana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWRY which Mr Ram Pal Tyagi had to provide for his daughter's wedding
earlier this year consisted of a moped, a fridge, a television, a double
bed, a sofa set, an iron safe, clothing, household utensils, cash, gold and
ornaments.
Yet Mr Tyagi, who farms sugar cane and wheat in a village 50 km north of New
Delhi, describes himself as 'a man of only average means'.
Dowry is illegal in India, but it remains a fact of life in many parts of
the country, particularly in the rural areas. Furthermore, the shopping list
of demands from prospective husbands these days is more likely to include
expensive consumer and electrical items in preference to the traditional
gifts of bedding and clothing.
The villagers of Pilana, where Mr Tyagi lives, are sufficiently close to
Delhi and well enough tuned in to the media to be influenced by consumer
trends. Nor is this 8,000-strong village in Western Uttar Pradesh unusual in
this respect. A survey by the Indian Market Research Bureau of more than 800
Indian villages showed that 77 per cent of them receive television
transmissions - an important influence on consumer trends - while 40 per
cent of families own a bicycle and 35 per cent have a radio or TV. At least
60 per cent of the villages have shops which sell soap, detergent and
batteries. Today, toothpaste from the village shop is replacing the
traditional Indian tooth-cleaner - a twig from the neem tree.
Pilana has all of these. Its roads and houses are bricked. Electricity runs
for as much as eight hours a day and there are telephone connections. More
than 100 of the 800 families in the village have a television, and more than
50 families own a tractor. There are water pumps and tap connections to many
of the houses. The children go to school in the village, and over half the
inhabitants are literate now. In the last five years, Pilana has gained a
veterinary clinic and a health centre.
'We are more prosperous than before, thanks to better irrigation, better
cultivation, and better employment and transportation in the village as well
as outside,' says one elderly Brahmin. The changes have not only been
material: increased contact with the outside world has led villagers to
question some aspects of traditional village life.
Many of the villagers are only too aware of the ridiculous burden placed on
them by the dowry system in a modern age. 'People realise it is not a good
thing because the amount of the dowry is getting out of proportion and it is
difficult to meet the requirement,' says Mrs Sukarma Tyagi, a grandmother
with three daughters and two sons.
The average family pays between Rs300,000-Rs400,000 (about Pounds 6,250 -
Pounds 8,300) in dowry, well in excess of their annual income. The upper
caste families in Pilana have land holdings of about 10 acres, earning
roughly Rs6,000 per acre.
Still, even though Mrs Sukarma Tyagi says there is 'a lot of talk' that the
practice of dowry should be stopped, change is unlikely to be rapid. Take
the example of representation on the village council. These councils, which
are responsible for village development, were usually dominated by men from
the higher castes. In the last couple of years, the councils have had to
include women and untouchables - the so-called scheduled castes such as the
sweepers and leather-workers.
In the village of Pilana, there are five women and four scheduled castes on
the council of 20. 'Of course there is representation of women on the
council but they are not active participants because they are not educated,'
says the village head, leaning back on his charpoy to take a drag from a
splendid long-necked water pipe.
Mrs Manisha Tyagi, one of the female representatives on the council for the
last two years, says she has never attended a meeting because she is too shy
and frightened of offending the other members. She comes from a neighbouring
village and, like all women who marry into Pilana society, she must keep her
face veiled in public. 'I don't like having to cover my face in front of the
men at the meetings. Also, everyone in the village is related and I'm scared
I might say something that offends my relatives or makes life difficult for
my family'.
The scheduled castes also have their council representatives, but they
complain that they do not have much influence because upper caste brahmins
have a majority on the council and so can overrule the untouchables.
Yet despite these gripes, many village members admit that relations among
the various castes are relatively harmonious, although the caste
distinctions are clearly upheld, with different castes having their own
residential areas.
'There's definitely more mixing between the castes,' claims Mr Srinikias
Dixit, a elderly Brahmin in the village. However, there are limits to the
degree of mixing. Untouchables were not allowed to use the village well,
although their situation improved when hand pumps were installed in their
own area. And even now the untouchables are not allowed to worship in the
same temple as the upper castes, with the result that they are collecting
money in order to build their own temple.
Marriage between members of different castes is unthinkable to the
villagers. Indian newspapers titillate their readers with a diet of horror
stories about unfortunate couples who disobey the strict caste rules. The
penalty is often death: in one recent case, the husband and wife were
beheaded by their relatives.
One of the shoe-makers in Pilana, who belongs to a scheduled caste, says
that '95 per cent of the things associated with untouchability have gone.
Now we put more emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene, and education has
contributed to this. Upper caste people find us more acceptable than 20
years ago.' And although he feels that he would probably never be able to
earn his living except as a shoe-maker because of his caste, 'at least I
hope my children might be able to do something else for a living, thanks to
education.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (37): Surface is scratched - Rural reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's latest economic reform programme has barely scratched the surface of
the country's agricultural sector.
While the government earlier this year announced a far-reaching
liberalisation of agricultural exports, it has done very little to modernise
the vast domestic markets and has, by and large, fought shy of liberalising
a sector of the economy which is riddled with controls and regulations.
Consequently, the economic reform programme has by- passed a significant
proportion of the population. About 80 per cent of Indians live in rural
areas, and 67 per cent of the people work in agriculture. About a third of
domestic production comes from agriculture.
Reform-minded economists believe that there is an urgent need for change in
the agricultural sector to improve productivity, largely by eliminating
restrictive regulations so that farmers can realise the full potential of
their land and efforts. But they are opposed by powerful vested interests
including wealthy farmers who manipulate the current regime and the many
officials who administer the panoply of agricultural regulations.
With its history of terrible famines, post-independence India has placed
enormous importance on the need for self-sufficiency in foodgrains, and has
chosen in the past to restrain food exports in order to keep down food
prices and build up food reserves.
The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s helped India to achieve its goal
of self-sufficiency. The use of fertilisers, pesticides, high-yielding
crops, farm mechanisation and better irrigation methods led to an increase
in farming output.
The index of agricultural production, quoted by the Centre for Monitoring
the Indian Economy (CMIE) in its Economic Intelligence Service, has risen
almost three-fold since 1949-50. Agricultural production accelerated during
the 1980s, and total foodgrains production rose from 129.6m tonnes in
1980-81 to 176.4m tonnes in 1990-91, according to government figures.
The increase in production during the 1980s stems largely from a significant
rise in yields: for foodgrains, the yield rose from 1,023 kgs/hectare in
1980-81 to 1,380 kgs/hectare in 1990-91, according to government statistics.
Today, market-oriented economists question the self-sufficiency policy,
arguing that it makes more sense for India to liberalise imports and
purchase those food items that are available at a lower real cost on the
world market instead of attempting to meet all of its requirements
domestically.
The central government sets the procurement price (which is the floor price)
for wheat and rice, as well as having a wide range of controls on various
other agricultural products. It uses a combination of subsidies and price
controls both to support producers and to benefit consumers.
Farmers benefit from subsidies for fertilisers, equipment such as tractors,
and irrigation. Furthermore, in many parts of India farmers pay next to
nothing for their electricity. This is used for pump irrigation, allowing
some parts of the country to have two harvests a year - one in the monsoon
season, and one in the dry season.
The system of subsidies - in particular those for fertilisers - acts as a
significant drain on government resources at a time when India needs to cut
back on expenditure.
Fertiliser subsidies have grown to become the largest central government
budgetary subsidy, amounting to about 1 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. The
government can ill afford to continue supporting the farmers in this manner.
At the same time, some of the agricultural methods which were encouraged in
the past due to subsidies, may not be sustainable: some parts of India
suffer from over-irrigation and damage to the soil. This is taking place at
a time when India's population is growing, and the burden on the farmers is
increasing.
The radical solution for the government would be to get rid of the costly
subsidies and open up the sector to market forces, with the option of
reallocating some of the savings to investment in the agriculture sector,
for example to stimulate agro-industries. However, such a move would be
socially disruptive and almost impossible politically. Instead, the
government has embarked on a more gradual process of reducing subsidies.
The government made a tentative effort to reduce the fertiliser subsidy,
with the result that prices for certain fertilisers have risen by around 50
per cent since last year. It is also restructuring the power sector, which
should lead to fewer distortions in the price of electricity.
Given that India is coming close to the limits of extensive cultivation, it
will have to employ other means of increasing productivity, for example by
diversifying into higher added value crops and agro-industries, and by
adopting more efficient irrigation methods.
Mr Balram Jakhar, the agriculture minister, recognises the need to encourage
diversification in the agricultural sector and the development of
agro-industries.
The government points out in its draft agriculture policy resolution that
'value addition in agriculture can only be achieved by a concerted thrust
being made in increasing processing, marketing and storage facilities. These
are imperative for the development of agro-processing industries which are
the key areas for development in agriculture.'
With the establishment of processing units in the rural areas, farmers would
be able to increase the value of their agricultural produce and could see
additional benefits such as the creation of new jobs.
The problem for the processing industries - for example, makers of tomato
paste or fruit canners - would be how best to ensure standard and reliable
supplies in sufficient quantities. In many parts of the country, individual
farmers work on relatively small plots of land, and, as a result of various
land reforms, there are ceilings on the amount of land which can be held by
individuals.
These reforms were intended to prevent the accumulation of large
landholdings by individuals, although in some parts of India, for example
the northern state of Bihar, land ceilings are largely ignored by the
powerful landlords.
Mr Balram Jakhar is keen to promote closer co-operation between individual
farmers living in the same area so that they can work more economically on
the land, for example by clubbing together to operate more advanced
irrigation systems. 'I want to encourage joint enterprise between small
groups of farmers,' he said.
While India's agricultural production has increased threefold in the last
four decades - which is a considerable achievement - there is still more
that can be done to help encourage the growth of the agricultural sector and
improve the living standards of India's large and in many areas impoverished
farming population.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (37): U-turn on curbs after 40 years -
Exports get the all-clear / Sara Webb looks at the most important step yet
taken to liberalise the agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's decision to encourage Indian farmers to export mainstream
agricultural products in April this year reverses India's post-Independence
policy of restraining food exports and is the most significant step taken so
far to liberalise the highly-regulated agricultural sector.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, has said it was necessary to
promote agriculture exports to boost investment in agriculture, raise
incomes in the rural parts of India, and thereby ensure that all parts of
the country felt the benefit of export-led growth.
In the past, India's agricultural exports have been predominantly the
internationally traded commodity crops such as tea, coffee, high-grade rice,
nuts and spices, while the export of staple crops has been either restricted
or prohibited.
However, the government now hopes that by scrapping duties on the import of
machinery and raw materials used in export-oriented farms or food-processing
plants, it will encourage people to set up export-oriented units in
agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and fish-farming.
Export-oriented projects will be obliged to export only half of their
output, and are free to sell the remainder domestically.
The export of agricultural products reached an all-time high in the year to
March 1993 of Rs73.08bn (about Dollars 2.5bn), up from R60.68bn in the
previous year and representing 13.7 per cent of India's total exports in
value. These export figures include rice, marine products, fruit, vegetables
and meat, but exclude tea, coffee and other traditional plantation crops.
By encouraging farmers and businessmen to set up export-oriented schemes,
the government hopes to increase agricultural exports to Dollars 5-6bn in
1996-97. 'Our export policy should be permanent, not stop-and-start: we must
be pragmatic and consistent in our ideas for reliable export promotion,'
said Mr Balram Jakhar, India's agriculture minister.
There is clearly plenty of potential for developing export-oriented
agriculture especially in the more fertile parts of the country, such as the
Punjab, where there are two harvests a year. India produces 70m tonnes of
vegetables and fruit, but only about 1 per cent of it is processed, and an
estimated 25-30 per cent is wasted through poor harvesting and the lack of
adequate storage and transport facilities.
The agriculture ministry is keen to encourage investment - possibly through
joint ventures - in cold storage, processing and packaging plants in the
rural areas as this would help to reduce the scale of wastage in agriculture
and raise the volume of products available for export.
Farmers will face greater pressure to grow export-quality produce, while
efforts to market it, both abroad and in other parts of India now that
restrictions on inter-state movement of agricultural commodities have been
removed, will have to be stepped up.
The challenges are not insurmountable, though the development of
agricultural exports may take some time, given the need for investment in
infrastructure and storage facilities.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (35): A trickle-down economy - Lack of water
is the Achilles Heel of Madras's heavy industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENTREPRENEURS of Tamil Nadu know how to take advantage of a crisis,
writes SARA WEBB.
While the city of Madras suffers one of its worst water shortages in years,
private truck owners clog the roads into Madras, bringing in tanks of water
which they then sell on the street. Scuffles break out as people rush to buy
water, while in some parts of town, the poorer inhabitants stay awake at
night waiting for the tell-tale trickle from the tap which signals that the
water supply has been switched on for an hour or so.
The more affluent keep their own water tanks while some of the state's big
industrial concerns have been forced to develop water recycling systems to
avoid running dry.
Madras, the capital of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, suffers from an
acute water shortage. The problem tops the list of priorities for Mr TV
Venkataraman, the state's chief secretary, especially since Tamil Nadu is
keen to encourage further investment in the state's industrial development,
which centres predominantly around light engineering, textiles and leather.
'The liberalisation of economic policy in the last year has been quite
helpful - there has been a lot of interest in setting up new industries,
both from affluent people in India and from abroad,' claims Mr Venkataraman.
However, industrialists argue that until something is done to rectify the
state's poor infrastructure, particularly water supply, it will be difficult
to encourage substantial new investments.
'The water situation is thoroughly mismanaged, there's absolutely no hope of
any water-intensive industries such as chemicals or paper wanting to come
here,' complains one industrialist.
Mr D. Srinivasan, southern regional director of the Confederation of Indian
Industry, points out: 'Water is a major constraint in the industrial
development of the state, and there is an urgent need to concentrate on new
technologies and innovative schemes like desalination and water recycling,
and to adopt water-saving concepts such as waste water treatment, recycling
and conservation wherever possible.'
Poor monsoons in the last two years have exacerbated Tamil Nadu's water
problems. In addition, the state has had a long-running dispute with
neighbouring Karnataka over the right to use water from the river Cauvery,
an issue which is heavily politicised.
However, Mr Venkataraman says the state hopes to improve the water situation
in Madras through a resolution of the Cauvery dispute, as well as by
obtaining water from the Krishna river, nearby lakes and from desalination
projects. Desalination of brackish water or sea water was once seen as too
expensive an option to pursue: now the state hopes to encourage foreign
investors to come in on a 'build-operate-transfer' basis.
Power is the other main area which needs to be developed. Tamil Nadu, in
common with other Indian states, needs to boost its power capacity as it
already suffers a shortfall of 1,500MW and this is expected to increase.
The Indian government announced in 1991 that private sector investors would
be encouraged to participate in new power projects given that the public
sector cannot afford to meet energy requirements.
Some headway has already been made in this respect in Tamil Nadu. The state
has large lignite deposits and has signed an agreement to set up the 1,500MW
Jayamkondan lignite project. The project, which is the largest in Asia, is
an integrated mining and power generation project which is a joint venture
between Siemens of Germany, the Khaita-Birla companies of McNally Bharat,
and Williamson &amp; Magor, and the state government-owned Tamil Nadu Industrial
Development Corporation.
Ms J. Jayalalitha, the state's autocratic chief minister whose career as a
Tamil film actress preceded her move into politics, has pinpointed the need
to develop the state's industrial sectors. Tamil Nadu's industrial growth
has lagged the national average in recent years, and unemployment,
particularly among young qualified people, is high.
However, critics claim that since leading her party - the All India Anna
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) - to power in 1991, Ms Jayalalitha has
achieved little in terms of promoting Tamil Nadu's industry. 'There's a lot
of talk but not much action - she's just another publicity-seeking
politician,' complains one businessman of Ms Jayalalitha, a woman whose
chubby features adorn many of the city billboards.
Yet according to the Confederation of Indian Industry, Tamil Nadu is the
third most industrially developed state in India, after Maharashtra and
Gujarat. That ranking is largely thanks to the automotive and
auto-components industries which have developed over many years in Tamil
Nadu.
Ashok Leyland, the bus and truck manufacturer, has a substantial part of its
manufacturing in Tamil Nadu in the area around Madras and Hosur (an
industrial centre close to the border with Karnataka).
Hinduja (the international trading group) and Iveco (a subsidiary of Fiat of
Italy) together hold a controlling stake in Ashok Leyland, with Iveco
contributing industrial expertise to help improve the quality of truck
production. A new range of trucks is being developed for production next
year.
'Gradually we will be replacing our range of trucks with these new designs
made available by Iveco. The new range will have engines and transmission
which are the same as those used by Iveco in Europe and which meet EC
standards,' says Mr RJ Shahaney, managing director of Ashok Leyland.
He is optimistic that Iveco will use India as a base for exporting the new
range of trucks, for example to the Far East, Australia, and Middle East,
particularly in view of India's low labour costs and overheads.
The presence of Ashok Leyland in Tamil Nadu has encouraged a flourishing
auto components industry in the region. Now, the industry is keen to exploit
the advantage of liberalisation and a favourable exchange rate to export
more components.
Mr S. Viji, president of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association
of India, and managing director of Brakes India, a Madras-based manufacturer
of brake systems, says the components sector is concentrating on boosting
exports to the US, EC, Australia, New Zealand and south-east Asia.
Brakes India exports 11-12 per cent at present, but hopes to boost its
exports to 20-25 per cent of sales in five years. However, some components
manufacturers are already exporting as much as 60 per cent of their
production, Mr Viji says.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (34): Silk worms and silicon - There is more
to Bangalore than electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE south Indian city of Bangalore has established itself as the country's
electronics capital, earning the nickname 'Silicon Plateau' from members of
its business community.
But Bangalore's success in attracting new business ventures, particularly in
the software field, is taking its toll on the city's infrastructure. Unless
the state government's plans to improve the city's infrastructure see the
light of day, further development in the region could be curtailed.
Bangalore, capital of the south Indian state of Karnataka, owes its success
in the electronics field to a combination of political, industrial and
geographical factors.
Back in the 1950s, the Indian government decided to base several of the big
public sector industries in Bangalore, creating new jobs and establishing
Bangalore as an important industrial centre. Those public sector companies
included Bharat Earth Movers, Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics,
Hindustan Machine Tools and Indian Telephones Industries - names which still
play an important role in the state and the country as a whole, employing
thousands of people.
They also provided a strong magnet for ancillary companies, drawing in
small-scale industries which could work as sub-contractors to the big
industries.
Initially, Bangalore was able to provide a cheap and plentiful supply of
power. However, the situation has changed and, as in many parts of India,
demand far outstrips supply today. While heavy industries now suffer from a
shortage of power, businesses which are less power-intensive, for example in
the software and related businesses, have continued to flourish.
For such businesses, Bangalore claims to have a number of advantages. For a
start, its climate is a lure for many Indians: with an altitude of just over
900 metres and relatively light rainfall, Bangalore is affectionately
described by its inhabitants as having 'an air-conditioned climate'. It is
green with parks and leafy boulevards - unlike other big industrial or
business centres, such as Bombay.
'Young, upwardly mobile, educated people want to come here and if you are
bidding for talented staff, that is an important consideration,' points out
Mr Anal Jain, vice president of marketing at Tata Information Systems
Limited (TISL), the joint venture business between IBM and India's Tata
group.
There is also a large pool of talent which foreign companies in the
electronics and computer sector are keen to tap. The Indian Institute of
Science is based in Bangalore and the state of Karnataka as a whole has
18,000 college places for engineering.
Mr Richard Gall, managing director of Texas Instruments (India), says:
'Bangalore is known as a technology centre: in the mid 1980s, US companies
in information technology saw that demand for software engineering talent
was far outstripping the supply in the US, so it was natural that when TI
started to address this problem we looked at the technical heart of India.'
Such talent comes at knock-down prices for many foreign companies. Mr Jain
at TISL points out that companies can hire graduate engineers from a good
school for about Dollars 2,000 a year, or maybe Dollars 3,000 if the
engineer has an MBA. Such staff would be employed in software, marketing or
on the support side. 'Wage rates are going up quite rapidly here, but that
is still a lot cheaper than in the US,' says Mr Jain.
Foreign investors say they are attracted by the state's relatively good
record in terms of labour relations, as well as the Karnataka government's
very positive attitude towards investors, particularly in the light industry
sector.
'The government is very pro-foreign investment - Bangalore today is a Who's
Who of US business,' says Mr John Hamilton, managing director of Cargill
Seeds India, the Bangalore-based India operations of Cargill, the US seed
company. Cargill may have been welcomed by the state government, but it had
a less rapturous response from certain factions of the farming community:
some farmers have attacked Cargill property, protesting that the US group
will deprive farmers of their livelihood if it patents the seeds it
develops.
However, the protests do not appear to be deterring other investors. 'We're
always open to industrial investment, but we encourage them to go 30km
outside Bangalore to reduce the strain on our resources,' says Mr JC Lynn,
the state's chief secretary who was brought in last December by Mr M.
Veerappa Moily, the chief minister of Karnataka, as part of a shake-up of
the administration. Mr Moily represents the Congress (I) party, and replaced
Mr S. Bangarappa as chief minister when the latter was ousted because of his
corrupt practices.
Karnataka has made considerable efforts to diversify its agricultural and
industrial base. Sugar-cane and rice paddy are grown where irrigation
allows, and the state is rich in teak, rosewood and sandalwood. Eucalyptus
has been developed as a fast-growing source of pulp for the forestry sector,
while sericulture and dairy processing have been introduced to provide more
stable sources of income for farmers in the region. Today, sericulture
employs about 200,000 people in Karnataka and the state accounts for nearly
half of India's silk production.
In industry, however, the rapid growth and development have brought new
problems to the region - in particular, shortages of power, water and
transportation.
In tune with the Indian government's economic liberalisation programme, the
Karnataka state government is looking at ways in which the private sector
can play a role in developing the state's infrastructure given that
Bangalore's current population of about 4.5m is expected to increase to
between 6.5 and 7m by the year 2000. There are tentative plans to alleviate
Bangalore's traffic problems by setting up a mass rapid transportation
system, while meeting the city's demand for power by building new power
plants.
'Power supply is a big problem, so our policy has been to encourage small
electronics industries rather than heavy industry,' says Mr Lynn.
Karnataka's power supply is predominantly hydro-electric. Over the next five
years, Mr Lynn hopes that the state will add a further 3,000-4,000MW to its
existing capacity of 2,700MW with the help of new coal and hydro-electricity
power projects - improvements which would encourage the growth of the heavy
industrial sector and undoubtedly benefit many of the region's inhabitants.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (33): How a giant keeps growing - Profile,
RPG Enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO big business houses grew at a phenomenal rate during the period of
government controls.
Reliance and RPG Enterprises both had close links with the ruling party. But
they developed differently. Reliance set up new industries, but has had
difficulties with its only takeover - of the engineering and cement giant
Larsen &amp; Toubro.
RPG Enterprises, however, grew largely by acquisitions. Its leading
subsidiaries - Ceat, Calcutta Electric, Harrisons Malayalam, Searle, KEC
International and International Computers - were all acquired through
takeovers.
RPG Enterprises, headed by 63 year-old Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, raised its
turnover to Rs31bn in the year to March 1993 from Rs800m in 1979-80.
Mr Sanjiv Goenka, the vice chairman, admits that not all RPG's takeovers
were wise. 'But in the highly regulated regime, we wanted to grab all the
opportunities that came our way. Otherwise, we could not have grown at this
rate.'
Remington Rand, which makes typewriters and telephones, and Gramophone
Company have proved disappointing acquisitions. With their low turnover and
mounting losses, they have not been an asset to India's fifth largest
business house.
It is now trying to sell Remington, but says it will retain Gramophone
Company for 'emotional reasons' and because of its 'very rich repertoire of
music built for nearly a century'.
'Except for certain aberrations, our takeover of companies has followed a
pattern', says Mr Sanjiv Goenka. 'The corporate strategy has been to
strengthen our presence in automotive tyre, thermal power, chemicals and
infotech through acquisition and also by setting up of new units.'
Calcutta Electric supplies electricity in the Calcutta region. The group
also owns KEC International, the world's second largest builder of
electricity pylons, and Asian Cables which makes high tension power lines.
It also has a power consultancy.
RPG Enterprises has similarly integrated its business connected with tyres,
of which it is a leading manufacturer. It produces all the major tyre
components, including rubber, nylon cord and carbon black.
In the new deregulated business climate, says Mr Goenka, RPG Enterprises
'will seek growth where it already has a critical mass. Similarly, it will
strike out in new fields if only there are prospects for creating a critical
mass.'
That is why it decided to sell its holding in India Polyfibres, a small
player in polyester staple fibres, and also two small electronic units in
Kashmir. The group, which thinks its turnover could reach Rs100bn by the
turn of the century, is giving 'maximum attention' to the development of new
coal fired power stations.
Calcutta Electric is to build a 500MW plant at Budge Budge and a 1,500MW
complex at Balagarh at a total cost of Rs60bn. Its interest in power is not
going to be confined to West Bengal. It has bid for the Delhi Electric
Supply Undertaking, a government unit which is to be privatised.
'We are also going to set up a 250MW power station at Chandel in Bihar. We
have proved ourselves to be an efficient producer of power and we are not
afraid of foreign competition,' says Mr Goenka.
The group also claims to be internationally competitive in tyres. 'Ceat,
which is among the top 20 tyre companies in the world, is a large exporter
of tyres to the US and Europe. This would not be possible unless our prices
and quality are right,' says Mr Goenka.
RPG would have been even stronger had it not lost control of Dunlop India,
in October 1988, to Mr Manu Chhabria, a non-resident Indian industrialist
with whom it had managed the company jointly for four years.
But RPG is not sorry that its petrochemical projects in West and Tamil Nadu
did not take off. With import restrictions lifted, their viability was
doubtful.
For the same reason, the group pulled out of a nuclear medicine project. 'We
cannot look up to the government for protection. Before we make any
investment, we must be sure that we can withstand foreign competition. After
all, the government will further reduce the import duty,' RPG says.
As part of a rationalisation policy, it has started looking abroad. It has
recently commissioned a tyre plant in Sri Lanka where it also manages two
plantation companies. The group has been invited to manage rubber estates in
Vietnam and is to set up a task force to take advantage of business
opportunities in China. But RPG Enterprises will restrict itself to areas
where it has the expertise.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (31): Waiting for a call - Why telephone
privatisation is being held up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S most ambitious privatisation, initiated two years ago, is in the
field of telecommunications. But court battles and the lack of a
comprehensive policy have bogged down what could well be the world's largest
expansion plan, connecting a population of more than 850m to the rest of the
world.
Contracts for paging systems are yet to be finalised. The government's
attempt last year to award contracts to Indian and multinational companies
for a cellular network in four metropolitan areas has been mired in
controversy, with allegations of favouritism and corruption.
After years of being neglected as a luxury, the Indian telecom industry is
slowly coming into its own, as a crucial infrastructural element if reforms
are to work.
Budget allocations were substantially raised, to Rs231.3bn in the
government's current Eighth plan (1992-1997), as against Rs45.3bn in the
Seventh plan. The actual expenditure, however, was Rs81.22bn, almost double
the outlay, but only after India had received a rap on the knuckles from the
World Bank.
Noting that the 'the quality of the current service is very poor compared to
international standards' and pitifully thin compared with other developing
countries, the Bank estimated the potential market to be 'three to four
times the market currently being served,' with only 5.8m lines for a
population exceeding 850m (an average of 0.52 telephone lines per hundred
Indians). The Bank added that the case for substantial reform was
'overwhelming', and that much of the groundwork had already been prepared.
The government's Department of Telecommunications is long overdue for
restructuring. The DoT is a monolithic, financially self-sufficient
organisation which has a monopoly of the regulation, direct provision of
services, and promotion of telecoms equipment manufacturing.
A committee set up in 1991 recommended as a first step the separation of
these three functions so that independent regulatory and policy-making
bodies could promote competition and private sector participation and
concentrate on providing a flow of services to users rather than on the
provision of physical infrastructure.
Besides the establishment of these two independent bodies, comprehensive
reform would include entry of competitors in both long-distance and local
services and the reorganisation of DoT into regional operating companies for
the northern, eastern, western and southern zones, besides a long-distance
trunk line corporation, to run the telecommunications service in the
country.
But the government has been unable to decide whether this plan is feasible,
or whether foreign equity participation should be allowed in these
corporations. The government's expansion plan envisages adding 7.5m lines to
the existing infrastructure by 1997, to reach 20m lines by the end of the
century.
Experts say this will still not meet the demands of a growing population and
an expanding economy. But the DoT admits that the telecom infrastructure in
the country could improve drastically if private companies were allowed to
provide the basic telephone infrastructure.
The DoT had sought Rs400bn from the government for its telecom budget, and
it was decided that the sector should be partly privatised. The DoT invited
global tenders for a range of telecom equipment and services, digital
exchanges, and microwave systems and franchises for cellular and radio
paging operations in more than 30 Indian cities.
But the Narasimha Rao government made it clear that privatising the entire
telecom sector was out of the question. Officials point out that it was only
in the late 1980s that governments in most developed countries relinquished
control of the telecom industry.
'We have not got to the stage where absolute privatisation is feasible or
advisable,' says a senior official in the Communications Ministry. 'The
government's main concern is to develop a telecom infrastructure in the
rural areas, where private companies would not venture because there are no
profits to be had,' he says.
Last year, the government set up rural exchanges in 30,000 Indian villages,
a giant leap considering that only 42,000 villages had been connected in the
40 years since Independence.
'We are all for liberalisation, but the telecom sector is a very sensitive
one, so privatising it can only be on a selective basis,' says Mr Rajesh
Pilot, a cabinet minister formerly in charge of telecommunications.
The government's limited attempts to privatise telecommunications have
attracted the biggest names in the world industry, including the American
AT&amp;T and Motorola, Germany's Siemens AG, France's Alcatel, Sweden's Ericsson
and Fujitsu of Japan.
But the dispute over the awarding of contracts for a mobile telephone
network highlighted the government's inability to implement policy
decisions, and, in this case, to devise a system which competitors could not
allege was unfair, corrupt, or arbitrary.
DoT officials say lack of funds impedes progress in the sector, not the
structure of their monolith organisation. Mr N Vittal, who heads the
country's telecom commission, stresses that changes cannot be expected
overnight. 'There is a need for transitional management and this calls for a
strategic alliance between the government and industry,' he said recently.
Foreign companies had often complained that India was doing 'too little, too
slowly' in the telecom sector.
An executive of a large foreign company which will supply the government
with part of a Rs1.5bn switching equipment order said the the size of the
market was tempting, 'but we are tired of hanging around Delhi's
bureaucracy, waiting for them to make up their minds'.
The stringent technical validation tests stipulated by the government took
Siemens, Ericsson and Fujitsu several frustrating months to clear.
'What made things worse was that the government refused to specify which of
the 40-odd tests we had failed to pass, so we could adjust accordingly,'
says the manager of one company left out of the eventual award. But he was
optimistic that, with the government's expansion plan under way, there would
be further tenders floated for switching equipment.
Voicing a common complaint of foreign investors, a telecom executive says:
'There is a stubborn reluctance among bureaucrats to get projects off the
ground, even after the red tape has been surmounted, and clearances
obtained.'
Last year, Motorola threatened to move its Dollars 100m semi-conductor plant
project and a telephonic pager company to China. 'But they are still here,'
points out an official in the Telecom ministry. 'It's the size of the market
and the growth potential we offer that makes it worthwhile for investors,
even if sometimes they have to wait.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (32): The appeal of apparel - Profile,
Gokaldas Exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAAZNEEN KARMALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL companies contribute substantially to Indian exports of products
ranging from garments to leather, semi-precious stones and jewellery.
In spite of restrictions and overseas competition, energetic private
enterprises have managed to find rack space in chainstores across Europe and
the US. Macy's, Sears, C&amp;A, Kaufhof and Banana Republic all have 'Made in
India' tags on their labels.
According to the Apparel Export Promotion Council, India exported Rs85bn
worth of garments in March 1993. It predicted the total would reach Rs100bn
in 1995. Exports grew by an average 30 per cent a year, making garments the
country's highest net foreign exchange earner.
'Versatility, flexibility and value for money are the three measures on
which Indian garments score high marks,' says Dinesh Hinduja, a partner at
Gokaldas Exports, the country's top garment exporter.
This family-run concern, which employs 13,000 people in its 26 factories in
and around the southern city of Bangalore, totted up international sales of
Rs1.3bn in the year to March 1993. (The family is not related to the owners
of the Hinduja international trading group.)
Some 80 per cent of this was picked up by European manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers such as Klaus Steilmann and Camel in Germany,
Newman and Galeries Lafayette in France and the C&amp;A retail chain in the UK.
Gokaldas Exports also supplies shirts to American jean makers Wrangler and
Levi Strauss. Eight out of its 26 factories are exclusive production centres
for these clients. Levi Strauss has put Gokaldas on top of the shortlist of
possible partners for its proposed manufacturing venture in India.
The Hinduja family made its debut in international trade in the 1960s by
exporting silk scarves. When demand levelled out, it began to look for other
options and hit upon exporting cotton shirts.
A family split in 1979 divided the business. Six factories fell to the lot
of Jhamandas Hinduja and his three sons, Madanlal, Rajendra and Dinesh.
Since then, both branches of the Hinduja family have expanded their
businesses and now compete with each other in global and domestic markets.
The siblings divided operational responsibilities between them. Madanlal,
the weaving expert, buys the fabrics, Rajendra monitors administration and
shipments and Dinesh, the youngest, watches over manufacturing and
marketing. Gokaldas specialises in outerwear, a quota-free item for which it
first secured orders in 1981. Today almost a third of the monthly production
of 500,000 garments is outerwear - jackets, coats and rainwear .
The fabrics used by the company have to be bought from Hong Kong or Taiwan.
The 30 per cent import component pushes up costs. 'We end up being more
expensive than our counterparts in China, Pakistan and Bangladesh,' says
Dinesh.
But in favour of Indian manufacturers is their willingness to take on
smaller orders and their dexterity in handling more complicated styles.
Procuring linen, viscose and cotton of reliable quality is a persistent
problem for Indian garment makers who depend on outdated mills and the
unorganised handloom sector for supplies. The odds they face - from
collecting yardage from dispersed weaving centres to coping with perennial
power cuts - call for tremendous co - ordination to ensure shipments are on
time. The Hindujas say that there is only one way to learn: by burning your
fingers.
Over the years the company has learnt a great deal about quality. Apart from
in-house checks, big shipments are certified by technicians from the buying
company before being dispatched. It has also invested in importing the
latest machines for sewing, buttonholing, fusing and embroidery. German
designers help Gokaldas put together its own collection four times a year.
Sales growth is now showing signs of a slowdown. This is due largely, says
Dinesh, to recession in western markets. 'People don't change their wardrobe
as often as they used to,' he says. The Hindujas have identified Russia and
South America as potential new markets. Both countries have no quota
restrictions.
The Hindujas are best known in the country for the 37-store Wearhouse
garment chain found in big cities. Their cousins run the rival Weekender
stores.
Buyers' preferences worldwide are veering towards environmentally friendly
garments. The intrepid export house is currently putting together a trial
consignment for its newest client, Marks &amp; Spencer.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (29): On a wing and a smile - Civil Aviation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY this year I arrived a few minutes late at Bombay Airport for an Indian
Airlines flight and was told to come back for the next flight the next day.
Though other passengers were still standing at the security check, I was not
allowed to join them.
Last month, I reached the airport 15 minutes before take-off and was
escorted on to the aircraft.
Few Indian industries have changed so fast since the onset of economic
liberalisation as aviation. Since private airlines started operating regular
services at the end of last year, the quality of air travel has changed out
of all recognition in India.
This shows how quickly competition can improve services even when the
private operators are small in comparison with the state-owned enterprise.
The most telling lesson has been the improvement in Indian Airlines' own
services.
'Competition is working. It is changing us,' says Mr K. Lal, commercial
director of Indian Airlines. 'They (the private companies) are not a threat
but a challenge. We have to show we are professionals.'
Indian Airlines has no time to lose, for the government last month allowed
foreign airlines to invest in India's private operators. Competition is
bound to hot up if the private companies are able to secure support from
foreign airlines, with their long experience of international service.
Already one company, Jet Airways, is seeking permission for Gulfair and
Kuwait Airways to invest in its expansion. Mr S. Kanungo, the civil aviation
ministry's top bureaucrat, called last month for foreign investment in the
aviation sector. He said such investment offered 'attractive returns,
particularly due to India's vast tourism potential and liberalisation
measures initiated in the past two years'.
Four airlines have emerged as serious rivals to Indian Airlines - Jet, East
West Airlines, Damiana Airways and Modiluft. Together they now have about 20
per cent of the domestic passenger market. But on the lucrative routes
between India's main cities their share is 37 per cent, according to Indian
Airlines' figures. The private operators will do even better as they bring
more aircraft into service. Modiluft, for example, has just two jets leased
from Lufthansa, the German carrier with which it has a collaboration
agreement.
Among the improvements pioneered by the private operators are on-time
flights, flexible check-in services, in-flight-drinks, top-class meals and
smiles from the cabin staff.
They have captured the imagination of travellers despite various
bureaucratic hurdles still in their way. The Air Corporation Act of 1953,
which bans private companies from operating scheduled services, is still in
force. It is due to be amended in parliament later this year. Until then,
the new companies cannot openly advertise their timetables.
One private airline owner complains: 'The government has given us permission
to operate to schedules, but we are still not allowed to advertise our
schedules. What's worse, we are misleadingly called 'air taxi operators'
even though we are for all purposes, full-fledged private airlines.'
MPs loyal to Indian Airlines and its powerful trade unions are fighting a
rearguard action to protect the airline. But they can at best delay change,
not reverse it. The real battle is now in the skies.
Indian Airlines, which lost Rs2.11bn in the year to last March and has not
made a profit since 1988, has little money to spend on a price war. So, as
Mr Lal says, it must improve quality.
The airline has improved its time-keeping. It has extended computerised
check-in facilities. It has introduced better food and drink services
(although it is not serving alcohol) and it has put staff through an
intensive course in service.
Mr Lal says that simple things make a big difference. He picks up a file and
holds it in front of him like a tray. You can serve drinks like this, he
says, with a scowl on his face. Or like this, his mouth opening into a broad
smile.
Then Mr Lal picks up the telephone. You can answer a call like this, he
says, growling into the receiver. Or you can answer it like this: 'Good
morning, this is Indian Airlines. How can I help you?'
Indian Airlines is also rethinking its marketing. It is introducing
long-distance fares which give passengers a discount if they travel the
whole way by Indian Airlines and is launching package holidays. It has
signed an agreement to join Mega Sierra, an international computerised
booking network. And it is planning a frequent flyer programme.
The airline can cope even with the possible advent of foreign airlines into
the domestic market, says Mr Lal. 'If foreign airlines are permitted to
compete, we would like to co-operate with foreign airlines too.'
The big cloud on Mr Lal's horizon is relations with the trade unions
representing the airline's 22,000 staff. For the last two years, the pilots
have called strikes in the winter in support of demands for better pay and
conditions. The pilots complain that their counterparts at other airlines
are more highly paid and want parity.
Last winter's strike cost the airline dearly because it gave the private
operators a free run at the market. Another strike this year could be
ruinous because the private airlines are now operating on a larger scale. Mr
Lal says: 'I look at the future and it looks bright, as long as this winter
passes off peacefully.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (30): Hope amidst the misery - The squalor
and splendour of Bombay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE seafront road outside the Taj Hotel, the grandest of Bombay's
Victorian palaces, small boys in rags run around passers-by selling
postcards. To single men, they offer their bodies. 'Just Rs200, sir. Rs100,
sir. Please, sir.'
Bombay combines the best and the worst of the changes which economic
modernisation is bringing to India. As the city has swollen into the
country's largest, so it has also become its richest. Land prices in central
Bombay are as high as Tokyo's. It has traffic jams to match.
Bombay has brought enormous wealth to the few. For others it has brought
nothing but misery. But even the poorest rarely go home because Bombay is
still a city of hope. In the villages from which people still pour into the
city there is often no chance of a paid job, no chance of betterment. In
Bombay, there is at least the possibility of work.
Even in the city's largest public laundry, where 5,000 washermen daily pound
clothes against stones with their hands, people think of the future. Mr
Bhachan Ram Kanojia, aged 35, says he has made enough money to send his 11
children to school. 'I am a dhobi (washerman). My father and my grandfather
were dhobis. But my children will do something better.'
Since independence, Bombay's population has soared from 2m to at least 9m -
the official total. Unofficial estimates put it at 11m. No-one can count
precisely the millions living in putrid slums or the tens of thousands who
sleep on pavements. As well as the people born in Maharashtra who lay first
claim to Bombay, the city is home to immigrants from all over India.
Bombay's heroes tend to be self-made men - entrepreneurs, criminal gang
lords, film stars. The city often turns a blind eye to dishonesty in the
knowledge that it is almost impossible to remain honest and become rich,
powerful or famous. Take for example Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at
the centre of last year's financial scandal, who has won and lost billions
of rupees. Once he had a sea-front flat with a mini-golf course and a fleet
of 29 cars. Now he has nothing. Yet when he was released from prison after
months of interrogation, crowds surrounded the jail gates to welcome him. He
is still planning his comeback.
Until this year, Bombay's people mostly believed that the city's enormous
energy would always pull it through the gravest hardships. But the
inter-religious riots which hit Bombay after the sacking of the Ayodhya
mosque tore through this complacency. A city which prided itself on its
cosmopolitan character was ripped apart by violence in which at least 700
died. A further 230 were killed by bombs in the world's biggest urban
terrorist attack.
Studies showed that as well as an explosion of Hindu-Moslem hatred, the
disturbances were fuelled by criminal and political groups trying to take
advantage of the unrest. Shiv Sena, a local militant Hindu political party,
was found to have played a part in organising the unrest. Moslem-led
underworld figures orchestrated the bombings.
In the aftermath of the violence, the police launched an unprecedented blitz
on the underworld, using the investigation into the bomb blasts as a
pretext. Mr Sharad Pawar, the chief minister of Maharashtra state which has
Bombay as its capital, has pledged to clean up the city, including the murky
links between politics and crime. But few Bombayites believe these ties will
completely disappear. Crime is too deeply embedded in the city's legitimate
business life.
Beyond the unease about politics and crime, the city also falls prey to
economic uncertainty. Even as high-speed growth in finance, in international
trade, advertising and other commercial services is creating white-collar
workers, the city's industrial employment is shrinking. With its high cost
of living, Bombay has become too expensive for factories. The number of
industrial workers in Bombay and its hinterland actually fell in the 1980s
by about 2m to 6m. With the closure of textile mills and other large plants,
registered unemployment in Maharashtra has soared to 3m, 20 times more than
in the 1960s.
Even foreign banks are finding Bombay too costly for their back-office
operations. ANZ Grindlays is transferring its computer centre and other
support departments to Bangalore and Madras because office space and housing
in Bombay are too expensive.
Cities in the developed world have passed through similar painful
transitions; London, New York and Paris all have problems with growing
numbers of low-skill unemployed. But in Bombay these problems are so much
more intense: people still go hungry.
Yet, Bombay would not be the city that it is if its residents dwelt long on
its dark side. Eight months after the riots and six months after the bomb
blasts, workmen are repairing the damaged buildings, the stock market is
strong, businessmen have returned to making money.
Life is as chaotic as ever - but normal. The talk of the financial community
this month has been plans by Reliance Industries, the textiles and chemicals
group, to launch India's biggest-ever share issue, Rs21.72bn, for a new
petroleum company.
The city fathers are planning to make their largest recent public investment
with water control barriers to prevent the floods which strike during almost
every monsoon. Even this huge project pales in comparison with the
investment the city actually needs in its buildings, roads, railways and
water pipes. But at least, a start is being made.
There will also be a hotel. And Bombay would not be Bombay if little boys
did not one day gather outside it as they do outside the Taj.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (28): When 13 is lucky - Profile, The Essar
Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NAAZNEEN KARMALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BROTHERS Shashikant and Ravikant Ruia are a superstitious pair. They
assiduously avoid travelling on the same aircraft, and 13, they believe, is
their lucky number. The corporate headquarters of their Essar Group - with
annual sales of Rs10bn - are housed on the 13th floor of an office block at
the Nariman Point, South Bombay's premium business district.
The global ambitions of Essar (a name derived from the brothers' first
initials) have borne fruit. With annual sales of Rs4.45bn, the group Essar
Gujarat operates the world's largest gas-based, hot briquetted sponge iron
plant (with an annual capacity of 1.76m tonnes), at Hazira, an industrial
township on the western coast. In August this year the company made its
debut in the international financial markets with a Dollars 75m Eurobond
issue that was oversubscribed seven times.
The next big venture is a Rs52,000m, 9m-tonne project in oil refining, an
area recently thrown open to India's private sector. Additionally, Essar has
put in bids for exploration of 13 oil blocks of which two are in partnership
with Occidental Petroleum of the US. Essar has the experience. Two years ago
it won onshore drilling contracts from Shell in Oman and Petromina in
Indonesia.
The Ruias belong to a breed of nimble-footed businessmen who over the past
decade have risen from oblivion to the front ranks of Indian business,
displaying more dynamism than old established groups such as Tata and Birla.
Starting with a small inherited shipping agency exporting iron ore in the
early 1970s from their base in Badras, the Ruias moved into marine
construction and offshore support services and then further afield. Today,
group gross fixed assets are Rs41.8bn, net profits collectively Rs2.3bn and
market capitalisation Rs40bn.
All this is generated from four core areas: steel, shipping, oil and
services. These fit in nicely, they say, with the country's core sector,
national priorities and their own competencies. In the past, critics have
pointed to the Ruias' skill in winning friends in high places. The state Oil
and Natural Gas commission has been a loyal customer for drilling rigs and
offshore supply vessels, for example.
Such assured custom cannot be expected in the more open markets of the
1990s. The Ruias say they are ready for competition since international
market dynamics have always dictated their businesses. The aim, explains
younger brother Ravi Ruia, has been 'to create worldscale capacities and
absolutely ensure that we have a competitive edge on a global basis'.
The Ruias display a keen entrepreneurial instinct for spotting a good
business opportunity - even in fields that they are unfamiliar with. This
brashness has been more than matched by their ability to learn fast. In
marine construction, Essar started out as a contractor for Brown &amp; Root and
ended up as an equal partner with the marine engineering company when they
jointly undertook construction of an underwater pipeline from Bombay High
oilfield to the coast of Gujarat.
Much of their fleet of bulk carriers and offshore vessels were picked up
when shipping was at an ebb and prices down and two years ago the Ruia
bought into the profitable South India Shipping Company in which they now
hold a 30 per cent stake.
Their hunch that economic growth would fuel demand for steel prompted their
decision to get into sponge iron, an alternative raw material to expensive,
imported scrap. The plant was picked up from Emden of Germany at a bargain
price of DM27m (Pounds 10.80m) and put up in a record 24 months.
From this followed a downstream plunge into hot rolled coils, a form of
semi-finished steel for export markets.
The brothers are moving further downstream having set up Steelco, a joint
venture with another private group for the manufacture of cold rolled coils.
Similar joint projects are being planned in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Saudi
Arabia.
This global focus has not made them lose sight of the domestic market. 'This
is our base. India itself offers tremendous opportunities. And
liberalisation has only opened up new areas for us,' says Ravi Ruia.
Essar has entered the growing financial services industry with its company
India Securities which offers lease financing and bill discounting among a
range of activities. The group is also building a 350MW power project in
Surat, in Gujarat, which will be for captive use for its steel plant.
All these ambitions add up to a mammoth investment of Rs100,000m over the
next five years. The group has relied on equity rather than expensive debt.
Since 1985 the Essar group has mopped up Rs17,260m from half a dozen issues.
The brothers have responded to criticism that the group is too centralised
with a management restructuring last year. A profit centre system was put
into place wherein authority was devolved to division heads.
But Essar remains a family affair. Five years ago Shashi Ruia's son Prashant
Ruia, a commerce graduate was drawn into the business and is now in charge
of Essar Oil. The brothers say they have a perfect understanding in the
workplace (Shashi is the operational man and Ravi assesses new projects)
where they sit at opposite ends of the boardroom-sized corner office that
they share. 'We can't think without each other,' says Ravi.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (27): The furnace gets hotter - Steel makers
face escalating competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR A sector whose product pricing and distribution were for so long tightly
controlled by the federal government, India's steel industry has been quick
to respond to the free market challenge following the lifting of controls in
January last year.
Imports of steel have become easier with the lowering of duty across the
board and the government is likely to reduce the import tariff even further
in the next budget.
The Steel Authority of India Limited (Sail), a state undertaking, and Tata
Iron and Steel Company (Tisco), which in the past operated in a highly
protected market, are putting as much effort into selling steel as producing
it.
Fears that the main producers such as Sail and Tisco would raise steel
prices sharply following decontrol have been proved wrong. Relaxation of
prices and distribution coincided with the domestic recession in the demand
for steel which meant steel prices could not be raised arbitrarily.
Moreover, Indian manufacturers are now competing in the domestic market with
imported products.
'The Indian steel industry can no longer operate on a cost plus basis,' says
B. Muthuraman, director of marketing of Tisco. 'It will have to protect its
margins by improving operational efficiency and controlling costs. The
consumer now has the option of importing anything. The domestic industry
knows it could be outpriced by imported material.'
While Indian producers have so far withstood competition from imports, they
also have succeeded in raising export sharply from 380,000 tonnes in 1991-92
to 900,000 tonnes in 1992-93.
Exports are expected to rise to 2.37m tonnes in the current year. According
to the ministry of steel, export income from steel in 1993-94 will be
Rs17bn, while imports will cost Rs16.95bn, making India a net exporter of
steel.
U. K. Mittal, executive director of Sail, said the sharp rise in exports
could be attributed to the large-scale buying of steel by China and the
devaluation of the Indian currency. China has, however, recently reduced its
steel imports. 'We are aware of the risk of depending too much on a single
market. We think we should be able to find buyers in West Asia and Taiwan,'
Mr Mittal said.
Tisco has taken a different approach. Instead of heavy dependence on China,
it has nursed markets such as west Asia, Taiwan, Thailand, Sri Lanka and
Nepal. Tisco's Mr Muthuraman said India should progressively reduce the
shipment of billets and raise the export of value added items such as wire
rods, structurals and plates.
India is not aiming to be a leader in the international steel trade. Its
export target is about 5m tonnes of steel by the turn of the century when
domestic demand for the metal will be 30m tonnes, against about 18m tonnes
now. The focus for exports will be the Pacific Rim countries where the
demand for steel is expected to grow fast.
With the throwing open of the Indian market to imports the indigenous
industry is finding it needs to pull itself into shape.
There is a 'substantial overhang of obsolete technology and equipment in the
Indian steel industry, resulting in a relatively higher cost of production
and a product quality short of international standards,' says Dr J. J.
Irani, managing director of Tisco.
Controls on integrated plants using the blast furnace route of steel
production meant sufficient resources could not be generated to modernise
and expand. As a result, the industry has not been able to benefit from
technological breakthroughs in steelmaking.
The Indian industry which until the mid-1960s was highly cost competitive,
now uses 50 to 100 per cent more energy than steel producers elsewhere.
Energy inefficient open hearth furnaces need to be replaced by basic oxygen
furnaces while the share of the highly cost-effective continuous casting
method needs to be greatly increased from the present 25 per cent.
Indian blast furnaces now produce 1.2 tonnes per cubic metre of steel
compared with the world average of 2 tonnes.
Dr Irani believes a 30 per cent improvement in productivity over a five-year
period would permit production of an extra 4m tonnes of hot metal from
existing Indian blast furnaces.
Sail's seven-year Rs150bn capital expenditure programme and Tisco's phase
III modernisation and capacity expansion to 3.05m tonnes by 1995 will
eliminate many of the weaknesses of integrated steel plants. But low labour
productivity and overmanning of steel plants will remain a problem. Indian
productivity is 30 to 85 ingot tonnes per man per year, against about 400
ingot tonnes per man per year in efficient steel-producing countries.
As a result, India is not able to take full advantage of its cheap labour.
Rationalisation of the labour force will be possible only when the federal
government has mustered the courage to introduce its much debated exit
policy.
Controls have also created serious distortions in the secondary steel sector
which includes units making steel in electric arc furnaces (EAFs).
EAFs are normally used to produce high value special and alloy steel. In
India, however, EAF units, which were not covered by price and distribution
controls, took the easy route of producing mild steel. EAF units account for
more than 30 per cent of the Indian steel industry's capacity of 26m tonnes.
The removal of controls has played havoc with the EAF units. 'Nearly 50 per
cent of EAF capacity is lying closed,' Mr Alak Saha, joint director of
marketing at Tisco, said. 'The EAF units can no longer indulge in the luxury
of using imported scrap and expensive power to make mild steel. Only the
ones producing special and alloy steel such as Mukund and Mahindra Ugine
will survive in the long run.'
Before the introduction of reforms, the state sector was the force driving
the creation of steelmaking capacity. Now the federal government says that,
except for modernising existing plants, it will not invest in new steel
projects.
But India needs to produce a lot more steel. Its per capita consumption is
only 25 kg against the world average of more than 150 kg. The government has
identified 25 sites in 10 states where the private sector can set up new
steel plants incorporating the latest technologies.
The private sector has come up with 16 major investment proposals, the most
ambitious being the 3m tonne capacity steel plant to be set up by the Caparo
Group of the UK at Daitari in Orissa.
Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of Caparo Group, says: 'We will bring the latest
technologies to India. Ours will be a model project.'
The steel ministry says these projects will see the light of day provided
they are offered a suitable package of incentives, including the import of
plants and machinery at a low rate of duty and exemption from tax in the
first few years of production. The finance ministry has to nod in agreement.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (26): Lights are going out all over India -
Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DAY after day, India's city-dwellers are reminded of the country's desperate
need for power. In the summer months, when temperatures can soar as high as
45 degrees celsius, air-conditioners shudder to a halt, rooms are plunged
into darkness, and those industries which cannot afford to run their own
generators grind to a standstill for yet another power cut.
Not even the Prime Minister or the usually-pampered VIPs escaped the power
cuts in New Delhi this summer. Much to the embarrassment of the authorities,
Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's home was without electricity for several
hours. Other residents of Delhi were deprived of power for much longer and
more frequently: they showed their displeasure more visibly by beating up
employees of the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU).
Acute power shortages afflict much of urban India in the summer months. The
power sector simply cannot meet the combined demands of India's industrial,
agricultural and residential consumers as investment in the power sector has
failed to keep pace with the country's economic development.
India has installed capacity of 72,000 megawatts (MW) and the government
expects to add a further 31,000MW in its 1992-97 economic plan. But even
then, it estimates that by the end of 1997 shortfalls in energy will range
from 9 to 21 per cent. As the government cannot afford to meet all of the
country's power requirements itself, it decided in 1991 to encourage private
sector participation in new power generation and distribution projects,
wooing investors with an array of financial incentives. These include a
five-year tax holiday on profits and lower duties for the import of power
equipment.
Even so, the private sector has been quite slow to sign up. The individual
state governments have offered power projects amounting to more than
33,000MW in capacity to private sector companies. But, while the private
investors are clearly interested in some of the proposals, they still have a
number of concerns.
At present, 46 coal, gas and hydro-electricity projects are being discussed,
with a total capacity of 25,120MW and involving an investment of about
Rs760bn (about Dollars 25bn). Among the foreign participants who have either
signed agreements, or who are close to doing so, are Cogentrix and Enron
Power of the US, and Siemens of Germany. Power officials have been busy with
roadshows around Asia, the Middle East, the UK and the US in the hope of
drumming up more overseas interest in power projects.
Foreign investors have been pushing the government for additional work. The
decision to turn to the private sector, however, ignores the simple fact
that India has plenty of scope to improve its existing power generation and
distribution system.
'Instead of investing money in new projects they should improve the
efficiency of the existing plants,' says Mr Shekhar Singh, an environment
expert at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, who says that
'huge' savings are possible.
Some effort is being made to do this by renovating and modernising power
plants and distribution systems. However, one senior official in the
Ministry of Power expressed disappointment at the lack of private sector
interest in such renovation projects, even though, he claims, 'investors
would be putting in less money than for new projects plus they would see a
higher return: there's less risk involved and less money up-front'.
But as one foreign company which specialises in this area says: 'it makes
considerable sense to increase the effectiveness of installed equipment; but
while renovating plants will increase supply, it won't fill the gap.'
Energy experts point out that India needs to do more to improve the
efficiency of the distribution network provided by the SEBs. More than a
fifth of transmission and distribution losses in India are due to stealing
and inefficiency - a poor record by international standards.
'Electricity has been handled as a social commodity meant to be doled out in
exchange for votes - it's either subsidised or free', says Mr SV Joshi,
director of the power generation and distribution systems division at
Siemens, India.
In some states, including Tamil Nadu, farmers receive free electricity
because the cost of collecting exceeds the amount due. While in a big city
such as Calcutta, the private-sector Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation
collects 92 per cent of its revenues within 15 days of them falling due, in
the rural areas revenue collection is far more difficult to conduct.
'Twenty years ago, agriculture only consumed about 18 per cent of the power
supply: today it accounts for 42 per cent of consumption,' says Mr N. Ramji,
joint secretary at the Ministry of Power's Investment Promotion Cell. Most
of that is used in irrigation schemes, in areas such as the Punjab and Uttar
Pradesh. Many slum-dwellers simply steal electricity by hooking up to
overhead cables.
Many of the SEBs, which are responsible for generation and distribution,
have a reputation for being poorly managed, overmanned, and corrupt. The
Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, recently reported that the SEB in the
state of Bihar was so overstaffed with 42,000 employees that 80 per cent of
its budget was spent on staff salaries. Bihar may be one of the worst
examples, but officials admit privately that many of the SEBs need to
improve their performance. The problem is that traditionally the public
sector has been reluctant to rationalise through job-cuts, a sensitive
issue.
The final way in which India might improve its energy use is through
conservation and the use of more energy-efficient equipment, in the home,
the factory, and the field. Solar powered irrigation pumps have only
recently been introduced in Rajasthan, and environmentalists are keen to see
wider use of solar energy.
DESU has billboard announcements and advertisements imploring people not to
consume too much electricity, though the request to turn off
air-conditioning in summer probably falls on deaf ears.
Environmentalists argue that what is needed is a pricing system which
discourages the use of electricity at peak times, and which reflects the
actual cost of the electricity supply. 'Electricity is far too cheap, there
are no incentives to save it' complains Mr Singh.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (25): Cars by the million - Profile, Maruti
is a showpiece company, with a Japanese flavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE factory of Maruti Udyog, India's largest auto maker, is a showpiece of
Indian industry. The company, a joint venture between the government and
Japan's Suzuki Motor, builds cars to Japanese designs, using Japanese
equipment and a liberal sprinkling of imported Japanese parts. Seven
Japanese engineers are on hand to give advice. If India cannot make
world-class vehicles here, it will find it difficult to make them anywhere.
Since the plant went into production 10 years ago, nearly 1m cars have
rolled off the production lines at the purpose-built factory outside Delhi.
Over time, the Japanese content of the best-selling model - a cheap and
cheerful 800cc compact - has fallen from over 90 per cent to just 5-6 per
cent. Maruti 800s have been sold abroad, albeit in small quantities, not
just to developing countries but also to France and Italy.
Nevertheless, even with a decade's experience behind them, Maruti managers
are unable fully to convince their customers that they have reached
world-standards in quality. Mr R C Bhargava, the managing director, admits
that in the second-hand market older Marutis, with a higher Japanese
content, command a premium over newer cars. He says: 'Our cars are 90 per
cent as good as the cars made by Suzuki in Japan, We want to reach their
level but are not there yet.' The commitment to quality is visible in the
factory. Japanese-style slogans hang over the production lines - 'Let's work
together and achieve our goals,' says one. 'Fight absenteeism,' says
another. Boards on the walls give detailed information on quality
performance, with the numbers up-dated every day.
No-one pretends that the factory has reached Japanese levels of efficiency.
The lines do not move as fast or as smoothly as in Japan. Around the factory
components are piled high in boxes awaiting assembly.
Just-in-time manufacturing is impossible given the slowness of the Indian
transport network. Nevertheless, as far as in-house production is concerned,
the gap between India and Japan is slowly being closed by training: every
year, about 100 Maruti workers spend six months working in Japan. One
engineer says the main thing they learn is not technical knowledge but
Japanese work habits. 'You can see the difference.'
The factory has an engine plant - but virtually all the other components,
including key items such as steering and transmission systems, are bought
from outside suppliers. From the earliest days, deficiencies in quality
often originated from defective parts - and they still do. To raise quality,
Maruti has invested in six joint ventures with suppliers of all its key
components - to secure a managerial voice in the running of their
operations. Mr Bhargava says that improving the quality of bought-in
components has been 'the major effort all these years'.
Production costs are also a concern for Mr Nandy. At an ex-factory cost of
about Rs106,000 (166,000 on-the-road with taxes), Maruti 800s are cheap by
world standards. The price is kept down partly in response to pressure from
the government which would like to put the car within the reach of as many
Indians as possible. So profits are squeezed. Maruti made just Rs366m
pre-tax profit in the year to March 1993 on sales of Rs22.22bn.
Until now, Maruti has had the luxury of operating in a market with very
limited competition. Its main rivals have been restricted by India's
autarchic industrial policies from importing technology to modernise their
output. For example, the venerable Ambassador, made by Hindustan Motor, is
little different from the 1950s Morris Oxford on which it is based. Premier
Auto, in Bombay, makes models based on 1960s and 1970s Fiats. Not
surprisingly, Maruti has over 70 per cent of the auto market. It sells every
car it makes with little marketing. Often customers must pay in advance and
wait two or three months for delivery.
With the liberalisation of the Indian economy, Maruti could now face real
competition. Earlier this year, Delhi removed government controls on
investment in the auto industry. Hindustan Motor is talking to General
Motors of the US about manufacturing the Astra model and Premier is planning
a link with Peugeot of France.
But Maruti has plenty of time to prepare for the onslaught. Its rivals'
plans are some way from fruition. Also, they concentrate on mid-sized cars -
not direct competitors to the Maruti 800.
In the meantime, Maruti is in the midst of expanding its plant capacity from
130,000 cars a year to 250,000 in two or three years. It is also enlarging
its model range - as well as the staple Maruti 800, the factory has for
several years also made jeeps and small minibuses. Three years ago it
launched a 1000cc mid-sized car and this year it introduced a sporty-looking
1000cc compact, which will be by far the fastest home-made car on Indian
roads. The launch of the new car called the Zen has created a big stir in
India, even though only 2,000 will be made before next March and all these
cars have been sold.
Maruti is also planning a modest expansion in exports. It has been exporting
since the mid-1980s, with a peak of 23,000 vehicles in 1991-92, falling to
14,600 last year. Mr Bhargava says the main purpose has not been to increase
sales, though export revenues have been very welcome, but to raise quality
by exposing Maruti to foreign competition.
Indeed, so satisfied are Suzuki's Japanese managers with the improvements in
the quality of Maruti's exports that next year they intend to sell the Zen
car in Europe under the Suzuki label, a first for an Indian-made car.

Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corp. of India

LIKE India itself, the Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India
is slowly moving out of its shell, writes STEFAN WAGSTYL.
Its history reflects the economic history of post-independence India. It was
established in the 1950s with capital from private financial institutions in
order to channel long-term funds into private industry in the best tradition
of a development bank. In the late 1960s and 1970s it drifted into the
public sector as its main shareholders were nationalised.
In the 1980s, it hesitantly began to look at new ventures, as the government
gradually began to encourage greater private initiative. Today, it is
hurrying to take advantage of government reforms.
'From a long-term lender, we are emerging into a comprehensive financial
services group,' says Mr N Vaghul, the chairman who has led the bank since
1985. Like other energetic business leaders of his generation, Mr Vaghul,
who is 56, is in a man in a hurry. He acts as if he has to make up for the
time lost when socialist-inclined planners ruled the economy.
Mr Vaghul says that the biggest change of the last two years for ICICI is
the decline in the state-owned institutions' share of the ownership from 82
per cent to 35 per cent. 'The most important thing is that we have acquired
500,000 shareholders.' At the same time, Mr Vaghul is presiding over a rapid
expansion of business activities: ICICI, the core company, is diversifying
from long-term loans into leasing, short-term loans and asset-based credit.
SCICI, or the Shipping Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India, an
affiliate which was set up to finance shipping and fisheries, is also
turning into general purpose finance.
The group has moved into investment banking with ICICI Securities and
Finance Company - a 60:40 joint venture signed earlier this year with JP
Morgan, the US investment bank. ICICI is also launching an asset management
company which will manage mutual funds and is planning a stock broking
business.
It is expanding a venture capital business which started in the late 1980s
and next year is launching a commercial bank.
ICICI's revenues have been growing at more than 30 per cent a year to
Rs14.9bn in the year to the end of March. Pre-tax profits totalled Rs2.3bn,
including profits from capital gains. The bulk of revenue comes from
lending. The capital reserves total Rs12.06bn, enough to sustain assets of
Rs123bn and yet keep a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 11.7 per cent.
Despite the decline in the share of state-owned institutions in the equity
capital, Mr Vaghul maintains close links with the government. He says ICICI
has 'relative autonomy'.
Western bankers might frown at such a cosy relationship. But their
colleagues from Japan and other east Asian countries would find ICICI a very
familiar animal.

Investment from Britain

LIKE unwilling guests at a feast, they are reluctant to come to the table.
Even when they do, they don't really want to taste the delicacies.
This just about sums up the attitude of Indians to overtures by the Indian
government to invest in their motherland.
Chinese success is in complete contrast to the Indian experience. 'India can
never become China,' said Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, after
a recent meeting with London's wealthy NRIs (or non-resident Indians).
'Unfortunately, there are not too many Indians flourishing outside India.
Besides, the Chinese programme began in the 1970s. We started much later.
Even in 1986, the reform programme was very limited. Today we have a greater
canvas.'
But its colours may not be rich enough. The lack of seriously wealthy people
is just one factor. Lack of industrial entrepreneurship is a greater hurdle.
Almost without exception, Indian businessmen who come to the UK - both from
India and East Africa - start out as traders and shopkeepers. Many get into
real estate. Some into catering and hotels. Few are able to change their
mind-set.
'If they find it difficult to make the transition from being a trader to an
industrialist in the UK, how can they do so in India?' asks Mr Raj Kumar
Bagri, chairman of the Pounds 350m Metdist Group and the London Metal
Exchange.
Mr Bagri is one of the very few NRIs to have jumped this barrier - in
rags-to-riches style. He reached London with Pounds 2,000 in his pocket in
1959. Today there are Metdist offices in the UK, India, Canada, Nigeria and
Malaysia, though the group's biggest manufacturing concerns are in Malaysia,
where it runs a 85,000 tonnes a year copper rod and wire mill and a highly
sophisticated Dollars 50m integrated copper tube plant supplying the air
conditioning industry.
Lack of industrial entrepreneurship is compounded by a perceptible lack of
interest in India among second generation immigrants. Brought up in the UK,
this jeans generation is not bound to India by the same feelings as their
parents. Increasingly they will be responsible for investment decisions.
Some have already stepped into top management, others are waiting in the
wings. Most simply do not want the hassle of learning about and dealing with
a notoriously difficult country.
'Once I am out of the picture, I doubt if my sons will have the same
enthusiasm for India which I have,' acknowledges Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of
the Caparo Group, a privately owned Pounds 330m steel products group.
Mr Paul, 61, emigrated from India to the UK in 1966. Today, his three sons
run the 17-company business on a day-to-day basis.
Over the past 10 years, Mr Paul has proposed - unsuccessfully - several
major projects in India, including a Rs7.5bn fertiliser plant at
Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh and the Rs60bn rehabilitation of the Indian Iron
and Steel Co at Burnpur, West Bengal.
Unperturbed by his failures, his latest ambition is to build a Rs64bn 1.5m
tonne a year integrated steel plant at Daitari, in Orissa. 'I would prefer a
smaller project in India, say one requiring just Dollars 1-Dollars 2m. I
love India, but sometimes I wonder why we are wasting time there,' says Mr
Angad Paul, 23, revealing the enormous gap between his father's ambitions
and his own. Currently, Paul junior is cutting his business teeth by setting
up a small plastic extrusion plant in the UK.
On occasions when parents do gain the support of their progenies for Indian
adventures, NRIs find they are unable to cut though India's thick red tape.
'The spirit of reforms has yet to percolate through the bureaucracy and to
state governments. A core of dedicated civil servants must be identified if
foreign investment is to increase,' says Mr Gopichand Hinduja, one of the
four brothers who founded the estimated Pounds 1bn Hinduja Group. The mainly
trading conglomerate already runs India's second largest truck manufacturer
(Ashok Leyland) and hopes to promote a power plant, an oil refinery, a
lubricants company and a financial services firm in India, besides enhancing
Ashok Leyland's product range.
While local Indians take petty hassles in their stride, dealing with the
Indian bureaucracy is much more frustrating for NRIs who commute thousands
of miles between their headquarters and India.
'Despite liberalisation, the implementation of any project in India is still
like entering a hurdle race when it comes to sorting out details with state
and local authorities on infrastructure, local taxes and related issues,' '
says Mr Bagri. 'You have to take India on trust.' Mr Bagri has certainly
done so. His project is one of a handful which may take off shortly. These
include:
a Rs2bn 150,000 tonnes a year copper smelter and refinery by the Metdist
Group. The plant will simultaneously produce 450,000 tonnes a year of
byproducts and sulphuric acid. It will also have its own power station. a
Rs60bn 2x500 megawatt thermal power station to be developed by the Hinduja
Group in collaboration with UK's National Power.
Located at Vishakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, the project is at an advanced
stage. a Rs1.86bn 200,000 tonnes a year cold rolled sheets and coils plant
by the Comcratt Group. Located at Palej, Gujarat, the plant is ready for
commissioning.
The pitifully small number of projects highlights the fact that out of the
approximately 820,000 Indians living in the UK, few have the ability, the
money or the interest to invest in India's future.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (22): A time for consolidation - Foreign
institutions scent rich pickings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN financial companies sniff rich pickings in India. But they are wary
of the time it might take to profit from the country's growing appetite for
financial services.
Indian businessmen are in some ways ideal potential clients for world-class
financial services, because India already has a fairly extensive range of
financial products.
In practice, newcomers face serious difficulties: Indian regulators are
steadily dismantling the restrictive controls which have cramped the
financial markets, but they are often hesitant.
The pace of change has been slowed by last year's scandal in the Bombay
securities market, in which money was illegally siphoned out of banks in the
stock market using fake documents. In particular, the Reserve Bank of India,
the central bank, was generally favourably disposed towards foreign banks.
But the foreign banks' role in the scandal has made the reserve bank very
cautious about promoting the interests of foreign companies.
Banking is the one section of the financial markets where foreign groups
have been allowed to operate throughout the period in which India closed its
economic doors to the rest of the world.
The former British colonial banks - Standard Chartered Bank, Grindlays Bank
(now ANZ Grindlays) and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - as well
as Citibank of the US and about 20 other foreign banks were permitted to
remain under foreign control even when domestic banks were nationalised.
However, their expansion was severely restricted, so they now have a small
fraction of the market.
Nevertheless, by offering better services than local banks and access to
foreign financial networks, foreign banks have established a lucrative
position at the top end of the market for both corporate and individual
customers. India's regulated interest rate structure - which guaranteed
banks large spreads - brought easy profits.
But the onset of financial deregulation, including interest rate reform, is
cutting those margins and forcing banks to expand value-added services.
Also, the uncertainty caused by economic reform has made many Indian
companies wary about borrowing money, so loan demand is slack. But the
restructuring of many companies has increased the need for other services,
such as merchant banks.
Mr Barry McCance, who heads the Indian operations of ANZ Grindlays, says
this is a period of consolidation for foreign banks as they deal with the
aftermath of the scandal. He believes they have important competitive
advantages, notably access to expert expatriate staff, the ability to train
Indian staff overseas and bring the latest products into India.
The reserve bank has recently invited entrepreneurs to apply for permission
to establish new privately-owned banks in India. No large foreign financial
services group has applied. But several foreign financial groups have
started to establish themselves in other areas.
For example, in stockbroking, Jardine Fleming, the UK/Hong Kong investment
banking group, last year opened an office in Bombay, which now has about 25
staff.
Other stockbroking groups which have set up shop in India include James
Capel of the UK, W I Carr, the broking arm of Banque Indo-Suez of France,
and Nomura Securities from Japan.
The brokers are closely watching the activities of foreign financial
institutions which have been permitted to invest directly in the Indian
stock market since last year. About 55 institutions have been approved, with
many more candidates in the pipeline. However, only about six are actively
investing in the market.
A handful of foreign financial companies have invested in joint ventures or
cooperation agreements with Indian partners. This year, GE Capital, a
subsidiary of General Electric of the US, has set up a joint venture in
consumer finance with Housing Development Finance Corporation, a public
sector mortgage bank. J P Morgan, the US investment bank, has signed a joint
venture in financial services, including merchant banking, with Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a part-private part-public
development bank.
Two Hong Kong-based financial services groups have also forged similar
tie-ups - Asian Capital Partners with the Industrial Development Bank of
India and Peregrine Investments with ITC Classic Financial Services and
Enterprises, an affiliate of ITC, which is in turn a subsidiary of BAT
Industries, the diversified British group.
Fund management is also attracting foreign interest because India is ending
the near-monopoly enjoyed by the Unit Trust of India. Two US groups have
signed agreements with Indian partners - Pioneer Management Corporation with
the Investment Trust of India and Alliance Capital Management with the
Investment Trust of India. In insurance, Sun Life of the UK has a joint
venture with the Life Insurance Company of India to sell life insurance to
Indians living in Britain. It plans a similar partnership in India.
Not all the investments are new. Among merchant banks, Lazard Brothers of
the UK has had a stake since 1985 in Creditcapital Finance Corporation, a
joint venture with Mr Udayan Bose, a banker and Creditcapital's chairman.
Creditcapital now employs 200 people in corporate advisory services.
However, it has taken Mr Bose eight years to reach his present position near
the top of the Indian merchant banking market. Newcomers cannot expect to
join him very quickly. Apart from the official regulatory restrictions,
there are numerous unofficial and informal barriers. For example, the Bombay
Stock Exchange, dominated by individual brokers, has only this year admitted
its first corporate member. Foreign corporate membership is still some way
off.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (20): Half-baked solutions feared - The
shape of financial reform is still unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If India's economic reforms make progress anywhere in the next year, it will
be in the financial markets.
Officials at the finance ministry and at the Reserve Bank of India, bankers,
brokers and businessmen all expect to see changes in the next few months.
But they differ greatly about what the impact of those changes will be.
While there is little doubt that policymakers are committed to further
financial liberalisation, there is serious concern among pro-reform
financiers that the government may stop short of creating fully-fledged open
markets.
They fear that India could be left in an economic half-way house in which
the government-owned banks and other public sector institutions will
continue to have the upper hand in their dealings with private companies.
Last year's Rs40bn securities market scandal, in which brokers siphoned
funds illegally out of banks for stock market investments, has reinforced
the belief that the government will be very reluctant to give the private
sector a free rein.
As Mr N. Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India, says: 'Policy reform is going very well. In a few
months it will be completed. But there is a serious problem with the
institutions. I don't see the government having the courage to reform them.'
India's financial markets are a curious hybrid. There are pockets of raw
capitalism such as the Bombay Stock Exchange, with its total market
capitalisation of Dollars 70bn, where the brokers are largely a law unto
themselves. Leasing, merchant banking (loosely defined), gold, silver and
diamond trading are also mostly pursued with little interference from the
authorities.
But all this rumbustious money-making, reminiscent of 19th century Britain
or early 20th century America, goes on around the underskirts of large
publicly-owned institutions, which have operated in one of the tightest
regulatory regimes in the non-communist world.
Bringing some order into this jungle requires three main changes: firstly,
the stock market must be brought under regulatory control without being
stifled; next, markets dominated by public institutions must be opened to
private competitors, including foreign companies; finally, public
institutions must be prepared for competition, including banks, which need
to be cleared of the bad debts accumulated during years of operating on
non-commercial lines. And these changes must be carried out without
jeopardising growth.
The reform-minded government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao has gone a considerable
way with stock market reform. Laws have been passed to increase investor
protection, ban insider trading and promote greater transparency.
The Securities and Investment Board of India, the watchdog organisation
established last year, has set about its job more vigorously than expected.
To the annoyance of stockbrokers, it is delving deep into the workings of
Bombay Stock Exchange, trying to enforce open market rules - such as
transparent pricing.
It wants brokers to give clients information about commission and other
payment details. It has also proposed an ambitious plan for computerised
futures and options trading to replace the present informal forward market
called badla in which brokers carry forward own-account and clients'
speculative positions using funds borrowed from other clients at rates of up
to 25 per cent. Badla transactions account for 75-85 per cent of all trades
 -creating considerable opportunity for brokers to manipulate prices.
Brokers are in a quandary. To fend off SEBI's attack, they are making
counter-proposals including plans for computerised trading and settlement
and a centralised depository. But such plans would cost a great deal of
money. The exchange is divided between some of its larger member firms,
which support modernisation because of the efficiencies it would bring, and
other firms, including many small ones, which seem to prefer to carry on in
traditional ways.
One consideration is the interests of foreign institutional investors, which
have since last year been permitted to invest directly in Indian shares
instead of through a limited number of country funds. So far, 56 funds have
secured licences, though fewer than 10 have been active investors. As India
wants foreign capital, it will have to take care that they are treated
fairly by brokers and other intermediaries.
The government is also committed to increasing competition in markets
dominated by state-controlled institutions. In fund management, it is
chipping away at the near-monopoly enjoyed by the Unit Trust of India, a
mutual fund group with 90,000 agents and 30m accounts throughout India.
SEBI has this year cleared 14 private sector groups to launch funds. UTI is
responding to the competitive threat by agreeing with Alliance Capital, the
US fund management group, jointly to launch an Indian mutual fund.
In insurance, a committee that is expected to report to the finance ministry
soon is almost certain to recommend ending the monopolies enjoyed by LIC and
GIC. Among foreign insurers, Sun Life of the UK has already established ties
with LIC under which the two companies jointly sell life insurance to
Indians living in Britain. They plan to establish a second joint venture in
India. But it could take time before there is genuine competition.
Like most Indian publicly-owned institutions, UTI, LIC and GIC are
over-staffed and under-computerised. But their problems pale in comparison
with the country's banks, where the government and the reserve bank face the
greatest challenge - and where they are likely to fall furthest short of
creating genuinely competitive commercial markets.
Since 1991, the authorities have gone some way towards liberalising interest
rates, abolishing a complex multi-rate interest structure and keeping just
three rates - a maximum deposit rate (now 10 per cent), a concessional
lending rate for small loans (12 per cent) and a minimum lending rate for
other loans of 15 per cent.
The amount of enforced lending from banks to the government has been
reduced, albeit modestly. Until 1991, banks had to deposit with the
government 38.5 per cent of their deposits and another 25 per cent with the
reserve bank. Now these figures have dropped to 34.7 and 14.6 per cent. The
plan is to cut them again to 25 and 10 per cent.
The rationalisation of the interest rate structure and compulsory deposit
ratios have given banks slightly more room for manoeuvre, releasing more
funds for commercial lending. But distortions remain - for instance, on a
small loan banks are obliged to charge at least 3 percentage points less
than on a large one. In countries with relatively open banking systems,
small borrowers usually pay a large premium over big corporations.
Moreover, the government has expressed no wish to reform a much greater
restriction on banks' activities - an obligation to advance at least 40 per
cent of credit to politically-favoured sectors, including farmers and small
businesses. As a result, others must pay more for credit.
However, distortions in credit policy pale in comparison with the weaknesses
of the banks themselves. The 28 nationalised banks, with 40,000 branches,
accounting for over 90 per cent of total bank assets, employ too many people
and too little technology. State Bank of India, the largest, says 28 per
cent of its 8,738 branches lose money. The 200 regional rural banks with
15,000 branches are even worse off.
Both the national and the rural banks were encouraged to expand rapidly in
the backward regions of India by the government. The result is a massive
backlog of bad debt, accumulated because too little regard was paid to
credit quality. Mr C. Rangarajan, the central bank governor, says: 'At the
moment the (capital) base of banks is weak according to the norms we have
laid down.'
The central bank has this year introduced rules requiring banks to account
fully for bad debts. As at the end of March 1993, it estimates bad debts of
the national banks totalled Rs100-110bn. Others put the figure as high as
Rs220bn. Rural banks' bad debts could raise the total to Rs270bn.
The government, which has injected Rs40bn in the past to bail out banks, is
this year putting in a further Rs57bn. But without even more, the banks will
be unable to make full provision for debts. Nor will they be able to meet
international capital adequacy norms laid down by the Bank for International
Settlements. Banks with international operations have until March 1995 to
meet the BIS's requirement of a minimum ratio of capital to assets of 8 per
cent. Other banks have until March 1996.
In order to fund their needs, banks are being urged to go to the capital
market. The State Bank of India is planning to raise Rs20bn later this year,
in a move which will reduce the state's ownership stake from 98 per cent to
70-75 per cent. However, SBI is a particularly well managed institution.
Others will be unable to attract private shareholders.
Mr D. Basu, the SBI chairman, says there will be mergers among banks. Yet he
doubts whether they will lead to greater efficiency since banks will not be
free to close branches rapidly or cut staff. For instance, the Punjab
National Bank, a state-owned bank, recently took over the loss-making New
Bank of India. But the deal was held up for three years while staff at the
two institutions sorted out their relative seniorities.
World Bank studies show that countries determined to sort out loss-making
banks are usually able to finance recapitalisation. If the Indian banks' bad
debts reached Rs200bn, that would be only about 3 per cent of GDP. By
comparison, Spanish banks' bad debts total 16.8 per cent of GDP.
However, recapitalising banks will be a waste of resources unless banks are
also required to operate more efficiently. At the central bank, Mr
Rangarajan believes they will, to compete with the 55 existing private banks
(including 24 foreign) plus four newly licensed private banks. State-owned
banks will have to sign operating agreements with the reserve bank that make
profitability rather than asset growth the top priority.
These pressures could improve the efficiency of a handful of well-managed
institutions. But a fully-liberalised banking industry is not even on the
government's agenda. As one Bombay banker says: 'The banks will modernise
but control will stay 90 per cent with the government.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (21): Fall-out from a scandal - The Stock
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government is breathing a sigh of relief. Measures taken earlier
this month narrowly averted a stock market crisis triggered by the income
tax authorities' seizure of stock worth Rs1.5bn traded by Harshad Mehta, the
broker at the centre last year's Bombay securities scandal.
Traders were reminded of the dark days when the markets came to a standstill
after an edict froze the shares that Mr Mehta had traded in the 14 months
before the scandal was uncovered.
A crisis may have been avoided but the pressure to eliminate the chaos of
India's bourses is still intense.
The ruling Congress party - which is eager to ride on the success of its
economic policies in elections in four provinces later this year - is
particularly keen to see capital overseas flowing into the country.
But foreign portfolio investors want to see the modernisation and regulation
of the bourses before buying heavily in Indian stocks.
New Delhi opened its doors to foreign investment a year ago but only Dollars
150m has come in so far and another Dollars 200m is in the pipeline. This
represents only a fraction of the Rs1bn official projection.
Several events have weakened the confidence of overseas investors in Indian
markets - a series of bomb explosions in Bombay in March this year, the
sacking of a mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu extremists and the Bombay securities
market scandal, which surfaced last April.
Bombay, founded in 1875, is the largest and oldest of India's 21 stock
exchanges and it accounts for about two-thirds of India's trading value. The
other main exchanges are Calcutta, Delhi, Madras and Ahmedabad. Bombay has
been averaging 45,000 trades a day - the same as the London Stock Exchange -
and at the peak of activity 18 months ago, it ran at double that rate.
Brokers in Bombay, who once catered to a handful of speculators and 2m
investors, are now being asked to serve, either directly or indirectly, 25m.
The number of investors is forecast to double in five years. The number of
companies listed has swollen to more than 5,000 and 350 new firms are added
every year.
Yet the Indian financial markets remain inadequately supervised and archaic
in their procedures. Restoring order to this chaos is no mean task for the
SEBI.
Its action is three-pronged: To bring brokers all over the country under its
control by asking them to register with the SEBI. However, the introduction
of hefty registration fees last November brought brokers out in protest,
claiming that the turnover-linked fee was a tax on their income and had
stalled the registration process.
To introduce capital adequacy norms. Brokers are undercapitalised and are
denied access to bank finance, which the Reserve Bank of India, the central
bank, fears will be diverted for stock speculation. Indian brokers not only
serve investors but also do business on their own account.
To bring corporates into a market dominated by proprietary firms and
partnerships. The entry of corporates is linked to a change in stock
exchange regulations, which at present demand unlimited liability of
members. Mr GV Ramakrishna, SEBI chairman, says transparent limited
liability is preferable to unlimited liability that is not quantified.
Last month, the government reconstituted the Bombay exchange in an attempt
to break broker resistance. It nominated four members to represent
investors, the corporate sector and the public on the nine-member board,
giving the executive director a casting vote in the event of a tie.
The SEBI has enhanced its vigilance after the securities scandal and now
probes every sharp rise or fall in share prices. But brokers are angry at
what they say is unwarranted intervention in their business.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (18): Poverty in a class of its own -
Development is hampered by the world's worst illiteracy level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of neglect, India is beginning to take education seriously.
But it will take many years to right the damage done to India's people,
particularly the poor, by the long decades in which the ruling elites failed
to make a priority of educating children.
India has the doubtful distinction of having more illiterates than any other
nation - almost half its population aged seven and over cannot read or
write. About 20 per cent of all children never even enroll at school; 60 per
cent of those who do drop out long before the end of basic education.
Uneducated people have little chance of participating fully in the economic
modernisation which Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and his
colleagues are pursuing. Worse, the lack of literacy could itself become a
serious block to further progress. With the exception of the oil-rich Gulf
countries, no state has achieved industrial take-off with literacy levels
below 60 per cent.
The economic success of China and other east Asian nations, which all made a
priority of primary education, has finally persuaded many Indians that they
cannot go on as before.
Mr Arjun Singh, the minister for human resource development, whose brief
includes education, says that in the past education did not get the
attention which it should have done because India faced other pressing
problems such as building its industrial base. 'Now that other needs have
been satisfied, the highest priority has been given to getting over the
backlog in education.' India's target is to achieve 100 per cent literacy by
the year 2000.
However, this target seems unrealistic because India does not seem ready to
commit to primary education the resources necessary to teach reading and
writing even to all its children - never mind to illiterate adults.
India spends about 3.8 per cent of its gross national product on education,
about the same as other low-income developing countries, including China.
However, India directs a disproportionate amount of its education budget on
universities and colleges for the children of its tiny upper and middle
classes.
Indian education officials often argue that the reason so few children
attend school is that their parents prefer to send them to work. The
families need the money the children can earn. Eimi Watanabe, the former
head of the Unicef office in Delhi, rejects this argument. She says parents
would send their children to school if only the education on offer was
better and more relevant to their needs. 'The problem in education is poor
supply not poor demand.'
Particularly in northern India, where illiteracy is especially high,
teachers are poorly trained, have inadequate materials, and face classes of
up to 80 pupils. Ms Watanabe says it is little surprise that the parents
take their children out of school.
Even in the poorest regions, such as the eastern state of Bihar, there are
dedicated officials and teachers, some of them volunteers. But generally, in
northern India, the commitment to teaching the poor is weak. Take the
example of one state-level education official who explained to the
representative of an international aid agency how he was able to manage his
budget in spite of increasing enrollments. He said: 'Because of literacy
campaigns we have high initial enrollment but fortunately we have a high
drop-out rate.'
The underlying reasons for India's neglect of primary education are much in
dispute. Professor Myron Wiener, a US academic and author of a study of
Indian education, pins the blame on the caste system. He says that the upper
castes have little interest in educating the lower castes because their own
position at the top of the hierarchy might eventually come under threat.
Mr Wiener's Indian critics say this is nonsense. Some of them retort by
blaming the British Raj for limiting high-quality education to a small elite
of middle-class Indians who were trained to serve their rulers. This
established a tradition of limiting access to schooling which independent
India followed.
Literacy levels vary widely but are generally low in the north and high in
the south. In the coastal state of Kerala they come close to 100 per cent.
In Bihar in the north it is less than 40 per cent. Coastal regions generally
do better than in-land districts probably because they have long been
exposed through trade to different influences instead of being bound by
traditional caste and other ties.
Also the south is more literate than the north because Christian
missionaries were particularly active there at an early date teaching
reading and writing as a way of spreading their faith. Hindu and Moslem
teachers responded in kind - channelling competition among the religions
into education.
In the north, where Christianity had much less impact, competition between
Hindus and Moslems was primarily military. So schooling was less well
developed.
But the blame cannot entirely be pushed back into previous centuries. Mr
Singh, the minister, admits that for well-intentioned reasons
post-independence governments put a higher priority on industrialisation
than on education. Unlike other socialist-inclined countries, including the
Soviet Union and China, India neglected basic schooling and basic
healthcare.
Also, India deliberately excluded the World Bank and most other aid donors
from education arguing that foreign money was better spent on concrete
projects like dams. Only in the late 1980s, did Indian officials begin to
see that they were cutting themselves off from important developments in
education. Only this year is the World Bank finally funding its first
educational project in India - a Dollars 300m teacher training programme in
the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
The picture is not altogether gloomy: as well as Kerala, which has long been
seen as an exception in achieving early widespread literacy, other states
are making progress, notably the relatively large southern state of Tamil
Nadu, which this year pledged to build enough schools to make sure that one
is within reach of every family. The state claims that 100 per cent of its
six-year-olds are now enrolled. The literacy rate is 64 per cent.
Unfortunately, India may still be moving too slowly towards widespread
literacy. Without better education, particularly for women, it will be
difficult to spread better health and hygiene standards and better knowledge
of family planning. Without these, the population will carry on growing at 2
per cent a year. Eventually, millions of poor illiterates would swamp the
economy, bringing growth to a grinding halt with a grave risk of widespread
unrest.
As Ms Watanabe says Indians are just beginning to realise the dangers.
'People are beginning to understand that education is a critical issue for
population growth and economic development. They see that if they don't act
they face a bleak future in the 21st century.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (19): Red tape heroes - Non Resident Indian
Investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By T THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN Indian businessman, resident abroad, who wanted to invest less than
Dollars 500,000 to set up an export-oriented software company in Bangalore,
south India, spent about six months going through nine steps in three cities
to win approval for his plans.
First he applied in Bangalore to the director of the Software Technology
Park (STP), a special commercial estate designed to attract high-technology
investment. Then the application was considered by an inter-ministerial
committee of the Department of Electronics (DOE) in Delhi. The committee
sent the application to the Secretariat for Industrial Approval SIA) in the
Industries Ministry to certify that the company was a 100 per cent Export
Oriented Unit (EOU), and therefore entitled to special regulatory privileges
aimed at promoting exports.
From the SIA, the case went to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB)
in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), where the majority foreign ownership
was cleared and permission granted for the eventual repatriation of
dividends. The FIPB's decision was passed for ratification to the Empowered
Committee, a committee of one - the finance minister.
The application was sent back to the SIA which issued an EOU certificate.
Armed with this, the applicant went to Bombay to the Reserve Bank of India,
the central bank, to seek permission to remit the money from abroad and
invest it in an Indian company. He negotiated terms with the RBI. He was
permitted to invest his money in India. Whether the investment is Dollars
0.5m or Dollars 300m, the procedure is the same.
It is no wonder that most non-resident Indians and foreigners are turned off
by Indian bureaucracy. The only solution is to abolish the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, the law which controls foreign exchange transactions. Even
after recent reforms, the rules run into hundreds of pages. Any partial
tinkering will not do. The financial regulation of foreign investments
should be delegated to commercial banks which can be authorised to ensure
that the remaining rules are observed.
The greatest challenge facing India is creating enough jobs for its
burgeoning population. India's unemployed have never been properly estimated
but they could total 100m. As the population is growing at 20m a year, India
must create at least 10m jobs a year. The total number of jobs in the
organised sector is only 26m - 18.5m in the public sector and 7.5m in
private companies. Only about 0.7m jobs a year have been created in the past
few years, most of them in the public sector.
The lack of jobs is a socially-explosive issue manifesting itself through
demands for increasing job reservation according to caste. This is a
time-bomb. Lacking a social security system for the unemployed, India
desperately needs to create more jobs. It can only do this by a radical
economic policy change to generate economic growth of 10 per cent a year,
instead of about 5 per cent as now.
The main constraint on growth is the lack of capital. India's savings rate
is high at over 20 per cent of GDP, but much of this money is deployed to
support a large bureaucracy and a vast loss-making public sector industry.
The only sensible solution is to attract more foreign investment. India
needs an infusion of at least Dollars 10bn a year for 10 years. It can only
get it by making it easier for foreigners to invest.
The government has already taken some steps - significant by Indian
standards - to liberalise the economy. It has virtually abolished industrial
licensing; it has diluted the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices
Act; it has made the rupee fully convertible for trade transactions.
Today it is possible for Indian and foreign companies to expand their
activities even through mergers. The recent take-over of Tomco, a soaps and
detergents company in the Tata industrial grouping, by Hindustan Lever, an
affiliate of Unilever, the international foods group, is an example of the
new freedom. Foreign companies which were previously forced to reduce their
holdings to 40 per cent have been able to raise them to 51 per cent, and
that at reasonable prices.
New investors attracted by the change in policies include American
corporations such as Coca Cola, Pepsi, General Electric, and IBM. Indian
exports have also become more competitive and increased significantly in the
recent past.
Yet the total of direct foreign investment approved by the government is
under Dollars 2bn. The investment which has actually flowed into India is
much smaller. This is a trickle compared to what the country needs. (China
has in the past decade attracted Dollars 40bn).
The Indian government needs to take the following steps to make the country
more attractive to foreign investors:
strengthen the government's commitment to reform by inducting into the
Cabinet more ministers who are not only fully committed to reform but are
able to articulate the policy in Parliament, in public and in the media.
decentralise the decision-making process with regard to industrial
investment. With the end of licensing, there is very little need for the
centre to intervene in India. Intervention only adds to confusion,
corruption and delay. Decentralisation will simplify procedures and promote
competition for investment among states. To speed this up, each state should
be allowed to set up a Special Economic Zone to attract export-oriented
investment.
large public sector undertakings should be opened to international groups
with specialised knowledge in areas such as petroleum, power, and
telecommunications. This will help upgrade India's infrastructure, the poor
quality of which is a major limitation on growth.
reform the financial sector by forcing nationalised banks to go to the
capital markets to raise capital and by allowing foreign financial
institutions to enter and compete. Competition is the best cure.
abolish foreign exchange regulation.
By adopting these suggestions, India can eventually attract a much larger
flow of investments than China because it has significant advantages such as
democracy, the rule of law, a highly-sophisticated entrepreneurial class,
well established stock markets, a good supply of talented English-speaking
managers, and cheaper skilled labour than the rest of Asia.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (15): Undaunted ABB aims high in spite of
delays - Martin Wolf finds the multinational power giant bullish on India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri is bullish on India. Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive
officer of the Swiss-Swedish multinational, said last year, for example,
that he expected India to become one of ABB's seven or eight most important
markets. Mr K. Narasim Shenoy, ABB's managing director in India, even
regards India as having the 'number one' potential in Asia, ahead of China.
Mr Shenoy has elaborated ABB's ambitions. He hopes that by 1996 ABB will
have invested an additional Dollars 300m, apart from Dollars 1bn earmarked
for a thermal power generation project near Delhi, and achieved an annual
turnover of Dollars 1bn. ABB even plans to be the largest private sector
industrial group in India by the end of the century.
ABB has far to go. In 1992 the revenues of the group were only Rs5.1bn
(Dollars 165m). But the company is already entrenched in the Indian market.
By 1992 its total employment in India, at around 7,500, was ninth highest in
ABB worldwide. Soon it may be fifth or sixth.
ABB is no neophyte in India. The group's current market presence consists of
ABB, a 1989 merger of Asea and Hindustan Brown Boveri, along with SAE - a
maker of power transmission towers - and Flakt, which makes pollution
control equipment and is a leader in air and gas handling technology. Both
of the latter are shortly to merge into ABB India, in which ABB, the parent
group, has raised its stake to 51 per cent, following changes to the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act.
Members of the group commenced manufacturing in India in the 1960s and are
now mainly concentrated in turnkey power generation projects, along with
equipment for power generation, transmission and distribution.
ABB's ambitions for India reflect its appreciation of the country's
potential and enthusiasm for the liberalisation of the last two years.
Mr Yogesh Desai, communications manager, notes that the environment has been
transformed in two respects: large companies used to have to wait for one
and a half to two years to gain permission to introduce a new product, but
that delay has now disappeared for most products; companies also used to be
told by the government of India to produce components in line with a 'phased
manufacturing programme', but now industrialists have the flexibility to
import the components they need. The fundamental change, in short, is that
entry has become far easier.
It may be easier, but as ABB knows full well, it is not that easy. The
problem, notes Mr Shenoy, is still one of agonising delays. Problems become
particularly severe when projects are politically controversial, as they
often are when, as is the case for ABB, the client is either a government or
a public sector enterprise.
A technology transfer project for high powered electric locomotives,
financed by the Asian Development Bank, has dogged ABB since 1987. Since
winning the initial tender, ABB has had to undergo two rebids and a
parliamentary inquiry.
Although the contract has at last been signed by the government of India, it
is unclear whether Indian Railways has the money to go ahead, its particular
problem being finance ministry insistence that this public sector entity pay
the government 100 per cent duty on the imported locomotives. Already delays
have been so great that the ADB has threatened to cancel the Dollars 190m
loan.
What has caused the delays? It is not doubt about ABB's technology, since it
is the unquestioned global leader in energy and maintenance-saving 3-phase
AC locomotives. Nor is it lack of indigenisation, since the contract
envisages that import of 16 fully assembled locomotives and 14 more in kit
form will be followed by transfer of the production technology to
Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. Nor is it the capital cost, which seems
likely to work out at about the same level as any relevant alternative.
The delay has been caused by lobbying by powerful losers, including the
public sector competitor, Bharat Heavy Electrical, concern about dependence
on foreign technology and suspicion of foreign multinationals. The lesson,
says Mr Desai, is that 'being good is not good enough. You must talk about
it, even to unrelated constituencies and convince them.' ABB now has a far
more favourable press, claims Mr Desai. Yet great damage has still been
done, more to India, which has lost six valuable years to fruitless
politicking, than to ABB.
Delays are also arising with ABB's planned involvement in power generation.
In line with its 'multi-domestic' policy, ABB decided to support the
government's policy of securing private sector power generation. It has
signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Thermal Power
Corporation to participate in a combined cycle 800MW power plant at Bawana,
expected to cost some Dollars 1bn. But this proposal has already been
delayed about 18 months for evaluation of tenders, which should be completed
by next month.
Even then, the power purchase agreement must be finalised, to which must be
attached adequate financial guarantees, a vital matter in view of the
parlous financial state of the electricity boards.
ABB is undaunted. While categorically denying all interest in purchase of
any part of BHEL, it is interested in joint ventures. It is also negotiating
with the state government of Karnataka to purchase a stake in the New
Government Electrical Factory, a manufacturer of transformers. But ABB will
be limited to a minority stake, since the state intends to keep 51 per cent.
The ambitions of ABB are vast. Whether it can fulfil them will be a test not
only of its own abilities, but still more of the political environment in
India. Much has changed. But much has still to change.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (17): Tough task for Basu - Profile, State
Bank of India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL sector reforms are ushering in unprecedented changes at the State
Bank of India. It will have to reach Basle norms for capital adequacy before
March next year and meet increasingly stiff competition in the market place.
This is tough time for the bank, which is recovering from India's worst
securities scandal and facing the possible loss of monopoly business for
state-owned enterprises following economic liberalisation.
The State Bank of India came into existence 38 years ago after the Reserve
Bank of India, the central bank, purchased a majority stake at Imperial Bank
of India, the Scottish-owned bank, in order to make the State Bank an
instrument of economic development. It has now 8,800 branches and deposits
of Rs663bn.
Many of the bank's problems stem from government policy requiring leading
banks to be nationalised and the entire banking system to set up branches in
rural areas and lend 40 per cent of their credits to sectors - such as
agriculture and small businesses - designated as priority areas by the
government.
This meant that around two-thirds of all lending by banks was in effect
directed by the state. Under the social policy of extending credit into
rural areas and supporting smaller companies the banks have been required to
subsidise loans and shoulder bad debts.
The government is now pushing ahead with reforms of this over-staffed and
slow-moving sector as part of the reform programme. In January it said that
it would allow private banks to be established.
Reforms come on the heels of a setback suffered by the bank last year when
it had to provide Rs7.06bn for losses in the Bombay securities scandal that
rocked the financial system. In the wake of the scandal, the bank lost its
chairman, MN Goiporia, who retired prematurely and its managing director Mr
V. Mahadevan, who was sacked.
Several top bankers left the bank for greener pastures and many are targeted
for hiring by the new commercial banks that are being floated.
Never before has competition been so intense. All banks are now seeking blue
chip customers so that they can make lower provisions to cover risks. The
State Bank has reached 5 per cent capital adequacy on its Rs663bn deposits
and will hit the target of 8 per cent through recapitalisation.
The bank's new chairman, Mr Dipankar Basu, is treading warily to stabilise
operations, boost staff morale and stem the flight of talent. Mr Basu has
hired management consultants to advise him on enhancing the staff response
to customer needs in the changing environment.
An equity issue is planned later this year, making the State Bank the first
to go to market. The Reserve Bank, which now owns 98 per cent of the bank,
will see its stake fall by a third to 70 per cent.
Mr Basu, enjoying the newly ordained freedom, plans to close uneconomic
branches. 'The exercise will not be worth it unless (closure) is in
hundreds,' Mr Basu says. Nearly 2,400 of the banks's 8,800 branches are
making losses at present.
But his determination to have a lean bank does not go beyond network
reduction and certainly does not extend to staff reduction. This is to be
taken care of by natural wastage and a ban on new recruitment, Mr Basu adds.
Two other components of cost cutting will be 'significant automation', as Mr
Basu puts it, and elimination of subsidies in the pricing of products. The
minimum balance of Rs100 for a savings deposit account with cheque facility
stipulated 20 years ago when the the rupee was worth three times its present
value, is in urgent need of review.
As the country's, and probably the world's, largest bank in terms of
branches, the State Bank has the sector's best reach. The second largest
Indian bank has half the number of branches. 'We are not unduly perturbed
about competition. Our strength is the network,' says Mr Basu.
The State Bank is aiming to be a universal institution offering all types of
services under one roof. Rationalisation will affect the bank's seven
subsidiaries, which have a combined 4,000-branch network and deposits of
Rs188bn. A proposal has been put forward to merge them into a single bank to
eliminate duplication.
SBI Capital Markets, one of the bank's subsidiaries, is a merchant bank and
undertakes leasing. SBI Fund Management is a mutual fund. The bank is also
involved in factoring and housing finance.
The London-registered SBI European Bank administers the bank's international
network and provides its parent with banking intelligence.
The next big initiative for the State Bank is in the Far East and the former
Soviet Union where it plans to set up branches.

BURNPUR CLUB, like the rest of this once vibrant steel city, is having a
hard time.
Its gardens have withered. The steel executives, unsure of their future, no
longer turn up for lunch and only a few come in the evening.
The Indian Iron &amp; Steel Co (IISCO), which owns the Burnpur steelworks, is
woefully short of funds to maintain the city with its elegant bungalows
built during the days of the Raj.
IISCO, deeply in debt, has let the plant decay. Parts date from the 1920s
and its productivity is the lowest in the Indian steel industry.
In the year to March 1993 it produced 860,000 tonnes of hot metal. But its
outworn melting shop converted this into only 363,000 tonnes of steel.
Mr KV Pai, managing director, says: 'Though we have learnt to run a
dilapidated steel plant, the Burnpur works as it is will not survive very
long. Modernisation cannot be postponed any longer.'
But comprehensive modernisation and capacity expansion, which finally will
claim an investment of Rs60bn will have to await IISCO's privatisation. And
that means job cuts.
When India's public sector was treated as a holy cow by the federal
government, the 33,000 jobs at IISCO were safe. However, the economic
programme of the Narasimha Rao government does not permit indefinite
bankrolling of the company's losses.
In a last-ditch rescue effort, New Delhi has decided to privatise it. The
move has raised the unions' hackles.
Anxious to protect jobs, the five unions have responded by forming a
committee to fight privatisation through mass meetings and strikes. More
than 1,000 IISCO officials have made common cause with the unions.
Mr Chandrasekhar Mukherjee, the local president of the Marxist union who was
fired from IISCO 40 years ago for leading a strike, says: 'IISCO is the
major employer in the Burnpur city which has a population of nearly 200,000.
'We know for certain that privatisation will lead to contraction in
employment at IISCO. That will spell ruin for the city.'
According to Mr Mukherjee, trade unions allied to different parties are
united against selling IISCO which they fear will lead to privatisation of
other government undertakings. Mr Santosh Mohan Dev, steel minister, has
told the unions that the government is bent on transferring IISCO to the
private sector.
Mr Mukherjee, hero of many a union battle, is no longer confident about his
present campaign. Its prospects have not been helped by Mr Jyoti Basu, the
pragmatically minded Marxist chief minister of West Bengal.
Mr Basu believes that the steel plant, which has run up a loss of Rs7.58bn,
cannot be saved unless it is modernised with private finance.
Mr Basu wants to have a say in choosing a buyer for IISCO. He has already
invited Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the UK-based Caparo Group, to rescue
IISCO.
At first Mr Paul seemed keen to accept the challenge but then backed out
because he did not like the conditions set by the government.
But the ever-pragmatic Mr Basu has also supported a bid for IISCO by Mukand
whose chairman, Mr Viren Shah, is a prominent member of the right-wing BJP -
the Hindu Bharatiya Janata party .
The power of IISCO's large workforce was a factor in influencing the Mittals
and the Tatas, India's two leading industrial groups, not to bid for the
company.
The Mittals had thought of re-equipping Burnpur with a second-hand, but
relatively new steel plant to be imported from the UK. They dropped the idea
because of doubts about winning co-operation from the labour force. For the
Tatas, involvement in IISCO would have been a distraction from plans to
expand their steel plant at Jamshedpur.
Finally, to the disappointment of the federal government, there were only
two bidders for IISCO - Mukand and Usha Rectifier.
The committee of experts on private participation in IISCO headed by Mr PL
Shankar reported that it found the Rs32bn Mukand proposal to rehabilitate
the steel plant 'more confidence inspiring'. Mukand has a technical
agreement with Hoogovens of the Netherlands.
Usha Rectifier, however, claimed that it offered a better price and that its
Rs52bn modernisation programme, unlike that of Mukand, included a dedicated
power station and a new blast furnace. It had also secured MAN of Germany as
a partner.
One committee member, Mr KC Khanna, former chairman of Steel Authority of
India (SAIL), offered a minority opinion, which is being canvassed by the
unions. He said that SAIL should be given the responsibility for modernising
IISCO, which is a subsidiary of SAIL.
But SAIL, which is busy modernising its bigger and newer steel plants at
Durgapur, Rourkela, Bhilai and Bokaro, would find it hard to devote
resources to IISCO as well. Meanwhile, time is running out at Burnpur.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (13): Bottomless pit for national wealth -
The public sector has turned from a vision of progress into a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE private sector, says a leading Indian businessman, is the people's
sector while the public sector is the government's sector. Given the
millions of shareholders that large Indian companies, such as Reliance, have
been able to attract, the judgment is not entirely unwarranted. The public
sector was intended to be the cutting edge of Indian socialist development.
It became the plaything of politicians, bureaucrats and, at least by Indian
standards, a relatively small and pampered labour force. Now it is an
incubus, expensive to the government and damaging to the economy.
At the turn of the present decade, the Indian public sector absorbed 44 per
cent of gross domestic capital formation and used 46 per cent of the capital
stock. But it generated only 27 per cent of gross domestic product at factor
cost and 7 per cent of gross domestic savings. It contributed 18 per cent of
manufacturing value added, but 41 per cent of value added in transport, 82
per cent in banking and insurance and 100 per cent in communications. Yet,
even though 71 per cent of the people working in so-called 'organised'
activities were employed by the public sector, that was only 19m people, a
mere 6 per cent of India's labour force.
The huge sums invested in public enterprises have brought not merely
negligible employment, but paltry economic returns. A study by Vijay Joshi
and IMD Little of Oxford University shows that even on relatively favourable
assumptions the real return on investment in the public sector, including
manufacturing, has been about a quarter of that in the investment-starved
private sector (see chart). 1 In 1991-92 approximately 300 central public
sector enterprises achieved a net return on capital of only 2.1 per cent.
Their net profits were just Rs24.8bn (Dollars 970m), with the losses of the
102 loss-making enterprises, at Rs36.7bn, weighing heavily against the
profits of the profit-making enterprises, which themselves amounted to only
Rs61.5bn. 2 In addition, some 700 or so enterprises were owned by the
states, among them the economically vital, but mismanaged, state electricity
boards.
The disaster of the public sector enterprises occurred for two reasons.
Under the Sick Industrial Companies Act the government acquired unprofitable
companies from the private sector, thus, in the words of two distinguished
Indian economists, 'extending to private enterprises the disincentives that
operate on public enterprises'3. In addition, even those public enterprises
that started as such have generated large losses. This is all a very long
way from one of the earliest justifications for the pivotal role of public
enterprises, that their profits would help raise the overall savings rate.
This degree of waste cannot last. India has to find ways of using the
capital invested in the public sector units more efficiently, of conserving
its scarce budgetary resources for more essential uses and of financing the
expansion of the infrastructure essential for fast development. Hitherto,
however, it has moved only a few gingerly steps in the needed direction.
The post-reform policies have the following principal elements:
The number of industries reserved for the public sector has been reduced
from 17 to eight.
Performance is to be improved by means of performance contracts or Memoranda
of Understanding, by which managements are to be granted greater autonomy,
but also to be held accountable for their results.
Budgetary support in the form of loans to loss-making enterprises, other
than those within the Plan, is to be phased out after 1994-95.
Up to 49 per cent of equity in profit-making enterprises may be
'disinvested', that is, sold to private investors.
Enterprises are being allowed to form joint ventures and raise fresh equity
to finance expansion.
'Sick' public enterprises have been brought within the jurisdiction of the
Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, which is to decide
whether units can be restructured or should close down.
Pricing decisions affecting, in particular, steel and petroleum and coal
products, are being taken more flexibly.
A National Renewal Fund has been established to fund compensation,
retraining and redeployment of workers affected by restructuring.
Finally, for the future, the government plans to press ahead along the lines
it has already indicated, as was recommended by the Rangarajan committee on
'disinvestment of shares in public sector enterprises'. 4
By Indian standards, these changes are revolutionary and should, if adhered
to, bring about at least some improve finally, ment in the performance of
these enterprises. By the end of the last financial year, for example,
disinvestment in three successive sales had raised Rs49bn (Dollars 1.9bn).
In 1991-92 between 5 and 20 per cent of the equity in 31 companies was
'disinvested'. In 1992-93 up to 5 per cent of the equity in 13 companies was
similarly sold. The new shareholders should impose greater pressure on
management. At least equally significant as such sales could be the
introduction of competition. By its own admission, for example, competition
has galvanised the notoriously indifferent Indian Airlines, which had lost
almost a quarter of its passengers to new entrants, to unprecedented efforts
aimed at regaining the loyalty of its customers. For all that, the
government is doing little more than nibble at the problem. It is all very
well for it to pat itself on the back for reducing budgetary finance for the
planned investment of public sector enterprises from 22.2 per cent of the
total required in 1991-92 to 18.6 per cent in 1992-93. But it is far from
certain that the budgetary stringency of the finance ministry would prove
the intended immovable object against the hitherto irresistible force of
public enterprise losses. Fundamental problems also remain with management
of the public enterprises, while the introduction of competition is still at
best only halting.
Paradoxically, India's poverty is being used as a justification for policies
leading to a huge and persistent waste of resources. This sacred cow needs
to be slaughtered. Reservation to the public sector should cease and
competition actively encouraged. There should be separation of
responsibilities for regulation from those for the production of goods and
services.
Given the vitality of the Indian capital market and the interest of foreign
firms, complete privatisation can and should be pushed forward. Finally, the
shedding of redundant workers and the closing of hopelessly unviable firms
must be made feasible.
The drawback of the current approach is not that it will make no difference
to the problem. But it will take far too long and change much too little.
India cannot afford to waste so much of its capital, use up so much of its
scarce budgetary resources and provide so little of the essential
infrastructure it needs, all in order to support a sector that offers
employment to so few and loads the costs of its poor performance on so many.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (12): Sprinting to the tape - China does it
differently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S economic reforms, though impressive, have not yet taken the country
to a higher plane of growth. China, by contrast, averaged 9 per cent annual
growth in the 1980s after its reforms got under way at the end of the
previous decade. Can India too transform itself into a high-growth economy?
On the surface there are a number of similarities between India and China.
Most obviously, both are very large, rurally-based economies with low per
capita incomes. Both have a big capacity for growth and large, available,
hard-working labour forces.
Secondly, both have huge, very inefficient public sectors and massive
bureaucracies. This means that there is tremendous scope for greater
productivity - but this would involve social, political and management
upheavals which have so far prevented much improvement in either country. In
both countries, corruption is a well-entrenched fact of public life.
Thirdly, both currently have governments which understand what reforms are
required to achieve their goals and appear ready to make the necessary
changes over time.
The parallels cannot be taken too far. Political structures are entirely
different.
The Chinese government does not have to answer to an electorate but instead
is subject to repeated internal power struggles which result in periodic
changes of direction. Mr Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reforms,
realised however that market-led economic growth was essential for the
Communist Party's retention of power, and this tenet underlies all
government policy.
China's reforms, though designed to end the heavy top-down management of the
economy, have themselves been carefully structured and strongly led by the
government. They are backed by the party's powerful propaganda machine. When
the Chinese government puts its weight behind reforms, they tend to be
carried out - sometimes too enthusiastically so that economic growth has
then to be contained.
Substantial re-structuring of of the financial system, the public sector,
taxation and trade can be expected in the coming years provided there is not
a crippling political power battle.
India's governments operate in a boiling cauldron of democracy in which
economic policies often seem somewhat irrelevant to their retention or loss
of office. It is significant that reforms were introduced two years ago when
financial crisis ruled out most other courses of action.
Mr Manmohan Singh, who launched them as finance minister, is not by career a
politician but a financial expert and administrator. He has proved himself
to be a canny politician, but relies on the support of a prime minister, Mr
Narasimha Rao, whose own tenure has sometimes looked shaky.
When Mr Singh announces reforms, he cannot be certain that they will be put
into action because they tend to involve a diminution of patronage for
bureaucrats at both central and state government level. Attempts to open up
sectors of the economy, such as airlines, telecommunications, and
television, have run into obstacles or become embroiled in corruption.
Political constraints have so far prevented Mr Singh from putting
privatisation and substantial labour reform on the agenda. This is
unfortunate because one of India's big advantages is that it already has a
large and vibrant private sector which should be a powerful engine for
growth of the economy and of exports once it has adjusted to the ending of
the need for close ties with the government and of the protection afforded
by high tariff barriers. Management skills which China is having to learn
from scratch already abound in India.
India also has a better developed financial system able to channel resources
to the development of businesses. Though its inadequacies were shown up by
the stock market scandal of 1992, it is still streets ahead of China where
the financial system has essentially existed to bankroll state direction of
the economy.
The biggest difference evident to the foreigner, however, is in attitudes to
foreign investment. China patently welcomes investment, even though foreign
companies must work hard to develop contacts and to ensure that contracts
are carried out as they envisage. The would-be foreign investor in India,
though entering a developed private sector with many familiar and appealing
aspects, must still wade through official processes of the pre-reform era
which can take inordinate time and effort.
Mr Rao, Mr Singh and other key ministers and officials have the vision and
the will to change the economic face of India, but they have yet to inspire
the same determination among sufficient numbers of their colleagues. Until
the political will becomes more widespread, it is difficult to see India
moving up to join the high-growth economies further east.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (11): Exports must grow faster - Foreign
trade perks up, but there's more to do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA has increased its exports too little; it has traded too little of its
output; and it has traded inefficiently. These have been the three historic
failures that reform of the trade policy regime has to remedy.
The policy changes made so far are dramatic by Indian standards. The
question, nevertheless, is whether they will prove enough to bring about the
required transformation.
India's trade performance has not been that dreadful. True, its share in
world exports fell sharply between independence and the mid-1970s, but it
has stabilised at about half a per cent since then. The average growth in
the volume of India's exports between 1980 and 1991, at 7.4 per cent, was
not only greater than that of Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil (see chart), but
considerably faster than the 4.3 per cent India achieved in the 1970s.
Again, the weight of trade in gross domestic product, though far lower than
in other developing countries, is comparable to that in large advanced
countries (see chart).
Nonetheless, India could and should have done better. Other developing
countries, notably in east Asia, have achieved faster export growth and a
greater presence in world trade. In 1991, for example, India offered only
the 35th largest import market in the world, just below Ireland and far
smaller than Hong Kong, Korea, China or Thailand. Export growth was
insufficient to finance the imports required by the country's improved, but
still modest, economic growth of 5.4 per cent a year during the 1980s. This
helps explain India's balance of payments crisis in 1991, notwithstanding a
panoply of exchange and import controls and import-weighted tariffs then
averaging close to 90 per cent (see chart). The country evidently needs
still faster export growth.
India also needs to increase exports and imports in relation to GDP. Its
economists and policy makers often argue that such a large country should be
no more trade dependent than the US. True, India has a huge population, but
it has a small modern economy. In 1990, for example, India's manufacturing
value added was only 70 per cent of Korea's, 40 per cent of China's and 6
per cent of Japan's. Such a modestly sized manufacturing sector ought to
enjoy great opportunities for increased specialisation in trade.
The required policy changes have included lower protection against imports,
which would itself shift incentives towards exports, and a devaluation of
the rupee, which would enhance the incentive to produce tradeable goods and
services. This has been precisely the direction taken by the government of
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, under the intellectual leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh,
the finance minister.
In July 1991, the maximum import duty was reduced from 300 to 150 per cent.
Then, in early 1992, emergency import controls were abolished and import
licensing and quotas were eliminated for most capital goods and raw
materials. A single negative list, consisting mostly of consumer goods,
remained. The maximum tariff was further reduced to 110 per cent, tariffs on
most capital goods fell from 80 to 55 per cent, and to 25 per cent for
capital goods used by exporters. Some export restrictions were also removed.
In the budget of February 1993, the maximum tariff was lowered to 85 per
cent, while tariffs on project imports and many capital goods were reduced
to 25-35 per cent.
The rupee was devalued by 18 per cent in July 1991, export subsidies were
removed and exporters received tradeable import licences for 30 per cent of
their export receipts. In March 1992 the rupee was made partially
convertible on trade account and a dual exchange rate was introduced, giving
a further effective devaluation of 9 per cent. Finally, in March 1993 the
finance minister took the bold decision to unify the exchange rate and float
the rupee, which has since remained at 31.2-31.4 to the US dollar. Between
June 1991 and September 1993 the cumulative devaluation was close to a
third.
These changes have met with success. However, the dynamism of exports had
been masked by the collapse in trade with the rouble zone, from the
equivalent of Dollars 3.1bn in 1990-91 to a mere Dollars 671m in 1992-93.
Yet, in fact, merchandise exports in convertible currencies have been
growing rapidly for years. Growth seems now to be accelerating, with total
exports in April-July 1993 27 per cent more in US dollars than during the
same period of 1992.
Meanwhile, merchandise imports are running at 3 per cent below their value
in April-July 1992 and well under their peak of Dollars 24.1bn in 1990-91.
In consequence, the merchandise trade deficit has shrunk from Dollars 5.9bn
in that year of brewing crisis to only Dollars 438m in the first four months
of 1993-94 (an annual rate of Dollars 1.3bn).
The risk now is renewed onset of complacency. Far more needs to be done if
India is to enjoy an efficient trade policy regime. The Chelliah committee
on tariff reform recommended a reduction in the average tariff rate from 47
to about 25 per cent by 1996-97 or 1997-98.
This proposal has been accepted by the government.(1) Yet even that level of
protection would be far higher than in Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, the
Philippines, Thailand and Turkey today. The committee also recommended a
tariff structure in seven slabs, ranging from zero for basic foodstuffs to
50 per cent for finished products.
Yet as two Oxford University economists, Vijay Joshi and IMD Little, note,
the view that 'higher stages of manufacturing should have higher rates of
nominal protection than lower stages  .. is a totally unprincipled
principle, for it has no foundation in economic principles(2). The
government is also committed to eliminating most exemptions from tariffs and
duties, except for inputs into export production and, more radically, to
rationalisation of duties and import restrictions on consumer goods(3). It
has long been an anomaly of Indian policy that those goods deemed too
inessential to import also receive the greatest incentive for domestic
production. So long as imports of consumer goods remain banned, this
absurdity will remain.
Also important is elimination of export restrictions, particularly on
agricultural products, such as cotton. Last but not least, tardy, sometimes
corrupt, administration remains a concern, notably over the provision of
still important export incentives, such as duty-drawbacks and advance
licences.
Enough has changed in the Indian trade and exchange rate regimes to make
probable an upward jump in export performance. But so large has been the
devaluation and so modest the reductions in nominal protection that little,
if any, economic restructuring is likely to occur. The government should not
only go far further, but must make its determination to do so as credible as
it possibly can.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (10): There's no turning back - The pace and
intensity of economic deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
INDIA, it has sometimes been remarked, has potential: it will always have
potential. The programme of deregulation that the present government
embarked upon in July 1991 is designed to prove that wry comment wrong. With
luck, it should do so.
India includes somes 30 per cent of the world's poorest people. It needs to
grow far faster if it is to relieve that poverty. Amazingly, as one of
India's most distinguished economists, Jagdish N. Bhagwati, points out in
his recently published Radhakrishnan Lectures, 'this thoroughly plausible
statement can create immense controversy in India'.(1)
That deregulation was not embraced more urgently before 1991 reflects partly
such ideological attitudes, partly suspicion of foreigners and partly the
resistance of powerful interests. Also important has been the ability of the
Indian economy to keep chugging along. An economic crisis was needed if
serious reform was to start. But only a systemic collapse would produce a
total transformation. It was the former, not the latter, that was
forthcoming.
Under the 'licence raj', businessmen had to ask permission from Delhi over
what, where and how to produce. They had to ask permission over what they
could import, what technology they could use and with whom they might
collaborate. They had to ask permission over where to locate, when they
could close and whom they could fire. Foreigners were generally precluded
from majority ownership and so-called 'large houses' from expansion. The
public sector was strongly promoted, while the Indian economy was detached
from the rest of the world.
Yet this was a planned economy only in name. It was really just a controlled
economy. The man in Delhi was thought to know best. What he did, in fact,
know best was how to stop things. In this system corruption was no accident.
It was inevitable.
The nadir of Indian economic development was reached in the 1970s, also the
heyday of the control system. The 1980s saw some liberalisation and,
correspondingly, improvement in economic performance. At 5.4 per cent a
year, India's average economic growth between 1980 and 1991 put its economy
among the ranks of the more successful developing countries, though far
behind leading East Asian exemplars (see chart). These differences are
significant. Even at the rate of growth of income per head achieved in the
1980s, India's income per head would double only every 22 years. At China's
rate, it would double every nine.
The failure to achieve fast growth has been mainly caused by the inefficient
use of resources. Though far behind levels achieved in leading east Asian
countries, India's gross domestic savings rate in 1991, (1) Jagdish N.
Bhagwati, India in Transition: Freeing the Economy (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
1993). (2) Isher Judge Ahluwalia, 'Industrial Policy, Reform of Public
Sector Enterprises and Privatisation in India,' paper for conference on
India - the Future of the Reforms, held at Merton College, Oxford, June
27-29 1993; (3) Economic Reforms: Two Years After and the Task Ahead,
Discussion Paper, (Delhi: Ministry of Finance, 1993).
at 19 per cent, compared well with those in many parts of the world and was
some six percentage points higher than 30 years before. But total factor
productivity stagnated in the 1960s and 1970s, before growing at the more
satisfactory rate of 2.8 per cent a year in the 1980s. More disturbingly,
the productivity of India's scarce capital has been falling over the past 30
years.(2) The fundamental objective of deregulation is to secure a much
better performance.
In industrial policy, many important changes have been already made,
including the abolition of industrial licensing for all except a select list
of hazardous and environmentally sensitive industries; abolition of the
separate permission for expansion hitherto needed by the large companies
covered by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP); a
reduction in the number of industries restricted to the public sector; and
freer access to foreign technology. Similarly radical have been steps to
liberalise controls on trade and foreign exchange.
Also important, if more cautious, have been changes in the treatment of
hitherto suspect foreign investment. As the finance ministry has noted, 'net
foreign direct investment into China is estimated at over Dollars 5bn in
1992. By comparison, net foreign investment inflows into India during the
late eighties and early 1990s were around Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a
year.'(3) Approval of foreign holdings of up to 51 per cent of equity in a
specified list of 34 priority industries has been made automatic, with
case-by-case approval beyond that given by the specially constituted Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).
Procedures for Indian investment abroad have been streamlined. The Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act has been amended to make it easier for companies
with foreign equity to operate in India. To take just one example, it is now
relatively easy for businessmen to obtain Dollars 5,000 for foreign travel,
without a per diem limit. India has also signed the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
Tax reform has begun: the marginal rate of income tax has been lowered to 40
per cent, the tax base has been broadened and excise duties have been
simplified, while the level of import duties has been lowered and their
structure simplified. A start has also been made on reforming the financial
sector.
Cumulatively, these are big changes. That they are having an impact can be
seen by the large increase in the value of foreign collaboration approvals
(see chart). The commercial director of Indian Airlines ascribes the decline
in his business partly to the reduced need for businessmen to travel to
Delhi. Similarly, major business houses have given up suites they long
maintained in the best Delhi hotels, while many of those whose job was to
help people obtain licences are now out of business.
The changes so far are also probably irreversible, except perhaps for the
greater tolerance of foreign investment, to which important elements in the
BJP object for nationalistic reasons. They should ensure a substantial
improvement in economic efficiency and accelerated economic growth, as
demand recovers. Nevertheless, these reforms will also create problems, some
of which could inhibit further movement in the same direction.
One obstacle is the parlous state of parts of the public sector. But there
is also a question mark against the future of many large private houses. So
far pressure on them has been modest, partly because of the devaluation. But
the development of private concerns has been distorted by the control
regime: their technology is often outdated, their spending on research and
development exiguous, the scale of their plants inadequate and their
experience with marketing, rather than distribution, negligible. They are
not, says a businessman, 'learning organisation'. Many are also now riven by
conflicts within the families that control, rather than own, them.
Large houses are just one of the interests likely to resist further reform.
Also important is the lower level of the bureaucracy, many politicians and
organised labour, whose political importance far exceeds its modest weight
in the labour force. The number of registered unemployed alone exceeds the
number employed in the organised sector. Nevertheless, removal of
restrictions on 'exit' of businesses and laying off of workers remains the
hottest of potatoes.
Even such obstacles to change are not absolute, as the success of many
companies in securing voluntary retirement demonstrates. But they raise the
cost of adjustment, increase the difficulty of using resources efficiently
and lower incentives for entry. As the ministry of finance remarks, 'in
protecting the interests of those who are currently employed, we must not
lose sight of the need to create fresh jobs for those newly entering the
labour market'. The National Renewal Fund, though helpful, is not large
enough to make a decisive difference to the government's ability to push
through redeployment of organised labour.
The finance ministry has further plans, notably for tax reform, tariff
reduction and financial liberalisation. Tax reform, for example, is to
include simplification of the complex and distorting structure of excise
taxes, abandonment of specific tax rates, more sophisticated tax collection,
virtual abolition of exemptions and a progressive move to value added tax.
In industrial policy, the main concern is now with the states, whose
licences, permits and inspections impose a heavy toll. No less important has
been the failure to provide adequate infrastructure, notably in areas of
state responsibility, such as electric power distribution. Furthermore,
where central government is involved, as in railways or telecommunications,
both delays and bureaucratic and political infighting remain serious
obstacles. In addition, restrictions on foreign ownership remain too tight,
since it is unreasonable to expect foreign companies to risk ceding control
over their most advanced technology.
Much has been done, but much remains to be done. So how far might reform yet
go? The erstwhile commerce minister, Mr P Chidambaram, obliged to resign
over the scam, argues there is no strong opposition to reform. The problem
is rather that the government consists of 'converts rather than crusaders'.
The free market does, it is true, have few strong supporters. But it also
has few disinterested opponents. Economic success should do much therefore
to shift public opinion.
Reformers need a marked improvement in performance as a platform on which to
build further reform. Only then might India's politics shift from their
current obsession with the redistribution of just about nothing to the more
attractive business of offering more to all.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (8): State of the economy - Interview,
Manmohan Singh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE Minister Dr Manmohan Singh replies to questions put to him by Stefan
Wagstyl:
QUESTION: How do you assess the current performance of the Indian economy?
DR SINGH: The performance so far has been in line with our expectations. The
only slightly disappointing factor has been that the upsurge in industrial
production is not as good as we would like it. But export performance has
been very good. Exports were up by nearly 28 per cent in the first four
months of the year (the financial year, starting in April). That is most
encouraging.
If exports continue to do well and the monsoon is good then it will help
industrial production. But quite honestly, there's a problem because
industries such as steel and cement are partly dependent on demand from the
public sector. And public sector demand (because of efforts to control
public spending) is not rising as fast as we would like.
THE fiscal deficit seems to be expanding above the targets that you set. Are
you concerned about it?
For the time being the fiscal system is not behaving in the manner we would
like. The deficit could be 5.7 per cent or 5.8 per cent of the economy if we
don't make any corrections. As of now we would overshoot (our target of 4.7
per cent). But we can take action once these elections are out of the way.
(Elections to be held in four states where state assemblies were suspended
and central rule imposed after the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque.)
MIGHT you act by cutting subsidies for publicly-distributed food?
Fortunately the macroeconomic situation is good. We could reduce subsidies
by selling (government-held) food stocks in the open market. We are
considering this. But we cannot act until after the state elections because
for the moment the politicians are worried about the fall-out of any action
we might take. I don't think the Indian people would mind but politicians
everywhere have this preoccupation with the short-term. They believe that if
you care for the short-term, the long term will take care of itself. That's
a problem of all democratic political systems. After the elections, we won't
be able to recover all the lost ground (on the fiscal deficit) but we can
act.
WILL the increase in the deficit create difficulties with either the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, which are monitoring the
Indian economy?
I don't think it will create problems. The significance of the fiscal
deficit is its effect on inflation and the balance of payments. On both of
these our performance is very good. Our export performance is impressive.
Also, (the IMF and the Bank) recognise that we are working with the reality
of a vigorous democracy. No other fact is more important than this.
Certainly today there's more support for the programme than there was when
we started. But even in countries where central leadership is strong,
reforms run into difficulties. In India, on structural reform what we have
said we have done. Given the democratic nature of our political system, it's
a miracle we have got this far.
DOES India still require financial support from the International Monetary
Fund?
Our foreign exchange reserves are high, about Dollars 7.2bn or Dollars
7.3bn. That is higher than we expected. So we have no immediate need. But we
are interested in a medium term programme. The question is when we tie it
up. Probably after the (February) Budget.
HOW can India move public resources from subsidies, such as those paid to
state-owned enterprises, to meeting basic needs such as education and
health?
We have reduced subsidies very substantially. We reduced spending on
development in the last two years but this year we have increased it. We are
trying to make good the lost momentum of the last two years.
INDIA has partly liberalised imports and exports in the past two years. What
are your plans for further trade reform?
A strong open (world) trading system would greatly help the efforts of
Indian industry. But if India unilaterally disarms when the rest of the
world is becoming more protectionist then what would be the result? That's a
worry. Nevertheless, we are stil committed to further tariff reform. We have
to carry the public with us. It will be easier as industry gains confidence
(about competing in world markets).
WHAT changes can we expect in the next few months?
We are opening up financial services to foreign companies. I expect a
committee examining the insurance industry to report soon. There's a need
for change there. We have a lot of work to do with restructuring banks.
Private companies are interested in starting banks but they are still
talking about this to the Reserve Bank of India. In all these areas we will
make progress.
WHAT possibility is there that the government will start to privatise the
country's large, and often loss-making, public enterprises?
We have to appreciate that our party (Congress (I)) has been the ruling
party for the past 46 years. It is a party with a (socialist-inclined)
ideology. It takes time to change the thinking. The government is now
committed to privatising power distribution in Delhi itself.
Telecommunications (a state monopoly) has been opened up. We hope for more
progress in the next two years. We can privatise if it does not lead to the
loss of jobs. That is the limit to reform in a country like ours. It
certainly restricts the pace of change. Two things matter to ordinary
people. One is food prices; the other trade unions.
BUT surely, organised labour accounts for only a small proportion of Indian
workers?
But we can't mobilise the other 95 per cent. Trade unions are well organised
and well entrenched. In the cities they are powerful. If you take them on
head-on you risk having the reforms derailed altogether. You have to take
every step taking account of what can be done. Tactics have to be sensitive
to the need of the moment.
SO is the pace of reform slowing?
I would say financial sector reforms are making good progress. Trade sector
reforms also. If we can control inflation and no jobs are lost we can deal
with the other things (including reform of public sector enterprise.) In the
last two years we have decisively de-ideologised the debate over reform (and
so made progress). But if I create inflation, or increase the fiscal deficit
or create a very substantial amount of unemployment then I am in trouble.
People have to be confident of their jobs and food and prices.
HAVE political events such as the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque diverted
attention from reform?
We presented the budget after Ayodhya. We carried forward the reform
process. The prime minister is committed to reform. But the economy doesn't
function in a political vacuum. So time spent on Ayodhya and other things
has diverted attention. Also if we had not had the financial scam (last
year's scandal in the Bombay securities market), the time could have been
spent more productively.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (9): Preconditions of reform - India needs
to retain economic stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STABILISATION should not be confused with structural reform. But the two are
intimately related. Losses of public sector enterprises and subsidies, both
causes of economic waste, contributed directly to India's fiscal
difficulties. Similarly, distortion-induced economic inefficiency and
consequent low growth contributed indirectly to those difficulties.
Yet another link is the balance of payments crisis of 1991, largely the
product of fiscal mismanagement, but also the starting point for the present
reforms. Now, argues the finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, the reform
programme could survive almost anything, except inflation and yet another
balance of payments crisis. Stability regained must, he insists, be
retained.
Not long ago India's historic record of stability appeared lost. In June
1991, it was on the verge of default on its external debt, foreign exchange
reserves were equivalent to two weeks of imports and the annual rate of
wholesale price inflation had reached the intolerable level of nearly 17 per
cent. Moreover, in the financial year ending in March 1991, the central
government's gross fiscal deficit was 8.4 per cent of gross domestic
product, while the current account deficit was equivalent to 2.6 per cent of
GDP and a third of exports of goods and non-factor services.
The subsequent two and a quarter years have seen a remarkable change.
Foreign exchange reserves are up from Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 7.3bn (see
chart); the dollar value of exports between April and July of 1993 was 27
per cent greater than in the same period of last year; foreign investors are
showing increasing interest in India; and inflation is down to a little over
6 per cent. In addition, the central government's fiscal deficit was 5.2 per
cent of GDP in the latest financial year, while the current account deficit
was a third smaller than in 1990-91, if up on 1991-92.
'With all the problems we have had,' claims Dr Singh, 'it is a miracle the
programme is still intact.' For all that, success has not been unalloyed.
One virtually inevitable problem has been recession, with growth of GDP
declining to 1.2 per cent in 1991-92. But economic growth recovered fairly
quickly, to about 4.2 per cent in 1992-93, with a further increase of about
5 per cent expected this year. Industrial output also stagnated between
1990-91 and 1991-92, before mounting a modest recovery. Unfortunately,
industrial output was then adversely affected by the disturbances at the end
of 1992, rising above the level attained in the same month of the previous
year only in May 1993.
The decline in economic growth was modest in the circumstances. It was also
inevitable. Nevertheless, it has tended to undermine one of the government's
most important achievements: fiscal consolidation. The finance minister had
planned a central budget deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP this financial year.
He now admits that the outcome, on current trends, is likely to be at least
one percentage point higher.
Industrial recessions reduce tax revenues. Since import duties generate
close to 20 per cent of total fiscal revenue, lower imports themselves
significantly reduce fiscal receipts. With the dollar value of imports
between April and July 3 per cent below that in the corresponding period of
the previous year, despite the abolition of foreign exchange and import
controls, the consequences for revenue have been unfavourable.
Excessive expenditures, particularly on subsidies, are also a problem. At
present, central budgetary subsidies - budgeted to be 1.1 per cent of GDP
this financial year, down from 2.3 per cent in 1990-91 - are bound to
overshoot. This would be true even if a fiscal correction were to be made
immediately after the four state elections expected in November and
December.
Any long-lasting fiscal slippage would be dangerous, perhaps not immediately
in current recessionary conditions, but in the longer term. Understandably,
the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr C Rangarajan, has expressed
serious concern to the government over expansion of net RBI credit to the
government, which is running at almost three times the budgeted level for
the current financial year. This is not just potentially inflationary. So
long as the government runs large and persistent fiscal deficits, it will
find it difficult to eschew forced borrowing from the banks and impossible
to continue paying anything close to market real rates of interest.
In the 1980s, it should be recalled, the central government fiscal deficit
was between 7 and 9 per cent of GDP in every year from 1984-85 to 1990-91.
Over the same period, the ratio of total government debt to GDP rose from 51
to 66 per cent, while the ratio of external debt to GDP rose from 16 to 29
per cent. The crisis of 1991 was the virtually inevitable result. That
crisis did at least prove the trigger for present efforts at reform. Now, by
contrast, persistently large fiscal deficits would be the greatest single
threat to reform.
Vijay Joshi and IMD Little of Oxford University argue, on admittedly quite
conservative assumptions, that a sustainable position for India would be one
with a current account deficit of less than 1 per cent of GDP and a small
central government surplus, excluding net interest payments.(1) The latter
would, in turn, imply an overall central government fiscal deficit of about
3 per cent of GDP, roughly half of that now expected for 1993-94 and below
even the budgeted level for this year.
Still more important, these authors stress, than the inadequate persistence
and scale of the fiscal adjustment is its poor quality, a point on which two
Indian economists, Jagdish Bhagwati and TN Srinivasan, agree in a paper they
have prepared at the request of the finance minister.(2) Half or more of the
reduction in the fiscal deficit has come from a decline in capital
expenditure, itself an important reason for the persistence of the
industrial recession.
A squeeze on public investment, particularly in infrastructure, threatens
future growth of the economy. That danger is exacerbated by curbs on loans
to important public sector enterprises, which are simultaneously restricted
in their ability to raise funds in the capital market by the government's
unwillingness to push for outright privatisation.
At the same time, inadequate efforts have been made to rein in wages paid by
government, whose share in GDP rose by one and a half percentage points in
the 1980s. Equally important has been the failure to eliminate most of the
remaining subsidies, particularly on fertilisers (budgeted at 0.5 per cent
of GDP in 1993-94). Even food subsidies (budgeted at 0.4 per cent of GDP,
though likely to prove larger this year) could be sharply reduced, without
adversely affecting the poor, since, as the World Bank rightly notes, 'the
public distribution system is not targeted at the poor to any significant
extent'.
Generally, cost recovery needs to be a central element in all government
programmes, both at the centre and state levels. The failure to charge
adequately is neither economically efficient nor does it benefit the poor,
who are rarely able to obtain scarce subsidised inputs.
Tax reform is important for both structural adjustment and stabilisation.
Present plans for reform call for lower import duties, for example. This may
not lower revenue if the ratio of trade to GDP grows and most duty
exemptions are eliminated. However, less distorting forms of revenue will be
needed.
Centre-state fiscal relations also require reform. Change here is
particularly important because revenue from customs tariffs accrues solely
to the centre under the Indian constitution, while revenue from personal
income tax or excise duties are shared with the states. The Chelliah Report
on tax reform has recommended, in response, that the central and state
governments move from sharing specific taxes to general revenue sharing.(3)
Tax reform does matter. So does sustaining the overall tax effort. But, as
the World Bank notes, the tax to GDP ratio in India, at 16.9 per cent in the
second half of the 1980s, compares well with that in other low income
countries. Fiscal stabilisation cannot be achieved by additional revenue
raising alone.
Thus, the finance ministry's agenda, which includes reduction and
redirection of subsidies, higher administered prices, limiting budgetary
allocations to public sector undertakings and generally tighter expenditure
control, apart from tax reform, should be implemented in full.(4) Above all,
inevitably scarce budgetary resources must be redirected towards development
and welfare expenditures that only the public sector can undertake and away
from finance of public sector undertakings and indiscriminate subsidies.
Privatisation is vital here and would also help lower the present
excessively high levels of public sector debt.
The intersection between the twin causes of stabilisation and structural
reform falls precisely where the public sector colossus now sits. Failing a
redrawing of the role of the public sector, it may well prove impossible to
sustain progress towards fiscal stabilisation. Without such stabilisation,
the RBI's role as central bank will be subverted, inflation will no longer
remain in control, the financial system will not be restructured and,
ultimately, reform will founder.
Stabilisation is not the same thing as structural reform. But a rethinking
of the role of the Indian public sector is unquestionably a precondition for
both.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (7): Beautiful waters that have turned to
blood - Tourism and tension in the Vale of Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, the legendary beauty of Kashmir in northern India attracted
tourists by the plane-load, writes SHIRAZ SIDHVA.
In 1989, Indian Airlines ran 13 flights a day into the state. Now there is
one flight a day.
It brings only a few tourists, mostly back-packers of the kind who used to
come by bus from Jammu, or trekkers heading for the Himalayan kingdom of
Ladakh.
Most of the tourists are aware of the conflict in Kashmir, where the Moslem
population has long chafed against Indian rule.
But they cannot resist the famed attractions of the area including the
gracious houseboats that can be rented for next to nothing on the placid
lakes near Srinagar.
'We wanted to see for ourselves whether Kashmir is the lost paradise the
newspapers say it is,' says Carlo, an Italian architect, during the flight
to Kashmir. 'I decided that if we didn't visit Kashmir now, we may never get
there. Is it really as bad as they say?'
If you are not put off by sporadic shooting, explosions, curfews, and the
presence of thousands of Kalashnikov-toting soldiers and militia-men, then
Kashmir is still a lovely destination for a holiday.
On all sides there is the awesome grandeur of the Himalayas. The people are
as friendly as ever, and room prices have remained steady for three years.
But as soon as you land, you know you are in a war zone, where there are
daily clashes fought armed separatists and units of the estimated quarter of
a million armed forces.
Four years of death and decay are symbolised by what has happened at the Dal
Lake.
Once a haven for tourists all the year round, its quiet waters are now
choked with weeds. In a phenomenon still unexplained by scientists, the
colour of the lake changed two years ago from a muddy green to red.
'The lake mirrors the rivers of blood that are flowing in the Valley,' says
Ahmed Jaan, a wizened old man who for 50 years has sailed his shikara on
these waters.
Today, his life is as desolate as the houseboats with their vacant
signboards.
The intricately carved facades of these floating homes bear quaint names,
like Queen of Sheba, Paris Beauty and Cherry Ripe.
But their timbers are rotting, and the rooms, with their chandeliers and
exquisite carpets, are musty from neglect.
At Mr Butt's Clairmont houseboat on the Nagin lake, the visitor's book tells
of good times that may never return. Beatle George Harrison has been here;
so have hundreds of other celebrities from around the world.
The crowds that thronged the Dal Lake boulevard have been replaced by
soldiers with sten guns, the golf course is overgrown and abandoned, and the
grand imperial Residence that became the Oberoi Hotel now houses officers of
the paramilitary forces.
Groups of women squat on the pavement outside the interrogation centre
waiting sometimes for hours to see their sons, brothers or fathers who have
been picked up, sometimes, without reason, for questioning. There have been
over 150 deaths in custody this year.
Stung by international complaints about human rights abuse earlier this
year, the government is trying to make its security forces more accountable.
But this is not easy. Most of the soldiers who are fighting a well armed
guerrilla enemy were trained for a conventional conflict rather than to face
10 year-old boys who lob hand-grenades before running into their mothers'
arms.
The Kashmiris have been alienated from the security forces after humiliating
and sometimes brutal house searches.
The troops have for decades been instilled with hatred of the enemy (read
Pakistan). For them, every Kashmiri in the Valley is anti-national, and
therefore, Pakistani.
Women and children have been killed or wounded in crossfire between Kashmiri
militants and the armed forces.
The citizenry of Srinagar retreat indoors long before nightfall, hoping that
the next day will dawn without a search operation.
Only stray dogs keep the soldiers company on their long night vigil.
There is no solution in sight.
'The Indian government has pushed us to the wall, and now, at the point of a
gun, they want us to swear loyalty to the nation,' says a well-to-do
Srinagar trader.
'I never thought that there would come a stage when I would support the
movement that some people have been advocating for over 40 years.
'But with the daily dose of humiliation and harassment from the Indian
forces, I cannot see how we can turn back on this road we have taken.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (6): Delhi rules with carrot and stick -
Across the subcontinent, regional conflicts strain the republic's integrity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tenuous nationalism which binds the multi-cultural Republic of India is
constantly threatened by regional strife.
Since it became independent 45 years ago, it has faced all-out separatist
insurgencies in the north-eastern state of Assam (since 1979), Punjab (since
the early 1980s), and in Kashmir (since December 1989).
Though militancy has been crushed in Punjab and peace has returned to the
state after a bloody decade, the unrest in Kashmir shows no signs of
subsiding, and Assam threatens to flare up again.
'India, with all its plurality and diversity, has been most successful in
dealing with regional conflicts,' says Mr BG Verghese, an eminent journalist
and research professor at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.
'Historically, traditionally and constitutionally, India's approach has been
one of accommodation, not liquidity.'
The ruling Congress (I) party, which has had an almost uninterrupted
monopoly of power in New Delhi since Independence, has in effect become the
Centre. Critics of the Congress claim that most regional conflicts,
including Kashmir, Punjab and Assam, are the Congress's own creations,
which, like the proverbial chickens, are coming home to roost.
'Kashmir, Punjab, Assam each have their own peculiarities, but what typifies
them is that they are all the results of the Congress (I)'s wrong policies,'
admits a senior party MP. 'The centre has repeatedly been tempted to play
the all-powerful boss of the states, and has not hesitated to be ruthless
when it has found it necessary to crush regional aspirations, especially
political ones.'
The Congress believes that it governs with a light hand and only uses force
to defend internal security and national sovereignty. However, force has
been used all too frequently to quell insurgencies.
'A lot of the trouble is a product of our own follies and political
failures,' admits Mr Verghese. 'But part of the Indian genius has been to
reconcile so many social, cultural, ethnic and religious identities.'
India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, unlike his daughter Indira,
and his grandson Rajiv Gandhi, did not live to see any serious regional
tensions erupt in the country.
Those who framed the Indian constitution allowed for dissension within
specified limits. The trauma of partition between India and Moslem Pakistan
was still too fresh, the states were in the process of being constituted,
and it was too early to gauge how Centre-state relations would evolve.
Though there have been periodic separatist uprisings in the north-east and
Kashmir since 1947, India's first regional conflict was in the early 1960s,
when the Dravida movement, an anti-upper caste social reform campaign in the
southern state of Tamil Nadu, demanded a separate Dravida state. But Nehru
initiated a compromise by 1962, and the party entered the electoral
mainstream to wrest power in 1967.
The first real jolt to independent India's integrity came in the 1970s, with
a full-fledged insurgency erupting in the north-eastern states of Assam,
Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland. These states,
carved out of the old Assam province between 1963 and 1986, were politically
integrated with the rest of the country, but were geographically, culturally
and emotionally remote.
In 1979, Assamese nationalists formed the United Liberation Front of Asom
(ULFA). Backed by Naga and Kachin guerrillas it opted for a full-scale armed
insurgency, which has fluctuated wildly, and has still not subsided.
Punjab has witnessed one of the bloodiest revolts. Here, the origins of the
conflict are not economic, but stem from a power struggle between local
politicians of the state's majority Sikh community and politicians at the
centre, who are eager to control the resources of one of India's richest
states.
A political movement for more autonomy started by Sikh leaders in the early
1980s turned violent when it failed to achieve its goal by peaceful means.
Mrs Gandhi's government responded with a series of blunders. The worst was
Operation Bluestar in June 1984, in which the Indian army stormed the
holiest Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple at Amritsar, which militants had
turned into a fortress.
Thousands died in the ensuing violence and the militants' demand for
Khalistan, a separate Sikh state, intensified. Mrs Gandhi paid heavily for
her attempts to establish political supremacy over the Punjab militancy. She
was killed by her Sikh bodyguards on October 30 1984. A fragile peace has
returned to Punjab, but experts fear the crisis could erupt again.
In Kashmir, a Punjab-style solution to an armed insurgency which has the
support of the entire local population has failed to restore peace. It has
only alienated the people further.
Mr Rajesh Pilot, Minister of State for Home Affairs in charge of internal
security, is trying - so far with little success - to initiate a political
process in Kashmir. He says that the government does not believe in using
force unless it is absolutely necessary. 'What we try to do is face the
reality, provide opportunities for economic and social development, and help
militants or aggrieved people to enter the political mainstream.' India's
characteristic response to secessionist uprisings has been to throw in the
army and the paramilitary, ordering full-scale crackdowns which often
involve the repression and torture.
The people of Assam lived with an occupying army for more than 20 years, and
thousands of villages experienced search-and-arrest operations and human
rights infringements. The Assamese were relieved when the Centre imposed
President's rule on November 27, 1990, under Article 356 of the Indian
Constitution. Assam was now under the direct control of New Delhi, and
military operations were called off on April 20 1991.
But the army was redeployed on September 14 that year, under the code name
'Operation Rhino'. Assam was policed by about 200,000 troops and
paramilitaries until January 1992 when a negotiated settlement with the ULFA
was reached. But some Assam militants remain unhappy, and sporadic violence
continues.
In Kashmir, the worst is not yet over. The government plans to send Mr KPS
Gill, the police chief who crushed militancy in Punjab, to tackle the
Kashmir militants.
But experts fear that a Punjab-style show of force will not reap results and
excesses by the armed forces have completely alienated the Kashmiri people.
The Indian government uses both the stick and the carrot. The low-level war
raging in the Vale of Kashmir has not prevented it from offering employment
to those willing to eschew violence, helping traders to sell their goods
through the rest of the country, and ensuring that food and other essential
supplies continue to reach the Kashmiris.
'Our main approach has been to ensure that the common man is not hit by our
operations to flush out militants, ' says Mr Pilot. But the government has
been unable to control parts of its 250,000-strong security forces and the
violence has so far claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Mrs Gandhi used to blame 'the foreign hand' for all India's troubles.
Pakistan across the border has been India's favourite whipping boy and not
without reason. But, as Mr George Fernandes, MP, puts it: 'Pakistan may be
fishing in the troubled waters of Punjab and Kashmir, but it is India who
has created those troubled waters.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (4): Challenge from homespun right - Shiraz
Sidhva assesses the power of the BJP opposition party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this month a group of eminent jurists, doctors and politicians clad
in homespun khadi cloth, congregated at a seminar in New Delhi to warn
against the dangers of what one of them termed 'the Coca-Cola culture'. The
backdrop of the podium showed Mother India astride a lion and the speakers
represented the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, an organisation promoting the use of
swadeshi, or Indian-made, goods.
Forty years ago, Mahatma Gandhi cleverly linked the concept of swadeshi with
freedom from British rule. Today, the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS),
the parent organisation of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is launching a
movement against the 'indiscriminate' entry of multinationals into the
Indian market it fears will accompany the ruling Congress (I) party's
economic liberalisation programme.
India's liberalisation programme is unlikely to grind to a halt if there is
a change in government and the BJP comes to power. But any shift in emphasis
could hurt foreign companies. 'We are all for reform,' says Lal Krishna
Advani, the party's president. 'We support liberalisation, but believe that
internal liberalisation must precede globalisation and must be introduced in
phases.'
The ambiguity of Mr Advani's comment reflects the diversity of opinion among
the party's support groups, ranging from the near-autarchic RSS to free
marketeers. Herein lies the threat to foreign companies. A BJP government
would not reverse reform. But it might be more willing than Congress (I) to
pick fights with multinationals to satisfy some of its more nationalistic
affiliates such as the RSS.
In the most detailed statement of the BJP's economic policy - its 'shadow'
budget, published a week before the government's own budget in February - it
recommended the abolition of controls on production, cuts in tax and
interest rates, encouraging the infrastructure sector and special
concessions to small industries in rural India.
Mr Advani disagrees with those who say that the BJP's economic policy is no
different from that of the Congress party. 'The Congress introduced
liberalisation merely as a response to averting the country's balance of
payment crisis in 1991. For the BJP, a deregulated economy is a matter of
conviction and commitment,' he says.
Mr Jagdish Shettigar, an economist and member of the national executive
which formulates the party's policies, says: 'The BJP believes that India
should introduce delicensing in the fullest sense of the term, and starting
an enterprise should be as simple as using a road. You still need all sorts
of permissions and clearances today, which have to go if we are to progress.
What we need are guidelines, for safety, labour and the environment, not a
quota and permit raj.'
The party believes fewer controls would automatically eliminate corruption.
Party leaders see no contradiction between the advocation of swadeshi and
the opening up of the economy. 'We have a holistic and humanistic approach
to the economy,' says Mr Shettigar, an RSS member and part of the BJP's
economic think-tank.
'We define swadeshi as anything that is good for the country and reforms, if
introduced rationally, are good for the country. The government has no
business to be in business,' he says.
BJP leaders point out another basic difference between their economic
policies and those of Congress (I). The ruling party allows foreign
investment in all but a few core areas which have been reserved for the
public sector while the BJP has specified that it would not allow
multinationals in the consumer goods sector but only in high-technology
areas.
'We don't need consumer goods like soft drinks and potato chips, especially
when they are so much more expensive than Indian-made goods and only
slightly better in quality,' Mr Shettigar says. 'We cannot have
multinationals buying our potatoes at Rs2 and selling them as chips at 10
times the price,' he says.
But Mr Advani says that multinationals already operating in India 'will not
be asked to pack up and go' as Coke and IBM were in 1977 when the Janata
party took over. 'There will be economic continuity, but we shall not
encourage any new foreign investment in the consumer goods sector.'
The BJP's support for 'speedier reforms' and 'reforms in a phased manner' at
different forums indicates that the party has yet to iron out its economic
programme. The RSS has further confused the issue by announcing boycotts of
multinationals and Indian companies such as Godrej Soaps, which has linked
up with Procter and Gamble, the international soap company.
Mr Pramod Mahajan, the BJP leader in Bombay who has won the BJP much
business support, says the party's model for foreign trade is Japan, where
free trade is encouraged with subtle import controls. It advocates a legal
framework providing a level playing field for Indian businessmen.
The party, which has a traditional support base of small traders, has
started wooing big business in India. Businessmen usually fund and support
the ruling party but many now are veering towards the BJP, some because of
the party's growing importance, others because they believe that the BJP
would introduce a more liberal economy and present a credible alternative to
the Congress (I), which they blame for the current economic problems.
The party is in turn seeking the help of big business to gain power. More
than 40 top industrialists received a letter from Mr Advani this July, weeks
after he took over as president of the party for the second time. Mr Advani
was keen to reassure the business community after his predecessor, Murli
Manohar Joshi, and some of the party's old guard had attacked the Congress
(I)'s reforms package.
The letter was sent out together with taped speeches and newspaper clippings
spelling out the party's agenda. It asked businessmen for a 'token
contribution' to be paid by cheque. (Political offerings are usually
unaccounted for, so the insistence on cheques illustrated the party's
resolve 'to cleanse public life'.)
The party beat its target of Rs500m from the industrialists, who said they
would respond to Mr Advani's request for more funds 'in the course of time'.
The BJP's critics say it is easier to spell out a hypothetical economic
policy than to implement one when in power. A Congress (I) leader says that
some of the country's worst economic offenders are the BJP's traditional
support base of small traders. 'Will the BJP be able to clamp down on these
tax evaders and still retain their support?' he asks.
'How can the BJP talk of salvaging the economy when they have struck the
worst blows to it in the past year?' asks a senior opposition MP. 'The BJP
sought the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya, which led to colossal
economic loss and the deaths of over 2,000 people, and the BJP is an ally of
the Shiv Sena who engineered the riots in Bombay in December and January.
They will have to give up their politics of destruction before telling us
how to improve the economy.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (5): A city at war with itself - Ahmedabad
usually suffers six riots a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAJEDA MOMIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of schoolboys plays cricket in a back alley of Ahmedabad. The ball
accidentally hits a passer-by, and it is enough to spark off a communal riot
between Hindus and Moslems in the city.
Ahmedabad has had the worst record of riots in the country - each year, for
the past eight years, there have been at least six riots on an average.
Curfew is imposed and the army often summoned to help restore law and order,
workdays are lost, and factories come to a grinding halt.
The city's streets are transformed into a wasteland by arsonists shouting
slogans and setting buses and cars alight. The looting and arson is often
carried out by gangs divided along religious lines. And the police are
little help at times like these because they become Hindus or Moslems first,
to the detriment of duty.
This once-flourishing industrial city of Gujarat in western India has been
tainted by its violent reputation. And yet, it is not that its people are
intolerant. The Guajaratis are usually a timid, peace-loving race. Founded
by the Moghul emperor Ahmed Shah on the banks of the river Sabarmati,
Ahmedabad grew into an important textile centre at the turn of the century,
and was often described as the 'Manchester of the east'.
Hindus and Moslems shared a common culture, especially since most of the
Moslem population were converted from Hinduism three centuries ago. The mill
owners and cloth traders were traditionally Hindus, while the textile
workers were Moslem.
The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a boom in the industrial growth of the
city. Though the cotton mills were facing a recession, other large
industrial houses were attracted to the city because of its spirit of
enterprise. Large drug companies such as Torrent Pharmaceuticals and Cadilla
were among those which decided to set up business there.
But many middle-class dreams were shattered in 1985, when riots broke out
against the reservation of places for the underprivileged in educational
institutions. This agitation was given a communal twist as there were many
Moslems among the disadvantaged, since they were the poorer community.
The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had very little
support in the traditionally Gandhian-socialist stronghold (Mahatma Gandhi
was from Gujarat), suddenly found a political issue to establish a base. The
BJP has had a phenomenal rise in the state, and is likely to win power there
in the next elections.
Mr EA Khan, a retired bureaucrat, decided to move from his home state, Uttar
Pradesh, to Ahmedabad. He had been posted there for 10 years in the 1970s,
and testifies to the city's dramatic change for the worse. 'When I moved
back here a few years ago, there was a distinct polarisation between members
of the two communities,' he says. 'I found it difficult to find a landlord
to rent a house to a Moslem, which was most distressing.'
Ahmedabad, with its population of nearly 4m and an area which has over the
years expanded to 280 square kilometres, is 'an overgrown village,' says Mr
Doshi, an architect. 'Social tensions are often the root cause of riots, and
if people are herded together like they have been in the walled city, the
proximity will only create deep chasms between them, which is what has
happened. Then all differences are accentuated, and religious differences
are always the easiest to erupt.'
Real estate in Ahmedabad is dependent on the communal colour of an area.
Entire streets have sometimes been sold for a song when one community
decides that it is too dangerous to live in a particular place, and has
moved to a safer part of town.
The construction industry, which is usually booming thanks to Ahmedabad's
nouveaux riches businessmen and diamond merchants, collapses when there is a
riot or long days of curfew. In July 1992, 25 people lost their lives after
communal tensions led to yet another bloody riot. And when a mosque was
destroyed in Ayodhya in December last year, Ahmedabad was badly hit with
lengthy curfews and at least 50 people dead.
Many Moslems have moved to the Gulf countries for jobs, since fewer and
fewer Moslems are being employed by Hindu factory owners. Unemployed youth
of both communities, however, find ready work in the large Mafia which
controls the bootlegging trade (Gujarat is India's only 'dry' state, where
prohibition is still - loosely - enforced).
The rise of the BJP and the upsurge of Hindu nationalism in the city will
only make things worse.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (3): Cautious leader of a hesitant party -
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's prestige has collapsed. But is it all his own
fault?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PV Narasimha Rao's political fortunes are at their lowest ebb since he
became prime minister.
Brought in hurriedly to lead the ruling Congress (I) party in mid-1991 after
the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Rao proved remarkably adept at
enhancing his own and his party's power during his first year in office. He
won praise at home and abroad for supervising the launch of India's most
extensive economic reform programme.
But Mr Rao's reputation has slumped since last summer: financial scandal,
growing party concern about the impact of reform on political patronage,
and, above all, Ayodhya have undermined the prime minister's reputation. He
is pilloried as the leader who cannot lead, as a man who cannot take
difficult decisions at a time when India faces hard choices.
There is some truth in the criticisms. But Mr Rao's reluctance to make these
choices is as much a reflection of his party's weaknesses as of his own. It
is as much Congress as Mr Rao which is cautious about pushing ahead further
with economic liberalisation and about mounting a coherent challenge to the
forces of Hindu militancy in the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. For
better or for worse, Congress has the leader which it deserves.
Mr Rao, who was born into a high-caste Brahmin family in 1921 and is a
lawyer by training, won acclaim as a scholar and a poet before going into
politics in his home state of Andhra Pradesh, in the south, in the late
1950s. He worked his way up the Congress party, winning praise for his
skills as a backroom organiser rather than a platform politician.
His first job in Delhi was in 1974, when he became general secretary of the
All-India Congress Committee. He served Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv
Gandhi as foreign minister, home minister and minister for human resource
development.
But while he worked well in the salons of Delhi, he rather neglected his
home state and, unlike other Congress leaders, never built a strong personal
power base.
Loyalty to the Gandhis made Mr Rao an ideal candidate to replace Rajiv
Gandhi in the midst of a general election. He was best able to capitalise on
a wave of public sympathy which brought Congress back to power, propelling
Mr Rao into the prime minister's chair. At the time, many Congress members
did not expect Mr Rao to stay in office long, with other leading figures
such as Mr Arjun Singh, the human resources development minister, and Mr
Sharad Pawar, then defence minister, angling for the top post.
But Mr Rao has skilfully contained the ambitions of both: Mr Pawar has been
sent back to his home state of Maharashtra to deal with the aftermath of the
riots and terrorist bombs in Bombay. Mr Singh remains in Delhi, a thorn in
the prime minister's side, but one he has learnt to live with.
Mr Rao did not have the slightest intention of promoting economic reform
when he came to office. But the reform agenda was thrust upon him by the
mid-1991 balance of payments crisis.
It also provided a good opportunity to steal some of the thunder from the
BJP, which had openly advocated economic liberalisation from the late 1980s.
Mr Rao borrowed their policies wholesale.
Mr Rao's low-key approach helped Dr Manmohan Singh, his finance minister,
secure the support needed for reform. Mr Rao patiently persuaded Congress
members that there was no option but liberalisation if India was to pull out
of the crisis.
But caution and clever tactics have not proved enough to deal with the next
two pressing problems on the agenda - how to pursue further economic reform
and how to deal with the BJP.
As far as further reform is concerned, Mr Rao is probably more than happy to
postpone difficult decisions. His party shows little inclination to make
controversial moves, such as selling loss-making public enterprises,
modernising bankruptcy laws or permitting employers to dismiss redundant
workers.
With economic growth now back at about 5 per cent, foreign exchange reserves
high and exports soaring, Congress members are not at all convinced that
further radical reforms of any kind are necessary, let alone the kind which
might bring job cuts.
The BJP is quite a different matter. Mr Rao has tried to ride out the storm
caused by the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque.
Whether his policy has been right will be shown in the state elections in
the four northern states in November and December. But there are strong
indications that Congress has lost ground to the BJP in the last year and to
the left-of-centre parties including Janata Dal.
For this, Mr Rao is now under intense, if largely silent, pressure from
critics inside Congress, including Mr Arjun Singh. If Congress fares badly
at the polls, these critics will want Mr Rao out.
Congress as a whole is as much to blame as Mr Rao for failing to confront
the BJP successfully. Like the prime minister, the party is plagued with
doubts about whether it is better to confront Hindu militancy or to
compromise with it. The prime minister's personal shortcoming has been his
inability to promote with sufficient force an alternative agenda to the
BJP's religious zeal. Economic reform is such an alternative. But, apart
from Dr Manmohan Singh, no-one in the present cabinet has staked much
political capital on liberalisation. Certainly not Mr Rao.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (2): Ruling party is yearning for a new
Nehru - The tide of Hindu militancy threatens to breach Congress's defences

It is the lull before the storm in Indian politics. For much of the year,
India has been waiting for a settling of accounts over the sacking of the
Ayodhya mosque and the inter-religious violence which it provoked.
Voters will finally have their say in state elections to be held in four
northern states in November and December. The polls will cover nearly a
third of India's population, but their results will be as significant as any
general election.
'The fight will be fairly tough. There's no doubt about it,' says Mr Arjun
Singh, the minister for human resource development and a leading figure in
the ruling Congress (I) party.
The crucial question is the extent to which the Hindu militants who tore
down the mosque have gained or lost from the ensuing upheaval. The betting
is that they have profited handsomely: the Bharatiya Janata party, the
opposition Hindu militant party, is riding high in opinion polls; the ruling
Congress (I) party is in disarray with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, fighting to contain dissent in his ranks. Disenchantment with
Congress runs so deep that even the left-wing parties, weakened by years of
in-fighting, have recently seen a modest revival.
Whatever the voters decide, Ayodhya seems likely to continue to dominate the
political agenda. Just at the time when the government is carrying out the
most extensive economic reforms in 40 years, ministers have little time for
anything but Ayodhya and its consequences.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, concedes in an interview in this
survey that, while the government remains committed to economic reform,
Ayodhya and other issues have diverted attention. Mr P. Chidambaram, a
former commerce minister and a strong advocate of economic reform, puts it
more bluntly: 'When we began the reforms (two years ago), economic reform
was at the top of the agenda. Now it has slipped to third place behind
communalism (relations between religious communities) and the internal
debate in Congress about how to confront the challenge caused by
communalism.'
The Ayodhya mosque's destruction and the violence which followed it caused
widespread revulsion among many middle-class Indians. It brought terror into
the lives of many of the poor in northern cities and in Bombay which bore
the brunt of the unrest.
But even at the height of the violence there were those who cheered the
action of the Hindu militants. Since then, it has steadily become more
acceptable for middle-class Hindus to make public their support for the BJP.
They like the argument that it is time for Hindus to assert themselves; that
Moslems have enjoyed too many favours in a predominantly Hindu country; that
it is time for India to become Hindu.
These sentiments are often vaguely-expressed, but they are powerful. At a
sub-conscious level, they reflect the unease which economic growth and
urbanisation often causes in traditional rural societies. As the
long-standing bonds of regional and caste loyalty weaken, so Indians are
searching for a sense of identity.
As the party which fought hardest for independence, Congress has a strong
nationalist streak in its ideological make-up. But with the independence
struggle now a distant memory, many Hindus find Congress's form of
nationalism too bland. They have also come to distrust the party efforts to
gather support from the nation's minority groups, notably the Moslems. Even
though Moslems have remained poor and socially-disadvantaged, many Hindus
have swallowed the BJP's argument that Moslem 'privileges' must be
restricted - such as the right for family and other personal matters to be
settled by separate Islamic law. Mr KR Mulkani, BJP vice-president, speaks
for a growing number of Hindus when he says: 'It's all right for Moslems to
have a sense of identity. But do they have to stick out like a sore thumb?'
Congress faces a profound dilemma. If it stays with its traditional
supporters, it risks being left behind by the shift in Hindu opinion. If it
drifts to the right to try to absorb the milder elements of Hindu militancy,
it risks alienating not only Moslems but also others who are suspicious of
Hindu militancy such as former untouchables and other disadvantaged castes.
The disadvantaged castes are concerned about Hindu militancy because the
militants' leaders are predominantly high caste people. They fear such
leaders might encroach upon the disadvantaged castes' privileges, such as
special quotas for government jobs.
Concern about the threat to job reservation is driving many low-caste voters
away from Congress and into the arms of Janata Dal, the main left wing
party, and its allies. Mr VP Singh, the Janata Dal leader, has made job
reservation his top issue. To try to recover lost ground, the government
this month extended job reservation from the most disadvantaged groups - the
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes - to the less disadvantaged - the
other backward classes. Fully 49 per cent of government jobs will now be set
aside for the disadvantaged. But it still may not be enough for Congress to
steal Janata Dal's thunder.
Mr Narasimha Rao has from the start headed a minority government, since the
1991 general election left Congress without an absolute majority. Worse,
because its support in 1991 included a wave of sympathy for Rajiv Gandhi,
the recently assassinated Congress leader, the result concealed the true
level of voters' disenchantment with Congress. Mr Rao had a good first year,
with much public recognition for his handling of the 1991 economic crisis.
But since last summer, his support has withered as the BJP has moved centre
stage and forced other parties on to the defensive. According to an opinion
poll published last month in the magazine India Today, Congress would now
secure only 198 out of 537 seats in the lower house of Parliament if a
general election were held - compared with 245 in 1991.
In July, Mr Rao survived a no-confidence motion by just 14 votes, the
narrowest margin ever. In an unprecedented alliance of left and right, the
left-wing parties and the BJP combined to attack the government over Ayodhya
and over corruption charges levelled against Mr Rao by Mr Harshad Mehta, the
stockbroker at the centre of last year's financial scandal.
All is not lost for Congress. In India, issues, even those as contentious as
Ayodhya, are only half the battle in elections. The other half is patronage:
as the party in government, Congress, is as well placed as ever to promise
voters in the four northern states government jobs, building schemes and
other electoral sops. Even straightforward cash bribes are commonplace in
the Indian countryside.
However, it will be very difficult for Congress to come out well in the
forthcoming polls in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
and Himachal Pradesh. All four were ruled by BJP governments until last
December when they were abolished after Ayodhya for allegedly failing to
carry out central government instructions in implementing anti-Hindu
militant measures.
Mr Malkani of the BJP says the party will win all four states - and most
independent commentators agree. Congress's main chance could be to try to
woo centrist splinter groups among the left-of-centre parties. But Janata
Dal and its allies this month announced plans to stand on a united platform.
To improve its prospects, Congress has arranged for the Election Commission,
which supervises polls, to stagger voting over a month, with the first vote
in Himachal Pradesh, where Congress believes it has the best chances. But
even if the polls proceed in this way (a final decision has yet to be
taken), commentators do not see Congress winning even one state. Worse, it
is expected to fare particularly badly in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest
state and the site of Ayohdya.
The BJP says that, if it wins the state polls, it will demand a general
election. Congress is unlikely to oblige. But Mr Rao's enemies are bound to
ask for his head. His critics accuse him of being too soft on the BJP and
urge him to be more forthright in his condemnations of Hindu militancy.
Chief among them is Mr Arjun Singh, who, while publicly protesting his
loyalty to Mr Rao, has fomented dissent. Mr Singh does not hide his
ambitions to be prime minister one day. He is also anxious that Congress
should not lose the fight with the BJP by default.
Fortunately for Congress, the BJP is still some way from winning an overall
majority in a general election. Its power lies in the north; in the south
and west, which include some of India's most prosperous regions, its impact
has so far been weak. Also, in the north, the left-of-centre parties have
recovered some ground, even from the BJP. Congress's support in the south,
its traditional powerbase, has slipped. A big blow this year has been the
loss of support from Ms Jayalalitha, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and
leader of the local DMK party.
The most likely result of a general election would therefore be a three-way
split between Congress, the BJP and the left-of-centre parties. India
Today's opinion poll estimates that while Congress could see its lower house
representation slide from 245 to 198, the BJP's would rise from 119 to 166
and the Janata Dal and the left-of-centre parties' would increase from 136
to 153.
Given its access to patronage, Congress might still emerge as the party of
government. But it would have to strike so many deals with actual and
potential splinter groups that its ability to carry out coherent policies
would be seriously compromised.
This prospect leaves even loyal Congressmen deeply concerned about their
party. Some dream of rebuilding a centrist alliance with Congress at its
core, which would capture support from both the BJP and the left. But they
are at a loss to say what this alliance would stand for; what its ideology
would be. Others talk vaguely of finding a new strong man to lead the party.
More than one says wistfully: 'We need another Nehru.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (1): The obstacles to modernity - Militant
Hindu nationalism has provoked a painful reappraisal of India's political
identity, which could impede the reforms vital to her future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR nearly a year, India has been living in the shadow of the ruins of the
Ayodhya mosque, torn down last December by Hindu militants.
The mosque's destruction and the violence which followed have plunged
Indians into a deep bout of soul-searching about their national identity. It
has left the ruling Congress (I) party seriously concerned about its own
political future. It has harmed relations with Pakistan. And it has consumed
the energy of the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
Economic reform, ministers' top priority until mid-1992, has been pushed
aside by the urgent need to fight the fires started by Ayodhya. There is
little prospect of the economy returning to the top of the agenda at least
until after state elec tions due to be held in northern India later this
year, when Ayodhya will be the main issue. Even afterwards, it is unlikely
that Mr Rao will have the stomach for further radical economic changes.
With luck, the reforms which have already been carried out should enable
India to maintain a steady growth rate of 5-6 per cent in the mid-1990s.
Deregulation is opening India to the world - in the coming years there will
be much more foreign trade and investment. But with the reforms slowing, the
prospect of India astonishing the world by staging a Chinese-style economic
take-off is becoming increasingly remote.
The Congress party's ideal of a secular India, in which Hindus, Moslems and
other religious minorities live together in harmony, seems to have lost its
appeal for many Hindus. They are searching instead for a stronger sense of
national identity and finding it in the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's
calls for greater Hindu self-assertiveness.
The BJP is taking risks by exploiting inter-religious tensions. At least
20,000 Indians have died in Hindu-Moslem violence since independence - more
than 2,000 in the unrest which followed Ayodhya. But violence does not seem
to have cost the BJP much support.
In his Independence Day address last month, Mr Rao warned that India faced
disintegration if religious tensions grew worse. 'Nobody has the right to go
and ask for votes in the name of Hindu, Moslem or Christian religion. No one
has a right to exploit the sentiments of the people by creating a frenzy.'
The BJP's answer is that without a greater sense of being Hindu, India is
nothing. Mr KR Malkani, a party vice-president, says: 'A country the size
and diversity of India cannot be held together without a common culture.
Since there are quite a lot of Hindus here, that culture should be modern
Hindu culture.'
Congress is in a quandary. If it attacks Hindu militancy too aggressively,
it risks alienating Hindus, who, after all, constitute 80 per cent of the
population. But if Congress is soft on militancy, it risks losing its
traditional support among Moslems and low-caste Hindus, who distrust the
high-caste leadership of the BJP. Congress's answer has, so far, been to try
to steer between the two extremes - at the cost of irritating both wings of
its support.
A crucial test of voters' opinion comes in state elections to be held in
November and December in four northern states. All were ruled by BJP
governments until they were suspended for allegedly failing to follow
central government orders after Ayodhya. The BJP expects to win all four.
Congress will be fighting desperately to limit its losses.
If Congress fares badly, Mr Rao will be under pressure from the party to
resign. The BJP would almost certainly repeat demands for an early general
election, but would be unlikely to get one. The present Parliament's term
does not expire until 1996.
The outlook seems to be for prolonged political uncertainty. Congress has
ruled for two years without an overall parliamentary majority. At first, Mr
Rao was able to win support from centrist splinter groups quite easily.
Today he struggles. According to opinion polls, if a general election were
held now Congress would lose seats but would still be the single biggest
party. The BJP would gain MPs but not enough to overtake Congress. While
strong in northern India, the BJP is too weak in the south and west to form
a national government. The centrist Janata Dal and the parties of the left
would remain a potent third force.
None of this bodes well for future economic reform. The government was at
its most energetic immediately after the 1991 balance-of-payments crisis
when the threat of international default galvanised Mr Rao into action. Mr
Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, presided over reforms which, by Indian
standards, were mould-breaking. A panopoly of controls over industry, called
the 'licence Raj', was dismantled; import bans and duties cut; and the rupee
made convertible on the trade account. Public sector spending has been
squeezed. In the financial markets, the key changes include extensive
banking reforms such as the introduction of proper accounting and
provisioning standards. Further reform of finance and foreign trade is in
the pipeline.
But the government has baulked at more far-reaching economic restructuring.
Ministers postponed plans for extending employers' rights to sack redundant
workers, something which is virtually impossible under current legislation.
They have also been half-hearted in pursuit of privatisation, refusing to
countenance the sale of more than 50 per cent of a public sector enterprise.
Little has been done to rationalise the inefficient public sector which
accounts for nearly half the nation's capital but only produces 27 per cent
of its output. The government has also been slow to cut subsidies to farmers
and other politically-privileged groups.
Congress is reluctant to act for fear of hurting interest groups such as
wealthy farmers, bureaucrats and trade unionists who are among the party's
most loyal supporters. MPs rely for patronage on their influence over public
sector appointments and contracts. They would not willingly cut the ground
from under their own feet.
However, ministers may have already done enough to generate steady economic
growth. From a low of 1.2 per cent in 1991-92, economic growth in the year
to the end of March 1994 is forecast to recover to 5 per cent. Inflation has
fallen from a peak of 13.6 per cent to about 6 per cent. Exports are rising
rapidly. There are signs of a strong recovery in industrial output. Foreign
direct investment is starting to flow, albeit at a modest Dollars
100m-Dollars 200m a year.
Moreover, middle-class Indians are beginning to see the benefits of
liberalisation: competition from private airlines has jolted Indian
Airlines, the state-owned domestic carrier, into improving services. Private
satellite television operators have prodded Doordarshan, the state
broadcasting network, into launching better programmes.
Across India, reforms have created big opportunities for entrepreneurs,
particularly in exports. Jewellery makers of Surat, for example; garment
factories in Bombay; software producers Bangalore; car parts manufacturers
in Madras. All have benefited from deregulation and the devaluation of the
rupee. In domestic markets too there are pockets of rapid growth, notably
among the middle-classes for high quality goods and services - within days
of announcing a new model, the Zen, Maruti Udyog, the carmaker, had a
three-year waiting list.
Unfortunately, none of this seems enough to transform the Indian economy. In
the immediate aftermath of the 1991 reforms, there was much talk in Delhi of
India following China into high-speed development.
That now seems rather unlikely. Finance ministry officials expect reforms to
generate sustainable growth of 5-6 per cent a year: that is well worth
having, but it is the same as India enjoyed pre-reform. For a developing
country, it is the economic equivalent of muddling along.
Moreover, there is still a risk that growth might slow. Government
borrowing, which fell sharply after 1991, is now expanding so fast that the
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has sounded the alarm about a
possible resurgence in inflation. Finance ministry officials are concerned
but are under great pressure from Congress to keep spending up at least
until after the state elections.
Also, despite liberalisation, the bureaucracy retains much of its grip. For
example, the Companies Act still requires an enterprise to file no fewer
than 66 different official reports. Armies of inspectors are employed to
supervise the process. The number of separate clearances required,
particularly for large and complex projects, still puts off potential
investors, especially foreigners. Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Creditcapital
Finance Corporation, a merchant bank, says: 'The regulators don't seem to
realise that investors don't have to invest in India. They have other
places.'
Furthermore, there is too little investment in power, transport and other
infrastructure. In the next two or three years, shortages of electricity and
other services will slow growth. In power, for example, the squeeze on
public sector spending limited growth in output in the year to March 1993 to
just 5 per cent, compared with 9 per cent a year in the 1980s. The
government hopes that private companies, including foreign groups, will
close the gap. But private investors have reservations about the terms which
the government is offering. Even if deals were signed tomorrow, it would be
three years or more before the first new large private sector stations came
on stream. Mr Tarun Das, general secretary of the Confederation of Indian
Industry, the employers' body, says: 'We see a very bleak outlook for
infrastructure.'
Finally, the benefits of growth will be restricted to high-growth centres
such as Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore unless the great majority of Indians can
become better trained to participate in the industrialised economy. Decades
of under-investment in primary education has left India among the world's
least literate nations - with just 52 per cent of adults able to read
compared with 73 per cent in China. Except for the oil-rich Gulf states, no
country has achieved economic take-off without also achieving a literacy
rate of 60 per cent. Without better education, India cannot hope to control
population growth, which is running at nearly 25 per cent a decade. By the
year 2000 there will be 1bn Indians.
Some businessmen believe that the only way for India to confront these
problems is at the state level. 'We must abolish the centre,' says one
company chairman in Bombay, who argues that India is too big to govern
centrally and, given its diversity, well suited to decentralisation.
Decentralisation might also take some steam out of separatist movements in
the troubled northern state of Kashmir and elsewhere. But Delhi is too
powerful to surrender control without a struggle. And there is little sign
that the larger states are ready to fight this battle.
By its own standards, the Indian economy is changing out of all recognition.
But by the standards of those developing countries which have achieved
industrial take-off it is moving too slowly. The danger is that without more
reforms there will not be faster growth. Without faster growth there will be
too little money to satisfy many Indians' aspirations.
Dissatisfaction breeds anger and anger spawns Ayodhyas.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Nuclear Electric seeks right to make direct sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned power utility, wants the right to sell
electricity directly to large industrial consumers in the UK, bringing it
into head-on competition with the privatised generation companies.
Nuclear Electric is to apply today to Offer, the power industry regulator,
to become a 'second-tier supplier', which would enable it to enter into
contracts with large consumers. At present, the utility is restricted to
selling into the pool, the wholesale market for electricity.
Although Offer will review the application, Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and
industry secretary, will have the final say.
Nuclear Electric's move, however, will be welcome to the government because
it should sharpen competition in a market where there have been loud
complaints from industrial users about rising prices.
Large companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries, Blue Circle Industries
and British Steel have been demanding government action to adjust
electricity costs in line with those of continental competitors.
If allowed, Nuclear Electric intends to offer 15-year fixed-price contracts
to industrial users with steady 24-hour demand. Its systems are designed to
provide base-load electricity and its costs are not linked to fluctuations
in oil and gas prices.
Dr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Power's chief executive, said he would not be
surprised if National Power and PowerGen, the other big generators, objected
to the application.
'But it has clearly been a real anomaly when we, as a major generator, have
been unable to supply customers directly while in other cases licences have
been issued to companies who have no generating capacity at all.'
PowerGen said: 'We see this as a logical step in the evolution of the
competitive market.' A significant point of concern for the other generators
is that Nuclear Electric should not be allowed to use the Pounds 1.2bn
nuclear levy which it receives from domestic electricity consumers to
subsidise its prices in the industrial market. They are likely to demand
that that should be a condition of the licence.
Nuclear Electric already commands 22 per cent of the electricity market in
England and Wales, but it is keen to establish itself as a leading
generator, in anticipation of the government review of the nuclear power
industry starting at the end of this year.
Its capacity will increase substantially next year with the start-up of
Sizewell B power station. Next year also sees regulatory changes that will
enlarge the market where the generators can sell direct.
Nuclear Electric hopes to obtain its licence by December 1.

FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Slough active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A late buzz of activity in Slough Estates was enough to prompt a raft of
rumours that the company was being closely eyed by British Land and its
partner Quantum Fund. The two groups, the latter headed by the billionaire
investor Mr George Soros, formed a Pounds 1bn partnership earlier this year
to take advantage of the recovering property market. Slough closed 2 up at
254p. Turnover was an above-average 1.4m.
An analyst said that a bid for Slough would need to be pitched at around
Pounds 3 a share to take into account not only the premium to asset value
but the premium in the group's shares to the market.
In the aerospace sector, dealers reported a small amount of switching from
Rolls-Royce into British Aerospace, where the shares retreated sharply in
the last half-hour of trading. They finished 10 down at 420p.
The market cheered the 35 per cent jump in full-year profits to Pounds 9.4m
from engineering group Adwest. The company also said it was making a
one-for-four rights issue at 140p a share to raise Pounds 22.2m for growth
and development as well as acquisitions. The stock raced forward 11 to 183p.
Continuing worries about the weakness in GKN's European markets, along with
the recent profits downgradings from several brokers, saw the shares
continue to slide. They lost 7 to 468p.
Profit-taking was said to be the cause of a decline of 4 1/2 to 192 1/2 p in
T &amp; N, although support was seen for Lucas Industries, which reports figures
next month, and the shares hardened 1 1/2 to 150p.
Full-year profits from Costain were Pounds 69.4m compared to Pounds 2.5m in
1992, although this was largely due to the sale of Australian coal mines.
The company also announced a Pounds 83.9m rights issue, bringing much-needed
funds to the indebted house builder. Building analysts are forecasting 1994
profits of around Pounds 15m. Turnover reached 11m shares and the stock
finished 4 stronger at 37p.
Berkeley Group climbed 6 to 439p as SG Warburg upgraded its profits
forecast, but later fell back to 432p as the gain was consolidated.
Chemicals were noticeably quiet, drifting with the market. ICI receded 6 to
714p.
Textiles concern Dawson International eased 2 to 194p as talk of downgrades
were heard ahead of an institutional presentation today.
Electricity utility shares came out of the doldrums to score sizeable gains,
with yield considerations again being mentioned as the reason. Among those
moving forward, South Wales was up 13 to 614p, Northern 8 to 605p and Manweb
8 to 611p.
Shares in international mining group RTZ came under pressure on weakening
metal prices and after James Capel was reported to have downgraded profits
estimates The stock lost 17 to 684p, with Capel said to have reduced its
current year estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 375m.
Worries ahead of the UK Budget in November about possible tax increases on
tobacco were said to have been responsible for falls in several
tobacco-related stocks. BAT Industries shed 9 to 485p and Rothmans
International 'B' 11 to 635p.
The broker profits downgradings in international conglomerate Hanson earlier
this week, in the wake of the continuing strike at Peabody, its US coal
operation, continued to exact a toll. The shares ended 4 1/4 lower at 249
1/4 p. Volume was 6.5m.
Royal Bank of Scotland shares were once again boosted by speculation that
the bank was planning to float off its Direct Line Insurance business. They
rose 8 to 324p.
Penna tumbled 35 to 130p after the company warned of a 'modest loss' in the
first half.
Lloyd Thompson recovered 5 to 288p, with Strauss Turnbull and NatWest
Securities said to be recommending the stock. SG Warburg advanced 7 to 791p
as dealers assessed the benefits of the sale of Mirror Group Newspapers
shares.

FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce rises
</HEADLINE>

Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce firmed 2 to 149p on suggestions that
the rump of its Pounds 307m rights issue had been placed.
Researchers were surprised by reports of an 87 per cent take-up of the
issue, in view of the poor sentiment that initially greeted the cash call.
Hoare Govett, the group's broker, was understood to have successfully placed
the rump of around 31m shares yesterday at 145p, following a bought deal in
which it is believed to have paid 144 1/2 p for each of the shares. The
stock was said to have been quickly taken up, with two large institutions
purchasing the majority.
However, concern remains that part of the new shares may have been taken up
by overseas institutions. Earlier this year Rolls-Royce said that overseas
holdings had reached 29.5 per cent, the limit allowed under its articles of
association. The owners of the new stock will not be known until the
registration date of October 25, but analysts are confident that the
government will soon make an announcement raising that ceiling to around 49
per cent.
Mr Brian Newman at agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite remains positive on
Rolls-Royce and predicted: 'With the balance sheet straightened, and the
raising of the limit on foreign holdings, the shares could rise to the
original issue price of 170p.' Closing volume on the Seaq screen remained at
3.1m shares.

The placing of the 54.8 per cent holding in Mirror Group Newspapers
belonging to the late Mr Robert Maxwell's private companies finally went
ahead yesterday, after a week of intensive pre-placing by brokers for the
companies' administrators. More than 219m shares were placed with a variety
of institutions, although the strike price of 170p was a little below that
which had been expected. The sale raised Pounds 373m.
One dealer involved in the placing reported that there was virtually no
stock coming back into the market from the offer and that this had been a
main plank in the share price's support yesterday. The stock closed at the
170p strike price, down 7. Media analysts said the stock was unlikely to go
very far in the short term as the whole sector fretted over the threat of
VAT on newspapers in the November budget, and the impact of the recent price
war among the press.

FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet deal welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer division by Grand Metropolitan
finally took place yesterday, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle clinching the deal
in a move warmly welcomed by industry analysts.
S&amp;N will pay Pounds 736m for the 1,600-strong chain of public houses and
restaurants, which at a stroke gives it the competitive presence in
south-east England it has so far lacked. However, the group will have to
sell or otherwise untie some 748 houses from its enlarged estate to comply
with the government's Beer Orders.
S&amp;N shares retreated on the news, with inevitable worries over the Pounds
405m one-for-four rights issue the main culprit. The issue, which is of
stock units automatically convertible into new ordinary shares, is in two
stages at a total price equivalent to 390p per share. S&amp;N finished the day
11 off at 459p in turnover of 2.9m. Analysts broadly agreed with S&amp;N that
the deal will be earnings neutral this year.
For GrandMet, the deal was the third big surprise to hit the market in the
past four sessions, following on from the senior management changes
announced last Friday and the Pounds 175m restructuring charge on Monday.
Industry specialists said the S&amp;N price was a fair one and the deal
benefited from relief that Chef &amp; Brewer was not parcelled off, as had been
predicted at one time. GrandMet shares leapt on the news but faded to close
a net 2 off at 416p. Turnover was another considerable 8.1m.
Whitbread had long been the market favourite to land Chef &amp; Brewer. However,
specialists now expect the group to turn its attention to the Harvester
chain, owned by Forte, which is also concentrated in the south-east, and
this was reflected in Whitbread 'A' shares, 12 lower at 529p. The asking
price for Harvester could be in excess of Pounds 100m. Some optimists were
even suggesting that an announcement could accompany Forte's results this
morning. Forte shares were steady at 237p.

FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRENGTH of the stock index futures sector was tested yesterday when the
outcome of the auction in the UK gilt-edged market briefly cast a cloud over
equities, writes Terry Byland.
Traders admitted that there was some selling of both equities and the
December contract on the Footsie, although both sectors rallied before the
close of business.
Some good-sized buying was reported in the first half-hour of trading but
confidence was soon undermined when bonds turned down. The December contract
bounced against its fair value several times before rallying to close at a
premium of 32 against the cash market. This showed a premium of around 8
points above fair value, the estimated premium which allows for dividend and
financing flows. Trading volume was down to 9,026 contracts, which traders
considered a satisfactory level for the penultimate trading session of the
third quarter of the year.
Activity in traded options was around one-third lower at 23,364 contracts.
The FT-SE 100 option, at 9,354 lots, recorded a sharp fall from Tuesday's
total of just above 18,000. The Euro FT-SE option was fairly busy at 3,436
contracts, while BP headed the list of individual stock options, turning
over 2,110 deals as the market continued to track the Opec meeting. Also
attracting interest was Tesco (1,103 contracts).

FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally after early
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES in the London stock market were overshadowed yesterday by
tonight's close of trading for the third quarter of the year and also by an
uncertain response to the auction of Pounds 3.25bn in British government
securities. Profit-takers held sway for most of the session but equities
rallied towards the close as gilt-edged securities turned higher.
Once again, international factors took a back seat in a stock market focused
nearer home. Optimism on domestic interest rates receded somewhat as
sterling eased and markets assessed prospects for the UK November budget and
the season of annual conferences of political parties.
Fund managers' attention was captured by two significant corporate
developments, and rumours of at least one other big share placing on the
engineering pitch, as well as by a Pounds 511m batch of rights issues.
Stock index futures continued to affect equities, and some stock was sold in
the afternoon when the December contract on the FT-SE Index challenged its
Fair Value premium, effectively for the first time since the contract took
over leadership of the derivatives sector. Strength in the future premium
has given important support to this week's gains in equities.
Although easier at first, shares tried to rally in early trading. But a 1.8
gain on the Footsie was quickly reversed as the time for the gilt-edged
auction drew near. First reports from the auction were badly received in the
stock market and the Footsie was soon down more than 14 points at 3,022.6.
It was late in the session before shares began to rally on the back of gains
in gilts and an initially firm start to the new Wall Street session.
However, the recovery was checked when the Dow Industrial Average turned off
and showed a fall of 1.12 in UK trading hours.
The final reading of 3,030.1 gave the FT-SE Index a net loss on the day of
6.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also subdued, closing 3.2 off at 3,434.4.
The big news of the day came early and occupied the attention of many big
institutions. Grand Metropolitan announced the sale for Pounds 736m of its
Chef and Brewer subsidiary to Scottish and Newcastle, a rival brewing group;
Scottish and Newcastle hit the market with a Pounds 405m rights call to help
fund the deal.
The expected placing of 54.8 per cent of Mirror Group newspapers for a total
of Pounds 373m made further demands on fund managers' time and cash
resources. While neither deal was unexpected, they helped distract attention
from other sectors while also indicating the readingness of the institutions
to accept to what are regarded as favourable corporate moves.
Seaq trading volume dipped to 511.7m shares, the lowest so far this week,
and contrasting with 603.3m on Tuesday; non-Footsie business made up around
60 per cent of the total. The reduced volume as the market fell suggested
that profit-taking was modest.
When the market was rising on Monday and Tuesday, retail or customer
activity reached Pounds 1.25bn abd Pounds 1.69bn respectively, both
indicating strong investment support from the institutions.
At the close of trading, the stock market was enlivened by hints that more
large corporate deals, or takeover moves, were in the pipeline.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Lower futures and bonds
restrain Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS ended little changed across the board yesterday after declining
stock index futures and bond prices kept a lid on investor enthusiasm,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.28 up at 3,566.30. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.41 down at 460.12, while the
Nasdaq composite eased 0.49 to 763.17. New York SE volume was 277.8m shares.
Although prices got off to a positive start, with the Dow climbing 10 points
in the first hour of trading, the markets were unable to sustain their early
momentum.
Two factors brought stocks back down from their highs: lower bond prices (by
late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government issue was down
three-quarters of a point and the yield up to 5.987 per cent) and falling
stock index futures. Traders said the latter was caused by the failure of
the S &amp; P 500 stock index contract to push through a technical resistance
level.
The day's only economic news - a small upward revision in the second-quarter
gross domestic product figure from 1.8 per cent growth to 1.9 per cent -
failed to lift sentiment. Investors will get a better idea of the state of
the economy today and tomorrow when personal income and consumption figures
and the September purchasing managers' report are released.
Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 79 1/2 in busy trading
after Blockbuster Entertainment announced it was investing Dollars 600m in
Viacom, which is attempting to buy Paramount. The news left Blockbuster
Dollars  1/4 easier at Dollars 29 and Viacom down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars
59 1/2 . QVC, which has also made a bid for Paramount, firmed Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 59 5/8 on the Nasdaq market.
Leading technology stocks, some of which have been in demand lately, ran
into concerted selling pressure. Motorola fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 101
5/8 , Digital Equipment gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 37 and IBM slipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 .
Rising crude oil prices lifted oil shares. Chevron moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2
to Dollars 97, Mobil Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 , Exxon Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 66 1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/2 .
Phillips Petroleum advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 7/8 after the
company announced a new oil find off the Louisiana shore. Anadarko
Petroleum, up Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 47 1/8 , and Amoco, Dollars 2 1/2
stronger at Dollars 57 7/8 , are partners in the oil field.
Among Nasdaq stocks, Braintree Savings Bank jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 16
1/2 after the company said it was in preliminary merger talks with an
unnamed bank.
Aames Financial plunged Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 8 3/8 after issuing a
profits warning that surprised analysts.
Canada
TORONTO finished a sluggish trading session mildly higher as investors
continued to hug the sidelines amid election and currency worries. The TSE
300 index added 4.3 at 3,983.2 and rises led declines by 379 to 324 after
volume of 55.3m shares.
Eight of the 14 stock groups lost ground, however, led by transportation,
which fell 2.06 per cent. Mining, industrial products and golds declined,
but the energy sector advanced 2.30 per cent.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers from
intraday decline below 20,000

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-linked selling took the Nikkei average below 20,000 at one point,
but it recovered some ground on index-linked buying in the afternoon,
agencies report from Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 95.31 lower at 20,077.41. It fell to a two-month low of
19,927.69 in mid-morning as initial declines set off unwinding of
arbitrage-linked trade, and hit a high of 20,156.72 later in the day.
Volume rose from 235m shares to 300m. Declines led advances by 625 to 368,
with 200 issues unchanged, and the broader first section Topix index was
down 5.21 at 1,617.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.74 to
1,246.99.
The market's opening weakness defied hopes that investment trusts and
government insurance and pension funds would continue to buy, as they did on
Tuesday, to prop up the value of equities. Brokers said their presence was
minimal.
However, others said attention had simply moved elsewhere. 'The Nikkei's
fall below 20,000 is not very significant, as investors are now focusing on
trading incentive-backed issues that are not in the average,' commented Mr
Masaharu Sakudo, managing director at Tachibana Securities. 'Buying from
investment trusts', he added, 'was also limited to shares which are not in
the Nikkei average.'
News that major steel makers were considering giving extra days off to
employees to cope with weak demand for steel depressed their share prices.
Kawasaki Steel fell Y8 to Y303, NKK Y12 to Y263 and Kobe Steel Y9 to Y276.
Retailers remained firm on hopes that possible income tax cuts and
deregulation would benefit them. York-Benimaru climbed Y150 to Y4,650 and
Ito-Yokado Y90 to Y5,540. Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed, with Seoul and Karachi closed for public
holidays.
HONG KONG perceived late buying of property issues by US and Japanese funds
which took the Hang Seng index up 80.60 to 7,551.10. Turnover grew from
HKDollars 2.19bn to HKDollars 2.49bn.
Henderson Land, which announced strong results last week, moved ahead 40
cents to HKDollars 23.50, while Cheung Kong advanced an adjusted 54 cents to
HKDollars 27.30.
AUSTRALIA picked up after a slow start, the All Ordinaries index ending 9.1
higher at 1,951.4 after some end-of-quarter window dressing. News Corp rose
12 cents to a closing high of ADollars 10.92 in volume of 4.38m shares.
BHP added 16 cents at ADollars 16.16 after saying that it did not know
whether its diamond mine project in Canada with a joint venture partner, Dia
Met Minerals, would proceed. Development costs could be about USDollars
400m.
MANILA surged at the close as investors flocked to Philippine Long Distance
Telephone and Philippine National Bank after the sharp fall of the peso
against the dollar. The market index rose 21.29 to 1,982.41.
PLDT added 60 pesos at 1,480 pesos and PNB 17.50 at 352.50.
NEW ZEALAND continued to consolidate, with some analysts predicting that the
current quiet phase would continue until the November 6 election. The
NZSE-40 Capital index closed 3.27 off at 1,926.68 in turnover of NZDollars
38m.
TAIWAN saw selling of speculative stocks and pessimism over a lack of
positive news. The weighted index lost 15.77 to 3,832.69 in slow turnover of
TDollars 11.27bn ahead of today's public holiday. China Steel shed 60 cents
to TDollars 17.80 on media reports that the government was again making
plans to resume its privatisation of the company this fiscal year, although
a timetable and details have not been decided.
SINGAPORE was flat as the corporate reporting season headed for its close at
the end of this week. The Straits Times Industrial index edged up 0.14 to
1,989.28.
BOMBAY became nervous as the income tax authorities said they were seizing
proxy held shares of a number of companies. The BSE-30 index declined 53.59
to 2,696.45.
Four weeks ago, prices fell sharply after the tax authorities seized shares
of nine companies which, they said, belonged to Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker
who is at the centre of a securities scandal.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela strengthens ahead of
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela showed the best performance in dollar terms last week among the
world's emerging markets as investors reacted positively to comments by Mr
Rafael Caldera, the independent candidate in the forthcoming presidential
elections.
Nevertheless, specialists in the market remain nervous about the medium term
direction of equities, and forecast unsettled trading ahead of polling day,
scheduled for the beginning of December.
Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities says that a number of
factors encouraged trading in Venezuela last week. These included comments
by Mr Caldera that, in general, economic and financial reform policies
initiated by the current administration would be continued; an apparent lull
in the recent spate of terrorist bombings; and stability in the level of
int-erest rates, currently at some 50 per cent.
Access to foreign investment in Venezuela is concentrated in ADRs traded in
New York, says Mr Laffan. There are around eight ADRs, a high number for the
region when compared with Colombia's one and Chile's four, and this broad
access has also contributed to the market's rise.
Turkey featured once again last week in the table compiled by the IFC, the
private sector arm of the World Bank. Global Securities in Istanbul comments
that bullish sentiment over nine-month earnings expectations, and enthusiasm
for shares in companies on the government's privatisation list, have
continued to push the market forward.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat falls 5.1% after rights
issue announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT's rights issue weighed heavily on Italian equities, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN demonstrated its displeasure with Fiat's record cash raising package,
marking the shares down by 5.1 per cent. The Comit index shed 8.74 or 1.5
per cent to 593.98 as selling widened to envelop many of the blue chip
issues.
Although long rumoured, the Fiat rights issue still took many analysts by
surprise. They had expected the group to wait until next year, after the
launch of some important new models. It fell L302 to L5,598 in heavy volume
of 24m shares.
Rinascente, the retail group, remained suspended: Fiat is to offer its 58
per cent stake to shareholders. Fiat's financial services company, Ifil,
which is to launch its own public offer for Rinascente, was also suspended
yesterday.
Mr John Stewart, of InterEuropa, in Milan said that the market's response
would have been more positive if Rinascente had been sold outside the group.
He said that the entire package would improve significantly Fiat's net debt
position, improving the prospects for eventual recovery, although he
cautioned that sales in a sluggish car market next year still posed a major
problem for the company.
Among companies which are to participate in a syndicate of Fiat investors,
Generali, the insurer, shed L1,090 to L39,250 and Mediobanca, the merchant
bank, fell L210 to L15,600.
Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan believed that the rights issue
alone accounted for yesterday's fall in the Fiat share price and that the
market would remain volatile as investors turned their attention to the
group's much higher than expected L966bn first half pretax loss.
Mr Bob Barber of James Capel in London commented: 'The size of the rights
issue, the extent of the losses and disappointment that Fiat has not found
an external buyer for Rinascente suggest to us that the share could fall to
L5,000 in the cum rights form.'
FRANKFURT saw strength in insurers, and weakness in steels and engineers as
the broad market continued to drift, and the DAX index closed 5.92 lower at
1,907.69.
Among insurers, Allianz saw a reiterated buy recommendation from Vereins-und
Westbank, which added a likely improvement in underwriting losses and a
growing demand for insurance products to the recent downtrend in interest
rates. The shares eased only DM1 to DM2,554, and showed a small gain on the
day in the post-bourse. However, the highly capitalised, but relatively
illiquid AMB and Munich Re continued to star in share price terms, with
gains of DM40 to DM1,300, and DM50 to DM3,250 respectively.
At the heavy end of the economy, the metal employers' cancellation of wage
contracts was seen as an abrasive move. Deutsche Babcock fell by another DM3
to DM185.50, Metallgesellschaft by DM6 to DM348 and Mannesmann, already
weakened by its rights issue, by DM4.30 more to DM305.50.
PARIS continued to mark time and the CAC-40 index settled slightly higher,
up 6.83 at 2,126.80.
There was some activity among non-CAC-40 stocks with Eridania Beghin-Say
gaining FFr21 to FFr816 after its announcement late on Tuesday that it was
interested in acquiring Bertolli, the Italian olive oil producer. Bic, the
pen and razor manufacturer, lost FFr89 or 6.7 per cent to FFr1,236,
reflecting disappointment with its first half results, which also came out
after trading closed on Tuesday.
There was renewed confusion over the timetabling of BNP's privatisation
after a report in the local media that the date had been set for next week
was denied by the government. A finance ministry official reiterated that
the public sale of the 40 per cent stake would take place before Christmas.
The bank's CIs shed FFr5.80 to FFr277.
MADRID's general index eased 0.15 to 286.62 but Acerinox, the stainless
steel company, recovered Pta290 to Pta9,290 after losing Pta400 in heavy
volume on Tuesday.
Between 2.4m and 3m of Acerinox's shares are currently being placed,
representing the bulk of Banesto's 34.5 per cent stake in the company.
Pricing will take place after the close today, following roadshows on the
stock in London on Tuesday, and in Edinburgh yesterday. James Capel liked
Acerinox in August, saying that despite industry conditions, output was
rising, the company was generating profits, and that it also had a sound
balance sheet.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower with early morning activity failing to follow
through into late trading. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 124.0.
A slightly weaker dollar also pressured stocks, with Unilever and Akzo both
slipping Fl 1.00 to Fl 197.20 and Fl 171.50 respectively.
STOCKHOLM weakened in spite of a gain in Ericsson, the telecommunications
group, which saw the B shares advance to a new all-time high, up SKr4 at
SKr436. The shares were supported by US buying which helped to push turnover
up to SKr182m.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.2 to 1,289.4 in turnover down to
SKr1.1bn from Tuesday's SKr1.4bn.
ISTANBUL fell back as investors locked in recent profits, the composite
index closing 450.9 lower at 15,326.3.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Revision fails to boost dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL upwards revision to second-quarter gross domestic product figures in
the US did little to enhance the dollar's fortunes yesterday, writes Emma
Tucker.
The revision, from 1.8 per cent to 1.9 per cent, was welcome but not enough
to dispel market views that the economy is recovering only slowly.
Dealers noted that even after the revision, the US economy would need to
grow by around 2.7 per cent in the second half of the year to achieve the
official 1993 forecast for growth of 2 per cent.
The continuing strength of the D-Mark further hindered the US currency. The
D-Mark was buoyed by the unwinding of political tensions in Russia, and by
the Bundesbank's recent money market oper-ations, in particular its decision
to set a fixed repo rate at 6.70 per cent, unchanged for three weeks. This
signalled that an early German rate cut is unlikely.
The dollar closed at DM1.6135, down from a previous DM1.6175. It was also
slightly weaker against the yen, ending at Y105.15 compared with Y105.25. In
New York the US currency fin-ished at DM1.6135 and Y105.05.
European currencies were sluggish against the D-Mark, with the market still
pushing for interest rate cuts to spur growth. The Portuguese central bank
intervened to support the escudo, which was suffering from rumours about a
change in the Portuguese government's foreign exchange policy. The escudo
closed slightly firmer at Es102.8 from a previous Es103.2.
Sterling opened lower and remained weak. D-Mark strength had much to do with
its lacklustre performance, although next week's Conservative party
conference is keeping prospects for an interest rate cut alive.
However, many dealers are sceptical that Mr Kenneth Clarke is ready to cut
the cost of borrowing. 'Thoughts of a politically motivated rate cut are
remote,' said Mr Stephen Hannah of IBJ International, the Japanese
securities house.
Mr Brian Martin of Citibank, the US bank, agrees: 'A rate cut would damage
the anti-inflation credibility of Eddie George and Kenneth Clarke, and they
would not want a rate cut to look so obviously politically motivated.'
The pound finished 1 1/4 pfennigs down at DM2.4400. Against the dollar it
was little changed at Dollars 1.5125.
With movement in European currencies slight, the troubles of the Canadian
dollar caught the attention of some London analysts.
They said the Canadian dollar had reached critical levels and was hovering
close to CDollars 1.33 against the US currency. 'A drop to this level could
signal a much bigger depreciation,' said one analyst.
The Canadian currency's weakness has been prompted by concern over the
budget deficit and the prospect of federal elections next month. It closed
at CDollars 1.3285 against the US dollar.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Liquidity tight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS IN the London money market were difficult yesterday, with the
Bank of England slow to remove a Pounds 1.15bn shortage.
The overnight lending rate was stuck between 6 3/4 and 7 per cent in the
morning, before falling to just above 6 per cent in the early afternoon
after the Bank purchased Pounds 670m of bills. Late assistance of Pounds
455m cleared the shortage.
The short sterling futures contract dropped back, partly because the pound
was weakening on the foreign exchanges but also because of lingering
expectations for a rate cut over the next two weeks.
Dealers in the money markets are less convinced of an early rate reduction
than their counterparts in the foreign exchange and equity markets, however.
'We are moving back towards the feeling that we had about three weeks ago
that interest rates are likely to come down at the time of the Budget on
November 30,' said one dealer. 'We do not believe that we are about to see a
rate cut for political reasons, either this week during the Labour party
conference, or next week when the Conservatives meet.'
The December contract dropped as low as 94.34 before closing at around
94.35, down 4 basis points on the day.
The three-month interbank rate was quoted yesterday at 6-5 7/8 per cent,
reflecting scepticism about an early cut in rates.
Dealers are expecting a big shortage today with the close of the month, the
end of the quarter and - for some institutions - the end of the half-year
coinciding. In addition, yesterday's gilts auction needs to be paid for
today, so conditions may well be awkward.
A decision by the Bundesbank to drain the German money market of liquidity
took dealers by surprise. They had expected a more generous allocation of
repo funds in the tender, but in the end the central bank took DM8.5bn from
the system.
All the funds were allocated at 6.7 per cent, with the Bundesbank choosing
not to offer a lower rate.
In spite of the withdrawal of funds, call money edged slightly lower,
indicating that there are ample reserves in the system before the beginning
of next month, when yesterday's repo funds will be credited. Call money was
quoted at 6.80-6.90 per cent yesterday afternoon.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Flood of CIS aluminium 'shows
no sign of abating'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOOD of aluminium to the West from the former Soviet Union shows no
sign of abating, the European Aluminium Association heard yesterday.
Mr Dag Flaa, the association's chairman, said that aluminium exports from
the Commonwealth of Independent States into Western Europe had more than
quadrupled between 1990 and 1992, and had continued to grow in the
first-half of this year. 'This has led to an unprecedented expected export
level in 1993 of 630,000 tonnes to the European markets and 1.4m to 1.5m
tonnes worldwide,' he said.
The EAA clearly expects the European Community limit of 60,000 tonnes on CIS
imports in the four months between August and November to be extended.
Yesterday Mr Dick Dermer, the association's president, suggested that the US
and Japan should follow suit with quotas of their own. Mr Flaa said that the
influx of CIS metal to traditional western markets was more or less
equivalent to the increase in world stocks of primary aluminium. This left
'no doubt that the present imbalance in the aluminium market is primarily a
consequence of the eastern metal'.
World total primary aluminium stocks amount to around 4.6m tonnes, of which
more than 2m tonnes is in London Metal Exchange warehouses. Western world
production is 15m tonnes, with demand at 15.5m tonnes a year. Best estimates
put CIS output around 3m tonnes.
Mr Flaa said the European industry had tried to negotiate with the Russian
industry before approaching the European Commission. The EAA accepted that
the Russian industry should have access to traditionally western markets,
and that over a reasonable period the Russian industry would be assimilated
into the world aluminium industry.
'But it is very unfortunate that it takes place under circumstances so
detrimental to our industry as is the cased today' said Mr Flaa. Why should
the aluminium industry carry the main burden of economic restructuring in
Russia? he asked.
The EAA, whose members employ 235,000 people, hopes that the EC quota
decision will lead to further negotiations with the Russians and a long-term
solution to the problem.
Mr Karl Wobbe, of Germany's VAW Aluminium, warned that world capacity had to
be reduced by at least 1m tonnes. But it was an international problem, he
said, and the burden should not fall on the shoulders of the EC, Russia or
the US alone.
Further price falls would be a disaster, he suggested, adding that at
Dollars 900 a tonne no aluminium smelters in the world would be making
money.
Mr Dermer said that last year European primary aluminium producers were
operating at 93.9 per cent of capacity and produced a total of 3.35m tonnes,
down 5.2 per cent on 1991. This year European production is expected to fall
a further 3.3 per cent to 3.24m tonnes. National trade statistics showed
that CIS imports to the West rose from 443,000 tonnes in 1991 to 750,000
tonnes last year, of which about 80 per cent arrived in European countries.
However, a further 200,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium is thought to have been
shipped from the CIS to western markets in 1992, bringing the total near 1m
tonnes. Most of this went directly into LME warehouses and was not cleared
by customs, Mr Dermer said.
Consumption in Europe grew from 4.68m tonnes to 4.76m tonnes in 1992. But
this year consumption is expected to fall slightly because of the economic
recession, particularly in Germany.

are good, with generally under 10pc passed in. Prices have been firm or
slightly dearer and the market indicator in Australia on September 29 was
433c/kg, unchanged from a week earlier. Problems in getting the Budget
through have helped to cause weakness in the Australian dollar in recent
weeks, and this enhances wool's cheapness in international terms. Strength
in the wool market is not matched in tops and yarns where pricing is
intensely competitive.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: French see faults in Blair
House foundations - Why feelings are running so high over the farm trade
accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE heart of France's differences with Brussels as well as Washington
over the Blair House agreement on farm trade is the fact that it starts from
different assumptions.
To begin with, French agriculture weighs far more heavily in the political
and emotional life of the country than the 3.5 per cent it contributes to
gross domestic product. Equally important for the tricky transatlantic
negotiations now in train, the French also adopt differing technical
assumptions about the course of the European Community's's common
agriculture policy over the intended six-year life of the Blair House
accord.
It is, of course, taken as read in Paris that the EC should not agree to
anything in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that constrains its
farmers more than CAP reform already does. Yet in the most important
commodity - cereals - the calculation in Paris is that by 1999, likely to be
the final year of a Gatt farm accord, the EC will have a surplus of at least
15m tonnes, which it would be unable to sell on the world market because of
the Blair House requirement for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of
subsidised exports by the end of the century. By contrast, the European
Commission reckons that at worst the community will end up with a surplus of
around 1.5m tonnes, which could easily be offloaded as food aid.
Why the big difference in Paris and Brussels' guesstimates? As a senior
French official explains, there are two reasons. First, in contrast to
Brussels, which is forecasting productivity gains by cereal farmers of 1 per
cent or less over the next six years, France predicts that the average EC
cereal yield will continue to grow by 1.5 per cent a year. 'This corresponds
to average EC yield growth, and to rather less than French producitivity
gains, in recent years,' says the official.
Why the continued growth in yields when CAP reform is supposed to make
European agriculture less intensive, and when French use of fertilisers has
been declining from its 1989-90 peak? 'Many of our farmers have realised,
partly for environmental reasons, they were using too much fertiliser on
their land, and with the help of an agriculture ministry campaign known as
'Fertimieux' we have been showing them how to grow as much with less input,'
the official says. 'We also expect continued yield advances from genetics
and the use of hybrids.'
Secondly, Paris is more pessimistic than Brussels about how much of their
home market EC farmers will be able to take back from imports, mainly from
the US. 'The commission thinks this 'reconquest' of the home market will
amount to 12m tonnes by 1999,' the official says. 'We reckon it will only be
7m-10m tonnes, partly because of recent agri-monetary developments and the
competitiveness of US cereal substitutes like corn gluten feed.'
On the agri-monetary issue, Paris is hardly innocent, having recently voted
to back Bonn's request for a farm price rise outside Germany to neutralise
the possibility of a farm price cut inside Germany. Confronted with this,
French officials merely chuckle, implying that this move had to be the
trade-off for Germany backing France's campaign to re-open the Blair House
dossier.
On the issue of imports into the EC, however, France is pushing for either a
tariff quota to be placed on corn gluten feed (present quantities getting a
duty free quota and any extra imports being hit by a tariff), or for the EC
to balance any extra imports with compensating freedom to export. Here
France has support from many member states, and the community has some
margin of manoeuvre in the current transatlantic talks, because market
access was not dealt with in the Blair House accord.
If the US proves unshakable in its Blair House commitment to the 21 per cent
cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and if the EC therefore ends the
century with an annual 'non-exportable' surplus of some 15m tonnes, the
community has only two choices, according to the French government.
Either it doubles its acreage set-aside provisions to 30 per cent; 'One per
cent of land set aside would reduce output by about 1m tonnes', says the
official - but many French farmers already contest, or detest, having to
take even 15 per cent of their land out of production; or the EC could move
to much lower prices with an American-style deficiency payment system to
make up the loss in farmers' incomes. 'But such payments would be very
expensive for the community budget and taxpayers, while even lower prices
would pose particular problems for certain member states like Germany, where
small-scale, high-cost farmers in its western region would find it hard to
sell anything,' says the official.
On beef, Paris and Brussels are not far apart in their appreciation of the
problem, with the commission recognising that the EC might still have a
difficult-to-export surplus of some 400,000 tonnes by 1999. But poultry
production has soared in recent years - up by 30 per cent from 1986-89, used
as the base period for the Blair House deal - in reponse to world-wide
demand for white meat. Behind its demand for some flexibility on the timing
of the Blair House volume cuts is the French government's concern that 'a
strict application of Blair House would give a reduction of 25 per cent in
the first year alone'.
For all their own number-crunching about Blair House's nefarious effects,
when it comes to painting their nightmare scenario French officials reach
for a recent Canadian Wheat Board study. This, they claim, postulates a 2
per cent increase in world demand up to the year 2002 - which is reasonable
given that some world market estimates reckon on demand growing as much as 5
per cent.
The US and Canada would be able to respond to this greater demand because a
Gatt deal would bear far less heavily on their exports (deficiency payments
being an allowable form of direct income support), while the EC would be
stuck with much of its present support system and therefore a large
unexportable surplus. The upshot is that the EC share of the world cereals
market would drop from its present 20 per cent to 8-14 per cent. 'We just
couldn't allow that', concludes the French official.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes cheesed off over
colouring ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH dairy industry has appealed to the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, to intervene to reverse a ruling by European industry ministers
that could seriously damage Danish exports of feta cheese.
The Danes export 80 to 100 tonnes of feta a year, mainly to Iran, which buys
50 to 70 tonnes and is the biggest single market for Danish cheese measured
by volume. Greece and Egypt are other important markets.
The Danish feta is made from cow's milk, unlike the traditional feta cheese
of the eastern European and near eastern countries, which is made from
goat's or sheep's milk.
The community's industry ministers, meeting on Monday, approved a directive
concerning the use of colouring agents in foods.
One of the additives that will be banned from now on is 'patent-blue',
without the use of which Danish feta would be the colour of cheddar cheese.
The Danish dairy industry believes that it will be impossible to sell yellow
feta in its main markets.
The value of the export is between DKr1.2bn (Pounds 125m) and 1.5bn a year,
including EC export restitution payments of DKr7.59 a kilogram. This is
about a quarter of total Danish cheese export returns, worth some DKr5.6bn
in 1992.
Mr Peter Kjelstrup, information director at MD Foods, the big dairy group,
blamed lobbying by the Greeks for Monday's decision. Greece has tried to
prevent exports of Danish feta to Greece on the grounds that it is not made
from the right raw materials.

SERIOUS FUEL shortages, the latest manifestation of economic crisis in the
former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, are threatening the cotton harvest
there, reports Reuter from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
Foreign Ministry official Mr Suleiman Rashidov said cotton harvesters faced
'great difficulties' and there was little immediate prospect that conditions
would improve. 'The cotton harvest is still on schedule, but there are great
difficulties now,' he added. An agriculture ministry official said fuel was
available for only 40 per cent of the country's tractors.
Supplies of fuel to Russian and other military units guarding Tajikistan's
frontier against guerrilla attacks from Afghanistan were unaffected by the
shortages, a local journalist quoted a military officer as saying.
Official Tajik radio broadcast a plea from the region of Gorno-Badakhshan
where it said the harvest was being gathered by hand. If extra assistance
was not given some 30 per cent might be wasted, it said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices dive despite
approach of export curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES plunged in London yesterday, almost on the eve of the
commencement of the producers' export retention scheme that had helped to
drive the market to recent 2 1/2 -year highs.
As doubts crept in about the impact and longevity of the scheme to withhold
20 per cent of output, which comes into operation tomorrow, the November
futures price at the London Commodity Exchange tumbled to Dollars 1,186 a
tonne, down Dollars 59 on the day and nearly Dollars 150 below the
late-August high. But it was still some Dollars 270 above the level ruling
when the rally took off in July.
The problem was that there had, until now, been no significant setback to
the rally, explained Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI, the
London trade house. And he noted that the sustained advance had taken place
in very thin market volume.
Heavy technically-inspired selling in New York yesterday had revealed a lack
of buying interest, he said, which suggested that there might be further
losses to come.
'The retention plan's positive implications have been fully absorbed,' said
Mr Eagles, 'and investors are now beginning to wonder how effective it will
be and how long it will last.' For his own part, he thought the producers'
resolve was strong and that the scheme would operate 'for a few years at
least'.
At the London headquarters of the International Coffee Organisation
delegates continued to debate how to make up financial for the withdrawal,
announced at the weekend, of the US, the biggest coffee imports and main
contributor to the ICO budget.
It had already been proposed that the budget be reduced by 31 per cent but
yesterday Germany called for a further 5 to 7 per cent cut, said Mr Nestor
Osorio, chairman of the organisation's finance committee.
It had originally been suggested that the US's Dollars 600,000 contribution
could be shared among other consumers. But that was opposed by some, notably
the EC.
The ICO's market stabilisation efforts were suspended in 1989 and it now
operates merely as an international coffee forum and data base.

Precious metals weakened suddenly in mid-afternoon on US fund liquidation,
initially in the silver and platinum markets, but subsequently in GOLD. The
London bullion price surrendered what remained of last week's rally to close
at Dollars 352.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 4 on the day. Dealers said they
could not pinpoint a specific reason for the selling but that without the
support given to the market recently by the Russian political turmoil a move
lower at some time had been inevitable. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER
prices remained under pressure from bearish fundamentals and the three
months price closed at Dollars 1,723.25 a tonne, down Dollars 19.25. The
last signs of the recent technical supply squeeze appeared to have
disappeared with the cash discount widening Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 23.75 a
tonne. The NICKEL market also continued to suffer from its weak
fundamentals. The three months price hit a fresh 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars
4,150 a tonne before recovering slightly to Dollars 4,165, still down
Dollars 40. The gentle slide in the ALUMINIUM market continued, although
some downside stability was found around 5 1/2 -month lows.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Accountancy: No room for own goals in financing soccer's
future - Gerry Boon looks at the world of football club accounts and the
implications of putting players on the balance sheet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY BOON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH professional football clubs spent more than Pounds 70m buying
players in the 1991-92 season, but you would never know it from looking at
their balance sheets.
At a time when clubs are increasingly turning to banks and shareholders for
support, should players be treated as a financial asset rather than an
expense to their clubs?
This was one of the questions we set out to answer in the 1993 Touche Ross
survey of football club accounts, published this week. As part of our annual
check on football's financial health, we looked at where the money comes
from to finance football and the accounting implications of putting players
on the balance sheet.
One of the survey's key findings was that in the 1991-92 season, 53 out of
the 84 clubs whose accounts were available reported a pre-tax loss. Add to
this that auditors qualified their reports on the 1992 accounts on 'going
concern' grounds for 27 clubs, and football finances start to look very
sick. But our results give a different picture.
Professional football clubs are increasingly required to pay their way as
businesses. Satellite television deals, new sponsors, tax investigations and
the sale of several clubs is focusing attention on their financial position.
Clubs also face additional burdens unfamiliar to conventional businesses.
For example, the Taylor Report on stadium safety has led to an estimated
Pounds 200m of capital expenditure since its publication in January 1990.
Substantial investment is required to strengthen the quality of players,
because success on the field usually has a direct impact on the club's
finances through greater attendance figures.
Perhaps the greatest challenge is balancing commercial realism against the
demands of the customer, since fans want money spent on players without
having to pay higher ticket prices.
With few exceptions, clubs can no longer rely on wealthy individual backers.
They need to turn to the banks, financial institutions and - like the three
quoted English teams - the Stock Exchange. In order to attract investment,
they will have to portray their financial position in the best commercial
light and demonstrate good financial management.
Our survey highlighted one area - player registrations - in which clubs
could help themselves to promote a more balanced financial picture.
In the 1991-92 season, English first and second division clubs spent Pounds
70m on players, up from Pounds 40 million the previous year. The biggest net
spender was Blackburn Rovers (Pounds 6.84m) followed by Derby County (Pounds
4.44m) and Liverpool (Pounds 3.63m).
But just four clubs put player registrations on the balance sheet as an
intangible asset. And 82 per cent of the 46 clubs in the top two divisions
still account for transfer fees through the profit and loss account in the
year in which the transfers take place.
There are certain advantages to sticking with this traditional way of
accounting for transfer fees. It is uncontroversial, involves no judgment in
carrying forward costs, is simple to understand and disclose, and means all
transfer deals are treated in the same way. It is prudent, consistent with
the way club directors view their transfer fee budget and in line with the
tax treatment of transfer costs.
However, we believe there are two considerable commercial disadvantages to
this policy. First, a substantial 'asset' - the players - is not shown in
the balance sheet. There is a strong business case that this expenditure is
an investment, and not showing it as such conceals the club's true worth.
Second, the profit and loss account bears substantial and 'lumpy' charges
which may significantly distort the underlying results of the business from
year to year. Net transfer income tends to be one of the largest single
items in a club's profit and loss account. For example, Blackburn Rovers'
Pounds 6.84m transfer fees helped result in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.92m
in 1991-92.
There are only two ways of expressing the value of transfer fees: either by
an additional disclosure in the accounts or by putting players on the
balance sheet. Derby County, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Tottenham
Hotspur put players on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. Tottenham
and Derby do so only for players they have bought, which they do at 'cost'.
Sheffield United use the manager's valuation, and Portsmouth uses the
directors' valuation for the whole squad.
Nine clubs disclose the aggregate value of the playing squad in their
accounts, based on either the directors' or manager's valuation. The
exception was Manchester United, which became the first club to have its
squad independently valued. Touche Ross calculated the figure at Pounds 24m,
which analysts quickly converted into 197p per share.
The benefit of an independent valuation is that it lends objective
credibility to the value of the business in the eyes of outsiders:
shareholders, supporters, financiers and investors. The club realised the
importance of communicating its market value to its new audience in the
City.
Club directors, or the team manager, can, of course, produce their own
internal figure. The main advantage is simplicity, although this is perhaps
outweighed by the perceived lack of objectivity. Whatever basis is used,
disclosure of market value for such an important asset is, I believe, good
practice.
It is sometimes argued that disclosing player values is not appropriate
because they are too subjective, or misleading, or simply too difficult to
calculate. Club directors need to tackle certain key issues: whether to use
cost or market value; the period over which to depreciate the capitalised
value; the residual value of a player at the end of his contract; write-offs
in cases of permanent injury; write downs due to a player's loss of form;
and how best to protect tax allowances.
The solutions are fairly straightforward. Market value can be judged from
the prices of recent transfers and other managers' views of what a player is
worth. The depreciation period should not exceed the length of the contract
period, and the standard European Football Association transfer multiplier
(based on a player's age at the end of his contract) can be used to estimate
residual values. A permanent diminution in a player's value because of
injury will require a write-off, although this may be off-set by any
insurance payment received.
The most difficult judgment will be on loss of value because of loss of
form; a reasoned assessment based on what happens elsewhere in the market
will be acceptable. Professional advice should ensure that writing off
transfer fees for tax purposes is not jeopardised by capitalisation.
Our research showed that there is a lot of hidden talent in football absent
from the balance sheet. Based on the disclosed amounts, we estimate that
there is about Pounds 250m in players in the Premier League and Pounds 80m
in the Football League first division - valuable assets that clubs should be
listing alongside their grounds and facilities.
By turning players into an asset rather than showing them as an expense,
clubs can promote themselves as commercial enterprises at a time when
football is coming under greater pressure to perform. If clubs react
positively to the changes, everyone wins: fans, players, clubs, shareholders
and investors.

football industry team. Copies of the survey are available free of charge

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (9):
Production moves overseas - One effect of the rise in the yen's value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN TOKUSHIMA prefecture, on the south-western island of Shikoku, a
42-year-old factory which assembles stereos and radio cassette players for
overseas markets will cease production at the end of October.
The factory, owned by Sanritsu Electric, an affiliate of Sanyo Electric, is
one of a growing number of electronics suppliers which have fallen victim to
the rising value of the yen. This summer, Sanyo put in its last order to
Sanritsu and told the company it would shift production outside Japan.
For Japanese manufacturers, already suffering from a downturn in domestic
demand, the impact of the yen's sharp rise this year has been devastating.
While people in many other countries would welcome a strong national
currency, for a population that depends for over 18 per cent of real GNP on
exports, a strong yen has brought more grief than joy.
According to an estimate by Wako Research Institute, a private organisation,
a Y1 rise in the yen vis-a-vis the dollar has the effect of reducing Japan's
GNP by 0.06 per cent. On that basis, the near Y20 rise of the yen this year
could wipe 1.2 per cent off the value of the country's production.
The negative effects of a higher yen reach across a wide range of industrial
sectors, from heavy industries such as steel and shipbuilding to services
such as shipping and air transport to high technology electronics, cars and
precision machinery.
Companies ranging from Matsushita, the largest consumer electronics maker in
the world, to Japan Air Lines have all suffered from the loss of cost
competitiveness and the decline in overseas profits resulting from a higher
yen.
However, public sympathy has been directly mainly to the plight of the
electronics and car industry, which are widely seen to have been the engines
of Japanese economic growth in recent years.
As the fate of Sanritsu Electric indicates, the yen's rise, which has been
much faster and sharper this year than companies expected, has had an
immediate impact on the profitability of electronics makers and forced them
to review their manufacturing plans.
JVC, the maker of audio-visual equipment, recently announced that the yen's
rise was forcing it to revise its profits forecast for the year to next
March. On a consolidated basis JVC expects a loss of Y31bn instead of Y800m
as forecast earlier this year. Sony says that a rise of Y1 against the
dollar reduces its prospective profits by Y5bn.
The pressures on the Japanese car industry are no less severe. At Y110 to
the dollar, Toyota says it would hardly make any profits. If the yen rises
to Y100 to the dollar, 'Japanese manufacturers would not be able to exist,'
it warns.
The exchange rate has forced electronics companies and auto makers to
consider shifting a larger proportion of their production overseas to reduce
costs.
In electronics, the manufacture of products with low value-added, such as
small TV sets, has already shifted to lower-cost areas such as Thailand and
Malaysia. Overseas production of colour TVs by Japanese manufacturers has
exceeded domestic production since 1988.
However, the yen's recent surge has meant that companies have had to expand
the range and volume of overseas production. Sony plans to manufacture 8mm
camcorders in Shanghai from November, though other manufacturers have opted
to keep production in Japan.
At the same time, to reduce costs, electronics companies are looking to
increase procurement from overseas. In the computer industry, for example,
Fujitsu intends to double procurement of foreign parts by 1995.
Car companies are also trying to raise their global manufacturing
efficiency. Honda is moving the entire production of its four-door Civic and
Accord cars for the North American market to the US while Toyota has decided
regularly to import crankshafts and cylinder blocks from its UK engine plant
for use in engines that will go into cars destined for Japan and other big
markets.
Most Japanese manufacturers accept that, since the yen is so high, one of
the main keys to success, if not survival, will be their ability to transfer
production overseas and reduce costs by increasing foreign procurement.
Steps are being taken in that direction, but it is not an easy route for
most Japanese companies.
For one thing, since Japanese companies do not, as a rule, resort to
redundancies, the transfer of manufacturing overseas raises the problem of
what to do with the surplus labour that will result in Japan.
Executives of manufacturing companies have been speaking out publicly on the
dangers of a hollowing out of Japanese industry as a result of the yen's
appreciation, reflecting the concerns that many have about their ability to
ride out the crisis without resorting to western-style redundancies and
plant closures.
Furthermore, Japanese manufacturers have to worry about the plight of their
suppliers. In many cases, especially among electronics companies and
carmakers, these close ties extend to equity holdings. In the past, these
ties enabled manufacturers to urge suppliers to work on gruelling production
schedules or meet stringent cost demands.
While carmakers admit that it would reduce costs if they bought a larger
volume of components from overseas, they say that would deal a serious blow
to their own suppliers, who are already suffering because of slower demand
in the domestic car market.
However, many Japanese companies are gradually preparing for a further
transfer of manufacturing overseas by reducing their workforce through
natural attrition, a reduction of new recruits, and for the more
hard-pressed, voluntary early retirement schemes. More manufacturers are
asking suppliers to look outside traditional corporate groupings for
business.
Nevertheless, the last strong rise of the yen in the mid-1980s strengthened
the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers after they took steps to cut
costs and raise profitability. It may well be that the pressures of the
yen's rise will once again act as a spur to raise Japanese companies'
efficiency by forcing decisions that under more moderate circumstances would
have been too painful to make.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (10):
Healthy advance by equities - Economic uncertainty is worrying European
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TOKYO stock market has put in an impressive performance this year. The
Nikkei index has risen from 16,994 at the start of the year to around the
20,000 level now, although this is still far short of its record 38,915.87
seen on the last trading day of 1989.
Tokyo has also risen by almost 25 per cent in local currency terms in the
FT-Actuaries index since the beginning of the year, compared with little
more than a 14 per cent rise in the World Index.
For the foreign investor, however, the advance has been even more
spectacular at more than 47 per cent in sterling terms and almost 50 per
cent in dollar terms as a result of the strength of the yen, a performance
bettered only by Finland and Spain.
However, the consensus is that the yen's strength will not continue
unchecked. David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, believes it has
probably peaked and will decline from current levels of around Y105 to the
dollar to Y115-120 by the end of next year.
But Tokyo's positive tone does not appear to have brought any great rush
into Japanese equities by European investors. Figures produced by the Tokyo
stock exchange show net inflows by foreigners of Y744bn by mid-September,
compared with Y841bn in the whole of last year. By contrast, a net Y5,621bn
was invested in 1991 after a net outflow of Y2,548bn in 1990.
However, analysts caution that these figures include all foreign investment
and a substantial part of this year's total is believed to have been
contributed by US pension funds which had previously been short in Japanese
equities.
The figures also include the operations of Japanese institutions abroad,
further reducing the European contribution.
Political uncertainties caused by the arrival of a seven-party coalition
government after July's election, ending the 38-year rule of the Liberal
Democratic party, a bumpy economic outlook with no clear end in sight to the
recession and the depressing knock-on effect on the corporate sector have
all put a brake on fund managers' enthusiasm for Japan.
There have been false dawns on economic recovery before, says Nicholas
Kenworthy of Nomura International in London. A Y10,000bn stimulatory package
at the end of August,1992, and a Y13,000bn package last March both provided
strong spurs to the equity market, while some encouraging corporate news
during the first quarter of this year brought hopes that recovery was on the
way. But with hindsight, analysts now believe that the improvement may have
had more to do with book squaring at the end of the fiscal year than
indicating the likelihood of any pick-up.
Since then, the economy has been treading water, and many economists doubt
whether this month's Y6,150bn package will prove sufficient to get the
economy moving quickly. Analysts believe many European investors have been
increasing their weightings in Japan over the past year. With bulls looking
for the Nikkei to reach the 30,000 level in two year's time, few have been
willing to reduce their holdings substantially.
In any event, few investors believe that the government will allow the
market to slip below the 18,000-level, since that would trigger difficulties
for Japanese banks in meeting the capital adequacy ratios of the Bank for
International Settlements.
Stocks likely to benefit from deregulation, in the retail and transport
sectors, have proved popular with foreign investors, as have shares in the
housing sector. The housing market went into cyclical downturn 18 months
before the real economy and is now beginning to show signs of growth.
Patrick Thompson, of Fleming Investment Management in London, sees no sign
that the economy had yet bottomed out. 'Ultimately, we believe that the
actions being taken by the new government will succeed but there will be no
real recovery before the first or second quarters of next year,' he says.
Fleming Investment Management was committed to Japan in the long term, he
adds. 'But the currency acts as a break on people making further investment
in the Japanese market.' In the next economic cycle, there was potential for
share price rises but Mr Thompson did not believe that this year's gains, in
sterling terms, would be repeated.
Nathan Gibbs, senior fund manager of ESN Investment Management which runs
the pension fund assets of the British electricity industry says it has
clearly been a very good year for UK investors in Japan, after the dismal
showing of the previous three years. ESN has 18 clients and they have all
been at maximum weighting since the end of the first quarter.
He believes that in recent years, institutions had reduced their holdings,
but now he would expect any London based pension fund to have around 5 per
cent of its investments in Tokyo.
He added that the types of stocks sought by foreign investors had changed
considerably in recent years. Until the early 1980s, foreigners tended to
buy the blue chip exporters like Honda, Fuji Photo and Sony. They had
provided better disclosure of financial information than many Japanese
corporations and were internationally known.
But during the last decade, foreigners had begun to take a lead from their
Japanese counterparts, who saw the best opportunities in stocks that were
very highly priced by UK standards - large steel companies like Nippon Steel
or the private Tobu Rail.
Alison Edmunds of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, believes that last
week's 75 basis point cut in the official discount rate to a record low 1.75
per cent might help the economy, but she believed there remained scope for
further interest rate and tax cuts later in the year.
Postel had been overweight in Japan earlier in the year but had taken
advantage of the market's rise to take profits. It was neutral now.
Michael Thomas, director of Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund
management group, notes that the short-term earnings outlook for Japanese
companies was poor, as a result of the depressed state of the economy and a
very strong yen.
On the other hand, he believes that current low level of interests rates and
a lack of incentive to enter the property market would bring cash rich
Japanese financial institutions back to the equity market, when the economy
showed signs of picking up.
On a global, non-US basis, Martin Currie had reweighted its Japanese
holdings in March and April. It was now below the index average of 48 per
cent, but was higher than an industry average which he saw as around 30 per
cent.
Peter Robertson, Far East director for M&amp;G Investment Management, which has
reduced its weightings from overweight to neutral in Japan, notes that an
unproven government and the possibility that there could be another election
were uncertainties.
He welcomed the latest supplementary budget but said that more action to
spur the economy was needed. 'Although it is an area where you must have
money, it is not as big a part of a south-east Asian portfolio as it used to
be,' he said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (8): Veteran
of the iron triangle - Profile, Gaishi Hiraiwa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new generation of leaders has, ironically, turned to a member of the
old guard for advice on how to get out of the present economic fix.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 78, the man chosen last month by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
the new prime minister, to prepare a report by the end of the year on how to
restructure the economy, is a typical product of the establishment on which
the old conservative-run order was based.
He is also an example of how the reformist government needs the
establishment's help to function at all.
The government's package of deregulation measures, covering 94 sectors from
satellite broadcasting to brewing, is one step towards reducing unnecessary
costs in Japan's Byzantine economic system.
Mr Hiraiwa's report, a separate project, has been asked to go even deeper.
He has been asked for ideas on how to change Japan from a society driven by
companies and producers into a society that pays more attention to
consumers' aspirations, the most important popular theme of the Hosokawa
government.
In this, his 15-man panel drawn from the top ranks of corporate Japan aims
to build on the Maekawa report. Named after a former governor of the Bank of
Japan, the Maekawa report in 1986 urged that domestic consumption should be
stimulated to reduce Japan's burgeoning trade surplus. Few of its proposals
have been acted upon.
Mr Hiraiwa's strikingly low public profile is belied by his extensive
behind-the-scenes influence as chairman of the Keidanren, the employers'
federation, an organisation which forms part of the so-called iron triangle
of business, bureaucrats and politicians.
A graduate of Tokyo University, the traditional breeding ground for the
Japanese elite, Mr Hiraiwa started his professional career as a humble
washing machine salesman, working his way up to the chairmanship of Tokyo
Electric Power by 1976.
He has a gentle, professorial manner and is said to be among the most widely
read members of the business establishment.
His influence on all sides of the iron triangle is said to be formidable.
Yet this member of the old guard showed his ability to move fast with the
times when the Keidanren recently announced that it would stop channelling
funds to the defeated Liberal Democratic Party.
The Keidanren doled out Y13bn to the LDP at the latest count, in 1991, so
the decision is a heavy blow to the conservatives, made worse by the fact
that other business groups are following suit.
The decision was triggered by the wave of political scandals surrounding the
arrest of Shin Kanemaru, former political 'godfather' of the LDP, and the
ultimate collapse of the LDP government last June. But it also reflects the
Keidanren's realisation that following the collapse of socialist regimes
across the world, it no longer needs to pay the ruling party to guarantee
the continued existence of a free market economy in Japan.
The Keidanren has clearly indicated that its old job financing the LDP will
now be less important. It is therefore expected to devote more effort to
being a think-tank and government adviser. Here Mr Hiraiwa will be able to
draw on the federation's 200-strong research unit to make his mark on the
new government's economic policies.
The job should suit him well, in that Mr Hiraiwa is known for having lobbied
fiercely for the former government to deregulate the economy and to have
taken a hand in the formation of the three public spending packages launched
by the LDP and Mr Hosokawa's government over the past 18 months.
Mr Hosokawa, meanwhile, will be an attentive listener. The seven-party
ruling coalition is divided on many things, but not on the realisation that
if it fails to deliver economic revival before the next election, likely
within a year, the LDP could well stage a surprise come-back.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (7): Small
but powerful grouping - The Keidanren has an influential role in corporate
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE apex of Japanese corporate life stands the Keidanren, which is
sometimes erroneously understood in the west to be the country's largest
business grouping. It is, in fact, remarkably small, representing only some
900 companies - but they are 900 of the biggest, and its influence is
immeasurable.
Its budget is some Y3bn a year, less than a third of that for the Tokyo
Chamber of Commerce alone - that organisation is part of the Japan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, which represents 1.5m mainly small firms.
The Keidanren, or Japan federation of economic organisations, has proved
adaptable over its 47-year life, but it has three main enduring functions.
To lobby government and the bureaucracy on behalf of big business. It has
recently been pressing for measures to ease industry's plight as Japan
enters recession and the high yen hurts export earnings. Some help then came
in a Y6,150bn economic stimulus package unveiled by the new government this
month. To tell big business what government and the bureaucracy is thinking.
In recent years the Keidanren has been one main conduit, along with the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, through which exporters have
been prevailed on to restrain their drive for market share in particular
sectors abroad, such as cars in Europe, and to open their component
purchasing to foreign products, such as US semiconductors. It has also
pressed the case among companies for greater environmental awareness.
To represent the interests of Japanese business abroad. In recent years the
organisation has scaled back its often unwieldy fact-finding tours and given
its overseas missions more focus.
To act as 'link-man' when disaster strikes. The bankruptcy of a company
which is listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange is a rare
and unsettling event. In order to calm investors' fears, the organisation at
such times becomes a facilitator in a merger whereby a stronger group will
bail out the stricken company. Jobs are thereby also preserved.
Until this summer, the Keidanren had a fifth role, as collecting agent for
corporate contributions to political parties, the vast bulk of which - some
Y13bn a year - went to the Liberal Democratic party. But when the LDP lost
power following a general election in July, in which the receipt by
politicians of tainted funds was a core issue, the federation announced that
it would stop this practice.
The move marked the end of an era for the Keidanren, which was formed in
1946 in the first year of the US post-war occupation of Japan. Washington
among other things wanted to dismember the zaibatsu, the close-knit families
of companies which had oiled the military machine.
The Keidanren participated in the emergence instead of the keiretsu, an only
modestly looser arrangement of interlocking minority shareholdings which
binds loyalties within a group - comprising, say, a bank, an insurance
company, a chemical manufacturer, an engineering company and others - to the
present day. And, within a decade, it had also become a key political
player, presiding over the founding of what Japanese call the '1955 system'
of politics which broke down only with this summer's election.
In that year, the trade unions were in the ascendant, and the left and right
wings of the Socialist movement came together in parliament and threatened
to establish a lasting majority. The Keidanren acted as marriage broker to
unite the then separate Liberal and Democratic parties into a conservative
bloc which was to rule Japan for 38 years.
The corruption scandals which eventually brought down the LDP were not just
a feature of the 1990s, but emerged recurrently from its early years in
power. The Keidanren adopted its role as funding conduit after an outcry of
public distaste during one election in which companies each endorsed a
particular local LDP candidate, for whom their workforce in many cases came
under pressure to vote.
But following a series of defections from the LDP's parliamentary ranks
which started last year, there emerged a choice of centre-right parties. As
Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, a Keidanren managing director, puts it: 'We helped the
LDP because it was the only party which upheld free enterprise. Now there
are others.'
Severing the financial tie with the LDP has helped the Keidanren, which
until now specified what each company or industry association should pay the
party, secure the ear of the new seven-party coalition government. Notably,
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its chairman, was appointed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
prime minister, to head an advisory panel charged with finding ways to
promote deregulation and streamline the often burdensome administrative
system.
The government has made a start on deregulation, producing a list of nearly
100 bureaucratic requirements or prohibitions which it says will go. But if
the panel comes up with wider-ranging proposals and the internally divided
coalition succeeds in getting them enacted, the private sector may have in
prospect a new age of flexibility which could enhance profits. Large
retailers, for example, may be freed to open stores where consumer markets
warrant an outlet without having to spend years seeking ministerial sanction
in the face of opposition from small shopkeepers nearby.
Deregulation has long been a Keidanren goal, but now it has a following
wind. Many changes will be sternly resisted among ministry officials
concerned with holding on to administrative power. But if the measures pass
 -and under the LDP previous similar initiatives were prone to run into the
sand - the hope exists that corruption may be further curbed. Mr Nukazawa
points out: 'Bureaucrats said over the years: 'If you want to start any sort
of business, come to me at night with a weighty fruit basket,' '
Bureaucrats and politicians in regional, as well as national government,
were also frequently on the take, and a construction company wanting to
develop a commercial site or win a share in a public sector contract would
know that a bunch of grapes and a few well-polished apples would not be
enough. Court cases involve allegations of bagfuls of cash being slid under
restaurant tables.
Money which came through the Keidanren went to party central funds, rather
than as backhanders to individual politicians, and was openly accounted for.
None the less, the system helped preserve a culture of mutual dependence, an
umbrella under which greater sums changed hands in a less transparent
fashion.
Some groups, such as the commercial banks from which the LDP has outstanding
loans, have said they will continue to make direct donations to the party -
if only to help get these off their books. The banking sector was the
biggest declared donor to the party, providing some Y2bn a year.
But however modest the amounts, corporate profitability will not be hurt by
the fact that Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house, need no longer feel
obliged to make annual political contributions of Y62.4m; also Nippon Steel,
Y75m; and Nippon Life Insurance, Y60.8m. In the third year of economic
downturn, Japanese companies can ensure the money is better spent.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (5): A
little polish for images - The trend towards investor relations divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE Japan, battered by the high yen, a sluggish economy and a spate of
scandals, and struggling for a new image, has turned to investor relations.
Raising funds through the stock market has become difficult due to a lack of
investor confidence, while the unravelling of cross-shareholding
arrangements between corporations is emphasising the need for companies to
attract new investors.
Investor relations divisions are being set up in many of the leading
companies, while publishers are contemplating investor relations magazines.
Fuji Bank, a leading commercial bank, held an overseas investor relations
campaign in the US and Europe last July. Such programmes are part of an
effort to lift the profiles of Japanese banks, which have been battered by
scandals and mounting bad loans.
Mitsubishi Research Institute started a service monitoring over-the-counter
companies' investors relations activities and assisting with corporate data
presentations.
Meanwhile, tougher rules for corporate disclosure and an easing of filing
requirements for shareholder litigants are also expected to boost companies'
awareness towards shareholders and encourage efforts to improve investor
relations.
A change in the commercial law in October will allow shareholders with a 3
per cent stake, rather than the present 10 per cent, to look at corporate
records, will increase the number of auditors from two to three, with at
least one being an outside auditor, and will reduce the cost of lawsuits by
shareholders to Y8,200.
The reduction of litigation costs is expected to increase the number of
lawsuits, where shareholders sue directors for breaches of trust on behalf
of the company. If the shareholders win, damages are forwarded to the
corporation.
Earlier this month, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that six former
executives of Mitsui Mining must pay Y100m in compensation to the company
for manipulating its share price. Janome Sewing Machine is being sued by a
former employee for its involvement with Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, the stock
market speculator, who has been convicted for stock price manipulation.
The focus toward better investor relations has coincided with calls by
industrial and financial companies for corporate integrity. The Japan
Securities Dealers Association lectured presidents of publicly-owned
companies on corporate disclosure, while Nomura Securities held seminars for
better corporate governance.
The Keidanren, the leading business organisation, wants companies to become
more like their western counterparts, providing better information and
giving shareholders more rights. It believes better corporate governance is
the answer to the US revisionists claims that Japanese companies are
different from those in the west.
However, while on one hand companies try to impress investors with their
campaigns and new investor relations departments, on the other, many still
choose to keep information to themselves.
Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities turned a deaf ear towards
California's Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which suggested
the need for independent board members to prevent scandals.
Calpers also sent letters in August questioning management policies of 17
leading companies. It received only one reply.
More than 1,900 companies held their annual shareholders' meetings on the
same day last June. By holding the meetings at the same time, companies can
keep sokaiya, or racketeers, from asking embarrassing or pointless
questions. However, this has also kept legitimate shareholders from making
comments, and shareholders' meetings have become a mere formality for both
company and shareholder.
Last June 29, most of the 1,900 companies finished their meetings within an
hour. These included leading construction companies implicated in illegal
political donation scandals.
Leading companies have made illegal pay-offs to gangsters that threatened to
disrupt annual meetings. Employees at Kirin Brewery, the country's largest
beer maker, were arrested last July for making such payments over the past
decade, while the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading retailer, resigned last
year for its illegal payments to extortionists.
Dividends remain low, with the dividend yield for the Nikkei average around
0.8 per cent. Companies have argued that earnings should be retained for
future investments and research and developments, rather than given to
shareholders.
Their argument against high dividends was that shareholders already have
capital gains on stocks.
Many corporations are bracing themselves for the spate of shareholder
litigations next month and executives are contemplating buying liability
policies. Japanese companies which have ignored investors, may finally be
forced to acknowledge their existence.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (6): Green
light for red tape curbs - The effects of the new deregulation policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE Japan has lent all its weight to the government's drive to reduce
the official regulations that control an officially estimated 50 per cent of
the economy.
No sooner had the new coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa published
its list of 60 proposals - later enlarged to 94 - to curb the burdens
imposed by administrative red tape last month, than the Keidanren, the
powerful economic federation, came out with its own further reaching counter
plan.
Senior Keidanren officials say they have been supporting deregulation ever
since a previous government set up a panel on the subject 12 years ago.
Yet corporate eagerness to give fresh impetus to efforts to curb red tape
also shows how the recession and the yen's rise have highlighted the
economic costs of red tape.
As corporate Japan's costs rise above those of its foreign, especially Asian
competitors, companies are desperately eager to cut operating expenses
before they have to make further cuts in their payrolls.
Whether Mr Hosokawa's deregulation drive will make any practical difference
to Japan's economic problems is still an open question.
Estimates of the impact of the measures vary widely. The government's
economic planning agency, often criticised for over-optimism, has forecast
that the package, plus a Y6,150bn public spending plan, would add 1.3
percentage points to gross national product over the next 12 months.
A conservative private sector estimate, by stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete
Wedd is that the government's deregulation plans could add up to one
percentage point to annual growth in gross domestic product over the next
decade.
The ultimate impact, of course, depends on how much political resistance the
package meets. This is hard to measure. Given Mr Hosokawa's record
popularity, few people are prepared to criticise deregulation in public.
Indeed the red tape cutting plan is seen in political circles as an astute
gesture to public frustration with some of Japan's old rigidities. Yet
behind the scenes, entrenched interests are strong.
Generally, both government and private sector economists agree that
deregulation will cause some economic pain at first, by driving inefficient
companies out of business, leading to lasting benefits in terms of reduced
business costs in the next two to three years.
In the short term this could cause a rise in unemployment as has been the
case with US and European Community deregulation moves in the 1980s. So,
analysts do not expect the proposals to be implemented fast.
First, Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition has to overcome the vested
interests of the government ministries and businesses, such as the layers of
middle men that stand between factories and customers that stand to lose
power and profits from deregulation.
A sign of the challenge ahead is that the deregulation list was prepared by
none other than these territory-conscious bureaucrats, who inserted several
contentious proposals rejected several times in the past decade.
Moreover, the 94 proposals in the plan, half of which are to be introduced
by next March, are a very small proportion of the more than 10,000
government rules which control one of the world's most regulated developed
economies.
Among the main points are: fewer controls on construction material imports
and mobile telephone sales, an easing of restrictions on the freight weight
of large trucks, an end to minimum production limits for brewers, which keep
potential small producers out of the market, and fewer car roadworthiness
inspections.
Others include a review of the anti-monopoly law to close loopholes for
cartels, more flexibility for the bond market, and fewer controls on the
opening of discount food and drink stores. Foreign companies could well
benefit from plans to speed up complaints to the trade and investment
ombudsman.
Many of these ideas will meet opposition, as they already have done in the
past. Car makers have supported the roadworthiness certificate system, as
they benefit from purchases inspired by the need for old cars to pass a test
every two years, or annually for cars more than 13 years old. Car repairers
and parts suppliers have a similar interest.
Taxi drivers, a politically vocal class in most countries, can be expected
to stage stiff resistance to plans to deregulate fares.
A look at past history indicates that putting all this into action might not
be easy. In Japan as in many other countries, vested interests can only be
challenged if some kind of compensation is paid.
For example, controls on opening large retail outlets will be relaxed under
the deregulation proposals, in theory paving the way for the further
expansion of the newly fashionable discount stores.
In May 1990, Japan responded to US demands to amend the Large-Scale Retail
Store Law, which covers stores of 500 sq m or more. The US idea was that
large stores would have increased shelf space for imported products and new
retailers would be less obliged to stock traditional suppliers' goods.
To win approval for the changes, which took another year to be introduced,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry put together a Y162.1bn
subsidy package for small retailers, who were able to use the funds for
business promotions, including street fairs and pavement repairs.
Three years later, in spite of a speeding of approvals for new large stores,
small shopkeepers are still able to put obstacles in the way of ambitious
retailers.
Will Mr Hosokawa be able to make a deal with vested interests or will this
latest attempt to deregulate go the same way as previous abortive efforts?
The consensus among economic and political observers is that, whatever the
outcome of these proposals, the policy debate has been shifted, giving
consumers benefits where producers' interests have long predominated.
As Mr Hosokawa himself put it in a policy address to parliament: 'It is
essential that we work to promote governmental deregulation and the reform
of those old competition-restrictive systems and practices that are unsuited
to the new era and to advance consumer interests and and further enhance
economic efficiency.'

hit by downturn

THE entry of Burger King, the US hamburger chain, into an already
over-crowded Japanese market this month, surprised many industry analysts
because the prolonged economic slump is beginning to hit fast-food outlets.
Japan's service sectors, which were virtually unaffected during the initial
stages of the economic downturn, are now starting to feel the effects.
Although the Japanese fast-food market saw firm sales and profits during the
initial stages of the economic downturn, it is now suffering as a result of
the further tightening of consumer spending.
Burger King has signed an agreement with Seibu Railways, run by Mr Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi, one of the richest men in the world. Mr Masao Okada, general
manager of project, expects to open 200 to 300 stores in the next few years
along Seibu's railway network.
While Burger King hopes to lure customers with its healthier and bigger
Whopper burger, its move comes at a time when the fast-food market is
experiencing declines in purchases per customer. Ms Kaori Hasegawa, analyst
at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says many companies are starting to limit the
number of new stores to cut down costs.
Convenience stores, meanwhile, saw sales fall in June and July due to the
long rainy season and cool summer weather. The sector, unlike the luxury
department stores and larger super stores, has until now seen firm sales,
unaffected by the downfall in consumer spending.
However, sales of seasonal goods, such as soft drinks, ice-cream, and cold
noodles, on which convenience stores are largely dependent, have slumped. In
July, FamilyMart, a leading convenience store chain, experienced the first
year-on-year fall in existing store sales for the first time since its
listing in December 1987.
Growth in the trucking industry, which remained firm during the initial
economic downturn, is also starting to decline. During the April-June
quarter, volumes on scheduled trucking services rose by only 1 per cent.
Compared to manufacturing companies, which are experiencing double-digit
percentage falls in revenues, trucking companies are only now being forced
to discount rates to win business. Ms Julia Baldini, analyst at Schroder
Securities in Tokyo, estimates that annual revenue for the industry this
year, will fall around 3 to 5 per cent, compared to the 2 per cent decline
last fiscal year.
The labour shortage which severely affected the industry during the late
1980s, has led companies to retain workers, causing a heavy overhead burden.
While the bigger trucking companies have succeeded in controlling costs, the
smaller companies are struggling. Ms Baldini believes that over the next
five years the number of licensed companies will decline sharply.
Gradual deregulation of the industry is also expected to accelerate
consolidation. The ministry of transport eased territorial restrictions in
1990, abolishing protection for the small local companies and allowing
larger companies to expand national networks.
The recent proposal included in the new government's list of deregulations,
allowing companies to use bigger trucks, is also expected to help the larger
companies.
The transport industry is the most regulated of all industries, and
deregulation is expected to prompt consolidation railways, trucking,
shipping and warehousing. Larger transportation companies will be the
biggest beneficiaries of deregulation, while smaller companies will be
forced to form alliances.
The government's push for deregulation to adjust the price differences
between Japan and overseas is expected to help the warehousing sector
increase imports in the medium term.
The government has stipulated a review of import procedures, including
construction materials, quarantine procedures and food health checks. While
such changes are not expected to boost imports immediately, a further easing
of procedures on a wider range of products in the future will support an
increase in import levels. Pressure from consumers for cheaper food and
agricultural products is also expected to increase demand for imported
foods.
While import levels remain subdued, warehouses will enjoy the benefits of
easing of import regulations once consumption increases.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (2): Engine
of the world falters - Financial Times writers analyse the performance of
companies in three sectors of the economy and examine the structural changes
taking place

THE RECENT difficulties in the Japanese economy and gloomy prospects for a
near-term recovery have triggered a crisis of confidence among
manufacturers.
In the electronics industry, a four-year decline in demand for audio-visual
products has led Japan's large consumer electronics companies to admit that
they are not fully prepared to deal with the saturation of the markets for
television sets, video cassette recorders and compact disc players, which
have provided them with profits.
Car makers, faced with sluggish demand at home and slow sales in Europe,
also say that their own competitiveness is threatened by a high yen and
quality improvements at the big three US manufacturers, at a time when there
is an over-capacity in the world car market.
Meanwhile, the high costs of manufacturing have raised the question of
whether Japan can continue in its role as the world's engine of
manufacturing growth.
Faced with the combined pressures of one of the worst economic slowdowns in
Japan since the war, the sharp appreciation of the yen and growing
protectionism in overseas markets, manufacturing companies are questioning
the way in which they have long been doing business. 'In the past, it was
thought that markets would always continue to grow,' says an official at
Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker. 'That is no
longer true.'
This change in their business environment, from strong and rising demand to
slower growth, is forcing manufacturers to review their business priorities.
While demand was growing, the objective was simply to keep increasing sales
volumes, which would naturally lead to higher profits.
As demand has slowed, that strategy has proved an obstacle to the
maintenance of profits in a more difficult era. The large numbers of staff,
particularly white-collar workers, taken on during the growth years as,
manufacturers' corporate structures grew in line with rising market demand,
is now a considerable source of high costs.
The wide variety of models and the short shelf life of products, which were
the hallmark of companies riding high on a period of strong growth, also
helped to create bloated corporate structures, which have made it difficult
for companies to adjust quickly to the new environment.
In a complete reversal of their former expansionist strategies, the call
among manufacturers is for the creation of a lean and mean corporate
structure, capable of producing profits even when revenues are not rising.
The quest for profitability, rather than market share, has led companies to
seek greater productivity among their white-collar workers by reducing
numbers working in jobs not directly linked to manufacturing.
'Japan's blue-collar productivity is very high,' says Mr Kuniyoshi Sasaki, a
director at the Japan Productivity Center. But white-collar productivity
has, in contrast, been very low. Since it is difficult to raise the
productivity on the factory floor, which is already high, Japanese companies
face a strong need to improve the productivity of white-collar workers in
order to raise their profits to revenues ratios, he says.
Japanese manufacturers are also trying to meet the challenge of slow growth
markets by shifting their product mix to more higher value-added products.
The move of consumer electronics makers into software, such as Hollywood
films, and advanced components, such as liquid crystal displays, is an
example of that trend.
As they shift the focus of their own energies to high value-added products,
Japanese companies are looking increasingly to tie-ups and OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) deals with other companies, to supply them with
those products that are less profitable for them to produce but which they
still need to complement their product line-up.
Fujitsu, for example, is asking Siemens Nixodorf, the German computer
company, to supply it with low-end mainframe computer technology, while it
supplies Siemens with higher end machines.
In a further response to the slowdown in their markets, Japanese
manufacturers are developing their global strategies, to enable them to call
on resources worldwide rather than just at home.
A growing number of car makers are therefore calling on their overseas
production facilities to provide them with cheaper components, while
consumer electronics makers are investing in US companies, ranging from
large film studios to small venture companies, to better exploit the wealth
of new market ideas emerging in that country. Matsushita, for example, not
only owns MCA, the entertainment group, but has a stake in 3DO, a small
company developing advanced multimedia products which has yet to make a
profit.
The changes being required of Japanese manufacturers pose a significant
challenge to managers, who have so far only had to concern themselves
largely with manufacturing issues. 'It is the business strategy of top
management in Japan that is now being questioned,' says Mr Sasaki. Unless
top management can introduce dramatic change, companies are unlikely to
achieve the real restructuring they need for a revitalisation of Japanese
manufacturing, he predicts.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (3): Caution
retards growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<TEXT>
IN THE DIZZYING days of the late 1980s, Japanese brokers scrambled to hire
employees and open new branches, believing that Tokyo stock prices were
irrepressible and customers would be forming ever longer queues to buy the
products on offer.
Large brokers took space in departments stores and railway complexes, and
the second-tier brokers developed first-tier ambitions, investing in
unnecessarily sophisticated computer systems or, in the case of Sanyo
Securities, building a Tokyo trading room the size of a large warehouse.
From finding new ways to expand, Japan's brokers are now looking for
creative ideas for cost cutting. For the 10 brokers in the second-tier, that
may mean challenging old notions of job security by retiring middle-aged,
middle managers instead of merely reducing the graduate intake.
Banks are confronting a different bubble-era legacy, a rising pile of
non-performing loans to property developers or to companies which used
overpriced plots of land as collateral. Banks' core profitability has soared
in the past year as interest rates have fallen, creating a favourable
spread, but those gains have been lost to increased provisions for
non-performing loans.
The 11 leading commercial banks announced an average 70 per cent increase in
loan loss reserves for the financial year ended in March, and wrote off a
total of Y172.8bn, an increase of 478 per cent on a year earlier, but a only
small portion of their combined non-performing loans of Y8,435bn.
Bank of Japan officials are concerned that the bubble era has not only left
scars on institutions' balance sheets, but made them overcautious in
lending, possibly retarding economic growth. In its most recent quarterly
outlook, the bank referred to this concern in its understated description of
'heightened risk aversion'.
One difference between the banks and brokers is that the latter do not have
the same portfolios of problem loans, while both are still struggling to cut
costs in an environment made more competitive by financial deregulation. In
July, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and
Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank, opened securities subsidiaries.
The openings followed a decade of debate about reform, which was welcomed
during the late 1980s, when there seemed to be profit enough to allow banks
a limited role in the securities industry and to enable brokers to establish
banking subsidiaries.
But the stock market collapse, and the accompanying collapse in brokers'
profits, changed the terms of debate and encouraged the finance ministry to
impose tougher than predicted limits on banks' role in the securities
industry. For example, it was initially proposed that banks house their new
subsidiaries at head office, but by April, when the Financial System Reform
Act became effective, the rules had changed.
Banks were forced to put their new subsidiaries in a separate building.
Staff at the securities operation had to wear a distinctive uniform, and
they were not allowed to accompany the bank's employees on calls to clients.
Apart from these restrictions, the banks were excluded from dealing in
stocks, though they were able to underwrite convertible and warrant bonds.
These limits have not been enough to save the more vulnerable second-tier
brokers. Last month, Daiwa Bank was called on to rescue Cosmo Securities,
which has reported extraordinary losses of Y68.9bn from tobashi, the
shuffling of stocks around client accounts in the hope of not booking
losses.
Other second-tier houses are still in difficulty. Unlike the Big Four,
Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi
Securities, seven of the ten brokers have been unable to turn the market's
rise over the past year into a profit. For the first half ending this month,
Sanyo Securities is expecting a pre-tax loss of Y5.7bn, Kankaku Securities
Y5.6bn, and Dai-Ichi Securities Y3.2bn.
Mr David Threadgold, brokers' analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research
(Japan), said some of the second-tier brokers, in order to make profits,
need a daily turnover value of almost Y600bn on the Tokyo exchange, about 30
per cent higher than the average so far this year.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (1): Time to
set new goals - After the bubble years of the 1980s, manufacturers are
facing a fourth year of falling profits, and financial institutions are
sweeping up the debris from their excesses. Robert Thomson reports on the
current debate about the future of corporate Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LATEST course in Japanese corporate therapy is Goal Setting, represented
in the phonetic script of katakana, which tells a Japanese reader that the
term and, perhaps, the idea are foreign. The words also tell of a lack of
direction among companies famed for an ability to set and beat ambitious
long-term goals.
Goals need resetting because Japanese manufacturing companies face a fourth
year of falling profits, and realise that an eventual recovery will be less
profitable than in the past, when the hard years of yen appreciation or
recession were quickly replaced by another bout of rapid sales growth and
apparently boundless expansion.
Financial institutions are still sweeping away the debris from their
excesses during the late 1980s, the so-called bubble years, which left banks
with non-performing loans that will be a burden until the end of the decade.
Larger brokers are also under pressure, but several mid-sized houses are in
serious difficulty, as was shown when Cosmo Securities was bailed out last
month by a leading bank, Daiwa Bank.
The Cosmo case provides evidence that some old corporate walls are
crumbling, though others remain sturdily in place, resisting recession,
deregulation and financial market collapse. On the financial fringe,
relationships are changing. Banks are varying interest rates for companies
in the same corporate group, while larger companies are selling bank stocks,
though not those of their closest institutions.
Japan's cross-shareholding system is generally holding together. Companies
needing to improve profitability, but weighed down by low-yielding stocks
held for the sake of maintaining a traditional relationship, are
nevertheless finding themselves obliged to sell stock. Institutional
investors, too, are threatening to offload their holdings in companies which
refuse to increase dividend payments.
The threats come as debate gathers momentum over whether Japan is in the
middle of a shift from employee sovereignty to shareholder sovereignty.
Companies must be more aggressive in cutting costs, including personnel, to
bolster profits, which will be distributed in ever larger amounts to
investors more willing to take legal action to protect their rights, or so
the theory goes.
But the swaying of the economic and social structure has inspired fears
among executives and bureaucrats that Japan's era has ended, that the
country will be hollowed out by the flow of manufacturing investment to east
Asia, and that a corporate culture supposedly an extension of the communal
spirit of the rice fields is withering.
Goal-setting does not seem a bad idea at a time of such grim visions. The
term was coined by Mr Shigeru Watanabe, of the Nomura Research Institute,
who wants companies to pay more attention to return on equity and less to
the aggressive pursuit of market share: 'In the coming years, companies will
have to look at return on equity if they are to be successful. They need to
set new goals by looking at these numbers more closely.'
The numbers are not looking good. Since 1984, return on equity of listed
manufacturers has slipped from 9.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent in the year
ending in March, and Mr Watanabe estimates that the rate will fall to about
2.5 per cent for the current financial year. The operating profit to sales
ratio for manufacturers has fallen from 5.47 per cent at the end of 1984 to
2.88 per cent for last financial year.
Mr John Baldwin, head of research at Jardine Fleming Securities, said
executives are beginning to realise that they will have to make difficult
decisions about job losses and corporate direction which they have not had
to face in the post-second world war period.
'Executives in the 55 to 60 years old range really have had the best of
Japan. Profits and salaries have always risen, but that has come to an end
and it is quite a shock. They have to make some very difficult decisions,'
Mr Baldwin said. 'Personnel expenses rose 5.8 per cent last year even though
sales fell by 2.1 per cent. This does not represent a sustainable pattern'.
The longer the downturn and the weaker the recovery, the more pressure
Japanese companies will face to reform their character. The yen's
appreciation this year has prompted manufacturers to look for cheaper sites
in east Asia, where production quality has risen markedly over the past
decade. If the yen remains strong, the Bank of Japan fears 'a massive
substitution of overseas production for domestic production'.
A sure sign that large companies are setting new goals will come if they
begin to lay off workers, instead of just lowering the ceiling on the annual
intake. Honda Motor is reducing its workforce by 3,000 over the next three
years through natural attrition and a reduced intake of graduates. JVC, the
consumer electronics company, is to reduce its workforce by 2,000 over the
next year, and Matsushita Electric Industrial has transferred 2,000
employees to retail outlets.
These cutbacks indicate that Japanese manufacturers are facing the most
difficult decisions. Mr Baldwin said that at the end of July, there were
424,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing, compared with a year earlier, while
during 1987, when the economy was suffering from an earlier bout of yen
appreciation, 190,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. The unemployment rate is
still a modest 2.5 per cent, because workers have been shifted sideways into
sales subsidiaries or service company affiliates.
The sideways shift is the traditional response to downturn. Staff stay on
the payroll and the promise of lifetime employment is kept, but companies
are unsure whether they can continue to keep their side of the bargain.
Manufacturers say Japanese consumers have lost their appetite for durables,
as sales of cars, colour televisions and videocassette recorders are all far
below peaks reached during the giddy days of the late 1980s, when companies
geared up for increased production by commissioning new plants.
Manufacturers are still paying for that expansion in higher depreciation
charges, but they and financial institutions based their investment
calculations on capital costs reckoned to be close to zero. Money was easily
raised on the stock market and return on investment was not the first
priority of managers inspired by the bubble era antics of their
contemporaries and competitors.
Some Japanese companies thought they were addressing decline through
diversification, the corporate therapy course of the mid and late 1980s.
Nippon Steel ventured into computers and mushrooms, Komatsu the construction
machinery producer, began distributing Norwegian pleasure cruisers, and
Minebea, the bearings maker, drifted into cosmetics.
A decade later, Nippon Steel is expecting a Y15bn pre-tax loss for the year
to March, and admits that it will have to review loss-making
diversifications. Komatsu last month announced a restructuring programme
that will increase component imports. Minebea is out of cosmetics and early
this year sold a semiconductor subsidiary, NMB Semiconductor, to Nippon
Steel.
If shareholder sovereignty is to be more than phrase favoured by
commission-hungry brokers, executives will need to be more responsible for
wayward investment decisions which have reduced profits and the returns to
shareholders. Revisions to the Commercial Code in June eased filing
requirements for shareholder litigants, though Japanese courts are generally
wary of exercising their power to set clear precedents.
Japanese executives are reluctant to alter a course that has brought them
remarkable success. There is a lingering sense that profits and partnerships
will return to normal, but there is also a recognition that stimulatory
packages and a series of interest rate cuts have failed to budge the
economy. When executives finally emerge from the still deepening trough,
they are likely to find an unfamiliar landscape.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts recover losses after disappointing
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

UK GILTS ended a volatile day slightly higher, recovering from a
disappointing gilts auction.
The auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 6 3/4 per cent stock due 2004 was covered
just 1.18 times - compared with expectations of a 1.5 to 1.7 ratio - and had
a three basis points tail, the difference between the average and highest
accepted yield.
The low cover was put down to a lack of foreign buying in the light of
sterling's current weakness, as well as the gilt market's recent rally,
which left most investors reluctant to chase prices higher.
Prices dropped nearly half a point on the auction result, but soon rebounded
on heavy demand for the new stock. 'We were flooded with buying inquiries,'
said one trader. 'There was a lot of pent-up foreign demand at lower
levels.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg, said the low cover was
'largely a reflection of the market getting more sophisticated and more
experienced in doing auctions.' Moreover, he points out that four of the
last eight auctions saw bid-to-cover ratios of between one and 1 1/4 times.
GERMAN government bonds recouped early weakness and firmed in the afternoon
on international buying spurred by the D-Mark's strength. Moreover, futures
dealers tried to push the December bund contract through its historical high
at 99.24, though it peaked short of that at 99.17. Technical factors are
expected to drive bunds further today.
The market's bullish mood was temporarily dented by the Bundesbank's latest
securities repurchase agreements, which left repo rates unchanged at 6.70
per cent. Many traders had hoped that the rate on the one-month repo might
ease as it was offered at variable rates, but it matched the 6.70 per cent
rate for two-week funds, reflecting money-market tightness and the
Bundesbank's reluctance to signal a resumption in easing, traders said.
While sentiment remains strong, some warn that bunds could come in for a
correction when investors focus on the issue calendar for the next three
months, with some DM50bn of supply in store. Bunds are also expected to
remain vulnerable to any renewed flare-ups in Russia.
DUTCH bonds outperformed bunds, with the Dutch 10-year benchmark yielding 19
basis points less that its German counterpart, compared with 16 basis points
on Tuesday.
FRENCH government bonds tracked bunds on the way up but ended the day
slightly lower on late profit-taking after three days of gains. The notional
bond future on the Matif closed at 123.76, down 0.06 point on the day.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its repo rates unchanged at 6.70 per cent
dampened hopes of a rate cut at today's Bank of France repos. But talk of
near-term easing continued, with traders now focusing on Monday's repo.
JAPANESE government bonds slipped on profit-taking after the recent rally.
The December JGB future ended at 112.73, down 0.11 points on the day.
US Treasury prices fell sharply at the long end of the maturity range
yesterday in the wake of higher oil prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 103
9/16 yielding 5.987 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent.
Trading opened in subdued fashion, with no lead from overseas markets.
Analysts said investors and traders were mostly staying on the sidelines,
awaiting the economic data due to be released later in the week, including
August personal income and spending figures, the August leading indicators
and the September purchasing managers' index.
Prices held their ground until early afternoon, when selling began to push
the long end lower. Analysts said the declines were a knee-jerk response to
higher oil prices, and may also have been prompted by rumours of a big
increase in the Conference Board's help-wanted index.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: SFA eases rules for small UK
derivative funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Futures Authority has proposed a change to existing
capital requirements which will ease the burden on small derivative fund
managers, some of whom had threatened to move their business offshore.
However, the UK regulatory authority's rules will only apply until January 1
1996, when the European Community's Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) comes
into force. This could bring even higher capital requirements than exist
under the original SFA rules.
Under the proposed change, the SFA will define a derivative fund manager
(DFM) as an arranger who has discretionary management of funds invested in
derivatives and whose income is not related to the volume of business
transacted.
It will recognise DFMs as a separate class of arrangers or discretionary
fund managers, because they do not hold client money or assets.
A reduced net capital requirement of Pounds 10,000 (excluding investments in
the DFM's own funds) will apply, according to an SFA official.
Under the CAD, the requirement could be Pounds 96,000 or Pounds 36,000,
depending on the interpretation, which has still to be clarified.
However, there are provisions which mean that any DFMs authorised under
existing rules will be able to keep the same capital requirements. This
could prompt a rush of DFM authorisation applications to the SFA prior to
1996.
Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish bank, has reappointed Morgan
Stanley to globally co-ordinate the second tranche of its big capital
flotation, writes Tom Burns from Madrid.
The offer will be split into five areas, Spain, the US, the UK, continental
Europe and the rest of the world.
Lead managers for the Spanish segment will be Argentaria, BBV, BCH, Banesto
and Banco Santander de Negocios. Warburg and BBV lead the UK part, UBS and
Santander the European part, and Goldman Sachs and BCH the rest of the
world.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to offer flexible term
options contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade plans to launch a series of flexible term options
on its US government bond and note futures contracts on November 12.
The options, which would allow users to tailor strike price, exercise style,
and expiration dates to their investment needs, will be the first customised
products offered by a futures exchange.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange pioneered the flexible options concept
last year, successfully applying it to stock index options. The options are
meant to compete with over-the-counter swaps markets, where customised
interest rate transactions are widely used by banks and corporations.
The CBoT's active Treasury bond futures and options pits will provide
liquidity for the new instruments, and its Clearinghouse will eliminate the
counterparty credit risk common to OTC trades.
'We want to show OTC market users that flexible term Treasury options,
combined with the benefits of the world's leading futures exchange, are a
superior alternative,' said Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman.
Another advantage for institutional users will be a large contract size. The
new options will be traded in lots of Dollars 20m, which is 200 times the
size of an ordinary bond futures contract at the CBoT. The flexible term
options will be offered on US Treasury bond, and five-, 10-, and two-year
Treasury note futures contracts.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms for Nestle in Canadian
dollar debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market saw a revival in new issuance yesterday as
several high-quality borrowers made offerings in a variety of currencies.
Nestle, the Swiss food group, tapped the Canadian dollar sector for the
first time, raising CDollars 300m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds.
The proceeds were thought to have been swapped into US dollars.
Its popularity with retail investors enabled Nestle to achieve an aggressive
spread of five basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due
1998. Syndicate managers were in no doubt the bonds would soon yield less
than the underlying government bond.
The Province of Alberta also tapped the Canadian dollar sector after an
18-month absence, raising Dollars 500m through an offering of 12-year
Eurobonds.
The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent
Canadian Treasury due 2003, in line with the spread on British Columbia's
recent 12-year offering and well below the spread of 51 basis points on
Ontario's 12-year.
Lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said that, in spite of its slightly inferior
rating, Alberta could command the same spread as British Columbia because it
was not a frequent borrower in the Euromarket.
The spread on both Canadian dollar offerings remained intact in the
afternoon, although the bonds eased slightly, in line with weakness in the
underlying Canadian government bond market.
Syndicate managers said Canada's general election on October 25 was likely
to cause some short-term jitters about the currency but the long-term
outlook remained favourable.
Rabobank is thought to be looking to raise Canadian dollars at a spread of
about 12 basis points over the underlying government bonds.
Elsewhere, GECC launched a Dollars 100m offering of three-year floating-rate
notes under its series B global MTN programme. The issue is linked to the
Mexican peso and is designed to hedge GECC's investments in Mexico.
Lead manager Kidder Peabody said GECC was the first foreign corporate
borrower to launch such an issue.
The notes, which will be priced on or before October 15, have an indicative
price of par and a coupon which is equal to the 91-day Mexican Cetes
money-market rate.
Arbitrage opportunities prompted Johnson &amp; Johnson, the babycare company
rarely seen in the Eurobond market, to raise L150bn through an offering of
10-year Eurobonds.
Several borrowers have used this structure to tap the Eurolira sector
recently and some syndicate managers say that investor appetite for this
type of paper is limited. Lead manager BNL said the bonds appealed to retail
investors in Italy and in northern Europe. The bonds traded at 100.05 bid,
within fees, in the afternoon.

THE French stock market authorities yesterday issued a harsh indictment of
Mr Pierre Conso, the prominent businessman who last year resigned as
chairman of the Ciments Francais cement group, after a scandal over the
discovery of FFr2bn (Dollars 354m) of off-balance sheet dealings, writes
Alice Rawsthorn.
He was also fined FFr400,000 for his part in the affair, which led to heavy
losses at the group.

flotation campaign

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat) expects to float
publicly shares in a subsidiary company in the first half of next year.
Egat, a state monopoly seeking approval for a partial privatisation, is
looking to fund expansion plans estimated to cost Bt887bn (Dollars 35bn)
over the next decade.
As a first step, it has established a subsidiary called Electricity
Generating (Egco). Egco will buy the 1232-megawatt, Bt20bn, combined-cycle
power complex at Rayong, south-east of Bangkok. It will then launch an
initial public offering to raise Bt5bn, with a further Bt15bn to be raised
through foreign borrowing.
Stockbrokers and Egat say Egat will probably keep about 50 per cent of Egco,
with the rest sold to local and foreign investors. The plan is to list Egco
on the stock exchange of Thailand by June 1994.
According to Egat, Egco will go on to buy the Khanom power station, under
construction in Nakhon Si Thammarat in southern Thailand. Egat itself is to
be listed in 1996, although some brokers regard this target as optimistic.
The Egco privatisation has been delayed by disputes over the pricing of the
company's electricity supplies and the tax liabilities relating to the
transfer of Egat assets to Egco. These problems now appear to have been
resolved.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Minorco profits rise meets
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the offshore investment arm of Anglo American, South Africa's
largest industrial company, increased pre-tax profits by 1.5 per cent in the
year to June 30 to Dollars 257.1m, in line with market expectations.
Operating profits at the Luxembourg-quoted group, which on Tuesday announced
a Dollars 1.43bn asset swap with Anglo, its largest shareholder, fell from
Dollars 63.8m to Dollars 55.8m on sales up 4 per cent at Dollars 1.73bn. The
fall was offset by an increase in treasury operations and the share of
earnings from investments.
Earnings per share rose from Dollars 1.22 to Dollars 1.25, before
extraordinary items of Dollars 68.2m, principally from the sale by Charter
Consolidated of its 38 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the UK metals
group. At the time of the sale Minorco had a 36 per cent stake in Charter
Consolidated.
The group will be paying a 57 cents dividend, a rise of 6 per cent.
The increase in sales was mainly due to the acquisition of ICI's Canadian
fertiliser business by Terra, the agribusiness subsidiary, but sales in gold
and base metals were hit by lower commodity prices.
Minorco ended the period with net cash of Dollars 1.1bn and shareholders'
funds of Dollars 2.83m.
The asset swap effectively gives Minorco control of all Anglo's non-diamond
investments outside Africa.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rights aftermath hits Fiat
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Fiat, the industrial group which this week announced Italy's
biggest rights issue, fell sharply yesterday as investors digested the
implications of the highly-dilutative deal. Fiat's ordinary shares dropped
by almost 8 per cent, to L5,595, while preference shares fell by more than 9
per cent to L3,085 on the Milan stock exchange.
Trading in the shares of Rinascente, the Fiat-controlled retailing chain
which is to be sold, remained suspended.
The Consob stock market authority, meanwhile, also called a halt to trading
in Ifil, the listed investment group, dominated by Fiat's controlling
Agnelli family, which is to launch a takeover bid for Rinascente.
After having had time to consider Tuesday night's complicated package of
cash-raising proposals, analysts focused on the negative aspects of the
complex Rinascente deal.
Rather than announcing a takeover by a big foreign retailer, as had been
widely expected, Fiat said it would sell its 58 per cent stake in the
ordinary shares of Rinascente, Italy's biggest stores and supermarkets
group, to shareholders.
Fiat shareholders will be entitled to buy four ordinary shares in Rinascente
for every 100 Fiat shares, of whatever category, currently held. Precise
pricing and timing for the deal have yet to be announced. Subsequent to the
sale, Ifil will launch a takeover for an indeterminate number of Rinascente
shares at a price yet to be revealed.
Analysts criticised the arrangement to sell Rinascente stock to Fiat
shareholders, who indirectly already own the company. 'It's like somebody
robbing you of your wallet and then asking you to pay for getting it back,'
said one.
The unusual structure of the transaction, whereby control of Rinascente will
first pass to Ifil via Fiat's shareholders, rather than directly, was seen
as a ruse to avoid triggering Italy's new rules on compulsory takeovers.
The main doubt was whether Ifil would launch a full takeover bid for all of
Rinascente's stock, or just on enough shares to obtain a bare majority. Ifil
and Ifi, the quoted company which controls the former, will automatically
gain a substantial stake in Rinascente, as they are already among Fiat's
biggest shareholders,
Separately, Ifil reported net group profits up 7 per cent to L225.1bn
(Dollars 142.7m) in the first half from L210.4bn last year.
The group, which already has a substantial cash pile, is to make a
one-for-five rights issue, raising L492bn, to provide additional funds for
the Rinascente takeover.

KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest banking group, said
yesterday that had raised FM759m (Dollars 130.8m) through its latest share
issue, AP-DJ reports from Helsinki.
Subscriptions were entered by more than 150 international institutional
investors, resulting in the increase of the number of shares offered to
63.25m from the original 50m, KOP said.
The issue brought the proportion of foreign owners in the bank's shareholder
base to 24 per cent from 13 per cent, the group added. The most recent KOP
share offering is one of several steps in a capitalisation program unveiled
in March. Since then, KOP has raised about FM2.85bn in new equity capital,
bringing the bank's total share capital to FM4.42bn and its capital adequacy
ratio to 10 per cent.

Last month the Philippines government announced plans to sell 60 per cent of

to be sold before the end of the year to a partner who would give Petron
access to crude supplies and improve its technological and financial

NEW Zealand Rail, which the government has sold for NZDollars 328m
(USDollars 181m) to a consortium led by Wisconsin Central Transportation of
the US, reports a 14 per cent increase in operating profit to NZDollars
45.5m for the year ended June, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
Sir Allan Wright, chairman, said that the company was trading 'substantially
ahead of budget' in its first three months of this year. This a period in
which the group traditionally loses money, he said.
NZ Rail said that it had made a net profit of NZDollars 16.9m after one-off
restructuring expenses, which included redundancy-related costs of NZDollars
21m. Revenue totalled NZDollars 488m, against NZDollars 495m.

HITACHI, the electronics group, is investing Y5bn (Dollars 47.2m) to
increase capacity at its US semiconductor facility by between 20 per cent
and 30 per cent, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Hitachi, an important producer of semiconductors, plans to use the increased
capacity at its facility in Texas to make mainly logic integrated circuits
for use in computers and industrial machinery, among other areas. The move
is in line with long-term plans to increase overseas manufacturing, it said.
Hitachi expects semiconductor sales to increase to Y600bn in the year ending
March, from Y560bn a year earlier.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Regulator warns on US banks'
loan margins
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKS are allowing loan margins to fall and loosening conditions for
borrowers to obtain credit, in spite of their claims to have learned lessons
from past bad debt problems, a leading US bank regulator has warned.
Mr William McDonough, the newly-appointed president of the New York Federal
Reserve, said that 'if some anecdotes are true, it seems some managers are
forgetting the lessons of the past awfully soon'.
Mr McDonough, who addressed a private meeting in Washington organised by the
G30 group of financial institutions this week, said afterwards that recent
data received by the New York Fed showed that banks were relaxing controls.
Mr McDonough said that margins on unsyndicated loans were falling in the New
York area, and in the past two weeks the Bank had seen evidence that credit
standards were being reduced as a result of competition to extend loans.
Mr McDonough, a commercial banker who recently took over as president of the
New York Fed from Mr Gerald Corrigan, said the recent narrowing of spreads
on loans was 'the first indication that wisdom is being fluttered away'.
However, a senior US banker said at a separate briefing that he thought the
risk management of banks had improved. Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman of Chase
Manhattan, said readiness to make loans meant there was no 'credit crunch'.
Mr Labrecque said Chase had observed some banks competing aggressively for
loans, but he did not believe most were doing so. While some banks 'might
have dropped a few loan covenants, I would not depict that as rampant
change'.
Mr Labrecque also said he believed that the potential risk to financial
systems from the rapid growth in the Dollars 4,500bn market in
over-the-counter derivative financial products could be exaggerated, and
most banks had strict controls.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Third-term earnings flat at
Marriott

<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the hotels and food services company, yesterday
reported flat third-quarter earnings and said its board had voted to go
ahead with its planned demerger on October 8.
After a year of battling with angry bondholder groups, the company is
splitting into two. Its main operating interests - lodging and food services
operations, accounting for about 80 per cent of the unified company's
revenues - will be known as Marriott International. Its property assets and
its Host/Travel Plazas business, as well as the bulk of the group's debts,
will be known as Host Marriott.
Marriott International, the company whose shares will be distributed to
Marriott Corporation shareholders in the form of a special dividend, will
report its third-quarter results in mid-October.
For the three months to September 10, Marriott had net income of Dollars
27m, or 21 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn compared with net
income of Dollars 26m, or 21 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.95bn a year
earlier. Operating profit before corporate expenses and interest rose to
Dollars 134m in the quarter from Dollars 124m a year earlier.
Stripping out the impact of income tax adjustments and lodging dispositions
in both years, Marriott said its operating profits rose 7 per in the latest
quarter on a comparable basis, while net income was 20 per cent higher.
On Wall Street, shares in Marriott closed Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 30
7/8 . Analysts had expected earnings of about 26 cents a share in the latest
quarter.
The company's lodging operations turned in an 11 per cent improvement in
third-quarter operating profits including profits from the disposition of an
equity interest in an international hotel. Sales were 3 per cent higher. The
company said comparable unit sales and occupancy rose solidly in all four
hotel brands.
The Host/Travel Plazas division, which will be part of the Host Marriott
company, reported higher sales in the quarter but operating profits
declined.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Water groups link to stay afloat
 -US suppliers are merging to offset rising costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFLUENCE of market forces is pulling the fragmented US water supply
industry towards greater consolidation. In particular, the growing interest
of European companies in this largely untapped American market suggests a
period of accelerated change is under way.
Evidence of the trend surfaced last week when United Water Resources, a New
Jersey-based group with 235,000 customers in two states, agreed to acquire
GWC, with nearly 300,000 customers in 14 states.
The Dollars 200m deal would create the second-largest investor-owned water
supply group in the country, with estimated annual revenues of nearly
Dollars 300m.
The enlarged United may seem like small fry in an industry with billions of
dollars in revenues a year. In fact, it is a leading force in what is a
highly-decentralised business which had not seen a significant merger in 30
years.
There are some 60,000 supply systems in the US. About 70 per cent are owned
by local government authorities, while the remainder are in private hands.
Most of the second category are small, independently-owned concerns serving
a handful of communities in a narrow operating area.
Large investor-owned groups have had a relatively minor presence, but have
grown steadily in recent years as more independents have been swallowed up
by the likes of United, GWC and American Water Works, the largest group in
the sector, with 1992 revenues of nearly Dollars 660m.
Over the past decade, American has, on average added about 12 independents
and some 25,000 new customers a year. Last month it completed its biggest
acquisition, picking up four middle-sized water systems in the mid-west from
Avatar Holdings. The deal added 130,000 customers and Dollars 30m to
American's annual revenues.
'Expansion has become a strategic necessity for investor-owned groups,' says
Mr Ward Welsh, director of corporate communications for American. 'With the
emphasis on conservation in recent years, water use and sales have been
flat. Buying up smaller companies is one of the few ways to increase
earnings.'
While consolidation has been evident for several years, three recent
developments appear to have quickened the pace.
First, compliance with stringent new federal environmental standards is
forcing many water systems to spend heavily on capital projects. Many are
finding it impossible to finance the required improvements, mandated by the
Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Government-owned water
systems, as well as private ones, have been affected. Philadelphia Suburban,
an investor-owned group with 245,000 customers, recently snapped up a public
water system with operations within its service area after local officials
were unable to pay for improvements required by the federal government.
Second, water groups are realising the benefit of geographical
diversification in a business where adverse weather conditions can cause
earnings to fluctuate.
American, with operations in 21 states, was able to offset losses in areas
of the mid-west hit by flooding this summer with profits from systems in the
east, where record high temperatures brought heavy demand for water.
Third, foreign-owned companies are eager to expand in the US. However, the
complexity of the US regulatory and rate-setting system, with its
overlapping federal, state and local jurisdictions, makes such forays
difficult. As a consequence, alliances with US companies more familiar with
the domestic operating environment have become appealing.
All three of these factors came into play in the decision by United and GWC
to join forces.
For United, which had operated just two big water systems in a contiguous
area of northern New Jersey and southern New York, GWC offered systems of
various sizes, in areas with expanding population bases, such as Florida and
New Mexico. The addition of GWC's systems not only offered higher growth
potential but would help United avoid weather-related swings in earnings.
The link made sense for GWC as well. The Delaware-based group was facing
high capital expenditures, projected by the company at Dollars 40m in each
of the next five years. The spending in part was to pay for environmental
improvements, such as sophisticated filtration systems.
United offered strengths that would help GWC over the financing hurdle. The
New Jersey-based group not only had a healthy balance sheet but also enjoyed
a reputation for being a well-managed company, according to Mr Paul Gioia,
who follows the industry for First Albany, a New York securities house.
Mr Donald Correll, United's chairman, says the group also has expertise in
bringing systems up to federal standards. He says United recently completed
many of the same improvements that GWC was just beginning to address.
Finally, the deal had a foreign dimension because 82 per cent of GWC was
owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez, the French group with controlling
interests in several UK water companies. Lyonnaise, which bought its GWC
stake about 10 years ago, would own 26 per cent of the newly-merged group.
Even though Lyonnaise was required to surrender control, Mr Patrick Babin,
its deputy chief financial officer, says the agreement was 'a signal of
persisting interest in the US market', rather than a desire to withdraw from
it. He says the group decided it would achieve the critical mass necessary
to grow faster if it took on a partner.
'It is not a question of aggressiveness,' says Mr Babin, 'but a question of
having the proper resources, both financial and technical (in order to
expand).'
One field in which foreign companies have shown great interest is
waste-water treatment. Anglian Water of the UK, for one, recently formed a
joint venture with American to operate privatised waste-water systems in the
US. Its first contract is with the city of Indianapolis.
The venture, called American Anglian Environmental Technologies, shares much
of the logic that led GWC and its French parent to United. The European
partner, Anglian, offers special resources (proprietary treatment processes,
in the UK group's case), while the US partner, American, has an insider's
knowledge of the industry. Enlightened self-interest has pulled them
together.

KRAFT General Foods, the US food products company, is considering the sale
of its Birds Eye frozen vegetables and fruit business.
The company, part of the Philip Morris group, said it was in negotiations
with several parties over a possible disposal of the operation, which
generated about Dollars 280m in sales in the year to September.
Kraft declined to identify the companies involved in the discussions, or to
comment on the nature of the alternatives it was also considering.
The move by Kraft to entertain offers for Birds Eye highlights the company's
recent efforts to divest its less profitable grocery lines to concentrate on
products such as breakfast cereals and refrigerated foods, which deliver
higher operating margins and show more growth potential.
The Birds Eye announcement comes just a month after Kraft agreed to sell its
entire frozen dessert business to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, for an estimated Dollars 300m.
The Birds Eye business has a share of about 15 per cent of the Dollars 1.9bn
US frozen vegetable and fruit market, according to Nielsen Market Research.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mercedes opts for Alabama as
plant site

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car company, will today announce a decision
to locate its first US car manufacturing plant, costing Dollars 300m, in the
state of Alabama.
The decision ends the most heated competition in the past year between US
states over the site of a greenfield manufacturing investment by a foreign
company.
It is a coup for Alabama, which has a cluster of high-technology industries
in the north, but has been slower than other south-eastern rivals to attract
high-profile new investment.
Mercedes announced last April it planned to build a new four-wheel-drive
sports utility vehicle in the US, but left open the location of the plant.
Although more than 30 states offered sites, the company came down to a short
list in the south-eastern US, which apparently included North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. North Carolina had been
widely rumoured to be the front-runner.
The company, which has called a news conference for this morning in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will name a site at nearby Vance, on a 1,000-acre site
set amid rolling forest and parkland.
Mercedes is already an important manufacturer of heavy trucks in the US,
through its Freightliner subsidiary. This, however, will be its first car
manufacturing operation on any scale outside Germany.
The plant, due to start production in 1997, will employ 1,500 people by the
end of the decade and make up to 60,000 vehicles a year, with as much as
40,000 of them for export.
Mercedes is following a lead set by BMW, the rival German luxury car
company, which is building a Dollars 350m plant in another south-eastern
state, South Carolina, where it will manufacture a new car for the US and
export markets.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Jordan, the new chairman of Westinghouse Electric, yesterday set
in motion the first of an expected series of management changes at the
company. The diversified group has been struggling to recover from an
ill-advised foray into financial services during the 1980s.
Mr Jordan, a former PepsiCo executive named Westinghouse chairman and chief
executive just three months ago, said in an internal memorandum Mr Warren
Hollinshead would leave his job as chief financial officer before mid-1995,
when he was scheduled to take early retirement.
Mr Hollinshead will participate in the search for his replacement, from both
inside and outside the company.
Analysts expect him to select an outsider as the first member of a team
charged with reversing the fortunes of the group, which has taken Dollars
5bn in charges over the past three years.
In January, Mr Jordan replaced Mr Paul Lego, who is believed to have left
the company under pressure from institutional investors unhappy with his
failure to stem losses related to real estate, junk bonds and leveraged
buy-out investments.
Over the past year, Westinghouse has sought to reduce its massive debt
burden by gradually withdrawing from financial services, in particular from
the property market.
As part of Mr Jordan's recovery plan, it agreed to sell its electronic
distribution and control business to Eaton Corp for Dollars 1.1bn in August.
Three other operations - Wesco, an electrical equipment distributor; the
Knoll office furniture operation; and Westinghouse Communities, a property
developer - are also on the block.
However, Westinghouse's difficulties extend into its core operations as
well. Earlier this month, it warned of a substantial downturn in
third-quarter earnings due to a 'continued deterioration' of its
environmental clean-up businesses as well as declines in electronic systems,
power systems and broadcasting.
Net income from continuing operations is expected to drop 50 per cent,
against last year's comparable figure of Dollars 91m, or 22 a cents a share.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Big names at little-known
investment house - Alan Friedman catches up with James Baker and colleagues
at the Carlyle Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN cabinet-level officials complete their stints in the US government they
often find themselves recruited to corporate boards, investment banks and
other private-sector entities keen to cash in on their big names and
substantial contacts.
However Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state who finished his
time in the Bush administration running the White House, has chosen a more
low-profile re-entry into the private sector than most of his peers.
He is spending some of his time at the family law firm of Baker and Botts,
and plans to write a book about his experience in foreign policy. Rather
more significantly, however, the 63-year-old Mr Baker recently became one of
only seven partners in the Carlyle Group, a little-known and fast-growing
Washington-based investment company that likes to call itself a merchant
bank.
Each of the partners is believed to earn between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m a
year.
The unquoted Carlyle Group, named after the famous hotel in New York, was
founded only six years ago with initial capital from the Mellon family,
which owns 20 per cent of the business. It is not a merchant bank in the UK
sense, in that its strategy tends to involve direct investment rather than
corporate finance advice for third parties.
Although young, Carlyle has already acquired equity holdings in companies
with nearly Dollars 5bn of annual revenues, covering activities such as
defence, telecommunications, property and services.
Among its more recent deals was the purchase of the aircraft division of LTV
Aerospace, a business with Dollars 2bn of annual revenues and an important
contractor for the B-2 bomber. The deal was controversial in Washington
because Carlyle started out as a partner with Thomson-CSF, the French
government-owned defence group accused in Congress of having supplied
military equipment to Iraq. Opposition to the French taking control of LTV's
missiles business resulted in Carlyle changing tactics and joining forces
with Northrop and Loral, two US defence contractors.
The chairman of Carlyle is Mr Frank Carlucci, the former secretary of
defence in the Reagan administration and once a Princeton classmate of Mr
Baker's. Another new partner at Carlyle is Mr Richard Darman, who served as
head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Bush
administration. Yet another executive is Mr Alton Keel, president of a
newly-formed international division and a former national security adviser
to President Ronald Reagan.
Such a politically high-powered team seems odd given the group's financial
approach to deal-making. But Carlyle is the only company of its kind in
Washington, and connections clearly help. For example, it was Carlyle that
advised Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia when he made a
controversial Dollars 590m investment in Citicorp in 1991.
Mr Baker promises he will not represent any foreign governments or seek to
lobby the US government. However colleagues at Carlyle are busy seeking
business in places such as Saudi Arabia.
Mr Baker, who says it feels 'good to be back in the private sector'
describes Carlyle as 'an extraordinarily capable collection of individuals
who have a very good track record in the business of investing in
companies'. Looking relaxed in a blue monogrammed shirt with the initials
JAB, he says he does not want to manage anything any more. 'I have run five
presidential campaigns. I have run the Treasury. I have run the White House
twice, and I have run the State Department. I don't want to manage.'
Mr David Rubenstein, a managing partner at Carlyle, says the former Reagan
and Bush administration officials in the company are helpful in generating
business because 'these are people who clearly have high visibility and an
ability to get meetings for us'.
Yet even without Mr Baker and his colleagues Mr Rubenstein has been able to
attract fresh capital, most notably a Dollars 100m commitment this week from
Mr George Soros, the investor who has joined a new buy-out fund called
Carlyle Partners. With Mr Soros's contribution included, the fund already
has Dollars 250m of its Dollars 500m total committed.
A three-man Carlyle team, led by Mr Rubenstein, will be in Europe next week
seeking more investment in the fund - which expects to buy into European as
well as American companies - from institutions such as S. G. Warburg in
London, Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and Credit Lyonnais in Paris.
Mr Rubenstein says he will also be trying to acquire minority shareholdings
in state companies being privatised in France, Italy and Germany. He hopes
to close shortly a Dollars 20m investment in IABG, a defence electronics
testing business owned by the German government and located near Munich. In
Italy, he is working with local partners to buy into companies being
privatised in the energy sector.
Carlyle is clearly an unusual company to find in the middle of Washington.
However, its ability to attract big names and fresh capital suggest it could
soon become better-known in both Wall Street and European financial centres.

MCI, the second-biggest US long-distance telephone company, yesterday said
it was shaking up its internal organisation and eliminating the position of
president and chief operating officer. This was formerly held by Mr Daniel
Akerson, who quit unexpectedly in August.
MCI said it was realigning and consolidating its US operations, and setting
up units to supervise international alliances and business with
multinational firms.
The company is creating MCI Communications Services, which will be
responsible for US operations and MCI's core long-distance business. It will
be headed by Mr Gerald Taylor, formerly president of MCI Consumer Markets.
MCI International Group will be responsible for managing international
alliances, selling to multinational companies, and looking for international
opportunities.
Mr Bert Roberts, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This reorganisation
continues the trend toward greater autonomy for our business units.'
MCI said it was eliminating the position of president and chief operating
officer as it moved toward more autonomous operating units. Mr Akerson left
MCI to head General Instrument, a manufacturer of transmission equipment for
cable television.

THE CLINTON administration yesterday joined the big three US carmakers in
unveiling an ambitious public and private research initiative aimed at
developing models three times more fuel-efficient than those currently
produced.
The joint 10-year project commits the government to sharing with Detroit
technology, which originated with defence and space research.
General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, in turn, have agreed to co-operate
with Washington, and one another, in adapting the technology to civilian
uses, developing advanced manufacturing techniques, and producing prototype
vehicles.
The long-term goal is to make affordable cars that will travel three times
as far on a gallon of fuel than at present.
Among the technologies on offer by the government are strong, light-weight
materials and electrical storage devices developed in the 1980s for the
'Star Wars' missile defence system.
On the table from the space programme are advanced fuel cells, which produce
electricity by combining oxygen and gas.
An inter-agency task force will oversee the initiative, with the
private-sector effort co-ordinated by the carmakers' existing research
consortium, known as Uscar.

GENERAL Motors, which has been involved in a shake-up of its supplier
network over the past 18 months, said third-quarter US production would be
70,000 vehicles below earlier estimates, writes Martin Dickson. It blamed
problems with fitting new parts into its models.
The company estimated in July that production of cars and trucks would total
845,000 units in the quarter. This is now expected to be 775,000.
Analysts said the shortfall could hit its third-quarter financial results,
and make it harder to achieve its goal of breaking even in North America
this year on an operating basis, after several years of heavy losses.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Global overcapacity adds to woes
 -Hopes rest on tie-ups and new models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S downgrade by Mazda reflects the severity of the business
environment facing Japan's third-largest carmaker.
Mazda's 60 per cent export ratio makes the company vulnerable to this year's
rapid appreciation of the yen and the sharp downturn in Europe, notably in
Germany where Mazda is the top-selling Japanese car.
In Europe, plans for manufacture have been shelved in spite of mounting
pressure for a reduction in Japanese imports. Earlier this year, Mazda was
forced to abandon a tie-up with large shareholder Ford that would have given
it a manufacturing base in the European Community.
Mazda is losing ground in its domestic market where, in the first six months
of this year, it posted the largest decline in output among Japan's 11
vehicle manufacturers. Output fell 18.6 per cent, compared with an industry
average of 7.2 per cent.
The company blames the decline in part on a reduction of pick-up truck
manufacture, due to its decision to buy pick-ups from Ford starting this
summer. But officials admit that a lack of new models has not helped.
The forecast pre-tax loss of Y32bn (Dollars 301.9m) for the year ending next
March will be Mazda's first loss in 23 years. Some analysts say that Mazda
over-extended itself in the domestic market by launching five dealership
channels and a strategy to increase market share to 10 per cent.
The company is addressing these problems with a programme to pursue quality
rather than quantity in production, through cost-cutting and plans to
strengthen its domestic sales force.
Mr Yoshihiro Wada, president, sees the company's woes as part of an
industry-wide trend: 'There is overcapacity in the world auto industry new
car demand is not going to increase much in developed countries which are
mature markets.'
Each carmaker must deal with this overcapacity by adjusting production to
levels more appropriate to slow growth. But Mr Wada is loath to reverse
completely Mazda's recent expansion programme.
It does not help that Mazda has a brand-new factory in Japan which is not
running at capacity.
'Mazda is too big to become a niche player,' Mr Wada says. 'It needs a range
of models as core mass-market products, and other specialist cars in
addition.'
Mr Wada is looking to tie-ups with other carmakers as a way to keep a full
product range and still survive in markets where he fears future growth
could be less than 1 per cent.
'We need to make a range of products because dealers want a number of models
to offer their customers, even though they may not be in large volumes,' he
explains.
Mazda is buying diesel engines from Isuzu and negotiating with Nissan to
cross-supply each other with commercial vehicles. The same strategy could be
applied on a global level, where the needs of regional markets differ
significantly, says Mr Wada.
He is optimistic that such co-operation 'in which each company maintains its
own identity' provides a way around the overcapacity afflicting the world
car industry.
But he is impatient with US demands that Japan make more efforts to open its
car market to imports and that Japanese carmakers buy more US auto parts.
His message is that US carmakers need to make a greater effort to develop
cars that Japanese consumers want.
Given Mazda's dismal performance in its domestic market, it is a criticism
Mr Wada himself may face if the Japanese car market remains weak. Mazda is
counting on a number of new model launches expected in the coming months to
revitalise sales.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mazda omits dividend as loss
grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAZDA, the Japanese car-maker 24.5 per cent owned by Ford of the US,
yesterday said its losses this year would be larger than forecast, forcing
it to pass the dividend for the first time.
Pre-tax losses are forecast at Y32bn (Dollars 296m) rather than Y12bn
estimated in May, while sales are expected to fall to Y1,920bn from a
previously forecast Y2,070bn. This would be the company's first loss in 23
years.
The downward revision reflects the severity of the business climate
surrounding Japanese carmakers. Last month, the industry saw exports decline
14.7 per cent, the fifth consecutive monthly fall and the worst performance
in 14 years, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Mazda said the loss would arise largely as a result of the yen's sharp
appreciation and a worse-than-expected downturn in the European market.
Mazda does not expect to return to profit next year, since it sees little
hope for a strong recovery in either the Japanese or European markets.
Mr Makoto Miyaji, executive vice-president, said that Mazda hoped to return
to profit and resume dividend payments in fiscal 1995.
The yen's appreciation is expected to shave Y65bn off annual revenues, while
the fall in European sales will make up the bulk of Mazda's expected 18 per
cent decline in sales overseas.
In Europe, Mazda is forecasting an 18 per cent fall in sales to 240,000
units at the retail level, from 292,000 units last year. This compares with
a 16 per cent fall in overall demand in Europe. Unit sales in Japan are
expected to decline 3 per cent to 455,000 units from 470,000 units last
year.
Mazda has introduced restructuring measures, but had not been able to 'catch
up with the changing business environment within a short period', it said.
It is closing a production line in Hiroshima, where it employs about 300,
and shifting its production to other lines.
Restructuring plans will be strengthened and brought forward. Staff levels
will be reduced through natural attrition by 3,000 over the next three
years, rather than 1,500 as planned.
The company is cutting costs and reducing its capital expenditure to Y60bn
from Y80bn last year. It may cut the number of cars in its range to deal
with a slower market, Mr Miyaji said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster agrees Dollars 600m
investment in Viacom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VIACOM, the cable television company, yesterday gained a new ally and
additional financial muscle in its battle to take over Paramount
Communications when Blockbuster Entertainment agreed to invest Dollars 600m
in Viacom.
The deal will give Viacom greater flexibility to increase its agreed offer
for Paramount, which is trailing a rival, hostile offer from QVC Network,
the cable TV home shopping business headed by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent
film industry figure.
Viacom, with interests ranging from cable systems to the MTV pop music TV
channel, declined to comment yesterday on market speculation that it had
been talking to two other companies - regional telephone company
Southwestern Bell and cable systems group Cox Enterprises - in an effort to
secure additional funding.
Blockbuster is a fast-growing Florida-based company which is by far the
largest home video retailer in the US and also runs two large chains of
music stores. It owns the Cityvision video rental company in the UK.
It has also been moving into film production, buying large interests in the
Spelling Entertainment and Republic Entertainment film companies, which are
in the process of merging.
Its investment in Viacom - and thence, it hopes, in Paramount - reinforces
this trend. Paramount owns one of the last large Hollywood studios not part
of a conglomerate.
Blockbuster is buying Dollars 600m of cumulative convertible preferred stock
which is convertible into Viacom's class B, non-voting common stock at a
price of Dollars 70 a share.
If the Viacom-Paramount merger does not go through by next August, either
Blockbuster or Viacom can reduce the investment to Dollars 300m.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, who will join the Viacom board,
said the new 'strategic relationship' between the two groups would allow
both to capitalise on their highly complementary businesses. It was, he
added, a strong vote of confidence in the Viacom/Paramount merger.
Wall Street analysts view Blockbuster's move into production partly as
defensive action to protect the company from a potential loss of video
rental business when new technology allows consumers to call up movies on
demand over inter-active home entertainment systems.
Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, said the two companies would pursue
potential ways to benefit from the new relationship after the merger with
Paramount.
Yesterday's deal had a modest impact on the shares of companies involved in
the Paramount battle.
On Wall Street, Viacom's A shares closed Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 59
1/2 while its B shares dropped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 valuing its bid
at Dollars 7.7bn.
QVC rose Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 59 5/8, valuing its bid at Dollars 9.8bn.
Paramount closed Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 79 1/2 on growing hopes of an
improved Viacom offer, while Blockbuster fell Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 29.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group,
resisted the impact of recession in some of its principal markets to
announce stable first-half net profits of FFr3.01bn (Dollars 519m).
The results for the first half of the year released yesterday compared with
net profits of FFr3.12bn in the first six months of 1992, but did not
include any exceptional gains. In the first half of last year, Alcatel
Alsthom received a capital gain of FFr440m resulting from the sale of shares
in the group.
The results follow confirmation that the company is to take a 2 per cent
stake in Fiat as part of the Italian group's plan to raise L5,000bn (Dollars
3.2bn) in new capital.
Alcatel Alsthom will represent part of a stable core of shareholders in the
Italian company, which will hold a reciprocal 2 per cent stake in the French
group.
The company said the trends in the first half are expected to continue for
the rest of the year and full-year profits should be equivalent to the
FFr7.05bn achieved in 1992.
Mr Andre Wettstein, executive vice-president in charge of finance, said the
first-half performance had been constrained by the economic downturn in
Germany and Italy. But he added that the group was well placed to benefit
from an upturn.
In Germany, the group's single biggest market for telecommunications and
cables, orders remained strong. Sales, which fell to FFr73.63bn in the first
six months from FFr79.48bn in the first half of 1992, were expected to
decline by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent for the full year.
In Asia, the company said important contracts had been won in all its core
business areas, including a Dollars 1.25bn deal for a power plant in Hong
Kong and an order from China for digital telephone lines.

ITALY'S leading state-controlled telecommunications groups, which are due to
be rationalised and sold to the public under a greatly simplified structure,
reported strong profits growth in the first half of 1993.
Stet, the overall holding company, said consolidated gross profits rose to
L1,788bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in the first half from L1,566bn, while pre-tax
earnings at parent company level rose to L428.1bn from L400.9bn.
The group forecast earnings for the year would be in line with those for
1992, when group net profits amounted to L1,425bn. Sales are expected to
rise by about 10 per cent over the 1992 level of L27,167bn.
Group turnover in the first half increased by 7.4 per cent to L14,242bn,
excluding sales by Finsiel, the software and information technology company
bought by Stet in the second half of last year.
Analysts, who have been strongly recommending Italian telecommunications
stocks this year on privatisation prospects and expectations of higher
earnings, were relieved to see investment spending falling to L3,445bn in
the first half, against L4,632bn in the same period last year. Italy's state
telecoms groups have spent heavily in recent years to modernise the network,
leading to a string of rights issues.
Stet gave no details of the rationalisation of the country's telecoms
utilities, due to start at the end of this year with the merger of Sip, the
main domestic operating subsidiary, and Italcable, the leading international
phone carrier.
However, it indicated that progress towards rationalisation was also being
made on the manufacturing and network services side, where functions are
currently divided between four subsidiaries.
Separately, Sip said gross operating profits in the first half soared by 44
per cent to L991.6bn. The company forecast that this year's net earnings
would be higher than the L461bn made in 1992. The group, which this week
announced it had reached 1m subscribers for its mobile telephone service -
the third biggest in Europe after the UK and Germany - rose by 7.6 per cent
to L11,409bn.
Meanwhile Italcable, which is also quoted, reported a small increase in
pre-tax first-half profits to L147.7bn from L143.3bn last year. Turnover
increased by 7.5 per cent to L388.6bn.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Adwest seeks Pounds 22m as profits advance
35% - Several takeover targets under consideration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADWEST yesterday marked the end of three years of restructuring at the
automotive components and power systems group by announcing a rights issue
to fund acquisitions and a 35 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to
Pounds 9.4m.
Mr Fred Grant, chairman, said Adwest had 'done all the rationalisation that
we think needs to be done. We want to grow the business now'. Since 1990
Adwest has reduced its workforce by about 29 per cent and closed six
factories.
Adwest aims to raise Pounds 22.2m through a 1-for-4 rights issue at 140p.
Although it was not able to announce an acquisition with the rights, Mr
Grant said the group was in discussions with several possible targets in its
power systems and automotive components divisions.
Adwest stressed that it had no intention of adding to its property arm,
although prospects there were brighter than for some time.
The rights issue announcement was accompanied by an unexpected increase in
the total dividend. Adwest had managed to maintain a covered dividend for
four years, but shareholders had been patient long enough, Mr Grant said.
'I do think they are entitled to a little bit of the flavour of recovery,'
he said, referring to optimistic prospects for the current year. The group's
shares rose 11p to close at 183p. The dividend was 3 per cent higher at
7.2p, after a reduced final of 5.2p (5.75p). Earnings rose by 45 per cent to
11p.
Results for the year to June 30 showed a 9 per cent increase in sales to
Pounds 137m. The automotive division's operating profits rose 27 per cent to
Pounds 3.5m on sales 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 83.1m.
Power systems rose by 20 per cent at the operating level to Pounds 3.9m on
sales 9 per cent up to Pounds 51.1m.
Property, hit by a decline in margins on housebuilding, returned a slightly
lower profit of Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 3.22m). This excludes the Pounds
634,000 (Pounds 1.12m) contribution from the joint venture with
housebuilder, Bryant.
COMMENT
Adwest has somewhat cheekily launched a rights issue to fund acquisitions
that have not yet materialised, and sweetened the move with an unexpectedly
increased dividend. The 5 per cent yield, which rises to 6.4 per cent on the
rights price, is one of the most attractive things about Adwest. The company
will now have to use the rights cash to meet demands from customers for
integrated products as opposed to a variety of small components. Yet this is
a company which - since new management was introduced three years ago - has,
so far, managed to deliver on its promises. On forecasts of between Pounds
11.5m and Pounds 12.8m, the prospective p/e comes in at roughly 15.5 times.
Compared with others in its sector, this would seem good value.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Non-recurring costs put Starmin loss at
Pounds 1.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
Conservative cabinet minister, announced interim pre-tax losses deepening
from Pounds 479,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to June 30.
Mr Owen Rout, the acting chief executive, said the company had not so far
received notification of legal action by either Mr Raschid Abdullah, a
non-executive director who speaks for about 30 per cent of Starmin's equity,
or his brother Osman.
Mr Osman Abdullah said he had not reached a decision. His brother was not
available for comment.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.59m (Pounds 10.8m) as the company continued its
programme of disposals of non-core businesses to bring down debt.
This is the first set of results since a review of accounting policies
prompted the company to restate 1992 pre-tax losses from Pounds 8.06m to
Pounds 11.9m in 1992. The restatement was prompted by a review of accounting
policies focused on asset swaps paid for with shares in a privately held
company.
On acquisitions, Mr Rout said: 'A number of talks are going on. Any option
we would look at. But we must be satisfied any deal is in the best interests
of shareholders.'
He said he would continue as acting chief executive for the time being:
'There is no point going out and looking for a new chief executive if we
then conclude a deal which makes his appointment unnecessary.'
Operating losses were Pounds 507,000 (Pounds 325,000), which disguised a
Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 1.16m) operating profit on continuing operations,
before exceptional costs, the company said. There were exceptional costs of
Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 1.57m), of which Pounds 250,000 covered the
reorganisation and board review while Pounds 138,000 covered abortive
acquisition costs.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 352,000 (Pounds 267,000) and net debt at the
half year end was Pounds 8.12m for gearing of 44.6 per cent.
Losses per share were 0.4p (0.3p) and the board did not declare a dividend.
It paid 0.1p last time.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Penna shares fall 30p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Penna, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney
outplacement consultancy, fell by 35p to 130p yesterday after the company
warned of a modest pre-tax deficit for the six months to September 30 1993.
Mr John Beard, chief executive, said revenues in the second quarter had
continued at the reduced levels of the first three months.
'Cost reduction programmes are in hand to reduce fixed overheads to levels
more appropriate to present levels. The board remains committed to its
strategy of developing its outplacement services, and marketing programmes
are being sustained.
'The balance sheet of the group remains strong and the business is cash
positive.'
Shares in Penna have moved erratically. It was the best-performing USM stock
in 1990, but the shares collapsed from 325p to 83p in 1991, following a
profits warning and then the departure of Mr Stephen Rowlinson, the highly
paid chairman and chief executive.
The shares recovered from that low point to reach 279p in March, but
substantially declined after the company warned at its annual meeting that
first-quarter trading was slow.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Price competition hits margins at Acorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACORN COMPUTER Group, the UK-based computer manufacturer owned by Olivetti
of Italy, saw turnover grow 11 per cent at the half-way stage, but margins
were forced down by fierce price competition and higher component costs.
Profitability was helped, however, by a first-time contribution from
Advanced RISC Machines, in which the company has a 42.86 per cent interest.
Pre-tax profits for the half-year to July 4 were Pounds 305,000, a decline
of 40 per cent on last time's Pounds 511,000. Revenues totalled Pounds 23.6m
(Pounds 21.2m). Earnings were 0.5p (0.8p).
Mr Gary Johnson, finance director, said the decline in gross margins had
been disappointing but a high point had been the performance of ARM which
contributed Pounds 100,000 to profits.
This company had moved into profitabil-ity about a year earlier than
expected.
ARM, co-owned by Apple Computer and VLSI Technology of the US, develops low
cost microprocessors for portable computers. An ARM chip is used in Apple's
heavily-promoted Newton personal digital assistant launched earlier this
year.
Acorn's shares have been boosted this year by investors anxious to share in
ARM's potential success; however, they fell 23p to 88p yesterday.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Battle set to be joined over Pounds 70m
Extel disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE battle for control of Extel Financial, the on-line financial
information service company put up for sale last week by its owners, United
Newspapers, is expected to unfold over the next few months.
Many of the world's largest information providers have already expressed
interest in buying the 121-year old organisation. It is seen as an
attractive acquisition by a range of companies to whom its products and
services are either complementary or competitive.
United executives hope that a deal can be concluded by the end of the year.
Indicative bids must be submitted within the next two weeks, a timescale
that some potential bidders have said is ridiculously short.
The selling price was likely to be up to Pounds 70m, they believed. United
bought the Extel group for Pounds 250m in 1987 but has since disposed of
much of it. Extel Financial represents about 14 per cent of the original
purchase. Extel makes profits of about Pounds 5m but last year soaked up
Pounds 6m in investment in technology.
Reuters, the world's largest electronic publisher, said that it had decided
against taking further part in the negotiations. It is understood that it
has already investigated the company and received the confidential circular
outlining terms of the sale. Analysts suggested that an attempt to buy Extel
would bring Reuters into conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The list of companies known to be interested includes Thomson Financial, the
Boston-based subsidiary of the Thomson Group; Datastream, the London-based
supplier of historical securities prices owned by Primark of the US;
Disclosure, which is US-based but owned by VNU, the Dutch media group; and
FT Profile, the on-line information service owned by the Financial Times. FT
Profile is being investigated by the MMC as part of an examination of
on-line text retrieval services.
Analysts were unimpressed by talk that BT could be a bidder but did not
discount the possibility that Telerate of the US, the Scandinavian company
Esmerk, Hoppenstedt of Germany, and Standard and Poor's and Knight Ridder of
the US could be interested.
United seems prepared to sell Extel in two packages; the profitable on-line
information services group that includes the market-leading portfolio
valuation service, and the bureau-based investment accounting service. The
accounting service's profitability has declined in recent years but it has
developed a new software package, the IAS-2, which sells for up to Pounds
400,000 and could make it attractive to a software house specialising in
financial services.
Extel's value to potential buyers lies in its spread of products, many of
which are market leaders in niche sectors. Datastream's interest for
example, must be related to the fact that virtually all its basic data comes
from Extel while Examiner, Extel's real-time financial and business news
service, would be complementary to Datastream's analytical products.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: MGN shares sale nets Pounds 358m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY TWO years after Mr Robert Maxwell's body was found in the sea, Mirror
Group Newspapers has become an orthodox public company with a wide range of
institutional shareholders.
More than 100 separate institutions put in bids for blocks of shares under
the bookbuilding exercise run by Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, joint
administrator to Robert Maxwell Group, the main private Maxwell vehicle.
Yesterday Mr Talbot announced that all 219.68m shares on offer - 54.8 per
cent of the total - had been sold at 170p. This was a little less than some
analysts had forecast but a figure that is still seen as a considerable
achievement.
The MGN flotation in May 1991 was set at a price of 125p but the shares fell
as low as 50p before gradually climbing back after a period of suspension.
The shares closed at 177p on Tuesday and yesterday fell 7p to 170p after
sale.
In a formal statement Mr Talbot said yesterday: 'The strength of the
institutional demand for MGN shares has permitted the sale of the entire
holding in MGN at an attractive price and we have completed the
international offering earlier than anticipated.'
The sale will raise a gross figure of Pounds 373m with expenses expected to
be about Pounds 15m.
The MGN shares were effectively controlled by four banks - National
Westminster, Goldman Sachs, Midland and Lloyds - all of which held them as
surety for Maxwell loans.
The banks are owed about Pounds 295m although the picture is complicated
because different banks hold different parcels of shares at different
prices. Three of the banks will receive their money back in full, including
interest. The offer price was not high enough to cover the loans of one of
the banks; believed to be Lloyds.
The banks will receive their money within a matter of days but a final
settlement for unsecured creditors, including a surplus of between Pounds
50m and Pounds 60m, will take longer.
Some assets of Robert Maxwell Group have still to be sold and a number of
claims are likely to be pursued by the administrator on behalf of creditors,
including Maxwell pensioners.

JEFFERSON Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based paper and packaging company, has
announced a private placement of Dollars 640m (Pounds 416m) in senior loan
notes with US investors, to refinance existing debt.
In what is thought to be one of the largest placements in this sector of the
US corporate securities market by a non-US group, 28 US institutions
participated in the issue, led by the Prudential Insurance Company of
America and the Annuity Association of America, which subscribed Dollars
104m each for the loan notes.
The notes have been issued in four tranches of 7,10,12 and 15 years, with an
average life of 10.1 years.
The issue has been split between the group's main international holding
company and its US arm.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL to regulate the US rent-to-own industry, dominated by Thorn EMI's
Rent-A-Center, has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr
Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee.
The bill aims to safeguard consumers who purchase items on credit - known in
the US as rent-to-own. The measures would limit interest and other fees,
provide mandated disclosures and warranty protections, and prohibit abusive
collection practice.
Mr Gonzalez acted after the committee heard that US consumers were often
forced to pay three to four times the value of an item before gaining
ownership in rent-to-own transactions. The Wall Street Journal ran a
front-page story about Rent-A-Center, which provided an account of the
company's collection practices and marketing techniques.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: DFS to be floated with market value of
Pounds 200m - Family own all the shares and will sell about half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GRAHAM Kirkham, an already seriously rich 48-year-old miner's son from
Yorkshire, is about to join the ranks of the super-rich.
He is executive chairman of DFS Furniture, which makes and sells upholstered
furniture. DFS is planning a stock market flotation before Christmas
expected to value it at more than Pounds 200m. Mr Kirkham and his family own
all the shares and will sell about half.
The group has no borrowings and has expanded entirely from cashflow since it
was founded in 1969. It is now the largest upholstered furniture retailer in
the UK, with more than 5 per cent of a highly fragmented market. No new
money is being raised by the company at the flotation. Mr Jon Massey, chief
operating officer, says it does not need any.
Mr Kirkham, who says he has never borrowed a penny either corporately or
personally, took a salary in the latest reported financial year of Pounds
5.72m.
He is somewhat embarrassed to be caught wearing a Rolex watch, and by a
newspaper article that described a plutocratic lifestyle he says was pure
fiction. But he laughs off the inaccuracies - he never tipped a Monte Carlo
waiter Pounds 1,000, he says, it was Pounds 2,500.
Once DFS is public, Mr Kirkham will be on a more suitable salary of Pounds
200,000, initially with a three-year contract. He will also receive
dividends on his remaining shareholding. His high salary in the past was in
part instead of dividends.
Mr Kirkham attributes his success to a good idea and a lot of hard work. He
says his increased wealth will not affect his commitment to the business.
He left school at 16 with no O levels and went to work in a furniture shop
that eventually became part of the Harris Queensway group. Frustrated at a
lack of career prospects, he set up his own business under the name of
Northern Upholstery in an old billiard hall near Doncaster, making the
furniture upstairs and selling it downstairs.
Important to its success is the wide range of styles on offer, with a price
range for a three-piece suite of Pounds 900 to Pounds 3,500. DFS has close
links with its suppliers, fostered by paying them speedily, giving it
exclusive styles and fabrics, and manufactures up to 20 per cent of its
stock itself.
Another factor is customer service. Staff training is a priority and,
unusually, the group does not employ part-time sales people. The group
spends heavily on advertising to attract customers, but is careful not to
open stores too close together.
Mr Kirkham says going public is a natural step in DFS's progression,
allowing employees to own shares and giving the group 'a wider shareholder
base which is more appropriate to a business of its size'. He admits to
having discussed the step with his merchant bank, J. Henry Schroder Wagg,
for the past six years.
He believes it is essential to go public to maximise the chain's potential.
DFS wants to expand the 24-store chain, which is concentrated in the north
of England, the Midlands and East Anglia, to cover the whole country. This
could take the group to about 80 stores. However, Mr Massey says it will
continue to finance its expansion internally. Acquisitions are possible, but
not the main focus of the company.
While other furniture retailers have suffered in the recession - some of
them failing spectacularly - DFS has increased operating profits from Pounds
7.7m in the year to end-July 1990 to Pounds 13.6m in 1992.
Mr John Richards, retail analyst at NatWest Securities, which is broker to
the issue, is forecasting an operating profit for 1993 of Pounds 18m. He
says: 'DFS should be capable of sustaining a self-financed 15 per cent per
annum average growth rate through to the late 1990s.'
DFS has appointed Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman of the Iceland Frozen Foods
chain, as a non-executive director. Another two will be appointed, one
before the flotation. A finance director will also be signed up, taking on
the role Mr Massey had occupied.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Athena losses put Pentos in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTOS, the specialist retailer that owns the Dillons, Ryman and Athena
chains, yesterday reported a first-half loss, passed its interim dividend,
and warned that full year results would be influenced by exceptional losses
at the Athena poster and card shops.
The group also announced that Mr Terry Maher, chairman and chief executive,
would retire by the end of the year.
In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax loss was Pounds 400,000 compared
with a Pounds 2.4m profit. Losses per share were 0.3p, against earnings of
1.3p when a 0.7p interim dividend was declared.
In the wake of the announcement the shares fell 1 1/2 p to close at 46 1/2
p. The shares have fallen steadily over the past 24 months from a high of
170p.
Commenting on the results Mr Maher said: 'Dillons and Ryman again made
progress although sales were below expectations. Office furniture made a
welcome return to profit after the losses of the second half.
'At Athena, however, in a still depressed market, increased losses were
incurred as stock levels were reduced at the expense of margins.'
Sales rose to Pounds 101.2m, against Pounds 99.3m, which included Pounds
2.9m from discontinued activities. There was a 5 per cent increase in sales
of the continuing operations.
However, trading profits fell from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2.2m, insufficient
to cover interest costs which increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds
2.5m). Trading profits in the core specialist retailing division fell by 63
per cent to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 3.8m), mainly reflecting problems at Athena.
Within the division, sales at the flagship Dillons bookshops increased by 9
per cent to Pounds 53.8m in a flat market, and by 4 per cent on a
like-for-like basis.
Ryman, the stationers which now includes the former Wilding stores trading
under the Ryman Computer Store name, increased sales by 4 per cent to Pounds
22.8m.
Sales were slightly ahead on a like-for-like basis despite the severe price
cutting in the personal computer market.
Athena's sales were up 7 per cent to Pounds 19m, with UK retail sales
showing an 8 per cent gain but the chain's like-for-like sales were down 3
per cent.
Mr Maher said market conditions remained difficult with margins depressed by
the action taken to reduce overall stock levels, particularly at Athena, and
to improve stock quality.
He added: 'Significant losses will be incurred for the year as a whole, but
the actions taken to reduce overheads, increase product focus and reduce
funds employed will improve our longer term prospects.'
Pentos's occupancy costs are now stabilising having risen over the past four
years to represent 35 per cent of sales, equivalent to an additional Pounds
9m in costs.
The office furniture division, which is earmarked for sale, achieved a
significant turnround to profits, compared with losses in the previous six
months by cutting costs and improving manufacturing efficiencies.
However, sales were 2 per cent lower and profits were 23 per cent down at
Pounds 1m, against last year's first six months.
Analysts believe Pentos' debt this year will average about Pounds 60m,
little changed from a year earlier.

Blockleys, the Shropshire-based brick and pavior manufacturer, reported a 36
per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds 261,000,
for the six months to end-June.
The outcome was struck on turnover down by Pounds 391,000 to Pounds 4.75m
and was bolstered by a Pounds 46,000 surplus from a property sale and a
reduced interest charge of Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 626,000).
Earnings per share fell to 0.71p (0.99p) but the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.5p.

Although turnover improved to IPounds 780,000 (IPounds 348,000) the cost of
sales rose from IPounds 283,000 to IPounds 825,000 and the loss was struck
after an exceptional IPounds 775,000 relating to the write-off of the

EFM Dragon Trust, the investment trust which took over Drayton Asia Trust
earlier this year via a contested bid, lifted its net asset value from
12.03p to 21.36p over the year to August 31.
The 78 per cent increase largely reflected the strong performance of the
dollar, which rose some 33 per cent against sterling over the period.
Sharply higher interest charges, however, prompted a decline in net profits
from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 277,000.
Earnings per share, on the increased capital, fell to 0.049p (0.11p) and the
single dividend for the year is passed (0.06p) 'due to the small amounts
available and the costs involved', said Mr Hugh Byatt, chairman.
A 1-for-4 consolidation of shares is proposed.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell takes on pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN WHAT might appear an unusual diversification for a merchant bank, Morgan
Grenfell is to become a substantial pub landlord as a result of Scottish &amp;
Newcastle's Pounds 622m purchase of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain from Grand
Metropolitan.
Morgan is in effect acting as a warehouse for up to 748 pubs which S&amp;N must
sell to comply with the government regulations on pub ownership. S&amp;N has six
months to dispose of the pubs.
Morgan, owned by Deutsche Bank, the leading German bank, since early 1990,
officially regards the move as part of its service to a client.
Nevertheless, the bank is clearly tickled by the idea of its new pub estate.
Directors have searched the list of pubs but failed to find a Craven Arms.
Mr John Craven, the chairman, may be disappointed not to have a pub in his
name where he can pull a few pints.
The bank is also delighted that the deal demonstrates the combined group's
ability to provide over Pounds 1bn of funding, with more than half coming
from Deutsche internally, as well as the corporate finance skills necessary
to find a way round the Tied Estate Orders. Few other British merchant banks
have the balance sheet to do the same.
It meant the deal could be done without having to syndicate the long-term
loan element of the funding - more than Pounds 300m - before it was
announced, minimising the number of people who knew about it.
The financing of S&amp;N's deal is complex. It involves a two-stage rights
issue, totalling Pounds 416m before expenses, which Morgan underwrote. The
second tranche will only be called if the deal is completed, and allowance
has been made for the possibility of a Monopolies Commission reference.
Part of the loan finance Morgan and Deutsche are providing is a short-term
facility to cover the second tranche, since GrandMet will want the money on
completion but it will take a month to collect the second payment from
shareholders.
To buy and manage the pubs, Morgan is setting up three subsidiary companies.
The first - unimaginatively named Newco A - will buy 235 pubs leased to Chef
and Brewer from Inntrepreneur, for Pounds 94m, paying S&amp;N another Pounds 22m
for the leasehold interests in them and another 227 pubs, making a total of
462. As they are sold, S&amp;N and GrandMet will share the profits or losses
equally. Merging the freehold and leasehold interests in the 235 pubs should
make them easier to sell.
Newco B will run the pubs, with S&amp;N providing management services for a fee.
Newco C will buy any of the other 286 pubs which S&amp;N has failed to sell
within the six months' time limit. Profits or losses on the sales of these
will be borne by S&amp;N.
Morgan believes it is facing no risk other than the credit risk of S&amp;N and
GrandMet. The pubs it has to sell are the less attractive end of the estate,
and have been individually valued at a total of Pounds 105m compared with
the Pounds 116m Newco A is paying for them, although they may be worth more
than the valuation if sold in packages.
Morgan does not expect to make any trading profits from its move into the
pub business beyond a normal banking fee.

Smurfit

<TEXT>
JEFFERSON Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based international paper and packaging
company, has announced a private placement of Dollars 640m (Pounds 416m) in
senior loan notes with US investors, to refinance existing debt.
In what is thought to be one of the largest placements in this sector of the
US corporate securities market by a non-US group, 28 US institutions
participated in the issue, led by the Prudential Insurance Company of
America and the Annuity Association of America which subscribed Dollars 104m
each for the senior guaranteed notes.
The notes have been issued in four tranches of 7,10,12 and 15 years with an
average life of 10.1 years. Dollars 288m of the issue has been by Smurfit
International, the group's main international holding company, and Dollars
352m by Smurfit Packaging Corporation, which holds most of the group's US
interests.
Mr Michael Pettigrew, group secretary, said that most of the group's
existing debt will be replaced by the new notes. 'The rates are at an
attractive level linked to US Treasury note rates. Their purpose is not to
save on short-term interest payments but to strategically capitalise on
long-term rates and take the debt profile out to longer maturities.'
Last April, JSC/CCA, the lossmaking US associate of Jefferson Smurfit Group
which operates 180 paper mills in North America, made a Dollars 500m offer
of senior loan notes with a 10-year maturity to restructure its bank debts.
Simultaneously Smurfit International created a facility to purchase Dollars
200m of junior subordinated notes in JSC/CCA as required.
Jefferson Smurfit reversed out of JSC/CCA in a complex Dollars 2.6bn
financial restructuring in 1989, remortgaging its US interests into a joint
venture with the Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund.
Mr Pettigrew said that the new senior notes issue by SIBV would not be used
to finance the Dollars 200m purchase of junior notes in JSC/CCA.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alexon slides Pounds 10m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXON Group, the struggling women's wear retailer, yesterday sought to
convey an up-beat message on its future in spite of deeper than expected
pre-tax losses of Pounds 10m in the first half.
Mr John Osborn, the chief executive appointed after shareholder pressure led
to the departure of previous management in April, said Alexon had 'broken
the back of the problem'.
Gearing, which had been 'out in the stratosphere' even after the Pounds
16.4m rights issue in August, was now expected to be less than 50 per cent
by the end of the year. Stocks were 13 per cent lower since January at
Pounds 30m, and the cost reduction programme was well ahead of schedule.
Alexon expected to have cut 'comfortably more' than the estimated Pounds 3m
in costs this year, he said. An exceptional charge of Pounds 4.3m for
ration-alisation was Pounds 300,000 higher than expected due to extra office
closures and redundancies.
The group increased sales by 14 per cent to Pounds 55.3m for the six months
to July 31. The operating loss was Pounds 4.7m, against a profit of Pounds
2.8m. Some Pounds 2m of the swing was due to the decision to spread
occupancy costs evenly across the year, instead of concen-trating them in
the second half.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 10m compared with a profit of Pounds 2.1m last
time.
Mr Osborn said both the Alexon and Eastex ranges had increased sales in the
first half, while Dash had incurred higher losses. The group intended to
convert some 20 Dash shops to the new Ann Harvey size 16-plus concept next
month and a further 20 in the spring.
Mr Osborn said that due to the long lead times on the Alexon range, the new
design team had not been able to make any material changes to the products.
It was expected that the range would begin to see a return by the autumn of
next year.
The chief executive was optimistic about his company's chances of survival.
'We have a lot on our plate,' said Mr Osborn, 'but we are a hell of a lot
healthier than we were.'
The group, which paid a 3p interim dividend last year, is suspending the
pay-out.
Losses per share of 37.47p compared with a profit of 3.05p last time.
COMMENT
Mr Osborn is doing all the right things to encourage shareholders. The
trends in stocks, gearing and working capital are all pointing the right
way. Even though the losses were expected to be Pounds 8m, what's another
Pounds 2m when investors are offered the hope of survival. From an
investment point of view, things may be slightly different, however. It is
early days yet. Estimates are being plucked out of the air and range from
losses this year of Pounds 9m to Pounds 13m. For existing investors, there
seems little to gain by pulling out and possibly much more benefit in
holding on, although the risks remain. Potential new investors might want to
wait until the company's attraction is less its new management and more its
day-to-day business.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Central TV chief sees new rules on
takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LESLIE HILL, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent
Television, predicted yesterday that the ownership rules governing ITV
companies would be changed to allow the nine largest companies to take each
other over.
'I think we have won the commercial arguments. The ownership rules will
change because they will have to change. We are not dealing here with
commercial logic we are dealing with political intricacies,' he said.
He was speaking as Central announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds
15.1m) for the six months to the end of June, a rise of 9 per cent. Turnover
fell 6 per cent to Pounds 149m (Pounds 158.6m).
Mr Hill has long campaigned to change the takeover rules. He believes that
there should be four or five ITV companies rather than the present 15.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is to chair a ministerial committee
meeting later this autumn on the issue.
Central's earnings per share increased by 8 per cent to 37.5p (34.7p) and
the interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 11p (10p).
The company has increased its share of the ITV advertising and sponsorship
revenue from 14.83 per cent to 15.26 per cent. It is believed that Central's
cumulative advertising share so far this year has been the highest in the
network, the first time this has happened for such a period.
Mr Hill yesterday predicted real growth of 2-3 per cent for the ITV system,
a considerable improvement on the past few years when advertising sales have
been flat at best.
'There are encouraging signs but its patchy and short term,' he warned.
Mr Andy Allan, who has just been promoted to managing director of the
Central group, said yesterday he expected more competition for audiences to
come from the BBC over the next 12 months.
Mr Hill said the company was continuing to review the progress of the new
media of satellite and cable television.
'I am sure we will be in the new media. It is a question of doing the right
thing, with the right partners at the right time,' Mr Hill said.
Central won its franchise back with an annual bid of Pounds 2,000 but also
has to pay 11 per cent of qualifying revenue to the government. The company
will probably pay between Pounds 22m and Pounds 26m to the government this
year, compared with a levy payment of Pounds 22m in 1991.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: A cash cow ready for market - Norma Cohen
on Gartmore in the light of its imminent flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS ago, Gartmore, ranked number 16 in a highly competitive and
overcrowded field of investment fund managers vying for clients among
pension fund trustees.
Today, it ranks fourth, attracting a disproportionate percentage of all the
UK pension fund money looking for a new home and ranks alongside some of the
most venerable names in the business. It manages Pounds 16bn in funds, more
than three-quarters of which are British pension fund assets.
After this spectacular growth, Gartmore's owner, Banque Indosuez of France,
has decided to milk its cash cow. Having bought Gartmore from the collapsed
British &amp; Commonwealth group in April 1990 for a mere Pounds 132m, the bank
is expected to announce a November date for the flotation of 25 to 30 per
cent of the fund manager.
Mr Philip Gibbs, financial industry analyst at stockbrokers Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, estimated the flotation would value the company at Pounds 270m
to Pounds 300m.
However, the flotation has caused some anxiety among pension fund
consultants who have championed Gartmore's skills to their own clients. 'It
will probably be good for Gartmore and for Banque Indosuez. But will it be
good for clients?', said one. According to another, 'the big danger for a
firm which has done so well is general complacency.'
Gartmore's investment performance successes have helped its pension funds
under management grow by 173 per cent in less than four years.
The question is whether Gartmore can hang on to what made it a success,
particularly in its new guise as a public company.
Gartmore's management is well aware of consultants' anxieties. Mr David
Watts, head of pension fund investments, said: 'I think it's a question of
keeping your decision-making structure focused. You have to keep your
decision-making group small.' Despite the rapid growth in funds under
management, only four top executives made the decisions on how to allocate
assets between sectors - an aspect of the business at which Gartmore is
acknowledged to have been particularly adept.
Gartmore is unusual in that it has been able to add value both in its
allocation of funds between types of investments and markets and in its
selection of stock. The company has a heavy bias towards equities and
expects to weight its portfolios 90 per cent in that category, somewhat
above the industry average.
'We have a style which is fairly robust in asset allocation,' said Mr Paul
Myners, the chairman. 'If we think a sector is going to outperform, we don't
go into it with just a half per cent weighting. Our clients expect us to
take risks. That's what they pay us for.'
For example, on the day Britain withdrew from the ERM last September,
Gartmore made a move out of large stocks and into smaller companies, which
have outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index since then. It has also held a
heavy weighting in foreign bonds, the best performing asset class all year.
Following the flotation Banque Indosuez, which Mr Myners says has never
meddled in Gartmore's affairs, will have representation on its full board as
well as on its remuneration and audit committees. 'But they subscribe to the
view that if it ain't broke, don't mend it,' he said.
And it certainly ain't broke yet. In 1992, Gartmore's median rate of return
in the investment pools it managed was 26.4 per cent, according to data from
Combined Actuarial Performance Services. Overall, its individual funds made
returns ranging from 22.6 per cent to 29.8 per cent - this in a year when
the Caps' median performance was 22.4 per cent and the FT-A All-Share Index
returned 20.6 per cent.
Gartmore has taken the precaution of warning its clients not to expect more
of the same in 1993. 'It is most unlikely we will ever again be able to
outperform in every market,' said Mr Myners.
Indeed, Gartmore's 1993 performance so far is just straddling the industry
median - a statistic which does little to alleviate the nagging worries
about the impending flotation. But after last year's excellent returns, it
would take at least three years of below-average performance before clients
began to defect, said BZW's Mr Gibbs.
The company's profits have grown with its assets. For the first six months
of 1993, operating profits were Pounds 10.8m on revenue of Pounds 30m.
Analysts at Cazenove, Gartmore's brokers, estimate that its ratio of
operating profits to funds under management stood at 0.15 per cent in June.
MAM and Henderson Administration Group, both quoted, had ratios of 0.13 and
0.11.
However, securities analysts point out that Gartmore has some vulnerable
points. With UK pension funds accounting for 77 per cent of its funds under
management, it is heavily dependent on a single product for its profits.
Most of these are the assets of defined benefit schemes, which promise
workers a percentage of final salary upon retirement. With a government
advisory panel considering changes to the way UK pension funds are
regulated, the fund management industry is bracing itself for the
possibility that new regulations will prompt employers to switch to less
complicated schemes which only promise a lump sum upon retirement.
Mr Myners acknowledges that such a shift would have implications for
Gartmore. 'Some employers will still continue to hire us. But if we move
away from the current world, there will clearly be more competition.'
Gartmore is bracing itself for these changes by developing its unit and
investment trust product lines and by expanding the investment products it
offers for just those types of pension schemes.
Also, unlike its three main competitors, Gartmore has done little to
diversify outside the UK. It has fledgling businesses in Denmark and the
Netherlands, along with a Canadian operation. But only within the past two
months has it applied for Securities and Exchange Commission permission to
operate a fund management company in the US.
Meanwhile, Gartmore's competitors are anxious to see what kind of a company
it will be when it has shareholders of its own.
It is in the arena of corporate governance that Mr Myners has probably
earned his greatest public recognition. He has been a repeated critic of
long-term employment contracts for corporate directors, complaining that
they force shareholders to pay huge sums to get rid of incompetent
management.
Mr Myners says details of his own contract are not yet complete. 'Whatever
we do has got to be defensible because we are in a glass house,' he said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: HunterPrint dividend warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in HunterPrint fell 9 1/2 p to 37 1/2 p yesterday as the specialist
printer announced that it had no distributable reserves and so would not be
able to pay a dividend on its convertible preference shares in the year to
September 30 1993.
However, this was not entirely unexpected because in July the group had
announced that it was unlikely to return to the black at the annual stage,
although the results would 'reflect a marked improvement over the previous
year'. That news prompted a 5p fall in the shares to 45p.
The July warning followed shortly after another announcement when
HunterPrint revealed that talks with a possible bidder had ended
inconclusively. This had sparked a 17p decline in the share price to 50p.
In the six months to March 31, the group turned pre-tax losses of Pounds
3.85m into profits of Pounds 330,000. In December it underwent its second
refinancing in two years. This included a Pounds 20m placing and offer.

DEALINGS IN shares of Quiligotti, which makes and installs terrazzo and
other specialised industrial flooring, were suspended at 2 1/4 p at the
company's request pending the announcement of results for the year to March

However the results will be postponed because the company is 'at an advanced

This, the directors said, might lead to an injection of capital into the

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline rises 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HODDER HEADLINE, the start-up publishing company which this summer took over
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, one of the oldest names in British publishing, announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 758,000 for the half year to June 30, an increase
of 25 per cent.
The results before the costs of the transaction apply only to Headline whose
authors include Cilla Black, Peter Scudamore and Diana Ross. The
acquisition, valuing Hodder at Pounds 48.9m, was only completed on June 28
and does not form part of Hodder Headline's results.
Separate accounts provided for the 125-year old publishing house for the
year to June showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.5m on turnover on continuing
activities of Pounds 56.3m. Exceptionals included a Pounds 4m provision for
advances to authors that are unlikely to be recovered and Pounds 3.5m in
reorganisation costs, mainly redundancy payments.
Three Hodder directors have left the board - Mr Patrick Wright, Mr Tom
Biggs-Davison and Mr Michael Attenborough - and by next April when the
integration is due to be completed there will be 625 staff compared with a
combined total of 800 at the merger date.
The company plans to double the output of Hodder's general publishing
division from 300 to 600 titles a year and childrens's titles from 100 to
200. From late-1994 onwards there are additional plans for strategic
acquisitions in the areas of academic, schools and childrens' book to take
total sales towards Pounds 100m a year.
Analysts are now expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m for the full
year, rising to between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m next year.
On the six month results for the old Headline business, earnings per share
before transaction costs rose 14 per cent to 4.1p and the interim dividend
is up 10 per cent to 1.65p.
Bookline, the book distribution business, broke even in the first half and a
strong performance is expected in the second half.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Maher the books crusader signs off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY MAHER, the consumers' champion who tried to kill off book
publishers' 100-year old price maintenance agreement, said yesterday he
would quit as chairman and chief executive of Pentos, the UK's second
largest bookseller.
He will step down before the end of the year from the group which embraces
Dillons and Hatchards bookshops, the Ryman stationery and office equipment
supplier and Athena posters.
His decision, announced yesterday alongside the group's first ever losses,
was not unexpected given the recent weak performance and concerns about
rapid expansion and aggressive accounting.
While some publishers might be relieved that they are losing the chief
critic of their Net Book Agreement, shareholders are likely to have mixed
feelings. Mr Maher, a working class, Irish-Catholic, Mancunian accountant,
has built Pentos into a retailing force. But the Pentos share price has
plunged from 170p to just over 40p in the last two years.
He will be replaced by a non-executive chairman, yet to be named, and a
chief executive who is likely to be a retail specialist appointed from
outside. In the meantime, Sir Kit McMahon, former Midland Bank chairman,
will take over as deputy chairman.
City criticism of Pentos' acquisition strategy and accounting policies
flared up last month when Mr Maher conducted a public slanging match with
one analyst over a research note entitled 'Pentosaurus'. The analyst had
questioned whether Dillons' high cost base was up to the challenge.
Nevertheless his departure from the company he founded in 1972 as a Pounds
100 'off the shelf company' will mark the end of an era in book selling. The
tough and prickly Mr Maher, 57, who has called the NBA 'an organised
conspiracy against the pubic's interest', has made repeated attempts to cut
book prices. Defenders of the NBA argue its destruction would kill off small
booksellers and reduce readers' choice.
An avid reader of authors ranging from Truman Capote to Anthony Burgess, who
went to the same Manchester grammar school, Mr Maher yesterday
uncharacteristically tried to avoid greater public exposure.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Brewer fills its cup in north and south: Single buy helps
S&amp;N to many goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish &amp; Newcastle has achieved several important strategic objectives in
a single step with the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's 1,654 Chef &amp;
Brewer pubs.
After disposing of 748 pubs - to meet limits imposed by the government on
the size of national brewers' estates - S&amp;N will be left with a retail
business of 2,700 outlets.
More than 60 per cent of the GrandMet pubs are in London and southern
England, complementing S&amp;N's existing estate which is nearly 70 per cent in
Scotland and northern England.
This wider national presence will provide S&amp;N with a solid base from which
to promote its portfolio of beer brands - including Younger's, McEwan's,
Theakston's, Beck's and Coors - and strengthen its operations in the
independent pub trade and take-home market.
Integrating Chef &amp; Brewer into its existing pub retail business will offer
scope for cost savings, and give S&amp;N more negotiating clout in the purchase
of wines, spirits, soft drinks and food.
The enlarged retail operations give the group a more evenly balanced
business across its three trading divisions. Pubs contributed Pounds 53.3m
or 23.5 per cent of last year's operating profits of Pounds 226.5m. Brewing
accounted for 42.5 per cent and its Center Parcs and other leisure
businesses contributed 34 per cent. Chef &amp; Brewer achieved profits of Pounds
72m last year and is expected to make not less than Pounds 66m this year.
GrandMet's disposal offered the only likely opportunity to acquire a
substantial number of high quality, well-located pubs in a single parcel.
They include the directly managed houses which formed the top profit
generators of the GrandMet and Courage estates.
During 10 months of negotiations, S&amp;N has inspected every pub. 'Our
investigations have confirmed that the estate has considerable unexploited
potential,' said Mr Brian Stewart, group chief executive.
Some 300 pubs are likely to be refurbished in the first year, at a cost of
between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000 a pub. Recent investment in S&amp;N's
estate on this scale has brought significant trading improvements.
In the longer term, the group plans to introduce into the new pubs some of
its Homespreads family catering initiatives and other facilities and
products.
The deal makes S&amp;N a much more significant participant in a pub market which
has been substantially restructured in the past four years.
Though the national brewers remain among the biggest operators - Bass,
Allied-Lyons and Whitbread each have more than 4,000 outlets - they have
disposed of 11,000 pubs from their estates to comply with government orders.
Regional brewers, such as Vaux, Marston and Greene King, have used the
opportunity to strengthen their estates, and many of the pubs were sold to
individual tenants.
But the main structural change has been the entry into the market of
independent pub retailing groups. They include former brewers such as
Boddington and Greenalls, which three months ago increased its pubs to more
than 2,000 with the Pounds 214m takeover of Devenish; Pubmaster, the Brent
Walker subsidiary; and a number of entrepreneurial operators, such as
Wetherspoon, Regent Inns and Enterprise Inns.
The changes have encouraged the spread of retailing skills, that are
beginning to improve the prospects of a business that has been badly hit by
the recession and changing demographics.
GrandMet's disposal of Chef &amp; Brewer, meanwhile, brings more consistency to
its recently restated aim of building international branded businesses in
food, drinks and retailing, underlined yesterday by its acquisition of Glen
Ellen wines in the US.
The Pounds 622m cash it receives will reduce its Pounds 3bn debts, cutting
gearing from 82 to 63 per cent.
The sale of the property interests of Inntrepreneur Estates, the
GrandMet/Courage joint venture, will also reduce from Pounds 130m to about
Pounds 80m the amount which the partners have to inject into the operation
next month to comply with banking covenants.
Inntrepreneur, the country's biggest pub operator with 6,800 outlets, is
expected to be floated as an independent company as soon as it becomes
profitable.

FT  30 SEP 93 / 'Shattered' Seat chairman quits as VW seeks harsh cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES, PETER BRUCE AND TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S demands for harsh cuts at its Spanish subsidiary led to the
resignation yesterday of Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman and a
member of the German automotive group's board.
The demands could also lead to political and industrial turmoil in Spain, a
senior government official warned.
Mr Diaz Alvarez will leave today, just two days after the VW group board
publicly rejected as inadequate his scheme to cut 5,000 jobs at Seat. He
returned to the company's Barcelona offices yesterday 'completely
shattered', an aide said.
'I have become an obstacle to the future of Seat and that is the last thing
I want to be,' he told his closest colleagues.
It is believed that VW wants to close the Zona Franca factory in Barcelona,
and cut up to 9,000 jobs. Such losses at Spain's biggest manufacturing
employer, would be a catastrophe for Barcelona, the government official
said. Unemployment in the area is already around 20 per cent.
The official said there was no possibility of financial aid from Madrid and
added that the government viewed as 'suspicious' Seat's sudden plunge into
deep loss.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, who has also ruled out any further funds
after this month's DM1.5bn (Pounds 615m) emergency cash injection, was
allegedly caught unawares when he was told last month of a looming loss of
DM1.25bn this year.
Seat has been hit by falling car sales and has also been severely affected
by the need to finance investment credits taken out in D-Marks and US
dollars in heavily-devalued pesetas.
Mr Diaz Alvarez was one of a handful of the old-guard directors still in
power at VW. Most of the old group board, including the Mr Daniel
Goeudevert, Mr Piech's deputy, has gone since the new chairman arrived in
January.
Mr Piech told the FT recently that he had been advised to clear out all the
old management, but had not done so. As a result, there were still 'dead
bodies in the cellar'. Speculation is mounting about other imminent board
changes. The name most often mentioned is that of Mr Werner Schmidt, another
long-serving director, currently finance chief.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Costain seeks Pounds 84m to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN Group yesterday made the latest in a series of moves to curb its
high gearing with a 5-for-4 rights issue to raise Pounds 83.9m.
The UK construction and mining group's share price, which peaked at 366p in
1987, closed up 4p at 37p on news of the issue, priced at 30p.
Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the proceeds would be used to reduce
debt and underpin the US coal mining business.
The issue reduces gearing from 132 per cent to 51 per cent pro forma at the
end of the first half. On the same basis, net debt of Pounds 204.7m falls to
Pounds 121m. The figures exclude borrowings of Pounds 15m held off-balance
sheet in a joint venture.
The company's assets include Pounds 63m reflecting both the potential of the
company's one-third share in the Spitalfield's central London development
site and an Pounds 18m premium to be paid to the City of London over three
years. Costain also has a loss-making Spanish house building joint venture
on its books at Pounds 18m.
The cash call brings the total generated from five years of fund raising
through disposals and share issues to roughly Pounds 470m.
At the time of its last rights issue, for Pounds 77m, Costain planned to
maintain its dividend at 12.25p for 1991, but managed only the 4.75p interim
payment and has not paid a dividend since. It said yesterday it did not plan
a dividend before 1995.
The company this year sold its Australian coal mining business for Pounds
157m to Peabody Coal, a Hanson subsidiary. The disposal helped lift the
company's interim pre-tax profits by Pounds 68.5m, from a restated Pounds
2.5m to Pounds 69.4m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 622.6m from Pounds 614.3m. Operating profits of
Pounds 14m - including a Pounds 6.1m contribution from discontinued
operations - just covered interest charges of Pounds 13.1m.
Engineering and construction increased operating profits almost 50 per cent
to Pounds 6.7m. 'The trading performance was good in a very tough market,
which represents in part the fact that we are moving activities into higher
margin areas, particularly overseas,' said Mr Costain.
The company lost on three 'small' Middle East contracts, but hoped to
recover them on two.
Operating profits in US coal mining were a static Pounds 5m, held back by
unexpected delays in obtaining a permit for one contract and failure to
renegotiate a second.
Earnings per share, including the disposal gains, were 28.5p compared with
losses of 1.3p.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. Joint brokers are
Hoare Govett and NatWest Wood Mackenzie.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Shares in Hogg fall after profit confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Hogg Group, the insurance group, dropped sharply yesterday in
response to unexpectedly low profits and confusion over the way in which the
company's year-end figures were reported.
Pre-tax profits fell by one quarter to Pounds 5.03m in the six months to
June 30, compared with Pounds 6.8m in the first half last year. The shares
fell from 211p to a low of 170p, before closing at 172p.
But an extremely brief set of results omitting most of the detailed figures
was released on the Stock Exchange's regulatory news service early yesterday
morning, which inaccurately showed pre-tax profits at Pounds 5.08m.
That soon led to a report on Extel, the financial news wire, that 'a major
part of the company's interim results statement figures had not been
published by the stock exchange' and that the shares dropped 'in the absence
of sufficient background information'.
The stock exchange published a more complete set of results almost two
hours' later.
To add to the confusion, the London Evening Standard newspaper also reported
the decline in Hogg's profits inaccurately in its first edition, and later
blanked out parts of the story at the request of the company.
Hogg said the stock exchange had slipped up. But the exchange insisted that
the company had failed to provide all the information, and the second
statement was issued after a missing page in the press release had been
supplied.
The stock exchange said it had asked Extel to make a correction, arguing
that the wire service report had suggested inaccurately that it was at
fault.
Hogg's results were reduced partly as a result of Pounds 1.2m in costs from
unexpected cancellations of contracts placed last year through Downes &amp;
Burke, its fine arts and jewellery division.
Profits were boosted by Pounds 1.1m in exchange gains from dollar brokerage
and currency translation at higher rates than last year. It said the
underlying growth in worldwide brokerage was 2.3 per cent up on the first
half last year.
Turnover rose to Pounds 62.7m, from Pounds 56.1m, earnings per share were
4.71p, against 6p, and the interim dividend was maintained at 3.15p.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Yeltsin frees market prices while parliament is banned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BREAD PRICES in Russia are to be freed from tomorrow as one of a range of
economic liberalisation measures decreed by President Boris Yeltsin.
Rebel deputies opposed to economic reform are powerless to resist the
changes Mr Yeltsin is pushing through following his declaration last week
that parliament was dissolved pending fresh elections.
The decrees cut grain subsidies, bring in huge increases in rents and common
domestic services, raise the bank rate to 180 per cent a year, curb cheap
credits to industry, improve conditions for foreign investors and deprive
the trade unions of their main function, control over social security
payments.
The measures are aimed at relieving the budget of its vast burden of
subsidies and passing to consumers the real costs of production and
services.
Bread prices are likely to rise sharply after they are freed, while rents
for flats, presently low, are forecast to rise by 10 times. The moves
reflect Mr Yeltsin's confidence in his ability to impose harsh reforms while
remaining secure in his position.
Foreign investors, whose most common complaint is the confusion between
national and local laws and regulations, are to be reassured by a law laying
down that only federal decrees will apply to them. The government is also
acting to stem the often illegal outflow of hard currency from Russia.
Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, at a meeting with academics
yesterday predicted a 'difficult period, with many hardships, for the
population'. However, both he and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, who heads the
Federal Information Centre, noted that, in most opinion polls, Mr Yeltsin's
popularity has grown.
The stand-off with parliament seemed set to continue last night as the
government issued a fresh ultimatum to the besieged deputies and
paramilitary volunteers within the White House, the parliamentary building.
It said that weapons must be handed over and the building cleared by next
Monday or 'serious consequences' would ensue - though the use of arms was
again ruled out. An earlier deadline set for yesterday morning for the
handing over of arms passed without incident.
General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, was quoted by the official Tass
news agency as saying that 'dangerous advisers' within the White House were
pressing for terrorist attacks against Russian leaders.
Interior ministry troops clashed with a few hundred supporters of parliament
near the White House early yesterday evening as they pushed the
demonstrators into the nearby Barrikadnaya metro station.
Resistance continued in the regions, as regional leaders meeting yesterday
in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk threatened to set up a Siberian republic
unless the decree dissolving parliament was repealed.

FT  30 SEP 93 / BT's video-on-demands cheme clears hurdle: Special permit
not needed for film-by-phone move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM yesterday cleared an important regulatory hurdle on the way
to launching a multi-billion-pound video-on-demand service down its
telephone lines.
The Independent Television Commission said that, after discussions with
Oftel, the telecommunications industry watchdog, and the Department of Trade
and Industry, it did not think BT would need a special local delivery
licence under broadcasting legislation.
The ambitious plan to deliver feature films and other television programmes
to consumers' screens in 23m UK homes through the telephone network would
have been stopped by the need to have such a licence.
An application would probably have been refused by the ITC for areas where
cable networks were already being built.
The plans, which go before BT's board in October for agreement in principle,
envisage using telephone lines to call up a menu of films electronically on
the television screen and order and watch a chosen film for a fee.
BT has demonstrated the technology to several media companies including
Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, and London Weekend Television.
Apart from delivering pictures of video recorder quality, BT says orthodox
telephone lines can simultaneously cope with a telephone call and the data
involved in managing the system.
The ITC said it was telling all parties involved that it did not think a
service that consisted of transmitting individual programmes to one
household at a time in response to a request needed a local delivery
licence.
But the commission added that close consideration of the 1990 Broadcasting
Act had not remov-ed all legal uncertainty and the issue may yet have to be
resolved in the courts. A final ITC view would also depend on proposals made
in a detailed application.
The ITC's view on the licensing requirements of video-on- demand would not
prevent either the Department of Public Prosecutions or third parties such
as cable television companies taking action in the courts. But it does clear
the way for the BT board to decide whether video-on-demand represents a
significant business opportunity.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Opec acts to halt slide in oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night agreed to a new
six-month output plan that aims to halt the sharp downward trend in oil
prices by reining in production in a period of rising demand.
The accord came after high-level political intervention in the Middle East
persuaded Kuwait to accept the scheme. The countrydropped its demand for an
individual output quota of 2.16m barrels a day and accepted a cut to 2m b/d
after president Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran spoke by telephone with the Emir
of Kuwait on the need to reach an agreement.
The new production pact covers the six months from October to the end of
next March. It calls for the 24.42m barrels-a-day overall production ceiling
which was agreed on Monday for the fourth quarter of this year to be
extended to the first quarter of 1994. This level of output is well below
expected demand during the northern winter.
Opec set itself a 23.6m b/d ceiling in June but this was widely ignored and
analysts estimate actual output has been more than 1m b/d higher, inundating
markets and depressing prices.
The agreement came five days after Opec's 12 oil ministers began
negotiations amid fears of an impending oil price collapse. The Opec basket
price - an average of prices from seven Opec countries - had fallen below
Dollars 15 a barrel. The organisation's target price is Dollars 21.
The agreement is likely 'to shore up prices by as much as Dollars 1.50 to
Dollars 2 (a barrel) and keep them there', according to Mr Vahan Zanoyan,
senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. 'It will
last as long as the prospect of Iraq re-entering the market does not pop up
and there are no signs that some Opec members are resuming overproduction.'
Kuwait had pulled out of Opec's production ceiling mechanism last June
because it wanted a higher quota. Its reintegration into the regime was a
main goal of the negotiations as its continuing exclusion would have
undermined market confidence that Opec's future production could be kept
within the ceiling.
Iran, which had been pressing for a production quota of 4m b/d, helped to
pave the way for a pact when it agreed to keep its fourth-quarter output
this year to 3.6m b/d.
Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iranian oil minister, said: 'We hope the price will
go up because the ceiling is very good. Failure to act could have led to oil
prices collapsing to as little as Dollars 10.'
The market responded positively to the agreement, with Brent blend for
November delivery closing up 69 cents at Dollars 17.35 in London.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Costain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Costain's record in recent years is an unmitigated catalogue of woe. From
the disastrous foray into UK housing to the unfortunate double-sale of the
company's Australian coal interests, the management's decision making has
proved poor. Shareholder value has all but evaporated and net assets have
fallen from Pounds 422m in 1988 to Pounds 72m at the last year-end. Even
that was after a Pounds 77m rights issue in 1991 and presupposes that the
Spitalfields site can bear the weight of its own valuation in Costain's
books. Investors saddled with this history will still probably opt for the
Hobson's choice of throwing good money after bad in the vague hope of
recovery. The alternative is watching their existing investment suffer slow
strangulation by its debts. At least the last rights issue was accompanied
by a fat yield which has since gone the way of all flesh. Any dividends now
seem a long way off.
Considering the violence that has been done to shareholders' funds, it is
surprising that Mr Peter Costain, the chief executive, apparently still
carries favour with the investing institutions - and all the more so since
the recovery tale lacks conviction. The construction business remains the
company's base, though in very competitive markets. Yet the recovery must
come in North American coal, where Costain is up against very formidable
competition from the likes of Peabody. Other chief executives have paid the
ultimate price with better records. Yesterday's five-for-four issue might
have been more palatable had Mr Costain announced that he was seeking a
successor.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By launching its rights issue now, Fiat is asking shareholders for more than
the usual act of faith. The company always looked likely to raise fresh
equity at some point to fund its prodigious capital investment programme.
But as yet Fiat can offer scant evidence that new models - such as the
recently launched Punto - will be a success. The first signs of recovery in
the European car market are probably the best part of a year away. On that
basis, it is extremely difficult to judge whether Fiat will earn a decent
return on capital now being sunk into the business.
The worry is that there is little in the capital-raising package to suggest
that Fiat has changed its spots. The involvement of outside investors such
as Deutsche Bank and Alcatel Alsthom might be taken as comforting. That
said, Deutsche picked up its existing shares near the top of the market in
1986, which says little for its judgment of underlying value. On the
surface, the planned sale of Fiat's 58 per cent stake in Rinascente, Italy's
biggest retailer, marks a welcome step back from the empire-building of the
past. Yet the convoluted plan to sell the stake to Ifil, one of Fiat's main
shareholders, is no substitute for a clean break.
The suspicion remains that such changes have been forced on Fiat by
circumstance. It would be more encouraging to see an infusion of new blood
among top management instead of the old guard postponing retirement. Fiat's
predicament stems from the poor performance of its automotive business
during the late 1980s, during a period of unwise diversification. Raising
equity is a remedy for the current financial headache, but it will not
prevent a re-run.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The low cover on yesterday's gilts auction doubtless sent a shiver through
those who fear that the Pounds 3bn-a-month funding programme must cause
indigestion eventually. There are some who argue that as the market adjusts
to the auction process increased sophistication will allow cover to fall.
Longer-term experience in the US suggests that cover remains a function of
underlying demand. By that measure, the UK looks a little vulnerable. The
recent weakness of sterling against continental currencies, and the
consequential deterrent to overseas buyers who have seen the value of
previous auction purchases fall, shows how critically dependent gilt
auctions are on foreign support.
Since the tax increases announced in the last Budget have yet to kick in,
the chancellor's room for manoeuvre in raising extra funds in November must
be limited by the risks of fiscal shock. There may only be limited room for
the interest rate cuts which the market so confidently expects. This
summer's rerating of gilts may be sustainable, but it is hard to see where
the next leg up is to come from.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Scottish heads south
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a mark of the absurdity of modern accounting that Grand Metropolitan
and Scottish &amp; Newcastle cannot agree on the price at which they struck
their Chef &amp; Brewer deal. Happily, both sides accept that Pounds 622m in
cash will change hands, but GrandMet, which has an interest in talking up
the total, says the package is worth Pounds 736m while S&amp;N, with the aim of
minimising the price, says the true figure is Pounds 703m. Most of the
difference relates to the provision made by GrandMet to offset the cost of
buying beer at above-market prices from Courage. GrandMet's figure allows
for release of this provision, but S&amp;N will also have to buy expensive beer
from Courage until 1995. So if the price it is paying for Chef &amp; Brewer
looks cheap, it is cheap for a reason.
That does not make the acquisition a bad deal. The strategic advantage of a
retailing position in the south made Chef &amp; Brewer worth more to S&amp;N than to
Whitbread, which found the eventual asking price too steep. In theory, S&amp;N
brands will gain national reach and there will be no more question of
dismissing it as a regional brewer. Relief that this strategic hurdle has
been cleared may finally allow the shares to outperform, but it would be
rash to count on too much too soon. The benefits will not accrue overnight,
or without a lot more work.
There is not only the daunting challenge of disposing of surplus pubs in a
difficult market. The Chef &amp; Brewer estate also needs considerable
investment, while it will be 1995 before S&amp;N will be able to put much of its
own beer through the system. Eventually, its acquisition could make it a
formidable competitor to Whitbread in south-eastern pub retailing. Yet
Whitbread has been investing in its retail estate throughout the recession.
It has a head start.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Fuel for a bumpy drive ahead: Fiat's financial package is
designed to defend the group at a time of weak demand for cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fanfare surrounding the launch earlier this month of Fiat's new model,
the Punto, was unprecedented. Turin, the group's home town, was taken over
by Fiat for lavish presentation parties stretching nearly two weeks.
Italy's largest private company had less to trumpet when it unveiled this
week how it intends to provide the financial muscle and management skill to
survive as a significant player in the competitive automotive business.
Fiat's strategy seems to be based on the principle that the best means of
attacking the market is by defending itself; and the stock market's initial
reaction has been cool. For the moment at least Fiat has shown that, unlike
Renault and Volvo, it is not staking its fate on an international marriage.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman and head of the family, has reversed his oft
repeated decision to step aside in favour his brother, Umberto, next June.
Instead, he will stay on with full executive power in the hands of his
faithful lieutenant, Cesare Romiti. This ducks the succession question in
the Agnelli family for the time being, though prepares the way for a further
dilution of their control.
At the same time Fiat has found a hard core of shareholders, along with the
Agnelli family, to help raise cash to cover the likely substantial operating
losses at the year-end. Fiat has not raised capital since 1984 and the
planned rights issue will be the country's largest. With the sale of its
Rinascente retailing arm and a complex set of other transactions, Fiat will
raise an estimated L6,250bn (Pounds 2.6bn).
Fiat is in the middle of an investment programme to revitalise its car and
truck ranges, and other non-auto activities - L40,000bn is going to its car
operations. Its ambitions are, however, devouring funds almost as quickly as
its robots can churn out new models, and come at a time of unprecedented
difficulties because of the steep fall in demand for new cars and trucks in
most leading markets. The climate is harsh for carmakers throughout Europe:
total car sales fell by 16 per cent in the first eight months of this year.
Fiat's turnover on the cars side fell by almost 12 per cent in the first six
months of this year while truck sales dropped by nearly 16 per cent. The
falls were the main reasons behind this week's L966bn pre-tax loss for the
first half of 1993.
The losses were much higher than most observers expected. Short of
extraordinary profits from the disposal of assets such as Rinascente, they
suggest 1993 will be by far the worst year in the company's history. As the
group's cash flow is no longer sufficient to generate enough money for
investment, Fiat has been obliged to turn to shareholders for help.
This week's package contained four main elements: The group will raise about
L3,300bn via a series of financial measures. Shareholders will be offered
new shares at L2,000 each, raising about L2,234bn. A further L194bn will
come from the sale of non-voting shares to employees at the same price.
Also, shareholders will be offered warrants, exchangeable for new ordinary
shares, to produce a further L857bn.
Separately, two big institutional investors will buy shares as well as
subscribing to the rights issue. Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial
company which in 1991 purchased Fiat's Telettra telecommunications
subsidiary, will invest about L615bn. That will repay a convertible bond
linked to the Telettra sale and raise Alcatel's stake in Fiat to about 2.2
per cent from 1 per cent.
Meanwhile, Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company, will acquire 35m
shares which, together with its subscription to the rights issue, will give
it a 2.4 per cent holding in the Fiat group. In return, Fiat is to spend
about L160bn on a 40 per cent holding in Generali's Paris-based Europ
Assistance insurance and travel services operation.
Fiat will sell control of Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, in which it
owns 58 per cent of the ordinary shares. No price has been announced and
Rinascente shares were suspended on Tuesday pending further information.
Assuming Fiat receives a reasonable premium in return for ceding its
majority stake, market analysts estimate the holding is worth about
L1,250bn.
Rinascente is an attractive asset. The group made net profits of L102bn on
sales of L5,040bn last year. Heavy investments in new stores and the
modernisation of existing outlets helped lift this year's first-half profits
by 31 per cent to L25.3bn, in spite of the recession, which has bitten hard
into Italian retail sales.
While the rights issue and the sale of Rinascente were broadly expected and
generally welcomed by the stock market, the two other aspects of this week's
package were viewed much more cautiously.
Fiat failed to produce the long-awaited top management changes which many
shareholders consider crucial to its future. Instead, Mr Giovanni Agnelli
and Mr Romiti are to stay on for another two years.
Neither is young. Mr Agnelli is 72, and was to have been succeeded by his
brother, Umberto, almost 14 years younger, after next year's annual
shareholders' meeting. Mr Romiti, managing director since 1976, is 70. Fiat
justified the decision to waive the company's compulsory retirement age in
terms of providing 'continuity' in a tough period.
But the announcement has been seen as demonstrating the unwillingness of the
Agnelli family, which owns a controlling stake in the Fiat group, to accept
controversial decisions about the group's strategy. 'These are the very
people who have got Fiat into its present mess,' says the Italian specialist
at one leading UK stockbroker. 'The company urgently needs new blood to push
through drastic cost-cutting measures, similar to those taking place at
Volkswagen.'
Continuity could also prove risky on the legal front. A number of Fiat's
senior managers have been implicated in Italy's 18-month political
corruption scandal. Observers fear Mr Romiti, who has appeared before Milan
magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks to politicians but has not been
charged and has denied any involvement, could again face questioning,
embarrassing the company.
Fiat's decision to form a 'hard core' of big shareholders, controlling 30
per cent of its equity, could be against the interests of smaller investors.
The hard core - which includes newcomers Alcatel Alsthom and Generali as
well as established shareholders such as Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca, the
Milan merchant bank - has agreed to act in unison on important decisions. It
also comprises Ifi and Ifil, two quoted investment companies dominated by
the Agnellis.
The pact erects a cordon of institutional investors around Fiat, offering
protection against the risk of a hostile takeover bid. It may also be a way
of enshrining Agnelli family control of the company at a time when the
group's cash needs could exhaust even the family's substantial personal
resources.
Concern about Fiat's attitude towards minority shareholders has been
accentuated by the structure of the Rinascente sale. Rather than selling the
company to a third party, Fiat is ceding control to Ifil, which is one of
its main shareholders.
The transaction is attractive for the Fiat group, in that it provides a
quick and essential cash boost. Whether it is as appealing to the minority
shareholders in Fiat, Rinascente or Ifil is less clear. The fact that all
three companies have cross-shareholding links and are directly or indirectly
controlled by the Agnellis has raised fears among critics of conflicts of
interest.
Only when trading resumes in the shares of Rinascente and Ifil - which were
suspended pending the announcement of details of the deal - will it be
possible to gauge investors' reaction. Early indications suggested some
hesitancy. Fiat's ordinary shares fell by almost 8 per cent yesterday,
closing at L5,595.
Soundings among analysts suggest that there is sympathy for Fiat's
commitment to the core cars business. Investors have been impressed by the
group's determination to renew its ageing range of cars, starting with the
new Punto small car. There is an acceptance that such modernisation requires
a considerable cash injection.
Attractive new models and hopes for a recovery in the demand for cars in the
second half of next year mean the group may be able to look back on 1993 as
a nightmare. But Fiat's failure to give a decisive signal on management
changes and to provide more transparent terms for the sale of Rinascente
have left a sour taste. The structure of this week's financial package
suggests that transparency and the need to avoid the impression of conflicts
of interest remain fairly low on Mr Agnelli's list of priorities.

Accountancy firm Touche Ross reckons that football clubs are underestimating
their assets by failing to disclose the value of players on their balance
sheets. The remedy, surprise, surprise, is to employ a professional valuer
to estimate players' worth and publish the figure in the accounts - someone
like, say, Touche Ross.
But when it comes to disclosing the fees Touche Ross charged Manchester
United for just such a service last year, the firm is rather less keen on
disclosure. 'It was done professionally, for a modest fee,' comes the
response.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Poles apart
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland has stumbled into an impasse in its attempts to form a government,
thanks not least to the constitution which hands the job of inviting someone
to assemble the next one to President Lech Walesa.
He long since announced he'd ask the winning party to give him three names
from which to choose. But he's still waiting for them, even though the
elections 11 days ago produced a winner in the Left Democratic Alliance -
SLD for short - which has agreed with the Polish Peasant party or PSL not
only on forming a coalition, but also apparently on who should head the
cabinet.
While the SLD wants to meet Walesa to advise him of the choice, he has
decided to stand on his dignity. Hence he's insisting that the meeting
cannot take place until he is handed the three names he originally
requested.
In response, the parties are digging in too, with the SLD playing down the
delay by saying it is continuing discussions with the PSL on a common
programme. But cracks seem to be appearing in the agreement - with the PSL
accusing the post-communist economists of being over-
attached to liberal, free-market
doctrines.
So who knows? Does Walesa hope the two parties will break apart before they
get to meet him?

FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Davis's gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt first-hand experience of the Lloyd's market will help Peter Davis,
yesterday revealed as the man to run the National Lottery, to handle
disappointed losers sensitively. But in other respects he himself may be
something of a gamble for the government in its new multi-billion
revenue-raising exercise.
Davis, 51, who resigned as group finance director and deputy chairman of
large underwriter Sturge Holdings in March, apparently has the blend of
accountancy skills and retailing experience that the Department of National
Heritage believes will make the new institution a winner.
A high-flyer at Price Waterhouse, he was regarded as something of a catch in
1980 when he landed at Sir Phil Harris's carpet business. But his Harris
Queensway stint ended less than happily seven years later, when Davis and
other directors walked out. The former PW partner was criticised for failing
to put in place the tough controls that were needed, though Harris is also
known as a poor delegator.
Davis was then brought into Sturge to mastermind diversification of its
business outside Lloyd's, but when the emphasis later turned to stringent
cost-cutting, Davis decided to go.
The national heritage department lets on that the new boy 'likes an
occasional flutter on the National or the Derby'. But he is basically a
cautious soul at heart. Sir Phil certainly owes him one, for it was
apparently on Davis's advice that the carpet tycoon decided not to become a
Name at Lloyd's.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Huntsman packs Packer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year was red letter time for Jon Huntsman. He had an audience with the
Pope and he met media mogul and polo fanatic Kerry Packer. The latter
relationship has blossomed and Huntsman was last week escorting Packer
around chemical plants in Texas, celebrating completion of the purchase of
most of Texaco's chemical interests in a joint venture between the Huntsman
family and Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings.
Unlikely pair though they may be, the odd couple will be hatching more
plans.
A devout Mormon based in Salt Lake City, Huntsman runs America's largest
privately owned chemical company which he built from scratch to a Dollars
1.8bn turnover - due nearly to double again after the latest deal.
Inventor of the old McDonald's hamburger containers, he also has a finely
developed philanthropic streak and a fascination for the former Soviet
Union. If he sounds like Armand Hammer reincarnated, he did meet the
controversial oil magnate towards the end of Hammer's life, at the time of
the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, and the country has been a focus of his
activities ever since.
His 18-month-old reinforced concrete facility is probably the largest
western manufacturing operation in Armenia, while Huntsman funds, and three
of his sons, helped distribute food to its starving people last winter.
Succession is assured, with the Huntsman clan encompassing nine children and
21 grandchildren. Four sons and two sons-in-law are already in the business,
though eldest son John, still only 33, took time out as US ambassador to
Singapore during the Bush administration. A 29-year-old son-in-law is chief
financial officer, and number-something-else son works nights supervising
machines printing bread bags.
Meanwhile, despite his endless ambitions, Huntsman is clear that the company
remains private while he's alive. 'I'm not emotionally equipped to become
the CEO of a public company. I couldn't give employees a house or a car when
they need one.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Through train for Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OCTOBER looks like being a blustery month for the people of Hong Kong.
Tomorrow Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, meets Mr Qian Qichen,
his Chinese counterpart, in New York for the latest stage of talks about the
colony's political future. On October 6, Hong Kong's governor Chris Patten
opens the new session of the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's
lawmaking body. There are hints that Mr Patten may be considering a dash for
limited democracy without Beijing's agreement ahead of the Chinese takeover
in 1997.
Recent events have done nothing to diminish anxiety in the colony that China
and Britain will fail to agree. To Mr Patten's high-profile populism has
been added Mr Hurd's attack on Beijing's claim to the Olympics. Beijing's
response last week was to publish Deng Xiaoping's 1982 demarche warning that
China might take early control of Hong Kong in the event of 'disturbances'.
Perhaps this impasse was inevitable. Mr Patten feels that he is locked into
a timetable and that Britain has made significant concessions without
response from Beijing. He must give soon an indication of his plans for the
extension of democracy in the colony. There must be a bill in LegCo before
the year-end to prepare for municipal elections next year. LegCo is,
however, divided between those who fear Mr Patten may dump democracy and
those who chiefly want a quiet life with Beijing. Mr Patten thus finds
ranged against him that part of the colony's Chinese population which
regards reunification as desirable on almost any terms and a business
community which believes more or less unanimously that China's economic and
political progress guarantees a satisfactory future for Hong Kong. Many feel
Britain should accept that there is no merit in forcing Beijing to swallow
western-style aspirations which London itself thought fit to visit on the
colony only as an afterthought.
Political institutions
Mr Patten has a case when he argues that Hong Kong's political institutions
have nurtured excellent conditions for business and prosperity. Hong Kong,
more than most other Asian centres, offers sound legal institutions, an
honest bureaucracy and a free press. But the governor's best defence against
his critics is that they are not necessarily best placed to judge the
people's interests. Opinion polls continue to show majority support for Mr
Patten's approach, although behind this sentiment may lie yet another
bargaining position: Hong Kong people undoubtedly want as much democracy as
they can get, but they also crave a peaceful transition to Chinese control.
The governor will need to attend with the utmost sensitivity to any shift in
the popular mood and to avoid overplaying his hand.
Board democracy
It is quite possible for example that in next year's municipal elections,
even if conducted on a broader franchise, the pro-democracy United Democrats
will do less well than in the last LegCo poll. They are unable to field
enough candidates to win a majority, and may encounter a sense that many
Hong Kong people are more concerned about services than about district board
democracy. More fundamentally, as 1997 approaches the Hong Kong people may
well feel disinclined to 'vote against China', knowing where their destiny
lies. What they most want is a political 'through train' - a pattern of
enfranchisement for LegCo with which Beijing can live after 1997 in the
context of its 'one country, two systems' formula.
It remains overwhelmingly in the interests of Britain, Hong Kong and China
that this through train runs on schedule, underpinning Hong Kong as a
financial and commercial centre whose strength has already proved of
inestimable value to China's modernisation. Common sense suggests that a
deal ought to be inescapable: China needs a vibrant and confident Hong Hong
every bit as much now to assist in the difficult task of engineering a 'soft
landing' for its economy; Britain and Hong Kong need a smooth transition
which takes reasonable account of popular aspirations. Mr Patten still has
time to persuade the Chinese that it would be in their interests to take
over a Hong Kong with a constitution broadly acceptable to its own people,
but persuade them he ultimately must.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Single market, phase two
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGLE market's launch on January 1 stands out as the European
Community's main success in recent years, contrasting sharply with the
trials over monetary union. The programme to remove barriers to goods,
services and capital has already knitted together the economies of the 12.
In time, it should lead to higher growth rates and enhanced competitiveness.
The Commission is now seeking to maintain the momentum, and earlier this
week presented a draft 'strategic programme' to the Council of Ministers,
setting out three broad areas for future action.
First, better implementation of the original programme. Only half the single
market directives have been implemented by all 12 countries. The
Commission's main concerns are that people still face frontier controls, and
governments have been slow to open up public procurement, which accounts for
15 per cent of EC economic activity. Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archifari, internal
market commissioner, is pursuing countries which fail to enforce directives
through the European Court of Justice.
Second, filling in the gaps of the original programme. The biggest item in
this category is direct taxation. The Commission argues that different
corporation tax regimes, in particular, distort decisions over business
location and co-ordination is therefore needed.
Frontier bottlenecks
Third, trans-European networks. Here the Commission's concern is that
transport, energy and telecommunications networks are planned at national
levels to serve national needs with the result that there are bottlenecks at
frontiers. It wants national operators to overcome the problems of poor
cross-border linkages by co-ordinating investment.
While the Commission's general idea of a new single market drive is good,
its detailed proposals are mixed. Most welcome is the crackdown on
governments which do not enforce directives. It is unfair for countries to
enjoy access to markets in other states, while keeping their own markets
closed.
Less satisfactory is the emphasis on tax 'co-ordination', which seems to be
a new way of saying harmonisation. It is not simply that there is little
hope of persuading national governments to relinquish control over what they
rightly regard as a core responsibility. Co-ordination could even undermine
competitive forces in the single market. In so far as businesses are
prepared to move location to take advantage of lower taxes, individual
governments are given a competitive spur to keep their tax rates down.
Greatest profits
Instead of frittering away its energies on tax, the Commission should focus
on liberalising sectors left out of the original single market programme.
The priority should be to free up markets in energy, telecoms and postal
services, which in most countries are state-owned monopolies.
It is no coincidence that there is a close correspondence between these
sectors and those where networks are fragmented on national lines. National
monopolies invest within their frontiers, while fighting tooth and nail to
keep rivals out of their territories. Competitive private enterprise, by
contrast, would have an incentive to focus investment on bottlenecks because
that is where the greatest profits will be made.
Unfortunately, the Commission has not made the link between fragmented
networks and monopolies. As a result, its main emphasis is on co-ordinating
monopolies rather than abolishing them. While the Commission has made
tentative moves towards liberalisation, there is no sense of urgency. Even
in telecommunications, where progress is greatest, monopolies will remain at
least until 1998. In energy and postal services, liberalisation appears to
have ground to a halt.
Vested interests are so powerful that it will not be easy force open
monopolies. Attempts to press on with liberalisation will be countered by
arguments that competition could lead to job losses. But the Commission
should remember that inefficient monopolies impose costs on all other
sectors of the economy, hampering their ability to compete in world markets
and create new jobs. An assault on monopolies should therefore be the prime
thrust in the next phase of its single market programme.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Personal View: No case for subsidies to the arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government sup-port for the arts is now regarded as a normal and desirable
element of public expenditure in Britain. Central and local government
together now spend Pounds 850m-Pounds 900m a year on the arts and museums:
central government expenditure has increased 15-fold, in real terms, since
1950.
But there is something odd about the arguments for this expenditure. The
Arts Council believes public support is needed to replace institutional
patrons and to encourage the development of the arts. But institutional
patrons played little part in the development of the arts in Britain from
the Reformation in the 16th century until the Arts Council was formed in
1946. As incomes grew, the theatre, music and visual arts - including
innovative works - enjoyed the support of audiences and private buyers.
The scene was, and is, different on the Continent, where princes had their
court theatres and orchestras which passed into the control of governments
when the princes lost their powers. Subsidised companies now attract most of
the audience on the Continent, but unsubsidised theatres still account for
the majority of the audience in Britain.
Incomes and educational standards do most to determine demand for the arts.
Both have grown faster in Britain in the last 45 years than at any other
time; personal incomes are about 2.5 times their level in 1946 and 4.5 times
their level a century ago. The demand for the arts today should therefore be
much larger than it was in the centuries before 1946, in which the British
cultural heritage was created. If the arts could flourish without subsidy
then, they can flourish even better today.
Subsidy therefore seems unnecessary. It also seems undesirable, because it
gives politicians and public servants the opportunity to influence the
development of the arts. Decisions about support are supposed to be
delegated to the Arts Council, but ministers have recently shown increasing
desire to influence funding. And, within the council, decisions are bound to
be influenced by current orthodoxies.
The audience for all forms of the arts is concentrated among the richer
classes in western countries; in Britain, subsidies are concentrated on the
richest area, London. Beneficiaries from subsidies to the arts are therefore
likely to be richer than the taxpayers who finance the subsidy. This fact
may explain why these subsidies are so strongly supported, but also suggests
that they are socially inequitable.
Although the Arts Council maintains that subsidy allows personal inclination
rather than personal income to control access to the arts, subsidies to
performing arts seem to have done more to improve quality and choice, and
increase costs, than to reduce prices. Subsidies to museums, however, have
allowed most British museums to maintain free access, a policy that makes
less sense today - especially in London, where more than half the visitors
to museums are foreigners.
Government policy towards the arts therefore seems misdirected. Increasing
the number of people who can enjoy the arts is a justifiable objective: but
the best means of achieving this goal is to introduce students to the arts
in school, not to dispense subsidies to the suppliers of the arts. Students
might also be given vouchers for free or cheap access to plays, concerts and
museums as part of the educational process.
Direct subsidies from central government to arts companies should therefore
be ended, while support to museums should be reduced. Some government
subsidy is justifiable for museums, to help them to conserve the cultural
heritage for the benefit of future generations and for their role in
education, but the performing arts should be healthier if the government is
not involved.
Any direct subsidies to the performing arts should come from local
authorities. If the electorate is prepared to pay the taxes to finance the
arts, a referendum, in the Swiss manner, would be the best means of
determining its willingness to do so. Voters would presumably foresee
benefits from this expenditure.
With subsidies from central government ended, there would be no need to
retain the Arts Council and the Department of National Heritage.
Responsibility for supporting museums and promoting the arts could be
returned to the Department for Education. Subsidies to the performing arts
could be run down over, perhaps, 10 years so the subsidised companies could
adjust - a process that is likely to imply reducing costs and obtaining more
charitable donations.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small companies the victims of banks
changing basis of lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PATTISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on financing small business emphasises the problem of
adjustment to new circumstances ('Entrepreneurs complain of bank pains',
September 27). Research conducted last year for the RICS by the Centre for
Economics and Business Research underlined the powerful link between bank
funding of industry and the state of property values. The findings in
Professor McWilliams' paper indicated this relationship made money too
readily available in good times and too scarce in bad times - banking
conventions tended to cause overreaction at the top and bottom points of the
cycle to the severe disadvantage of the British economy. On the basis of
past patterns, the report suggested that a 10 per cent decline in commercial
property values over a two-year period would reduce the flow of funds from
banks to industry by some Pounds 9.7bn over the same period with a six
months' lag. The issues are clearly strongest for small businesses.
The banks tell us that they now wish to change the basis of their lending.
In the long run, this may be desirable, even if it means that the price of
capital to small businesses will tend to rise. However, the parallel
experience in North America is worrying. It suggests that when the banking
sector seeks to change the basis of lending to small business, the result
tends to be that the sector stops lending to small business instead of
finding a different basis for such lending. Let us hope that the Bank of
England finds more effective solutions.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: MPs should lead on pay freezes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK FIELD MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report Gordon Brown's statement to the Labour party conference on
full employment, and this is to be welcomed wholeheartedly ('Brown pledges
Labour drive for full employment', September 28). A commitment to full
employment will give new direction to the party's thinking and campaigning.
What is now required is the detailed work on a raft of policies necessary to
any significant expansion in the numbers in work. This is a debate in which
Labour should attempt to set the agenda, but it will involve some hard
choices.
You also report Gordon Brown as emphasising the importance of growth in the
economy. Of course this is crucial, but growth by itself will not
necessarily lead to an expansion in jobs. Other countries, such as Spain,
have shown that a doubling in national income can result in an actual
decrease in the numbers in work. Crucial to the regaining of full employment
is people's attitudes to how the new wealth should be shared.
The government asserts that there will be no automatic pay increases in the
public sector in the coming year. But, as David Goodhart reported on
September 18 ('Keeping the lid on pay rises'), a freeze on recruitment in
the public sector would mean 'losing' half a million new jobs. By freezing
recruitment, workers could thereby gain a 5 per cent wage increase and
appear to keep within the government's overall nil increase in the pay bill.
Last year workers at Sheffield City Council were faced with the hard choice
of a pay increase and sending some of their colleagues on to the dole queue,
or accepting a wage freeze and maintaining the existing workforce. Their
choice of the latter was brave and principled.
If Labour is serious about setting the debate for full employment, this
year's public sector pay round offers a major opportunity. Some will say it
will need considerable political courage to spell out the case for a wage
freeze in order to safeguard those half a million unfilled jobs. But a clear
lead from the Labour party on the need to offer a hand-up to half a million
people in the dole queue would win widespread support in the public sector.
Labour MPs could give a lead to public sector workers in respect of their
own pay here in Parliament. MPs and cabinet ministers are expected to gain
an automatic increase in the coming year. Labour should put a motion down
suggesting a freeze on MPs' and cabinet ministers' pay, providing that the
monies foregone are earmarked for job creation programmes. In this way the
public would see there was a direct link in the short term between limiting
pay increases and creating new jobs.
Sharing out existing pay packets with those in the dole queues is not itself
a panacea to full employment. But it would be a start and it would signal a
new beginning.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate backing vital for ENO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN NICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your management page feature, 'Time to sing a new song' (September
23) on ENO's new team, you say the company 'recognises that it will never
get much out of the corporate entertainment market'. May I elaborate on this
point. Although the Coliseum is not a corporate house in the sense that all
the best seats are monopolised by business people, ENO enjoys the support of
100 companies and trusts which contribute more than Pounds 1m a year to the
company while taking advantage of the theatre's many private entertaining
rooms.
Sponsorship also plays a vital role - more than half of our productions have
been sponsored in 1993-94 so far. Indeed, a recent Arts Council appraisal
says ENO's performance far exceeds the average growth in arts sponsorship
during the past five years.
Lucy Kellaway rightly says that our success in attracting audiences will be
determined by the operas we produce and, citing the critics, questions
whether ENO's new production of La Boheme (sponsored by the IIR Group) can
be the equivalent of a Jurassic Park. The public has answered resoundingly
with attendances averaging more than 90 per cent.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Real reason behind the 'miracle' in
east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL HOBDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed to read your coverage of the World Bank report, The
East Asian Miracle ('State role in growth of east Asian economies
questioned' and 'The Asian miracle that wasn't', September 27). It gave too
much credibility to the sterile old 'was it the market/was it the state?'
debate - and the Bank's (predictable) finding that it was the market, not
state intervention, which explains east Asia's development.
Anyone with a knowledge of east Asian industry knows that it is the ability,
speed and dynamism of Asia's companies which explains the miracle. It is
companies which export, earn foreign exchange, acquire technology, generate
wealth and raise productivity - not governments, and not abstract markets.
Without these companies' skilful, audacious and deliberate strategies (in
many cases in co-operation with governments) the miracle could not have
occurred.
If one-tenth of the resources dedicated to the 'market vs state' debate were
put into learning about the strategies of Asia's late-comers we would now
have useful advice for Latin America, eastern Europe and our own companies
which are trying to compete with Asia's new-comers.

SOAP OPERA.
THE INSIDE STORY OF PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE
By Alecia Swasy
Times Books, Dollars 24, 288 pages
Procter &amp; Gamble has a dirty and not so little secret, says Alecia Swasy:
the US consumer products giant, which cultivates the image of enlightened
employer and housewife's friend, is in reality a paranoid, rather sinister
institution, obsessed by secrecy and control, which spies on its employees
and bullies anyone who stands in its way.
That, at any rate, is the picture painted by this Wall Street Journal
reporter in one of the most sensational yet deeply flawed business books
published in the US this year.
It is the product of interviews Swasy conducted with more than 300 current
and former P&amp;G employees - which is in itself no mean achievement, given the
company's well-deserved reputation for secrecy.
However, Swasy is hardly a detached observer. In 1991, when covering P&amp;G for
the Journal, she infuriated Ed Artzt, its chairman, by revealing strategy
moves under discussion inside the company.
His response was draconian. He enlisted the help of the police in
Cincinnati, P&amp;G's midwestern home city, who combed through millions of
business and home telephone records in an attempt to track down the P&amp;G
employee leaking information to the Journal.
The move backfired badly. P&amp;G, accused of abuse of power and invasion of
privacy, faced a torrent of bad publicity. Mr Artzt was forced to back down
and acknowledge he had made an 'error of judgment'.
The incident reveals an ugly side to a company long regarded as a good US
corporate citizen, which regularly appears on lists of the 'most admired'
companies in the US, or 'best to work for'.
Swasy asserts, however, that her brush with P&amp;G is symptomatic of an inbred
and increasingly oppressive culture which strips employees of privacy and
independent thinking. P&amp;G is 'a cross between the marines and the Mormon
church'.
She portrays a company so worried about leaks of sensitive trading data that
its large security staff - manned by former employees of the FBI, CIA and
military police - monitors internal staff phone calls and routinely rides
aircraft between Cincinnati, New York and Chicago to prevent employees and
advertising agency representatives talking shop in flight. 'People can be
fired for leaving a company phone book on their desk.'
The atmosphere, she says, has become more oppressive under Artzt, who took
over as chairman in 1990 and is known within the company as the 'Prince of
Darkness' because of his abrasive manner and impatience with those who
disagree with his ideas. To many people, he personifies 'what's wrong with
P&amp;G these days: success at any price and too little attention to people'.
Swasy goes on to pillory P&amp;G's research and development record (too few new
products), its advertising (conservative and sexist) and sales methods
(bullying, but with diminishing effect as large retailers such as discount
chain Wal-Mart usurp the power of consumer goods manufacturers).
She also revisits two controversies from the 1980s which reflect badly on
the company: its marketing of the Rely tampon - which was withdrawn amid
allegations that it was linked to the potentially fatal toxic shock syndrome
 -and the pollution of a Florida river by a P&amp;G pulp mill.
P&amp;G's aversion to publicity and market power make it an excellent subject
for investigation. Despite its lily-white public persona, questionable deeds
have doubtless been committed in the cause of its bottom line.
Unfortunately, Swasy has wasted this opportunity by writing an account so
one-sided and unfair, so full of vague generalities and argumentative non
sequiturs, that she undermines the cred-ibility of her entire book.
To take just one example, she dwells at length on the very real competition
facing P&amp;G in the US and some third world markets, while brushing aside the
fright it gave Unilever with a remarkable push into Europe in the 1980s.
There may be considerable truth to her suggestion that Artzt's management
style - described as one of 'fear and intimidation' - is undermining company
morale and prompting a brain drain among senior managers. The trouble is,
her judgment cannot be trusted.
And it is equally true - as Swasy grudgingly acknowledges in a throwaway
sentence or two - that P&amp;G has a very strong profits record and that its
bureaucracy may have needed at least some of the strong medicine delivered
by Artzt.
Yet despite the persistent grinding of axes, this book does contain a wealth
of fascinating detail about the inner workings of P&amp;G. There is, for
example, a vivid portrait of the young Artzt, consumed with ambition,
conducting his own informal national store check (P&amp;G's first) as he drove
his family across the US to his first headquarters job.
There is also a valuable account of how P&amp;G improved its long-time
adversarial relationship with the increasingly powerful Wal-Mart, locating a
dedicated sales team close to the company's Arkansas headquarters and
linking the two groups by computer.
As Swasy points out, Wal-Mart's annual sales revenues could be Dollars 100bn
by the turn of the century, more than double those of P&amp;G. Together with
other giant retailers it poses a serious threat to the profit margins of all
consumer products manufacturers.
Yet despite these insights, the primary impression left by this book is of
someone hunting through a family's dirty laundry basket, intent on
presenting every grubby garment stain to the world. The search can tell you
something about a household's habits, but it hardly gives a balanced
portrait.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The painful road to capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN

<TEXT>
Last weekend I made my pilgrimage to the solid bourgeois house in which Karl
Marx was born. This was in the former Roman garrison town of Trier, on the
River Mosel, near where Germany, France and Luxembourg all meet and, indeed,
a stone's throw from the village of Schengen, where ministers from five EC
countries agreed to dismantle all frontier formalities.
Apart from the lady who took the entrance money, there was not a single
German to be seen in Karl Marx Haus, and hardly any Europeans. The visitors
were mainly from the third world, predominantly Africa. They mostly treated
their visit as a tourist outing, grinning and taking photographs. A more
serious-looking young man, reading a Turkish newspaper, turned out to be
looking at the sports pages, while drinking a bottle of coke.
The visit put me in the right frame of mind to read the Annual Economic
Outlook of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the
problems faced by countries 'in transition', which are trying to escape from
the Soviet variety of Marxism and restore capitalism.
Forget the recent trouble at the top of the EBRD. The report, issued by the
EBRD's chief economist John Flemming, is a thorough analysis of the
economics of transition. It should remain a permanent reference for its
treatment of property rights as a condition - in addition to markets,
privatisation and macroeconomic stability - of a workable capitalist
economy. And it is not as far from the rings of security police around the
Russian parliament as it might seem. For the anti-Yeltsin opposition is
basically trying to stop a transformation in property rights which would
finally undermine its power base.
Just as there are no special economic rules prevailing within 30 miles of
Cambridge, there are no separate ones for the former communist countries
either. Some of their most acute problems are familiar in the west under the
dreadful name of 'corporate governance'. No ideal method has been found
anywhere of performing the proprietorial role of monitoring the activities
of, and if necessary replacing, professional managers.
But in the transitional economies, property rights are also threatened by
'ill definition, continuing bureaucratic en-croachment and criminality'.
Meanwhile, the birth pangs of capitalism are proving every bit as painful as
Marx expected those of socialism to be. Anyone who believes that there has
been a severe recession in the west should look at the EBRD best guess for
output in Russia, which fell by a cumulative 20 per cent between 1989 and
1992. In central Europe, the best performers were Hungary and Poland, where
output fell by 'only' 13 1/2 per cent.
The slump had its origins in the final years of the communist regime. Output
growth came to an end in the middle 1980s. The pains of the subsequent
restructuring included a sharp cutback in military expenditure, which was
mostly in remote areas with little alternative employment. Just as important
has been 'the enormous anxiety over the prospective returns to investment
created by the uncertainties of the transition towards markets and property
rights'.
There have also been external forces. The decline in economic activity in
the former Soviet Union, and the ensuing fall in its demand for imports, may
have accounted for the entire output decline in Hungary and most of the
output decline in the Czech Republic. In addition, German unification
resulted in a massive decline of exports to the former German Democratic
Republic.
The Russian shift to charging world prices for oil and other resources has
been likened in its incidence to a third oil price shock. On top of
everything else there came recession in the west, which has made investors
there cautious about placing funds anywhere - except perhaps in the dynamic
Asian economies.
The scale of the post-communist recession may be overstated, because of the
under-recording of the output of new small-scale private enterprise. The
EBRD expects positive growth everywhere outside the war zones within the
next two or three years. Long-term forecasters suggest that it might take
more than 35 years to catch up with per capita levels in the OECD. So much
the worse for the forecasters. The EBRD mentions that none of them is using
the successes achieved in a number of Asian countries 'to identify the paths
the reforming countries of eastern Europe might be following'. There is also
the throwaway remark: 'Provided that eastern Europe can avoid building a tax
and transfer system providing employed and unemployed workers with
incentives to risk prolonged joblessness, such as has developed in western
Europe, the normal unemployment rate in eastern Europe might turn out to be
less.'
Comparisons across Europe should not all be one way. I hope that somebody
will draw the attention of the UK chancellor to one apparently innocuous
section, which estimates that the marginal tax rate on labour incomes in the
UK is already around 65 per cent, taking into account national insurance
contributions and VAT, 'slightly higher than is typical in eastern Europe'.
The US is exceptional in being below 50 per cent - that is, unless Congress
approves the Clinton budget package.
On the other hand the post-communist countries stand alone in their rates of
tax on income from capital, which are estimated at nearly 98 per cent for
Russia and around 85 per cent even for Poland and the Czech Republic. These
astronomical rates reflect the interaction of the tax system with high
inflation. Until they are tackled, privatisation is bound to be at knockdown
prices and domestic investors will continue to hold funds abroad or simply
hoard US dollars.
According to the EBRD: 'The fate of economic reforms in eastern Europe will
depend on how successful the reforming countries will become in penetrating
western markets.' Trade with the west is now as high or higher as a
proportion of the total as it was in 1928. Import protection in the Czech
and Slovak republics and Poland is now lower and more uniform than in most
OECD countries.
Central European trade with the European Community is regulated by
Association Agreements, which came into force in March 1992 and aim to
establish a free trade area within 10 years, with a phased timetable in
which the EC will move faster. Unfortunately these commitments do not
completely apply to sensitive sectors accounting for 30 to 40 per cent of
the trade of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
The biggest restrictions are in agriculture, where, for instance, imports of
meat into the EC were recently subject to a levy of over 100 per cent. Some
relief is promised in textiles and clothing; but these are dependent on the
successful conclusion of the Gatt round. In principle, steel quotas have
come to an end; but there are fears of informal pressure by west European
industries against price competition here and in chemicals.
An example of EC behaviour was the recent ban on meat and dairy products
because of the supposed danger of foot and mouth disease. The Czech foreign
minister pointed out that there has been no known case of this disease in
his country for almost 20 years. (A Hungarian colleague said it must have
been 'foot in mouth disease' instead.)
In view of some of the horrifying estimates of the cost of extending to
central and eastern Europe farm supports and regional assistance, the EBRD
authors suggest a new form of membership that would not automatically offer
all the 'benefits' of EC cohesion policies, such as a social charter and the
regional funds. Maybe other countries will eventually ask for such opt-outs
as well, leaving Mr Delors to enforce his rules within 30 miles of Brussels
 -which does not extend as far as Trier.

CAREFUL Guy Maddin
LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE (15) Alfonso Arau
BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT (18) Taylor Hackford
ASSASSIN OF THE TSAR (12) Karen Shakhnazarov
An utterly wonderful Canadian film is on at the ICA in London and I am
thinking: Can we arrange coach trips from all parts of Britain or Europe?
Seldom does one stroll into the Mall's culture palace and find a gem like
Careful. ICA movies are usually pieces of penitential avant-gardism,
airdropped into Britain from planes plying between unheard-of movie
festivals. But this film, written, directed, designed, photographed and
edited by Guy Maddin - there is auteurship for you - is a joy, a feast, an
astonishment.
Set in a never-never Bavarian village, it starts as a spoof-Teutonic
'silent' movie embellished with cautionary voice-over: a wise old chorus
figure warns of avalanches, crevasses and other Alpine perils ('Guard
against any noise]', 'A heedless heart can be lured to dangerous heights]').
Then it modulates into a mountain folk-melodrama plucked as if from the
1920s: the kind of movie that led on later to such joy-through-ozone
pictures as Leni Riefenstahls's The Blue Light or The White Hell Of Pitz
Palu.
Through an occluding swathe of grainy, mock-tinted photography plus artfully
crackling soundtrack - ah sweet satiric retaliation for all those
dawn-of-time Nordic art movies we once suffered through as youngsters] - we
watch the adventures of a doomed, incestuous family living in the village of
Tolzbad. Ma is lusted after by blond son Johann; elder son Franz spends his
years in cobwebbed detention in the attic (offence unspecified); and young
Grigorss, the only healthy and 'normal' son, loves Klara who works in the
village's all-female coalmine. (Candle-hats and soot-dusted Laura Ashley
dresses a requirement.) There are also cut-out cardboard mountains, wrinkled
sky-drops lit by bilious suns, and any number of flugelhorns, goats, ghosts,
castles and avalanches.
To call this film 'kitsch' would be like calling the Grand Canyon a
faultline: true but inadequate. Mr Maddin, none of whose three previous
micro-budget films I have seen, must have spent his whole childhood
devouring early German cinema. But when pastiche reaches this degree of
passionate empathy, it passes into a zone of unpolluted, debt-free genius. I
would call Careful worthy of Airplane] did I not think it better than
Airplane]. Better because it does not stop at derision; it goes on to make a
new shape and poetry from the wreckage of its own lampooning.
Maddin makes us notice as never before how beautiful were the
slap-up-a-mountain artifices of primitivist silent cinema. When his
characters, stick-silhouetted against the backdrop sky like Lotte Reininger
figures, clamber down a couple of feet of papier-mache rock, they ask us to
believe we are halfway up an Alp at the same time as saying 'This trompe
l'oeil would trompe absolutely no one.'
And when the schoolmistress with the ludicrous German accent (played by
writer-actress Jackie Burroughs of A Winter Tan) deals out her jackbooted
moral lessons for the day to the towheaded Aryan youngsters - 'Never Gamble
With Life' she scratches on the blackboard - we giggle at the scene's
goofiness as well as grinning at the heady oneiric cocktails Maddin makes
from mixing his movie memories. (Besides all else, Careful is a mischievous
primer on how the follies of Aryan supremacism were embryonic in those
purity-obsessed 1920s mountain yarns).
Nothing is funnier than a comedy that seems to take itself seriously.
Careful never holds out its hat for laughter. It guards an uproarious
solemnity even in climaxes like the avalanche triggered by Grigorss to kill
Klara's father. (Dare to laugh out loud as the first rumble causes a stuffed
goat to topple down the fake mountainside). And as if the kitsch had not
already told us a gay sensibility was at work, the film can be read as a
dream-parable about closet sexuality: about the tragic absurdity of lives
ruled by exaggerated caution. 'The single bleat of a lamb' intones the Wise
Old Narrator, 'once caused an avalanche that uncovered an entire graveyard.'
Careful is, among much else, a poetic farce about social hypocrisy: about
the need to tread softly, lest we stumble on the Real Truth about people and
their needs and their emotions.
The rest of the movie week dwells among foothills. When you open a press
handout on Monday morning and discover instructions on how to make hot
chocolate and Quails in Rose Petal Sauce, what should you do? Assume a
mistake at the printers? Check that your brain-centres are fully
functioning? Or say to yourself, 'Another day, another Mexican
magical-realist movie.'
Laura Esquivel's novel Like Water For Chocolate was a romance with recipes -
this trend is spreading; is she related to Nora Ephron? - and has now become
a movie with recipes. As directed by Alfonso Arau (actor, film-maker and
Esquivel's husband) it is whimsical, too long and filmed in a dusty orange
glow. But in America it has made much money, becoming the year's arthouse
answer to Jurassic Park.
Reason: its slant on Magic Realism is shamelessly populist. Give the public
a pair of lovers kept apart by fate: mother-tyrannised Tita (Lumi Cavazos)
and handsome Pedro (Marco Leonardi), who weds Tita's sister when Tita is
sentenced to spinsterdom by possessive Mama. Then, having kept them sundered
through assorted births, deaths, revolutions and recipes, bang them together
finally like two flintstones overdue for combustion.
The film has moments of charm and mischief. And I may try the recipes. But
set an Esquivel yarn next to a Marquez yarn and you see what a vast
instructive gap exists in Latin American fantasy-fiction between the
wonderful and the merely whimsical.
There is more Hispanic flavouring in Blood In Blood Out, directed by Taylor
'Officer And A Gentleman' Hackford. But this is Latinism Hollywood-style. It
is about as convincing as those million-dollar stars' haciendas that dot the
hills above Tinseltown: here a whitewashed Spanish arch, there a carefully
placed Mexican maid; spread above them all, the exotic waves of red tiling .
. .
Unlike houses, of course, movies walk, talk and make a lot of noise. This
three-hour saga of life on the barrio - the slums and war-zones of east Los
Angeles - wants to be the ultimate ethnic epic for LA's fast-growing Chicano
population. But around our three artfully differentiated 'heroes' -
hotheaded Miklo (Damian Chapa), artistic Cruz (Jesse Borrego), proud and
macho Paco (Benjamin Bratt) - spins a plot whose circles diminish even as
they accelerate.
For every family bust-up there are two more waiting; for every prison riot,
expect three encores; and for every mutilation inflicted on our boys -
stomach wound, broken back, amputated leg - be sure that exponentially
amplified revenges will be meted out to the baddies.
'I wanted this film to have a reality factor that could not be questioned,'
says Taylor Hackford. But we know all about Hackford's reality factors. In
addition to the Gere-Winger navy lark he directed Against All Odds and
produced La Bamba: movies sharing Blood In Blood Out's blend of melodrama,
ear-bashing music and comic-book acting styles. This is the cinema of
knee-jerk response-induction. Keep hitting the filmgoer in the right place
and he will react in the right way. Failing that, he will at least feel too
battered to leave the cinema.
Assassin Of The Tsar, an Anglo-Russian co-production, is better only in
being shorter. Malcolm McDowell is the grizzled, whitehaired mental patient
who thinks he killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and that he led the firing
squad that later erased the Romanovs in 1918. As Lady Bracknell might say,
one paranoid delusion is reasonable: two seems like self-indulgence. Dr Oleg
Jankovsky attempts to cure him; and director Karen Shakhnazarov attempts,
without success, to make the film feel like something more than an extended
history exam.

Dorabella lifts her face from her paperback (Raw Energy) and says 'I'm
totally energised]' She and Fiordiligi are waiting outside the electrically
fenced MOD enclosure. Where can their RAF lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo,
be? Then they hear that the boyfriends are being sent straight into action
today. Meeting in a quick but tearful farewell ('. . . life's a bitch and
then you die'), the girls beg the men 'You must be sure to 'phone'. But soon
two rich American strangers (F. and G. in disguise) enter the girls' lives,
announcing 'We're hung like two sun-ripe bananas' . . .
Music Theatre London has its own style, and has had notable success in
Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni and Rossini's Cinderella. The performers
are actors who can also sing; recitatives are spoken; and everything is
transposed into present-day England. This method has made us see the
societies of old operas by a newly sharp light, while laughing at the
England we know. Now MTL is tackling Cos fan tutte. Despina is a neighbour
who pops in to borrow some sugar, and Dorabella stuffs herself neurotically
with chocolate biscuits as her first aria ends.
Cos, however, faces MTL with a new kind of problem, because it is less to do
with sociological structure than Figaro, Giovanni and Cinderella. Class
tensions are virtually absent from Cos, whose subject - women's capacity for
infidelity, and men's reactions to that - is developed in private. Another
problem is that the usual MTL director, Nick Broadhurst, was unable to shape
the entire show; William Relton is billed as 'co-director', and this Cos
only fitfully displays the impish, revelatory modern detail that kept
bubbling up through the company's previous work.
Yet, although this staging is not always neat or satisfying, it addresses
the core of Cos seriously - and so proves often stimulating, often
entertaining. Its strengths and weaknesses of this Cos are best illustrated
by its Ferrando, Simon Butteriss (an MTL regular). Ferrando, Cos's least
defined character, is appalled when he finds that Dorabella has betrayed him
 -yet, trying to seduce Fiordiligi only minutes later, he becomes
(musically) so impassioned that we wonder if he has transferred affection.
In this case, we don't wonder any more - we know.
Butteriss keeps forcing us to attend to the workings of Ferrando's heart
when Mozart leaves us (and Ferrando) ambiguous. This helps us to re-think
Ferrando, but not always to believe simply that he is Ferrando. No-one
onstage is more vividly alive to every nuance, more exemplary in dramatic
commitment, but he actually works too hard. To cope with the role's rigorous
lines, he has acquired newly lyrical and heroic vocal tones - enlarging his
usually incisive, but strenuous and tight, vocal method. These new
'Ferrando' tones, however, are not unified; you can hear him changing tack
vocally.
Fiordiligi (Jacinta Mulcahy), Dorabella (Mary Lincoln), and Guglielmo (Peter
Corry) - all vocally more relaxed - give sensitive, accomplished
performances that are intermittently exciting. Fiordiligi gets visibly high
on the defiant proclamations of fidelity in her first aria; and Dorabella's
giggly second aria (here sung in a drunken lather) exposes her own
unresisting emotional helplessness. Both girls are brunette beauties. But,
despite several such illuminating passages, they lack force of character, so
that sometimes we feel what certain opponents of Cos have claimed: that
these people are fools.
The two most completely conceived characters are Alfonso (Richard Hampton)
and Despina (Marilyn Cutts). Hampton's delivery, however, is laborious and
grey, whereas the tension whooshes up with Cutts's every entrance. She sings
and acts this nosy, knowing neighbour with easy assurance. Tony Britten,
leading the band of five, gives the show the right brisk pulse. The
ensembles, as they should, danced. The show's tone is not consistent, but it
adds to our understanding of this most imponderable opera.
At the Greenwich Theatre until December 6

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP

<TEXT>
We can forget the pumpkin and the mice. And the Fairy Godmother. We can,
indeed, forget any earlier Cinderellas: Christopher Gable's new staging for
his Northern Ballet Theatre is an exercise in de-mystification, decorated
with Freudian hang-ups. The production, with design by Tim Hatley and a new
score by Philip Feeney, had its first performance on Tuesday night in
Sheffield's prettily refurbished Lyceum Theatre. Gable, with Rachel Lopez de
la Nieta as 'choreographic assistant', has opted for the heavily dramatic -
not to say melodramatic - manner he has sought to give to many of the
stagings offered by NBT, of which troupe he is director.
So, in the first act, we see the deaths of Cinderella's brother and mother
during a Ruritanian apple-harvest, events whose dramatic impact is somewhat
mitigated by the fact that the dear departed haunt the rest of the action as
singularly busy ghosts. The brother occupies himself doing Cinders'
housework; the mother acts as a spectral modiste, producing frocks from The
Beyond. Stepmother and Stepsisters are the traditionally nasty lot, ready to
inflict punishment, to tear dresses and passions to tatters, and to brand
our heroine with a poker. That the stepmother eventually chops off one
daughter's toes so that the shoe shall fit, is by the way.
Cinderella's father takes to the bottle, and during a waltz makes a pass at
his daughter. This, unsurprisingly, freezes her emotions - it didn't do much
for mine, either - and when the Prince becomes attentive at the last of the
action's three big dances (Gable has seriously over-balled the tale)
Cinderella is less than enraptured. But, although now seen in vest and
braces, the Prince wins the waif, and a flock of obliging ravens peck out
the eyes of the stepmother and her brood.
Nearly three hours are passed in the company of this anxious affair. Gable's
policy for NBT is much concerned with the staging of full-length dance
spectacles, in which dance seems the weaker partner. In an earlier Romeo and
Juliet, dramatic vivacity was taken to almost hysterical lengths. The
company's revision of Swan Lake was manic. The positive benefits of Gable's
style were, though, clear to see in the recent Christmas Carol, where
Dickens' strong plotting, as well as his sentimentality, provided an ideal
armature for a production nearer music-theatre than dance.
In each of these, a recognisable title was a significant factor in
attracting an audience. This Cinderella will not, I hazard, alarm NBT's
faithful, though it may take ballet-lovers, gently reared on Ashton or on
Russian versions - where the classic dance is dominant - by surprise. Philip
Feeney's music is eclectic, veering from the abrasive to the sweet, but
interestingly scored. Tim Hatley's basic set is a dimly reflecting box, in
which panels rise and fall to allow changes of location. It is clever,
somewhat claustrophobic, a bit grim. Costuming I found uniformly
unattractive and, like the staging, heavy-handed. What Gable and Miss Lopez
de la Nieta propose as choreography is what one might expect: dramatic
structure is more deftly done than steps, and, curiously, the
characterisations look sketchy. Jayne Regan has attractive, delicate moments
as the heroine; other roles are more like received ideas than personalities.
The staging is over-run with birds: one flock obligingly pick rice from the
kitchen ashes; cockerels fight as cabaret at a ball; doves behave dove-ishly
and ravens are retributive. The sum effect is very odd: but the piece itself
is an oddity in its resistance to the idea (which Gable knows well from
dancing in such works as The Invitation or Romeo and Juliet or The Two
Pigeons) of classic choreography as an art able to express the most intense
emotion. And as a presentation of an enduring myth, which is the sub-text to
the staging, this Cinderella lacks that mysterious joy which we know it can
have in dance and the theatre.
Northern Ballet Theatre's regional tour lasts until January 1994 and is

The Lindsay Quartet's 'French Connection' Festival at the Wigmore Hall, now
just past the halfway mark, testifies not only to the strength of the
entente cordiale but also to the continuing vitality of the chamber-musical
medium itself.
The bill of fare places side by side French and British masterworks and new
works: Ravel's single String Quartet and Geoffrey Poole's Second Quartet,
say, or - in Tuesday's recital by the excellent piano-quartet group Domus -
the Faure C minor Piano Quartet and John Casken's 1990 Piano Quartet (first
London performance). In no didactic fashion, and also because these players
have themselves sustained a policy of commissioning new works for their
repertory, the nightly mixtures make their point with pleasing, salient
simplicity.
The Domus programme was a particularly winning one. Casken, whose leading
position among British composers of middle years is emphasised by each new
work of his that appears, wrote the Piano Quartet for Domus's tenth birthday
season. It is 'real' chamber music - that is to say, its musical ideas seem
irremovable from the intimate performing circumstances that brought them
into existence, and there is a 'conversational' distinctness in their
exchange that characterises both the ensemble and each invidual strand.
The idiom is highly personal - with pianistic arabesques in tiny, chattery
flourishes against static, consonant strings, and sudden group stirrings
into dance-like rhythmic energy - yet always strictly logical, and
beautifully clear in the balance of parts. The Domus violinist, Krysia
Osostowicz, told us in advance that Casken's quartet was 'the most difficult
work we've played', but from the performance it seemed clear that the
technical challenges had been comprehensively and exhilaratingly met.
The previous evening the Lindsay Quartet had devoted the first half of their
recital to the second London performance of Michael Tippett's most recent
chamber-music opus - the Fifth Quartet, a quirky, loose-limbed, sometimes
buoyantly appealing compendium of late-Tippettian sounds and ideas - and
then the London premiere of the Poole Second. A Manchester don who has spent
fruitful time in Africa mastering drumming and other instrumental
techniques, the composer has found atmospheric, enjoyable ways of
re-creating and developing them within the string-quartet format.
Like the South African-born Kevin Volans in his string-quartet 'hit' of the
1980s, White Man Sleeps - if perhaps with less 'native' economy - Poole
sends out a compliment to the strength and wholeness of African music which
is elegantly returned.

It is always salutary for the English to be reminded of how much the world
owes to the Scottish genius for invention. Small Objects of Desire (BBC 2,
10.10) is an ingenious and worthwhile series. Tonight it examines the
influence on our lives of the hypodermic syringe which was invented in 1853
by a Scottish physician called Alexander Wood.
Critical Eye: The Women at Ten Downing Street (C4, 9.00) follows the
wearisome and depressing course of a strike at a metal furnishing factory in
the West Midlands. Asian women are not a group who have yet made much of a
mark in this country for their militancy. In this case, bad pay, compulsory
overtime and poor working conditions led to the women picketting the factory
for over a year.
American fiction and cinema has gained greatly for putting convicts into
chain-gangs, something which so far as I know the British penal system has
not used this century. 'Cool Hand Luke' with Paul Newman is one of my
favourite films so I will ignore the critical consensus and watch Brubaker
(C4, 10.00) in which another Old Delectable, Robert Redford, swings his
hammer.

Plaid, to borrow from the Oxford English Dictionary, is 'a long piece of
twilled woollen cloth, usually having a chequered or tartan pattern, forming
the outer article of the Highland costume'. That is distinct from the
Lowland plaid, which has a different pattern and is more commonly known as a
maud. Americans are very fond of the Highland version.
In the delightful musical entertainment that has opened at the Apollo, plaid
is pronounced to rhyme with glad.
Do not be misled by the bagpiper outside the theatre. Forever Plaid takes
its name from a fictitious four guy harmony group of the kind that was
immensely popular, especially in the US, in the 1950s. The story is that
their kind of music was killed off by the arrival of the Beatles. Unlike
Buddy Holly, Forever Plaid didn't even have a plane crash: they died in a
road accident while still rehearsing. Now they come back from heaven.
And heaven in a way it is. These are fresh-faced American guys, with short
hair and intelligent looks. It is about as far from Grease or Hair as a
musical can get. When not wearing plaid, they tend to wear elegant white
dinner jackets: sometimes a mixture of the two. It is not hard to imagine
them in high society, whether the movie or the real thing.
There is a certain amount of dialogue and knock-about. For the most part,
however, they simply sing the 1950s songs of innocence in their harmonised
style. At one stage,they adapt the Beatles' 'She Loves Me', and you know
that can't be bad. They have a wonderful time with 'Lady of Spain', bring in
the audience when it comes to the mambo and show their more emotional range
in their version of 'Cry'.
Some will settle simply for the sheer nostalgic pleasure of their
arrangements of 'Three Coins in the Fountain' and 'Catch a Falling Star',
though they can have deeper voices when they want to, as in 'Sixteen Tons'.
Plaid lasts for less than two hours without an interval, is directed by
Stuart Ross, and has a splendid pianist in James Compton. Here is a show
that you cannot fail to enjoy.

FT  30 SEP 93 / People: Jean Wood to head Irish Life in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Life, Ireland's largest life assurance, pensions and investment group,
has appointed Jean Wood as chief executive of Irish Life UK on the
retirement of Ralph Sepel.
She will also take on responsibility for Irish Life's operations in Europe
outside Ireland, which was formerly handled from the Dublin HQ by John
Edmonton; he departed last month to head the new operation of J. Rothschild
International Assurance at the International Financial Services Centre in
Dublin.
Wood is well known in the UK insurance industry having been managing
director of the life insurance, pensions and unit trust company, Prolific
Group, until it was bought for Pounds 82m from Hafnia, the Danish insurance
group, by Scottish Provident last year.
Scottish Provident gave Wood a senior position to integrate Prolific, but
not on a long-term basis. She had helped build Prolific's strong reputation
for investment management, indeed it had a portfolio of Pounds 1.15bn and
Pounds 20m in cash when it was taken over.
Wood, 51, has worked most of her life in the life assurance business,
starting out in the North American market - she spent ten years with
Manulife; she later moved to Cyprus and on to the UK where she became the
managing director.
She was apparently the personal choice of David Kingston, the group managing
director, to replace Sepel and Edmonton. Her appointment is a significant
departure for Irish Life, as she is the first woman to be appointed to a
senior executive position.
Wood says her new job 'will require a serious review of the UK operations
which will consider options of acquisition or disposal. There are distinct
possibilities of expansion elsewhere in Europe and I will be looking at
those, but the immediate task will be to get the three existing branches of
the (non-Irish European) business to deliver the goods.'
Around 15 per cent of the group's premiums are derived from its UK
subsidiary, but its market share is only around 0.5 per cent in the UK;
Dublin analysts believe that either an acquisition with a retail
distribution network for its life products needs to be made, or resources
should be released to expand elsewhere, such as in Norway and France.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Technology: A healthy dose of confidence - The biotechnology
sector is entering a more mature phase, better equipped to face market
hazards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of disappointments has wreaked havoc in the US biotechnology sector
over the past 18 months, but analysts say the industry may be on the
threshold of a new and more positive phase.
'The future is very bright,' says Jeffrey Swarz, biotechnology analyst at
First Boston, the US investment house, in New York. 'Wall Street hasn't yet
completely grasped this, but it is beginning to.'
The reason for such optimism is a recent spell of good news, which has
lifted the mood in the industry. Revenues for the sector were up by 20 per
cent in the first six months of 1993 according to a study by consultants
Ernst &amp; Young.
The late summer approval of Betaseron, the first new drug to treat multiple
sclerosis for a generation, boosted the stock price of Chiron, the US
biotechnology company which makes the drug for Schering, the German group
whose shares also shot ahead in Frankfurt on the news.
Genentech has also scored an important victory with the Food and Drug
Administration's advisory committee approval of DNase, a drug to treat
cystic fibrosis which works by breaking up the excess DNA that accumulates
in the lungs of sufferers. 'These approvals have restored some credibility
to the sector,' says Teena Lerner, a biotechnology analyst with Lehman
Brothers in New York.
Credibility with Wall Street is essential for the health of the
biotechnology industry, which requires large doses of investor confidence to
help it raise money for expensive and lengthy drug development.
The past 18 months have seen a severe drought in financing for the industry.
The sector has suffered several disappointments, which helped to depress
stock prices in 1992 and the early part of 1993. Last year, the FDA denied
approval for two septic shock drugs in the final stages of development -
Centocor's Centoxin and Synergen's Antril. And jitters over the
repercussions of President Bill Clinton's health plan have helped keep
prices low through much of 1993.
Despite the recent upturn in confidence, there is still concern that, in the
face of a hostile investment environment, the sector is trying to grow too
fast. The Ernst &amp; Young report pointed to the problems of fast-diminishing
cash reserves in the industry.
'The current financing environment is a limiting factor,' says Henri
Termeer, chairman of Genzyme Corporation. 'You can't keep offering new
products without the support of the financial markets.'
The need for new funds is far more acute at start-up companies than at the
more established companies. A handful of biotechnology groups - notably
Biogen, Genzyme, Genentech, Chiron and Amgen - have enough products on the
market to generate their own cash flow for research and development.
These are the groups most favourably viewed by Wall Street and with the most
ready access to financing. 'There seems to be more discrimination on the
part of investors between the large, more stable firms, and the rest of the
field,' says Lawrence Kurtz, spokesman for Chiron. 'There are less blanket
moves of all biotechnology stocks up and down.'
Historically, investors are unwilling to put up large amounts of money for
biotechnology. This has led to an increasing number of joint ventures
between large pharmaceutical and chemical groups.
The strategy has proved largely successful. Applied Immune Sciences
continued the trend earlier this year by forming an alliance with Rhone
Poulenc-Rorer.
'As long as financial markets are unable to supply biotechnology companies
with cash, they will turn to large pharmaceutical groups for investment,'
says Kirk Raab, president of Genentech.
Some observers worry that the lack of cash could hold longer-term
consequences for the sector, however. 'There is the danger of premature
consolidation in an industry that is inherently financially fragile,' says
James Vincent, chairman of Biogen.
Companies are hoping that the recent stock price surges in biotechnology
will be part of a longer-term optimism on the part of Wall Street.
Cash is becoming dangerously tight at many firms and a new willingness to
finance biotechnology research would ease the strain.
Analysts and industry players believe Wall Street now has a better
understanding of the drug approval process for biotechnology, and is
therefore better equipped to make wise investment decisions. 'Investors now
have a later time horizon and realise phase two studies may not be
predictive of success,' says Kurtz. 'This is good news, because it means
investors are less open to the kinds of disappointments that bring prices
down.
'People used to invest in biotechnology companies earlier than they should
have, based on premature claims on pending drugs. Now, the emphasis is more
on management, less on science and research.'
Raab agrees. 'Getting drugs to the market is a longer and harder process
than once believed,' he explains.
'Not all companies succeed and those that do need mature leadership. Success
depends on careful, thoughtful trials and working closely with the FDA.'
Investors worry that the number of protein drugs remaining to be discovered
is limited, a view vehemently denied by the biotechnology industry. 'The
pipeline for protein drugs is full, based on research we've already
conducted, and this will continue for some time,' says Raab. 'I think
proteins as drugs still have a lot of life. If anything is done on Aids or
cancer, for instance, I'm convinced it will be a large molecule drug.'
Despite continued enthusiasm for proteins, an increasing number of
biotechnology groups is diversifying into small molecule research, and this
is seen as a positive move by industry analysts. Since biotechnology
companies have a keen understanding of the interaction between small and
large molecules, they are thought to have an advantage over many
pharmaceutical groups in this area. Of particular importance is current
biotechnology research into the use of small molecules in controlling
inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and arthritis.
'Traditional pharmaceutical groups, which relied on organic chemistry, have
run into a wall,' says Swarz. 'They realise they should have gone into
biotechnology. The future is in proteins, and maybe in the kind of small
molecule and genetic engineering research that biotechnology firms are
getting into.'
The advent of gene therapy may prove an important development for
biotechnology, although few of the traditional biotechnology groups have
become involved in this area. Genzyme, with a strong commitment in gene
therapy, is a notable exception.
Excursions into new areas are thought to be a positive trend for the sector.
'To the extent that biotech groups become real companies with diversified
risk, they will be more positively viewed,' says Termeer.
The growing drug portfolios and increased diversification of the sector may
not completely erase the enormous risk involved in the industry.
Still, they may mark the beginning of a new, more mature phase for
biotechnology.
'I wouldn't say we're grown up yet,' says Raab. 'But we're certainly not
infants any more. I'd say we've entered our teenage years.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Newall, the institutional broker at Lehman Brothers whose City roots go
back 35 years, has been elected as the next Lord Mayor of London.
The front-runner in a field of four, Newall will be admitted as Lord Mayor
(subject only to the Queen's approbation, he emphasises) and will take up
residence in the newly-restored Mansion House on November 12.
Now 59, he was educated at Harrow and Magdalene College, Cambridge, before
launching his career at Cazenove. He was seconded to Durlacher as one of the
Stock Exchange's energetic 'blue buttons' but rose to become economist. In
the 1960s he moved to Wall Street, and became one of the few British members
of the NYSE.
Though Newall is in purdah until November 13, he did offer this reflection
on his election: 'I ran and ran and ran and look where I've ended up - Lord
Mayor of London.'

David Puttnam's success as a film producer is well documented; less well
known is his career as a non-executive director.
For more than 10 years he has been a director of Anglia Television and is
enthusiastic about his seat on the board of another media company - Village
Roadshow of Australia. Now he is to join the board of Chrysalis - the record
and television company where Chris Wright is chairman.
The film producer says he has joined up because he was interested in
learning about another part of the media world - records - and also perhaps
helping Chrysalis on strategic alliances; Puttnam (left) and Wright already
have a backer in common - the Japanese company Fujisankei. But Chrysalis
shareholders will no doubt be reassured to note that Puttnam says he has
absolutely no intention of taking the company into the film business.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Technology: Leap forward for fancy footwear - A pair of
machine-washable leather shoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Splashing through puddles in leather shoes is the delight of many a child
but the nightmare of many a parent. The leather usually dries hard and
cracked and the colour frequently fades.
But after years of research, tanners and footwear designers have discovered
a way of preventing shiny shoes from becoming shabby.
Newly emerging on shop shelves are leather or suede shoes which can be
popped into the washing machine with a cup-full of detergent with the weekly
wash. The shoes should re-appear clean and supple, and in perfect shape.
The biggest breakthrough in making machine-washable leather shoes has been
in the tanning process, says Steve Rose, head of upper materials testing at
Satra, the UK shoe industry's research association.
When the leather comes off the cow, the natural fats in the skin are removed
to prevent them going rancid, and a cocktail of oils and greases - some
natural, such as fish oil, some synthetic - are added.
The hides are then tanned using chrome salts, which keep the fats in the
leather. The problem with detergents is that they are alkaline, and would
normally cause the salts to detach and the fats to be washed away.
The latest tanning processes, the exact details of which are closely
guarded, use chemically reactive fats: they combine with the leather so that
they cannot be sluiced out. The technique is carried out by only a handful
of tanneries around the world, notably in the US and Korea.
The process means that rather than being water repellant, as might be
expected, the shoes use leather which wets very easily. 'When they come out
of the machine they are glutinous and swollen,' explains Rose.
Salz Leathers, of Santa Cruz, California, originally developed its washable
leathers for cycling gloves, explains sales manager Mike Mullins. 'We wanted
something that was very porous and would dry very quickly. Then we found
that we could wash it and that there was a much bigger market out there for
it.'
Designing machine-washable shoes presents further problems. On most
conventional shoes, the soles are stuck on with adhesive bonds which tend to
disintegrate in warm soapy solutions. For machine-washable footwear the
soles are made of PVC or polyurethane and injection-moulded on to the uppers
 -so the sole becomes its own adhesive. This largely determines the shoe
style: trainers or casual.
Metal fasteners also need to be avoided and the shoe-lining should be sewn
in rather than stuck using traditional glues.
Most mashine-washable leather or suede shoes are also white or light
coloured, as there are still some problems in making the colour fast if
darker dyes are used.
Once manufactured, samples of the shoes undergo rigorous testing. Mike
Fletcher, head of the Clarks test laboratory in Street, Somerset, says his
company, which also sells shoes under the 'K Shoes' brand name, gives the
shoes six thorough washes to test for durability.
The obvious appeal of the shoes seems to be translating into sales. Shoe
retailers, such as UK high street store Russell &amp; Bromley, which sells the
American Keds range of machine-washable ladies' casuals, reports brisk
sales.
Once purchased, Satra recommends that machine-washable leather shoes be
treated like delicate fabrics. They should be washed at 40`C and be stuffed
with tissue paper to help retain shape. And, Satra warns, they should not be
tumble-dried - or ironed.

British Telecommunications has played safe in its choice of a new finance
director, plumping for an accountant from inside the company.
Robert Brace, 43, moves to the top finance spot, with a seat on the BT
board, from the post of group controller - roughly equivalent to chief
accountant.
Brace joined BT four years ago as finance director of its UK division. He
was recruited from Black &amp; Decker, where he was vice president, business and
finance. Before that, he was Unipart's finance director, having moved into
industry from the then accountancy firm Peat Marwick Mitchell.
Brace's appointment follows the surprise departure of Barry Romeril, who

FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A firm belief in
reincarnation - The Design Council's new chairman claims reports of its
death have been exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The view from Utopia is that something very constructive has just happened
to the Design Council.
To the rest of the world it seemed last week that the 49-year-old body was
to be dismembered and buried, at least in its present form. The government
announced that it planned to integrate many of the council's functions into
the new Business Links network of service centres for smaller businesses.
But to John Sorrell, who takes over as chairman of the redesigned council in
January and whose consultancy Newell and Sorrell is based in the small north
London enclave of stylish businesses called Utopia Village, the
possibilities of reincarnation are immense.
'There's been too much talk of 'dismantling'. This is refocusing. It's
exactly what's happened with a large number of household-name British
industrial companies - they've refocused, restructured and they're stronger
than they were before.'
Sorrell, a former chairman of the Design Business Association, is chairman
of the design consultancy he founded with his wife Frances Newell in 1976.
Its principal business is corporate identity and the Automobile Association
and InterCity are two of its best-known clients.
Not that Sorrell will be spending all his time at Newell and Sorrell in the
coming months. He will be heading a review of all the Design Council's
activities with the aim of getting it into its new shape by the end of next
year.
His review will not, he says, be circumscribed by a new pre-set budget,
although it is widely thought that the government will cut the council's
grant from Pounds 7.5m to less than Pounds 3m.
'It's incredibly misleading to look at the effectiveness of the organisation
in terms of headcount and amounts of money,' he says. Instead, he will be
guided by the government's plan to deliver services through Business Links
wherever possible.
Sorrell is anxious not to be seen to be pre-empting the review. 'We
anticipate that the various information and advice services which are
currently available - such as the Design Advisory Service, the Materials
Information Service, the Consultancy Register, the Product Development
Advisory Centre - will need to be looked at in terms of their integration
into Business Links if ministers' strategy is to be followed,' he says.
Also under scrutiny are the council's magazines Design and Engineering, its
premises in Haymarket, London, and the design awards. The council's
acclaimed education work it is thought will continue to be carried out
centrally.
A significant problem for Sorrell to consider in these early stages lies in
transferring services to Business Links - only three of the 200-plus planned
Links have been forged.
Sorrell says: 'It would be an absolute disaster if there were disruption. If
certain services are to be transferred, then we'll do it very calmly, very
carefully.'
So what will the council be left with when the review is over? Tim
Sainsbury, Department of Trade and Industry minister, says it should be 'a
powerful voice for effective design, a bridge between industry and the
design community and a vital catalyst stimulating initiatives'.
If Sorrell pulls this off he may hold the blueprint for all small but
perfectly formed councils, quangos and worthy bodies in Utopia.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Realism slots on the
screen - Commercial casts are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone judging US society by its television commercials over the past 50
years would probably assume that most Americans are white, young, attractive
and vigorously healthy.
Lately, however, an increasing number of slots are presenting casts in a
more non-traditional light. Middle-aged women are seen touting fashion,
youths with Down's Syndrome appear in slots for McDonald's and Dow
Chemicals, and an all African-American cast sells Hallmark cards.
Not only do the newly diversified casts present a more realistic view of
American society, but they also sell products. 'Our slot featuring an
employee with Down's Syndrome has been very effective,' says Jane Hulbert, a
spokesperson for McDonald's.
In part, the new diversity reflects a greater awareness by advertisers of
their target audience.
'We just finished an all-black advertisement for the Atlanta market,' says
Cheryl Berman, executive vice president in charge of creative services for
the advertising agency Leo Burnett. 'Since Atlanta is a predominantly black
city, that made a lot of sense.'
Advertisers say mainstream Americans are also becoming more receptive to
non-traditional casts in commercials. 'Americans have become much more
sophisticated about accepting diversity in advertising,' says Gerard
Saviola, head of casting services for Grey Advertising in New York. 'They
see as positive what may once have turned them off.'
Heightened pressure from acting unions has something to do with the changes.
The Screen Actors Guild in New York, for instance, actively promotes the
casting of women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled in positive
roles.
'We've made a lot of progress, although certain things still remain largely
taboo, like showing families in inter-racial marriages,' says Elaine Brodey,
executive administrator of affirmative action for the Screen Actors Guild in
New York.
Advertising agencies say using non-traditional casts often makes for more
interesting commercials. A slot for Hallmark greetings cards, for instance,
features a surprise 100th birthday party for an African-American woman. The
story provides a twist, though, when the woman tells the driver that
although she already knows about the
party, she will pretend to be surprised.
Another spot for Dow Chemicals' Spray 'n Wash Stain Stick features a little
girl with Down's Syndrome.
'We use Stain Stick,' says the mother in the commercial, 'because the last
place we need another challenge is in the laundry room.'
The use of non-traditional casts can also reflect positively on the
companies trying to sell their products.
'A company which uses a disabled person, for instance, is often seen as more
caring, more sensitive than other companies,' says Berman. Still, the use of
non-traditional casts poses some problems - advertisers risk criticisms of
stereotyping.
'A lot of commercials use senior citizens as protagonists, but too often
it's in a negative light, showing them as hard of hearing, or not quite with
it,' says Saviola. 'We not only need more diversity, but we have to present
the diversity in a sophisticated way.'
The use of disabled people in commercials is probably the most
controversial. 'There's is always the danger of a backlash, or the danger
that you'll be accused of exploitation,' says Berman. 'It's a fine line you
have to tread.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'Tis the season for
Christmas cards - Why charities often get a bad deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summer is over, and it is time to choose the corporate Christmas card. But
companies should be warned: many of the old faithful designs have fallen
from grace.
Christ may have been born on Christmas day, yet in these multi-cultural
times less than 1 per cent of companies send cards depicting Christian
themes. Cartoons and any attempt at wit are also widely avoided.
Instead, the height of fashion in cards is an international theme, according
to card printer Almanac Gallery. A spherical fruit cake with a map of the
world on it, or a dove of peace are both trendy choices.
Cards with animals and a conservation message are also catching on, while
trusty corporate favourites such as London scenes and snowy landscapes are
as popular as
ever.
Almanac's market research shows that companies send out on average 400 cards
a year, and that chairmen, who order their Christmas cards separately, send
on average 150 each.
Larger companies and those in the service sector send out far more: one
company in the leisure market sent 50,000 cards last
year and a merchant bank sent 30,000.
However, the number of companies opting for charity christmas cards is
fairly low - just 8 per cent of the market.
Part of the problem for charities is that the print quality is sometimes
poor. Another more fundamental difficulty, especially for smaller ones, is
the expense of marketing the cards, which often leaves little profit after
sales.
Not all companies are potential buyers of charity cards: architects and
designers nearly always use the card to advertise their own talents while
banks like to commission their own. Accountants and solicitors tend not to
send out cards at
all.
Even with such groups excluded, the market has great promise. 'At least 70
per cent of the potential charity Christmas card market remains
undeveloped,' estimates Darryl Williams of Almanac.
In order to increase sales a charity must keep updating its mailing list,
even though it stands little possibility of building a solid customer base.
This is because companies normally decide to buy a charity card on the
strength of the card itself, not of the charity. This means that even if a
charity sells to a company one year, the chance of a repeat sale next year
is about one in 10.
Almanac believes it has come up with the perfect marketing solution that
will allow charities to sell their cards more cheaply. It has launched 'The
Christmas Collection', a catalogue devoted to cards from many different
charities. It features the requisite global christmas puddings and
snowscapes and represents a range of charities from household names like
Oxfam to more obscure charities like The Movement for Non-Mobile Children -
Whizz-Kidz.
All the cards are different, removing competition between charities based on
the picture design.
The idea is that one charity may lose this year's clients next year, but it
may pick up those clients lost by other charities.
To advertise in the catalogue, the charities pay only the printing and
distribution costs. The catalogue is effectively a clearing house for cards
and the charities receive all profits from sales.
So how does Almanac benefit? It hopes to persuade charities to choose
Almanac to print their cards. 'We are trying to create a climate where it is
not on if companies do not to send charity cards,' he says.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Arm-twisting allies win the day
in late show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the Labour traditionalist's traditionalist, and the
left-wing MSF white-collar union were the unlikely heroes of Mr John Smith's
victory.
A barnstorming speech by Mr Prescott, fast becoming the Labour conference's
Michael Heseltine in his ability to appeal to the party's grassroots, ended
in an urgent appeal to delegates.
He contrasted the modernisers within the party who blamed the unions for the
election defeat with the way Mr Smith had 'put his head on the block by
saying, 'I fervently believe in a strong relationship between the trade
unions and the Labour party'.'
His speech was the outward sign of frantic behind-the-scenes and last-minute
efforts by the leadership to win over as many delegates as possible by
arm-twisting and persuasion.
MPs with local parties against the change were told to ring their general
management committees back in the constituencies and put pressure on them,
while those with 'sound' constituency parties were told to talk to other
local parties or to the smaller unions.
The National Communications Union delegation met seven times and was
repeatedly lobbied by senior party members, including Mr Neil Kinnock, the
former party leader, before deciding that they would persist in their
opposition to the rule changes.
Mr Kinnock was among the most active figures, seeing delegates and putting
the argument for change loyally and effectively in a series of television
and radio interviews. Mr John Major must envy Mr Smith his predecessor.
But as late as lunchtime - after Mr Smith had made his speech - his aides
were saying that up to 250 constituency parties were undecided or proving
hard to pin down.
Then came the turning points, with the decision for Mr Prescott to wind up
the debate, and with a meeting of the MSF - which was already committed to
vote for the TGWU motion which the leadership opposed.
Away from the conference hall, at the supposedly secret location of the
Brighthelm community and civic centre, the delegation met and decided by
just two votes - 19 to 17 - not to cast their 4.5 per cent of the conference
vote against the rule change, but to abstain.
Ms Hilary Armstrong, Mr Smith's parliamentary aide and an MP sponsored by
the MSF, is credited with finding the way out for the leadership by
highlighting how the changes to parliamentary selection procedures would
affect women. The MSF's opposition to the change in the role of the unions,
was cancelled out by their support for its moves to increase the number of
women candidates.
It worked, but anger at the way in which the two issues had been linked
showed through in some of the speeches from delegates who felt
outmanoeuvred.
At the end of the debate, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, could
only watch as Mr Prescott won his second standing ovation of the conference.
She had lost any chance she might have had of making that speech by virtue
of her less than enthusiastic support for Mr Smith earlier in the week.
Talk in the corridors and bars turned quickly to speculation that Mr
Prescott would and should run for the deputy leadership next year.
Just before 6pm, after a day of impassioned argument, two voting procedures
and six different coloured ballot papers, to cheers and applause from most -
but not all - sections of the audience, the conference heard that the rule
change had been passed. Mr Smith's margin of victory on the key vote was
below 3.5 per cent - less than the size of the MSF vote.
It had been about an additional payment for union political levy payers of
just Pounds 3 a year, but it had also been about the leadership of the
party.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Rigid seat quotas for women are
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOTION calling on the party leadership to adopt a more rigid system of
quotas, with women-only shortlists in every Labour seat falling vacant, was
defeated.
But a resolution backing women-only shortlists in 50 per cent of seats
becoming vacant was carried.
Mr John Spellar, MP for Warley West, provoked an angry reaction from some
delegates when he spoke against quotas.
He said such a system would lead to the imposition of candidates on
constituencies by Labour headquarters, and warned the proposals would lead
to 'massive resentments and demoralisation in local parties.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Morris demands early
clarification of diverging votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS were divided last night in their immediate reaction to the
outcome of the crucial votes.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that the
party conference was 'facing three ways' after his union's
anti-one-member-one-vote motion was carried and he said he wanted the
national executive committee to clarify the position today.
He was delighted that his union's anti-one-member-one-vote composite motion
had been passed. 'I believe we have won the argument', said Mr Morris. 'The
vote for our composite is the clearest possible demonstration of support for
the trade union link.'
He called on the party's national executive committee to bring forward rule
changes this week that will 'embody the principles in the composite,
including continued trade union involvement in candidate selection'.
'The NEC has a responsibility to respond to the wishes of conference', said
Mr Morris. 'The various positions approved by conference today are clearly
contradictory. It is now the responsibility of the NEC to bring forward
proposals as to how the conference should proceed'.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said he would
not challenge one-member-one-vote. 'Democracy has expressed its vote.
One-member-one-vote will be introduced. I trust there will be no more
constitutional adventures. It was a great mistake to make the issue into a
constitutional battle. Its importance was misjudged.'
But Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AUEW engineering and electrical union,
said that he was delighted at the result. 'Mr Smith has won. Nothing else
matters', he said. 'He took on the might of the old left in the unions and
he beat them.'
A delegate from the MSF technical union, which made the crucial difference
to the outcome, said: 'All that counts is that the rule change was accepted.
The TGWU motion falls by the way'. Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the
RMT transport union said: 'It is great news for the leadership and the
movement.'
In the long, cumbersome debate, lasting most of the day, the union leaders
took up their predictable positions, knowing that the outcome was always on
a knife-edge.
Mr Edmonds told delegates the whole debate about one-member-one-vote had
been 'divisive and destructive'. He warned that 'it has been like an
iceberg. The little bit you see above the surface looks benign enough and
even flashes in the sunshine. But it is the nasty bit below the surface
which will do the damage. It will tear great chunks out of this party',
adding that 'this unwanted dispute has done great damage'.
The strongest trade union support for Mr Smith in the debate came from Mr
Jordan. 'The block vote is now this party's weakest link,' he told
delegates. 'We cannot attack privilege in society and let it hold power in
our own party.'
Strong opposition to one-member-one-vote came from Mr Tony Dubbins, general
secretary of the GPMU print union. He suggested it was 'arrogant rubbish'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: MSF's last-minute switch
secures rule change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE narrow victory on the vital rule change was clinched by a last-minute
switch by the MSF technical union.
The MSF vote, which went by 19 votes to 17 in favour of abstention, meant
that 4.5 per cent of the conference vote was not cast with the opponents of
Mr John Smith's one-member-one-vote reform.
That made all the difference as the card vote on rule change E - which
provides for a one-member-one-vote framework to be set up in constituencies
 -was passed by 47.5 per cent of the votes to 44.3 per cent.
Although the TGWU general union motion strongly opposing reform was also
narrowly passed - by 48.6 per cent to 48.4 per - the Labour leadership could
also take some comfort from the fact that a motion more favourable to
one-member-one-vote was passed with a slightly wider margin.
That motion, moved by the RMT transport union and the Nupe public services
union, was passed by 48.9 per cent to 48.1 per cent.
Another motion opposing one-member-one-vote, moved by the GMB general union,
was lost by 44.01 per cent to 53.1 per cent, largely because the MSF
supported the TGWU motion but voted against the GMB.
Although details of how unions and constituencies voted were not immediately
available it seems that on the crucial rule change a large number of
constituencies that had planned to vote against it decided to abstain after
the appeal from Mr John Prescott, transport spokesman.
Slightly over half of the constituencies appeared to vote in favour of rule
change E - representing about 17 per cent of the total vote - with slightly
less than half of the union vote representing about 30 per cent of the total
vote.
At the end of the series of votes, delegates had approved five rule changes
 -identified by the letters A to E - which will allow Mr Smith to implement
his democratisation plan.
Taken together, the rule changes mean that:
Parliamentary candidates will be selected by individual members voting by
single transferable vote in their constituencies, instead of jointly by
individuals and affiliated trade union branches. Union members who pay the
political levy will be able to vote if they pay a further fee of Pounds 3 to
join the party. Trade union branches retain the right to nominate
candidates.
The leader and deputy leader will be elected by an electoral college giving
a third of the votes to each of three groups - trade unions, members of the
Westminster and European parliaments, and individual members. Trade unions
had 40 per cent of the votes in the last election, with the balance split
equally between parliamentarians and constituency parties.
The union block vote in conference debates will be weakened by forcing
unions to split their votes between individual delegates. But unions will be
able to control delegates by mandating them in advance. The unions' 70 per
cent share of conference votes will be reduced to 50 per cent, but only if
party membership increases from 260,000 to 300,000.
The rule changes also allow a number of less controversial innovations,
including a cut in membership fees from Pounds 18 to Pounds 15, and
compulsory all-female candidate shortlists in 50 per cent of Labour held
seats that fall vacant. A resolution seeking greater black representation on
candidate shortlists was was defeated.

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Smith basks in close-run vote
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Mr John Smith said he was 'absolutely delighted' last night by
his victory over plans to modernise the party.
Immediately the outcome of the voting was announced, a beaming Mr Smith
shrugged off the narrowness of his victory and declared: 'It is a great day
for the Labour party.'
Asked to agree that with such a close margin he had courted disaster he
said: 'Yes. But I won.'
Mr Smith maintained that from time to time it was necessary to take
decisions that could not be put off.
It had been vital to carry forward the improvements in Labour's internal
democracy initiated by his predecessor, Mr Neil Kinnock.
Mr Smith called on Labour to put the controversy over its constitution
behind it and concentrate on the major issues of full employment, combating
cuts in the social services and fighting the government's proposals for
extending Value Added Tax.
Mr Smith also insisted that the approval given to the motion submitted by
the TGWU general workers' union should not be a cause for concern.
He said: 'The key vote was for the rule change and that has been clearly
carried.'
Before the crucial votes were taken Mr Smith had warned delegates that
defeat for the principle of one-member-one-vote would destroy the
credibility of Labour's radical agenda for constitutional change for the
country.
He insisted: 'As the party of change we must surely be able to change
ourselves.'
Mr Smith said that what millions of union members and party supporters all
over the country wanted above all else was a Labour government.
To sustained applause, he declared: 'As leader of our party, charged with
the responsibility to secure that victory, I say to this conference that the
changes I propose today are vital - absolutely central - to our strategy for
winning power. And I ask you to unite behind them.'
Only a few isolated hecklers challenged Mr Smith's claim that for some years
there had been growing agreement within the party about the need to
dismantle the block vote.
He stressed that trade unionists formed the majority of the new members in
constituency parties with the best recruiting record, describing this as
'proof positive that we are not proposing an increase in individual
membership at the expense of the trade unions'.
Mr Smith said one-member-one-vote already applied to the selection of
candidates for local-government elections.
Calling for the extension of of one-member-one-vote for the selection of
parliamentary candidates for Westminster, Mr Smith said: 'The principle is
clear, simple and democratic.
'All Labour party members should have equal rights to choose the party's
representatives.'
Mr Smith emphasised that what conference was being asked to decide did not
involve a choice between one-member-one-vote and a role for the trade
unions.
He said: 'It's the chance for more trade unionists than ever before to take
part in all the decisions and campaigns of the Labour party.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Necessary but not sufficient -
Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO HE WON. Just. At one minute to midnight enough unions and constituency
delegates stepped back from the abyss to give Mr John Smith a knife-edge
majority for his proposals to loosen Labour's institutional links with the
trades unions.
The vote could not have been closer. Victory came only after a day of
pleading, armtwisting and desperation not seen at a Labour conference for a
decade. For Mr Smith the result was no less important for that.
Most people are confused by the implications of a one-member-one-vote system
for the selection of Labour's parliamentary candidates.
Mr Smith, in his last-ditch plea to the conference, said it would actually
strengthen the union link. In words which will have been carefully noted at
Conservative Central Office he declared unequivocally: 'Let me make it clear
that as leader of the Labour party I am totally committed not only to
maintaining but to strengthening the vital links between our party and the
unions.'
Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds of the TGWU and GMB respectively said
that it was the beginning of the end. It was the thin edge of a wedge which
eventually would prise apart the Labour party and the unions which gave
birth to it.
Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds were closer to the truth. The process of separation
 -reflected also in less controversial decisions yesterday to reduce the
unions' voting power at annual conference and in election of the leader - is
probably unstoppable. It might, though, take yet another general election
defeat for it to come to fruition.
But the immediate significance of yesterday's vote lay not in the arcane
technicalities of the new voting system. Instead it was a question of Mr
Smith's personal authority. In the easy jargon of the headline writers the
issue was 'Who runs the Labour party?' Mr Smith does. The symbolism was
all-important. Last night he was looking forward to this morning's headlines
to convey that message to a wider world.
So the leader has received a significant boost. He was confronted by his
party's most powerful paymasters. He did not blink. Messrs Edmonds and
Morris must now find another way to secure a prominent place on the nightly
news bulletins.
But one-member-one-vote is not enough for Mr Smith. He set victory in
Brighton as the condition for defeat of the Conservatives at the next
general election. It was necessary but it was not sufficient.
There has been much else this week to depress those in the shadow cabinet
who have argued now through election defeats that it is not enough for
Labour simply to underpin the support of its natural supporters.
In the hall and on the fringe most of the speakers have been looking inward
 -addressing the 30 per cent of the electorate who will probably vote Labour
come what may. The other 10 or 15 per cent - the aspirant classes of
southern England who will decide the election, have been largely forgotten.
What, asked one of Mr Smith's senior colleagues, will the housewife in
Basingstoke have made of all this?
There are obvious explanations. Mr Smith's determination to win on
one-member-one-vote meant this was hardly the time to extol Labour as the
party of the public service consumer rather than of its trades union
producers. He needed the votes of Nupe and Cohse.
The disarray in Mr John Major's government has strengthened the voice of the
one-more-heave tendency in the party. Even sensible people who have seen
such dreams disappear in the ashes of the 1987 and 1992 defeats believe that
this time the Conservatives might really have a death wish.
But the delegates who cheered each time a speaker rose to the conference
rostrum to extol the virtues of Clause 4 public ownership, of union rights,
and of spending, taxing and borrowing had signed up, it seemed, to a new 'No
more heave tendency'. Others argued that a simple return to the
prescriptions (always referred to as the principles) of the past would be
enough. Mr Tony Benn has been deposed from the party's national executive
committee but his spirit lives on.
No one had the temerity to tell this conference that Labour needs the votes
of millions of people who would never dream of joining a union.
The Labour leader is impatient with analyses like this. He believes that
some of the party's so-called modernisers have lost sight of the need to
take their supporters with them. Foundations must be put in place, bricks
laid in careful rows.
He believes in the electoral force of the moral high ground, of leadership
that people can trust. He senses that the undoubted anger of the electorate
at unemployment, with insecure employment, with rising crime and with
hard-pressed public services can successfully be exploited.
He used his main speech to the conference to stake out that ground. It was
effective. He has the manner of a prime minister in waiting. With
one-member-one-vote out of the way he will begin to define his agenda.
Mr Gordon Brown resents suggestions that his decision this week to stress
the commitments to full employment and fair taxes mark an abandonment of his
post-election strategy of restoring Labour to fiscal responsibility. The
first two strands in the shadow chancellor's approach - that Labour wants
low inflation as well as higher growth and will never tax for the sake of it
 -have not been snapped. He has no intention of being drawn into debates
over whether Labour might raise this tax or that to pay for bill for better
public services.
But Mr Brown's careful path has diverged this week from that of Mr Tony
Blair, the most committed and determined of Labour's modernisers. The two
hitherto have been joined like Siamese twins. But watching Mr Blair tour the
Brighton fringe has been to see a politician frustrated by the complacency
of those around him. The shadow home secretary has decided, come what may,
to stand firm on the ground of modernisation. The question is whether Mr
Smith and Mr Brown will decide to join him.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Roads spending to focus on upgrades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW motorway routes through greenfield sites are largely 'a thing of the
past', Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told a Freight Transport
Association conference yesterday.
The government's roadbuilding programme was now largely concentrating on new
bypasses and improvements to the existing motorway and trunk road network,
he added. 'Our efforts are focused on getting the best from our
broadly-completed motorway network by widening and improving the roads that
are already there, and investing in technical improvements to help use it as
efficiently as possible.'
This reassurance came as the British Road Federation, which represents road
users, warned that any cuts in the roads budget could threaten 66,000 jobs.
The federation says 68 road schemes planned to start between April next year
and December 1995 depend on government funding due to be announced in the
November Budget.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Pools heir hopes to draw 100,000 to gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEIR to the Littlewoods pools empire yesterday announced plans to
develop an art gallery to rival the country's leading collections.
The gallery will be part of a new centre for exhibitions and the performing
arts.
Mr Peter Moores aims to open the gallery within five years at Compton
Verney, a mansion near Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. Mr Moores is a
son of Sir John Moores, the Littlewoods founder who died at the weekend.
The project is being overseen by the Peter Moores Foundation, a charity
which purchased the 18th century mansion last week for an undisclosed sum.
It was bought from Period &amp; Country Houses, the London-based restoration
company.
Foundation officials said that the purchase price, development costs and
budget set aside to expand Mr Moores' private art collection would run into
'several million pounds'.
Separately, another charity aims to build a Pounds 50m opera and ballet
house in the grounds of the estate pending a public inquiry and approval
from the Department of the Environment.
Stratford district council has already approved the scheme, which involves a
1,150-seat auditorium. If planning permission is also granted by the
department, the opera and ballet house would take two years to build and
would open in 1997.
Sir Kenneth Bradshaw, administrator of the Compton Verney Opera Project,
said yesterday the charity would seek backing from private and institutional
investors for the Pounds 40m construction and a Pounds 10m endowment fund to
underwrite running costs.
'This will be the UK's only purpose-built auditorium for both opera and
ballet, and together with the gallery it will be a remarkable arts centre
for the country,' Sir Kenneth said.
The Peter Moores Foundation said the costs of setting up the gallery would
be funded from Mr Moores' own resources.
More than 100,000 visitors a year are expected to visit the gallery when it
opens in the late 1990s.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Greenpeace fails to halt Thorp tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday failed in its High
Court attempt to stop British Nuclear Fuels completing uranium testing at
its Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
But in a second decision, greeted with relief by many environmental
campaigners, the judge ruled that Greenpeace was legally entitled to bring
its challenge, and was not just 'a meddlesome busybody'.
The local pressure group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment,
based near Sellafield, described the ruling as 'good news and bad news'. The
group was 'disappointed' that testing had been ruled legal, but it welcomed
the decision that Greenpeace's challenge was legitimate.
Mr Andrew Lees, director of Friends of the Earth, a pressure group which has
recently won leave to bring court actions about drinking water quality
against water companies, said that yesterday's decision on Greenpeace's
right to bring the action, was 'very important' for environmental
campaigners.
'BNF had the cheek to argue that organisations such as Greenpeace had no
right to go to court to try and protect the environment,' he said. 'But if
we did not, who represents the butterflies and frogs?'
Greenpeace, which argued that the testing prejudged the government's
decision whether to give the plant a licence to start full operation, is
considering an appeal against the decision to allow preliminary testing to
continue.
Mr Justice Otton ruled that nuclear industry regulatory authorities - the
Ministry of Agriculture and the pollution inspectorate - had acted
rationally and lawfully when they gave the go-ahead in August for testing.
Mr David Bonser, BNF's divisional director for Thorp, yesterday said: 'I am
very pleased that jobs have been safeguarded and that we can carry on with
the commissioning of Thorp.'
Thorp's future is now the subject of a public consultation, which ends on
October 4. A decision on whether the plant will get the go-ahead to start
full operation is expected later in the year.
Environmental groups' right to bring court actions has been challenged
before. In 1990, a court ruled that the Worldwide Fund for Nature did not
have 'sufficient interest' to apply for a judicial review against a decision
by Poole Borough Council in Dorset to build a housing estate on a heath,
home to several rare species.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Rifkind dismisses rearguard action to save Rosyth yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REARGUARD campaign in favour of Scotland's Rosyth naval dockyard foundered
yesterday when the government confirmed that it was to concentrate refitting
of nuclear submarines at the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth.
The announcement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, came after three
months of talks with unions, dockyard companies, MPs and private-sector
repairers.
'No new considerations have been put forward which would cause the
government to change its original proposal,' Mr Rifkind said.
The submarine work is worth up to Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years. The
decision to do it in upgraded facilities at Devonport was announced in June
after a two-year battle between the dockyards.
Rosyth can expect one contract to refit a Swiftsure class submarine before
losing this part of its business in 1996. In compensation, it has been
promised a work programme including refits of 18 warships up to 2005.
Babcock Thorn, which runs the government-owned yard, said it was seeking
firm guarantees for these contracts or alternative work. The announcement
came as no surprise as the yard had assumed the decision was unlikely to
change. It was confident the yard was still 'a solid and viable business'.
The decision paves the way for the next stage in dockyard privatisation. The
Ministry of Defence is expected in the next three or four months to issue
invitations to tender for the management and possible ownership of dockyard
facilities.
Management contracts with Babcock Thorn and Devonport Management were due to
expire next year, but have been extended.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Commercial property 'set for recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW MOOD of optimism has gripped lenders to the commercial property
industry, a survey shows today.
More than half of the banks and financial institutions questioned by
Chesterton Financial, the property advisers, and CSW, a property magazine,
expect to see an improvement in the market over the next six months, while
88 per cent are optimistic about prospects over the next 12 months.
The survey shows a striking rise in confidence, with optimists on prospects
for the next six months outweighing pessimists by 30 percentage points. In
January the pessimists outweighed optimists by 23 percentage points.
The survey is based on responses from 61 institutions, of which 52 per cent
were British, 18 per cent were from the rest of Europe, 12 per cent from
north America and 8 per cent from Japan.
Bankers are now more hopeful of a slowdown in the rate of receiverships, bad
debt provisions and loan covenant breaches. More than a third of the
institutions - compared with 23 per cent in January - said their property
loan books were in better shape than their overall loan books, The number
perceiving them to be worse fell from 43 per cent to 16 per cent.
Bankers are more optimistic about bad debt provisions, with 32 per cent
expecting a lower rate of provisions over the next 6 months compared with 13
per cent in January. For the full year just 15 per cent expect an increase
in bad debt provisions while half expect a fall.
The number of receiverships is also set to decline, with 62 per cent of
those surveyed expecting a decline over the 12-month period.
The number of borrowers who have breached their covenants has stabilised
over the past six months at 17.9 per cent compared with 18.6 per cent in
January.
Retail property was the most popular sector for new lending, being the first
choice for 71 per cent of institutions. Offices and industrial property were
the first choice for 16 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.
The west Midlands was the most popular region for lenders for the fourth
consecutive time, followed by the south-east. Chesterton said the increased
popularity of the south-east might be due to a growing feeling that its
economy was pulling out of the recession faster than other regions.
Chesterton warned, however, that the bankers' increased optimism would not
lead to a broad-based recovery until they were prepared to expand their
lending beyond top-quality properties.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Refunds to Kuwait probed: Inland Revenue focuses on Pounds
600m linked to BP investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has launched a formal investigation into whether Kuwait
should repay more than Pounds 600m in tax refunds which it received in
connection with its Dollars 1.7bn investment in British Petroleum. The
Revenue's international division will lead the investigation.
The Financial Times reported last week that the Gulf state may have abused
its sovereign immunity from taxation in relation to its purchase in the late
1980s of a stake close to 22 per cent in BP.
A UK government official said yesterday: 'The Revenue is investigating
allegations that sovereign immunity has been abused by Kuwait.'
He added that it would be impossible to judge how long the inquiry would
last. 'It depends on co-operation from the other side (the Kuwaitis)', he
said.
The Kuwait Investment Office, the emirate's international investment arm,
enjoys sovereign immunity from taxation on investments it makes on behalf of
the state fund, the Fund for Future Generations. These tax savings have been
worth more than Dollars 1bn annually in some years, according to tax
experts. The FT report said that Kuwait may have abused this immunity by
receiving more than Pounds 600m of refunds on the BP investment.
According to the testimony of a former senior Kuwaiti official, the
investment was made by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which is not
entitled to sovereign immunity even though it is state-owned because it is a
company set up by issuing shares.
After the BP shares had been bought, Kuwait told the Inland Revenue that
they been purchased by the KIO on behalf of the state investment fund.
The Kuwait Investment Authority, the government agency to which the KIO
reports, said during the weekend it would conduct its own review of the
'historical background' to the BP investment.
It also said it 'cannot accept the allegations made in the report of the
Financial Times' and that it 'never had the intention to mislead the British
authorities'.
The Inland Revenue will not be examining whether there should be changes to
the rules which give tax immunity to states or sovereigns making
investments. The question of whether the scope of sovereign immunity should
be narrowed is a matter for the government, not the Inland Revenue, the
government official said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / MMC to examine allocation of films
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISTRIBUTION of films to cinemas has been referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Sir Bryan said yesterday the Office of Fair Trading had decided to
investigate the industry after independent cinemas complained it was
difficult to obtain popular films from large distributors.
Independent cinema owners welcomed the inquiry, but large companies called
it unnecessary, saying the increase in multi-screen complexes and a sharp
rise in attendances meant consumers now had a wide choice of films.
Sir Bryan said the independent cinemas' difficulties had continued despite
changes which followed an MMC report in 1983. The report resulted in the
prohibition of 'barring', under which distributors decide in advance which
cinemas have the right to show films first.
Sir Bryan said: 'Most major companies are vertically integrated into the
production, distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas and follow
practices which could lead to the exclusion of independent producers,
distributors and exhibitors from the marketplace.
'I am aware of the changes that have taken place, such as the emergence of
multiplex cinemas, but I consider that competition remains restricted to
such an extent that it is appropriate for the MMC to undertake a fresh
investigation.'
Mr James Higgins, president of the Society of Film Distributors, said he was
confident the commission would find that distributors and cinemas were
providing consumers with greater choice than ever before. He said Pounds
500m had been invested in new cinemas over the past 10 years, a larger
amount than in any other country. Cinema admissions had increased from 52m
in 1984 to over 100m last year.
Mr Higgins said films were being distributed far more widely than at the
time of the last report. He said that a decade ago, 220 copies of ET had
been distributed to UK cinemas, which was then a record. He said 450 copies
of Jurassic Park, this year's blockbuster, had been distributed.
Mr Tony Kirkhope, managing director of the independent two-screen Metro
Cinema in central London, said he had difficulty obtaining US pictures.
'They don't offer them to us - only the dogs.' He said the large
distributors had 'made it amply clear they weren't going to deal with the
independents in the West End'.
Mr Geoffrey Henshaw, owner of the three-screen Cine City cinema in
Manchester, said small operators found large distributors' terms onerous. Mr
Henshaw said distributors insisted that cinemas show their films for three
weeks, regardless of how well or badly they were doing.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Fears for coal's long-term prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOEVER buys British Coal will only have four years to make most of their
money out of next year's privatisation, the corporation's former director of
economics says in a study of coal prospects.
Mr Mike Parker says the pressures on the industry are such that its
long-term prospects are in doubt. British Coal's core business depends
almost entirely on its contracts to supply the electricity generation
industry. When these expire in 1998, the business becomes 'very risky'
because the final stage in deregulation of the electricity market that year
will encourage a switch to short-term contracts.
The report, published by Oxford Economic Research Associates, forecasts that
coal-fired capacity will fall from 30GW to between 6GW and 14GW by 2005.
Deep-mined coal output that year will be no more than 20m tonnes, falling to
10m in 2010.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Devonshire Names to sue over Pounds 154m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the loss-making Devonshire underwriting syndicates at the Lloyd's
of London insurance market voted yesterday to sue their members' and
managing agents for compensation. Losses to date on five syndicates are
Pounds 154m, Andrew Jack writes.
About 1,500 Names - individuals whose assets underwrite the market - on the
Devonshire Names Action Group supported calls for litigation for negligence
against their advisers for the 1989 and 1990 underwriting years. The Names
have still to decide whether to sue their brokers and auditors.
The group said the move was a precaution in case a Lloyd's attempt to settle
disputes with loss-making Names out of court was not satisfactory.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Press white paper set for further delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has delayed a white paper on privacy and the press amid
disagreements among ministers and a growing realisation of the complexity of
issues involved.
The National Heritage Department first promised a white paper before the
summer recess, then suggested that the document, expected to propose a
'voluntary' ombudsman in addition to the industry's Press Complaints
Commission, would come during the recess.
The most recent hope was that Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary,
would make an announcement at next week's Conservative conference in
Blackpool where a number of motions on the press have been submitted.
The heritage department said Mr Brooke had written to Mr Gerald Kaufman,
chairman of the Commons national heritage committee admitting the government
response to its report on the subject would be delayed. It is likely there
will not be a white paper until next year. Mr Brooke has decided to wait
until responses to the Lord Chancellor's privacy green paper have been
assessed. Responses must be in by October 15.
Ms Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the World and a former complaints
commission member, said: 'I think the truth is that there are no complaints
about newspapers. The commission is hard-pressed to find complaints from
readers, and really it's politicians who are concerned about privacy and the
press, not the ordinary public.'
The Lord Chancellor's office has proposed a law giving citizens the right to
sue for up to Pounds 10,000 in damages for invasion of privacy.
The delay also means that new criminal offences covering electronic
eavesdropping and the taking of pictures on private property are unlikely to
be included in the Criminal Justice Bill. There have been problems of
definition and arguments over whether there should be a defence of public
interest in the offences.
Lord McGregor, chairman of the complaints commission, and other commission
members have said they will resign if an ombudsman is appointed.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Warning on photocopier lease 'ruses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS evidence of 'unacceptable practices' in the photocopier leasing
market, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Fair Trading, said
yesterday. He called on the industry to reform itself, warning that he would
take direct action otherwise.
Sir Bryan's remarks follow widespread complaints in the past year about
contracts issued by some photocopier dealers, which are alleged to involve
customers in hidden costs and enormous cancellation fees. An Office of Fair
Trading investigation into the office equipment leasing market was launched
in February.
Sir Bryan said the OFT report, which is expected late next month, 'will
illustrate the seriousness and variety of the malpractices and excesses that
have occurred'.
He said some of the main sufferers had been small businesses, solicitors,
accountants, schools and housing associations. 'Some of these have found
themselves facing five or even six-figure bills to extricate themselves from
contracts.'
Sir Bryan said there were various steps he could take to stop abuses. These
included a reference of the photocopier leasing industry to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, and revocation of individual licences.
However, he said, there were signs of change in the industry. 'I hope . . .
that this will be sufficient to make the market work well without regulatory
intervention.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Birmingham airport seeks private cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM International Airport, Britain's fifth largest, is seeking up to
Pounds 400m of private-sector investment to fund expansion over the next 10
years, its local-authority owners said yesterday.
Meanwhile the High Court has ruled as unlawful proposals by the government
to increase the number of night flights at London airports including
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
The seven local authorities which own Birmingham airport said improvements
to the terminal and runway could create up to 11,000 jobs in the region.
Investors will be offered an equity stake in the airport. Local authority
leaders, however, said the move did not signal a move to privatisation.
Raising the necessary capital will depend on approval from Mr John McGregor,
transport secretary, who is being asked to meet Midlands councillors to
discuss their demands for a relaxation of public-sector spending rules.
Mr Fred Hunt, leader of Dudley Borough Council, said the authorities
envisaged a partnership between the public and private sectors enabling
Birmingham to keep pace with its main regional rival at Manchester.
Detailed proposals on raising the finance, setting out options for investors
such as preference shares or long-term debt, will be published next year. If
approved, construction work could begin in 1997.
The court decision yesterday on night flights at London airports is a blow
to the government and to BAA, the privatised airports operator, which wanted
more flexibility for aircraft movements at Heathrow.
The government was planning to introduce a new quota system for night
flights based on the noise performance of aircraft to replace the current
system based on a specific number of aircraft movements.
The proposals faced fierce opposition from local authorities near the
airports worried that the new rules would sharply increase the number of
night flights.
Mr Justice Laws yesterday granted the councils a declaration that the
proposed new noise regulations were not authorised by the 1982 Civil
Aviation Act. He also ordered the government to pay 25 per cent of the legal
costs incurred by the councils. They include Richmond and Hillingdon in
London, Tandridge in Surrey, and Windsor and Maidenhead as well as Slough
councils in Berkshire. British Aerospace has applied for planning permission
to develop its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, as a commercial airport.
The proposal is highly controversial because several thousand houses have
been built in recent years near the airfield. It also threatens the
viability of Bristol's existing airport south of the city.
BAe said it needs to make better use of the airfield to protect the future
of its Filton plant, the largest local private-sector employer.
BAe says in its planning application that it would restrict air traffic
movements to 23,000 a year, and night-time movements to 20 a night. It says
the terminal building would limit passengers to 350,000 a year.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Clarke faces chorus of opposition to tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders, retailers, and MPs united yesterday to warn that extending
indirect taxes could be disastrous for consumers, industry and the
government.
Their comments followed remarks by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on
Monday in which he clearly hinted that any tax increases in the Budget would
be on spending rather than incomes.
But Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, said that, while the British economy was growing, 'recovery is
patchy and still fragile. We need a Budget for investment.'
The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of UK retailers,
has written to Mr Clarke and says it is 'completely opposed to any extension
of the VAT base'.
Many retailers, including Argos and Sears, have warned that increases could
damage consumer spending. They also fear that the move of the Budget to
November could devastate Christmas trading.
Extending VAT onto exempt products such as children's clothing, basic foods,
and books was seen as highly emotive.
'VAT on children's clothes is nothing less than a tax on the growth of our
children, and that is immoral,' said Mr Bryan Green, executive director of
the National Childrenswear Association, representing manufacturers and
retailers.
Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director of Asda, said: 'I can't believe
Mr Clarke would want to be remembered as the man who put tax on a bottle of
milk.'
Mr Tim Godfrey of the Booksellers Association warned that imposing VAT on
books would be a tax on reading. 'Economists predict consumer sales of books
would fall by at least 15 per cent. That would mean there would be fewer
books around, fewer books in the home, and standards of literacy would
deteriorate.'
Booksellers and publishers have launched the Books Add Value campaign to
lobby MPs in the next few weeks .
Increases in excise duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol were also strongly
opposed. Mr John Cryne, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale,
called for members to write to MPs demanding a cut in beer duty. He says
duty has risen 37 per cent since 1979, while consumption has fallen 15 per
cent.
'Britain's beer drinkers are being hammered into the ground by tax rates
that threaten the future of breweries and pubs,' he said.
The chancellor's comments sparked an immediate reaction from rightwing
Conservative MPs.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said higher taxation would be
absolutely devastating for the Conservative party. 'The way to deal with
this problem is not by more taxation but by the government cutting public
spending in Whitehall and the town halls.'
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said increasing taxes would be 'a
breach of faith with the British public.'
Lord Howe, the former Conservative chancellor who raised VAT to 15 per cent
in his first Budget, said it was 'right in principle to prefer taxes on
expenditure to taxes on income'. But he added: 'When you begin putting it
into practice, it becomes a great deal less popular and a great deal more
difficult.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Portillo stresses need for incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, chief Treasury secretary, last night gave a fresh hint
that the government was disinclined to raise income tax or corporation tax
in the November Budget.
In a speech focusing on declining European competitiveness, Mr Portillo
argued that low rates of both these taxes acted as an important lure for
mobile entrepreneurial talent and investment capital.
The EC was pricing its workers out of jobs by putting too little emphasis on
productivity, profitability and labour market flexibility and too much on
welfare, he warned.
Mr Portillo urged member states to reform their social security systems 'not
only to contain growth in costs to a sustainable level but to give people
greater incentives to work and save'.
His remarks came within 24 hours of Mr Kenneth Clarke's hint that any Budget
tax increases would be on spending rather than incomes.

FT  30 SEP 93 / VAT on fuel 'will cut energy use'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUTTING value added tax on domestic fuel will reduce household use of energy
by 6 per cent, a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies says today.
It says the impact will be felt most heavily by low-income households, which
spend a higher-than-average proportion of their income on fuel. The poorest
20 per cent of households will cut energy consumption by 9 per cent but
still face increases in energy costs of 2 per cent of their total spending.
For average households, the extra tax will be about 1.1 per cent of their
total spending.
The government needs to spend an extra Pounds 430m on social security
benefits next year to compensate for the tax increase, the institute says.
The tax, which was announced in the March Budget, has created a political
row that is likely to dominate next week's Conservative conference. VAT will
be charged on domestic fuel at 8 per cent from April next year and at 17.5
per cent a year later.
Increased fuel prices will eventually feed through into higher social
security benefits through the annual indexation process, but the institute
says that indexation - based on average households - is likely to be less
than the poorest families need to cover their increase in fuel bills. It
will also come through a year after the charges are imposed.
The institute recommends bringing forward the indexation of benefits in the
first year, so that benefits rise at the time VAT is imposed - this would
cost Pounds 330m in 1994-95. It also recommends additional help for
pensioners to recognise the importance of heating bills in the budgets of
the elderly. Adjustments to means-tested benefits to double the compensation
paid to the elderly would cost Pounds 100m.
Although the measure has been taken largely to boost tax revenues, the
government has stressed the environmental benefits of the tax in lower
energy consumption.
The institute says VAT 'would be less efficient at restraining carbon
dioxide emissions' from burning fuel than the carbon tax proposed by the
European Commission.
A MORI opinion poll in The Times today says that 92 per cent of all voters
and 83 per cent of Tory voters are against the imposition of VAT on domestic
fuel. A total of 94 per cent of all voters oppose VAT on children's clothes
and 80 per cent VAT on books.

FT  30 SEP 93 / CBI urges small-business aid to encourage investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY should emphasise the needs of smaller businesses when drawing
up its Budget strategy, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday.
The CBI wants tax allowances to encourage more small manufacturers to invest
in buildings and machinery. It also wants tax relief for cash injections
into unquoted companies, through a form of the business expansion scheme.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said tax increases in the Budget
should be avoided, on the grounds that the recovery was still fragile.
He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reduce public spending by
Pounds 10bn by 1996-97 as a way of limiting public borrowing - expected to
reach Pounds 50bn this financial year.
Mr Davies will meet Mr Clarke next month to discuss the Budget proposals.
The CBI is emphasising the need to give companies extra incentives to invest
so that industry is in a better position to meet higher demand in the 1990s.
It wants a continuation of the temporary rules under which 40 per cent of
spending on investment qualifies for tax relief. Under existing Treasury
proposals, from the end of next month the proportion which can be written
off against tax is due to drop back to the normal 25 per cent.
The CBI also wants all investment up to Pounds 200,000 to be eligible for
relief.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Criminal case over Hoover ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING standards officials yesterday ruled out criminal action against
Hoover over its free-flights offer, but criticised the company for failing
to foresee that the scheme would go so badly wrong.
Mid-Glamorgan trading standards department, which has received almost 2,000
complaints, said it had received legal advice that there were no grounds for
prosecuting the company under the Trade Descriptions Act.
The department said criminal action could be brought only if Hoover could be
shown to have known in advance that its statements about the free flights
were false and if it was criminally careless.
It said that while Hoover might be accused of miscalculating the take-up of
its offer, there was no evidence that the company had set out to deceive or
defraud customers.
The department said it was calling on the Department of Trade and Industry
to review the Trade Descriptions Act.
The department, which conducted its investigation on behalf of trading
standards authorities throughout the country, said Hoover customers who had
not received free flights to which they believed they were entitled could
still take civil action.
Hoover said it was pleased by the department's decision.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Printing employers divided on pay change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINTING employers are divided over whether there should be a return to
national wage bargaining in the industry next year.
After widespread but inconclusive consultation with its 2,600 affiliated
member companies, the British Printing Industries Federation has decided to
hold talks with the GPMU print union over the future of the national
agreement which was suspended this year.
Mr Tony Dubbins, the union's general secretary, welcomed the invitation to
talks yesterday and he stressed this would be without conditions on the
union's side.
The leadership of the employers' federation made clear in recent months that
it wanted to scrap the national agreement for pay while retaining it for
other issues such as training, resolving disputes and health and safety.
Mr Andrew Brown, the federation's employee relations director, said
yesterday that opinions over a return to national bargaining were 'evenly
balanced' among companies. 'There is no definitive position either way - no
clear indication of what to do,' he said.
He added that, if national bargaining returned, the union would have to make
a 'positive response' to the needs of employers who want to introduce
greater flexibility into pay deals and achieve a low-cost agreement.
The union has threatened to withdraw from all its national agreements with
printing employers if industry-wide bargaining is scrapped.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Players' assets ignored in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH FOOTBALL clubs would add more than Pounds 250m to their assets if
they included the value of their players in their accounts, a survey by
accountants Touche Ross said yesterday.
Only four clubs showed the players' value on their balance sheet as an
intangible asset, in spite of the substantial sums paid for transfer fees,
the survey showed.
In the 1991-92 season - the latest for which figures are available - English
football league clubs spent almost Pounds 75m on players. The first division
 -now the FA Carling Premiership - spent Pounds 70m, up from Pounds 40m the
previous year.
Blackburn Rovers spent the largest net amount on transfers - Pounds 6.84m in
the year.
The survey covered the accounts of 84 clubs. It showed that 53 of the clubs
reported pre-tax losses.
In addition 27 clubs had their accounts qualified by their auditors over
worries that they might not be 'going concerns' in the future.
But the survey said that far fewer clubs would show such poor apparent
results if they treated transfer fees as investments rather than expenditure
written off directly to the profit-and-loss account.
Derby County, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Tottenham Hotspur put
estimates of their players' worth on the balance sheet. A further nine clubs
disclosed the aggregate value of the playing squad in notes to the accounts.
Just one club - Manchester United - has obtained an independent valuation to
assess the worth of its players. That was conducted by Touche Ross.

during the slack winter season.
The company's Pounds 15m promotion doubles the benefits of its Frequent
Flyer programme for the next six months. Passengers buying full-price
tickets in any class will get double 'air miles' towards free tickets.
Passengers must say by the end of March where they want to fly. The time
limit for taking the flight varies according to the country of residence of
the traveller.
The UK's other scheduled long-haul carrier, Virgin Atlantic Airways, will
soon announce its own incentives. This will include new ways of collecting
Frequent Flyer points. There are links with American Express, Air New
Zealand, British Midland and Scandinavian Airline System.
Virgin and American Express will spend Pounds 3m on a promotional programme
and the airline plans to announce several more partners.
United Airlines, one of the biggest US carriers, is preparing direct
mailshots offering bonus points for trips this winter, while Japan Air Lines
is already four weeks into a double-points promotion.
BA's promotion differs from many others because it forces travellers to
specify their free destination.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Night flights plan ruled unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday ruled as unlawful proposals by the government to
increase the number of night flights at London airports including Heathrow,
Gatwick and Stansted.
The decision is a blow to the government and to BAA, the privatised airports
operator, which wanted more flexibility for aircraft movements at Heathrow.
The government was planning to introduce a new quota system for night
flights based on the noise performance of aircraft to replace the current
system based on a specific number of aircraft movements.
The proposals faced fierce opposition from local authorities near the
airports worried that the new rules would increase the number of night
flights sharply.
Mr Justice Laws yesterday granted the councils a declaration that the
proposed new noise regulations were not authorised by the 1982 Civil
Aviation Act. He also ordered the government to pay 25 per cent of the legal
costs incurred by the councils. They include Richmond and Hillingdon in
London, Tandridge in Surrey, and Windsor and Maidenhead as well as Slough
councils in Berkshire and the London borough of Hillingdon.
The judge said: 'The truth is that the concept of a maximum number of
movements has in practical fact no part to play in the secretary of state's
proposal, yet it must - under the act - be the linchpin of any order made.'
Meanwhile, Birmingham International Airport, Britain's fifth-largest, is
seeking up to Pounds 400m of private-sector investment to fund expansion
over the next 10 years, its local-authority owners said yesterday.
Investors will be offered an equity stake in the airport. Local authority
leaders, however, said the move did not signal a move to privatisation.
Mr Fred Hunt, leader of Dudley Borough Council, said the seven local
authorities which own the airport envisaged a partnership between the public
and private sectors enabling Birmingham to keep pace with its main regional
rival at Manchester.
Detailed proposals on raising the finance, setting out options for investors
such as preference shares or long-term debt, will be published next year. If
approved, construction work could begin in 1997.
British Aerospace has applied for planning permission to develop its
airfield at Filton, north Bristol, as a commercial airport running scheduled
services. It said it needs to make better use of the airfield to protect the
future of the plant.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Action against Hoover ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING standards officials yesterday ruled out criminal action against
Hoover over its disastrous free-flights offer, but criticised the company
for failing to foresee that the scheme would go so badly wrong.
Mid-Glamorgan trading standards department, which has received almost 2,000
complaints from Hoover customers, said it had received legal advice that
there were no grounds for prosecuting the company under the Trade
Descriptions Act.
The department, which has spent six months investigating the offer, said
criminal action could be brought only if Hoover could be shown to have known
in advance that its statements about the free flights were false and if it
was criminally careless.
It said that while Hoover might be accused of 'extreme gullibility' for
miscalculating the likely take-up of its offer, there was no evidence that
the company had set out to deceive or defraud customers.
The department said it was calling on the Department of Trade and Industry
to review the Trade Descriptions Act, which had not kept up with advances in
technology and marketing techniques.
The department, which conducted its investigation on behalf of trading
standards authorities throughout the country, said Hoover customers who had
not received free flights to which they believed they were entitled could
still take civil action.
The Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, which claims to represent 1,600
dissatisfied customers, said yesterday that about 40 actions were pending in
small claims courts.
Hoover said it was pleased by the department's decision. It said 103,000
people had so far flown under the free-flights scheme and that about 12,500
tickets were being issued every month. It would not say how many
applications remained to be dealt with.

FT  30 SEP 93 / West country finds a united trade voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARTNERSHIP of the public and private sectors in Devon and Cornwall was
launched yesterday to promote the economic interests of south-west England.
The Westcountry Development Corporation, whose chief executive is Mr Mike
Boxall, aims to provide a forum for a co-ordinated economic strategy. A
similar body, the Western Development Partnership, was set up this summer
for the county of Avon. The two groups reflect a growing belief among
business and political leaders in south-west England that the region has
suffered from the lack of a united voice.
Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the WDC and managing director of Dartington
Crystal, said the WDC's aim was 'to generate long-term sustainable
prosperity'. It sought to create jobs, increase income levels, promote
established industries and attract inward investment.
The WDC will also pump-prime projects designed to stimulate the local
economy and lobby the government and European Commission on such issues as
regional aid.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said yesterday he would announce within
the next few weeks the UK government's proposed new map for EC structural
funds. 'It could mean good news for the two counties,' he said.
Devon and Cornwall have suffered from declining trends in agriculture,
fishing, tourism and the defence industry. Cornwall in particular has a high
unemployment rate and the gross domestic product per head is only 76 per
cent of the UK average.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Recession hits tax revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION helped push tax revenues down to the lowest levels for five
years in 1992-93, the Inland Revenue said yesterday.
Receipts from compliance and the number of successful prosecutions also
fell, while bad debts, tax written off and costs as a proportion of tax
collected rose.
Net receipts fell to Pounds 76.1bn in the 12 months to March this year
against Pounds 79.7bn last year, the Revenue's annual report showed. That
included net receipts from income tax of Pounds 56.5bn and from corporation
tax of Pounds 16bn.
The Revenue said the decline had been caused by falling income and profits
as a result of the recession and tax changes introduced in the last Budget.
Sir Anthony Battishill, Revenue chairman, said in his foreword to the
report: 'Staff in tax offices achieved the best recorded overall results for
their annual cycle of work and performed extremely well against targets
which measure their service to the tax-paying public.'
Total income from compliance work - including investigations against tax
evasion and avoidance - also fell, to Pounds 4.6bn from Pounds 4.9bn. The
proportion of collectable assessed tax which was collected fell from 87 per
cent to 86.7 per cent as a result of poorer debt collection rates.
The Revenue's expenses fell slightly to Pounds 1.6bn, but the reduction was
not sufficient to offset the decline in tax revenues. As a result, costs as
a proportion of total tax yield rose to the highest level in the past
decade, at 2.09 per cent compared with 2.06 per cent last year.
The amount of tax written off as irrecoverable almost doubled to Pounds
1.7bn last year, from Pounds 884m in 1991. This included Pounds 1.1bn in
unpaid income tax and Pounds 542m in corporation tax.
The number of people convicted in criminal proceedings brought by the
Revenue fell to 217, the lowest level in more than five years, while those
acquitted rose to 14.
Most of the Revenue's offices achieved their performance targets. The
results of an opinion poll in the report show that taxpayers' top priorities
are getting their tax right first time, clear explanations and good general
information. Two thirds said they were satisfied overall with the service
they received.
Seventeen tax inquiry centres experimented with extended opening hours
during the year as part of the Revenue's attempts to restructure.
Nearly 1,500 of the Revenue's tax forms were reviewed during the year
against a target of 1,000 in an attempt to make them clearer.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Gatt 'to boost world income by Dollars
213bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation would add Dollars 213bn (Pounds 138.3bn) a year to world
income by the year 2002, according to a four-year joint study by the World
Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
released this week at the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in Washington.
The lion's share of these gains - about Dollars 190bn - would come from the
Uruguay Round's proposed 30 per cent cut in tariffs and subsidies for
agriculture.
The remaining Dollars 23bn would come from average 30 per cent cuts in
tariffs on industrial products.
By highlighting the gains that would come from reform of farm trade, the
report throws the gauntlet down in front of France in particular, whose
government has threatened to block agreement on the Uruguay Round unless its
interests as a leading exporter of subsidised farm goods are better
protected.
The report's authors insist the findings present a conservative estimate of
potential gains from trade reform. They take no account of gains from
liberalisation of trade in services. Nor do they take account of the
'downside risk' of trade conflict if the Uruguay Round talks fail.
The study also emphasises that the Uruguay Round amounts to no more than
partial reform of the distortions linked with protectionism. 'If all trade
distortions stemming from subsidies and tariffs were completely removed in
all regions, we estimate the total (annual) gains in the year 2002 would
measure Dollars 477bn,' said Mr Ian Goldin, senior economist at the World
Bank, and co-author of the report.
Mr Goldin notes that the largest income gains would occur in regions with
the largest distortions - notably the EC, the European Free Trade
Association countries of Norway, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Iceland and
Swizerland plus Japan, and the Asean grouping of Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.
Losers, in contrast, would mostly be poor net food importers, in particular
those in sub-Saharan Africa.
The study praises the 'remarkable courage' of developing countries, whose
recent commitment to painful economic liberalisation 'is now threatened by
the failure of the industrialised countries to take reciprocal measures'.
It highlights the contradiction that industrial countries are those blocking
successful completion of the Uruguay Round, even though it is these same
countries that stand to gain most from reform.
Of the Dollars 190bn that would be gained from reform of farm trade, the
study finds that Dollars 120bn would be reaped by OECD countries. In
addition, 64 per cent of the gains from tariff cuts in manufactures trade
would go to OECD countries. Almost all gains from liberalisation of services
would go to the OECD.
The report also attacks the alliance forged between environmental lobbies
and protectionists, arguing that it is protection, not free trade, which
endangers the environment - especially in agriculture.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Brussels set to accuse US over Saudi air
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is expected to accuse the US next week of breaching
international trade agreements to secure for US manufacturers a Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.96bn) order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian
airline, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent.
EC trade negotiators are expected to lodge a complaint with US trade
representatives at a meeting in Washington next week, claiming that the US
has broken last year's Gatt civil aircraft accord by offering Saudi Arabia
special inducements to acquire US rather than European Airbus airliners. Mr
Jean Pierson, chief executive of the European Airbus consortium, is
understood to have written to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner,
to alert him of a visit to Saudi Arabia by Mr Federico Pena, the US
transportation secretary, at the end of this week.
Mr Pena is going to Saudi Arabia today, together with Mr David Hinson,
administrator of the US Federal Aviation Administration, to sign a new
bilateral aviation agreement between the two countries. He is also expected
to discuss with Saudi officials the imminent Saudia aircraft order.
The EC is worried that the US is exerting political pressure on the Saudi
government to award the lion's share of the Dollars 6bn aircraft order to US
manufacturers, including Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
The US Export-Import Bank has already announced it would provide loan
guarantees to finance purchase of US airliners.
In his letter, Mr Pierson drew Sir Leon's attention to the risk of the US
trying to link the new aviation agreement with a Saudia order for US-made
aircraft, according to EC trade sources.
'The opportunity of linkage of the two issues is self-evident,' Mr Pierson
wrote. In turn, this would breach article 4 of the Gatt civil aircraft code
which stipulates that governments should not 'exert unreasonable pressure'
to support their manufacturers to win export orders.
The award of airline landing and route rights is included in the Gatt list
of prohibited inducements.
The EC complaint coincides with a concerted campaign launched this week by
British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France, the three
leading European aerospace companies in the Airbus consortium, against what
they claim are US efforts to undermine the Gatt aircraft agreement.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan to import at least 1m tonnes of rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, said yesterday the country
will be forced to import rice after typhoons and an unusually cold summer
left production an estimated 20 per cent below the average annual harvest.
But the government insisted that the decision was a once-only response to a
poor harvest, and other countries should not take the imports as a sign that
the firmly closed Japanese rice market is now open.
Agriculture Ministry officials indicated that over 1m tonnes of rice would
be imported, about two thirds of the amount for consumption at Japanese
tables and the remaining third for use in processed foods.
It is expected that the US and Australia will be the leading contenders to
supply the table rice, while Thailand and Vietnam were suggested as the most
likely suppliers of rice for crackers and other processed foods.
Japan has resisted attempts to open the rice market as part of a settlement
in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, though the country
is expected to open the market if the US and EC reach agreement on farm
trade.
Mr Hosokawa has indicated that he would be willing to allow imports, but has
also insisted that rice is not the issue holding back the Uruguay Round.
If he does push for an opening, the prime minister will have to overcome the
opposition of rice farmers and the Social Democratic party, one of the seven
members of his coalition government.
At 1m tonnes, the imports would be equal to about 10 per cent of average
annual Japanese output, though government officials have privately suggested
that, if the market is opened in the future, the initial ceiling on imports
would be between 3 and 5 per cent.
The government is due to announce the rice harvest index today, but
officials have suggested it will be about 80, compared with the 100 of an
average year, while the index in Aomori prefecture, in the north, is said to
have slipped to 32.

FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay deadline seen as last chance - A
new, almost palpable sense of urgency over liberalisation talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEADLINES in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks have come and
gone. But this time there is a new and almost palpable sense of urgency
among negotiators in Geneva to wrap up the seven-year-old talks by December
15, when the US administration's negotiating authority runs out.
'December 15 is the agreed deadline for the deal to be done,' Mr Peter
Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
told finance ministers on the International Monetary Fund's policy-making
interim committee at the weekend. 'I can see no possibility whatsoever of
another chance.'
Mr Sutherland has set the 116 nations taking part in the Round a demanding
timetable for each remaining stage of the negotiations. Today's meeting of
the top-level trade negotiations committee is expected to confirm that so
far the talks are broadly on track, but a huge amount of work is still
needed.
The most pressing demand is to complete country-by-country talks on opening
markets for foreign goods and services. For goods the negotiations must be
largely completed by October 15, with a further month to finalise draft
country tariff schedules. For services, the timetable envisages a final
round of bilateral talks in the second half of October.
By common consent, these negotiations now represent the key to the success
of the Round. Only if countries are happy with the results can other
difficult issues related to the Uruguay Round framework of rules be
resolved. For instance, Latin American nations need specific pledges of
improved access for their highly competitive farm goods if they are to
swallow what they regard as a sorely inadequate US-EC deal on farm
subsidies, the so-called Blair House agreement.
Progress on lowering trade barriers for goods has been mixed. Negotiations
on farm products, which were not covered by the four-way tariff deal between
the biggest traders last July, are only just starting to move after the
hiatus caused by French sniping at the Blair House agreement.
This is no longer seen as a blockage since the decision of EC foreign and
farm ministers on September 20 not to seek to renegotiate the accord with
Washington. The French, like everyone else, will now be faced with accepting
or rejecting the entire Uruguay Round package when the talks are over.
Trade officials also point out that the process of 'multilateralising' Blair
House as part of negotiations to finalise the rules on farm trade reform
could provide some scope for the 'additions and clarifications' Paris has
demanded.
Refusal by Japan to accept the principle of 'tariffication without
exception' (conversion of all trade restrictions into tariffs), which would
mean opening its closed rice market, has become the main obstacle to
progress, trade officials say.
There has been more activity on industrial products, but developing
countries have complained that the 'Quad' deal between the US, EC, Japan and
Canada contained little of interest to them. US agreement to reduce high
tariffs on textiles is seen as essential to moving along the talks, paving
the way for offers by developing countries to reduce their own tariffs on
textiles and other goods and for the EC to do more in areas such as
electronics, non-ferrous metals, wood, paper and pulp.
In services the picture is brighter. A revised draft General Agreement on
Trade in Services, complete with annexes on air transport, financial
services, telecommunications and labour mobility, will be presented to
negotiators tomorrow.
The tricky issues here relate to maritime transport, audio-visual services
and financial services. The US is refusing to open ocean-going shipping to
all comers, to the dismay of many shipping nations, including the Nordic
countries and EC members such as Greece.
The EC - with backing from others such as India, Australia and Canada - is
resisting on 'cultural' grounds US demands for unrestricted access to the
European film, video and television markets. Elsewhere, the US and the EC
are united in pressing mainly south-east Asian nations to open financial
services to foreign competition.
In private, trade diplomats in Geneva expect a trade-off between US and EC
interests in maritime and audio-visual services, with both keeping existing
restrictions. However, a US threat to keep its own financial services off
the table if others do not come through with adequate offers in this area
could still wreck the talks.
Only once the market access package seems to be coming together will Mr
Sutherland gingerly open up some of the contentious aspects of the Uruguay
Round rules package drafted in December 1991.
Apart from the amendments to the farm trade rules resulting from the Blair
House accord, the other predicted trouble spots are US demands for changes
to the anti-dumping text and its vacillation over proposals for a strong
Multilateral Trade Organisation.
The end-game will not be easy, especially if, as many in Geneva fear, the
garnering of congressional votes in Washington for the controversial North
American Free Trade Agreement leaves US negotiators with little room for
manoeuvre.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Short time for steel: Japanese steelmen to be asked to stay
away

JAPAN'S leading steelmakers are expected to ask workers to stay at home for
two to three extra days per month to cut costs, in a move likely to set a
standard for other troubled industries.
Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel and NKK, three of the largest makers, confirmed
yesterday they were considering the reduction in work hours, which would be
subsidised to a maximum of Y9,410 (Dollars 89.60) per day by the Japanese
government.
Manufacturers are looking for new ways to reduce labour costs, which rose
last year for all industries by an average of 5.8 per cent, even though
sales for most products fell as the economic downturn worsened.
The tradition of lifetime employment in Japan means companies have tried to
find ways to reduce costs other than laying off workers. Most have already
cut their graduate intake and plan to trim workforces through natural
wastage. But Japan's economy is continuing to weaken and manufacturers are
likely to follow the steel industry's lead. The Labour Ministry has approved
steel industry subsidies for 'employment adjustment', meaning retraining or
just keeping workers at home.
The steelmakers will need approval from company unions, which may also be
asked to accept pay cuts in the longer term. A senior official said
manufacturers and unions would come under government pressure to accept a
pay cut.
Six years ago Japanese steelmakers cut working hours, as the industry was
hit by yen appreciation and declining domestic sales, but the rapid growth
of the late 1980s encouraged companies to hire workers to meet demand.
The companies have just announced profit revisions, with Nippon Steel, the
world's largest maker, expecting a Y15bn pre-tax loss in the year ending in
March.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday outlined a 'rolling programme' for full
normalisation of relations with South Africa, but warned that a new trade
accord should not be signed until after democratic elections set for April
1994.
The policy is a response to this month's agreement between the Pretoria
government and the African National Congress on establishing a transitional
executive council to pave the way to an end of white minority rule.
The announcement in Brussels yesterday comes nine days before President F W
de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, are due to come to
Brussels to address the EC/African, Caribbean and Pacific Joint Assembly.
Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are expected to outline ideas on how to develop
EC-South African trade links. These are likely to take place outside the
Lome Convention, the trade deal between the EC and the 69 ACP countries.
Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Foreign ministers of the
Organisation of African Unity last night approved the lifting of all
economic sanctions against South Africa, except for the mandatory arms
embargo, a voluntary ban on oil sales and nuclear-related trade.

Syria said yesterday it was not in a hurry to make peace with Israel if
peace did not mean Israel returning all occupied Arab territory, Reuter
reports from Damascus.
'Syria believes time is on the Arabs' side so we need not hurry for a
settlement which will not restore the Arabs' usurped rights,' the ruling
party newspaper al-Baath said.
'Here we should cite a quotation from the Arab leader (Syrian President)
Hafez al-Assad in which he said future generations would be able to restore
the Arabs' rights if our generation could not,' added the newspaper.
But al-Baath said this did not mean Syria would abandon the Middle East
peace process.
Syria and Israel have held direct peace talks for almost two years without
achieving tangible progress. Syria wants Israel to give back the Golan
Heights. Israel says it is willing to withdraw from at least a part of the
Golan but first it wants to know what kind of peace Syria envisages.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Pachinko fever survives recession
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACHINKO, a cross between pinball and gambling which is one of Japan's most
popular games, appears to be surviving the recession better than most
industries.
The pachinko industry scored an astonishing Y17,000bn (Pounds 106bn) in
sales last year, up 7.8 per cent on 1991, according to yesterday's Mainichi
Daily News, in a study of the little-researched industry. That is more than
the turnover of Toyota and Nissan combined.
Pachinko parlours, with their garish facades, are standard features of many
Japanese shopping streets. Players sit in rows, facing upright pin boards on
which they flip metal balls about for hours on end, accompanied by rock
music.
All kinds of folk do it, from stressed salarymen to university professors.
Nearly 30m people, a quarter of the population, confess to being addicts.
The sales figures mean that the average pachinko fan gambled Y566,666 last
year. That might look a lot, but the figures are skewed by a few big
betters, who place up to Y30,000 a time on so-called 'fever' machines, set
to pay out high winnings for big stakes.
But in spite of their recession-proof sales performance, Japan's 17,000
pachinko operators say net earnings are being squeezed. Average gross profit
margins have nearly halved to 16 per cent since 1980.
This is because parlours have jacked up their payouts - fever machines are
an example - to defend their markets from a growing number of new operators
seeking a share of those high rewards. One operator maintains that only one
in three parlours is actually profitable these days.
Competition is also forcing pachinko parlours to take a somewhat creative
view of the gambling laws, which forbid them from paying winnings in cash.
Instead, successful pachinko wizards are legally supposed to take winnings
in kind. Anything from chewing gum to a computer will do.
In a bid to outdo their rivals, some parlours have started paying the
biggest winners in gold ingots, according to the Mainichi Daily News study.
Others have taken to paying out in tokens, which can be turned into cash at
exchange desks, sometimes run by local yakuza gangsters.

FT  30 SEP 93 / EC plans pact with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday unveiled proposals for a new free trade
pact with Israel covering services and a stake in the EC's multi-billion
dollar research and development programme.
The proposal would extend the 1975 free trade agreement with Israel, and
forms part of an unfolding EC policy aimed at capitalising on the
breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians on self-rule in the
occupied territories.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC Commissioner for development policy, said the new
agreement would be an important step in supporting Middle East development.
He said other trade arrangements in the region also needed to be updated,
and called for round-table talks with Arab states, including Egypt, Lebanon
and Jordan.
The draft for the new bilateral trade agreement must be approved by EC
ministers. It avoids serious concessions on agriculture, but offers other
attractions for Israel:
A broader political dialogue at ministerial level, enabling Israel to
continue its escape from diplomatic isolation;
Liberalisation of public procurement, so that public sector contracts are
accessible on a reciprocal basis;
A separate agreement whereby Israel could take part in the EC's R&amp;D
framework programme which accounted for Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2bn) in 1993;
Co-operation on energy, the environment and drugs.
Palestinian companies in the occupied territories will not be eligible for
funding or special treatment under the EC-Israel pact, said Mr Marin. But
this could change, once the nature and extent of self-rule in the
territories became clear.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Israeli peace fatigue blocks Rabin's road to Damascus:
Obstacles to a deal on the Golan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GIANT banners are everywhere. One hangs from a window-sill next door to
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's Jerusalem residence. Another is
festooned across the top floor of a towering luxury apartment complex
overlooking parliament. A third has been planted into a small hillock
alongside the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. The message, loosely
translated: 'The Golan Heights are an integral part of Israel.'
The banner campaign, backed up with the distribution of car stickers bearing
the same message, was dreamed up by a group of Israeli right-wing activists
several months ago, before the news broke that Israel had secretly reached
an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation to grant limited
self-rule to the Palestinians of the occupied territories.
The activists were mainly Jewish settlers, residents of the occupied West
Bank. But since the mainstream Israeli population had little sympathy for
the settlers, having watched successive hard-line Likud governments pump
money into settlements instead of towns and poor neighbourhoods inside
Israel, they focused their efforts on resisting territorial compromise on
the Golan - an issue for which there is a far wider national consensus.
Their hope was that the Israeli electorate would first join them in
demanding that Mr Rabin reject Syrian demands for an Israeli withdrawal from
the strategic Golan Heights ridge, captured from Syria in 1967, and then
back them in their demand for the maintenance of Israeli rule over the
entire West Bank and Gaza Strip as well.
The settlers, like other Israelis and, for that matter, the rest of the
world, were caught off guard by the accord with the PLO. They barely had
time to organise a couple of protest demonstrations before Messrs Rabin,
Peres, Arafat and company were gathering on the White House lawn.
Within days, Israeli opinion surveys were showing that about 60 per cent of
the public were behind the autonomy deal. The banner campaign had apparently
failed.
But most days, as he leaves his home, or glances at the back windscreen of
the car in front, Mr Rabin must still see the message. And the interviews he
has given in the past few days suggest that he has absorbed it.
The US is pressing Mr Rabin to follow up the deal with the PLO and the
agreement with Jordan on a joint 'peace agenda' by working for a similar
breakthrough with Syria. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is
heading for the region next month bent on mediating an accord between Mr
Rabin and Syria's President Hafez Assad.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is urging Mr Rabin to cut a deal with
Damascus. And Israeli and Syrian negotiators in Washington have done most of
the work on a joint declaration of principles for peace.
Yet Mr Rabin is holding back. He knows that the road to a truly
comprehensive Middle East peace leads only through Damascus - that once an
accommodation is reached with Syria, Lebanon would follow immediately, the
Arab boycott of Israel would be lifted and the new era of regional harmony
he speaks of might at last be at hand.
But Mr Rabin also knows that the Israeli public is still grappling with the
concept of 'Yassir Arafat, the peace partner'. After all, as he confessed at
the White House two weeks ago, it was not easy for him to make the leap.
He knows that a second peace punch might just knock the Israelis out. If,
only weeks after rehabilitating Mr Arafat, he were to announce a deal with
President Assad - one that would necessarily involve withdrawal from most,
if not all, of the Golan - he might lose his mainstream support.
In the short term Mr Rabin has no urgent need for an agreement with the
Syrians. The Israeli-Syrian border has been quiet for almost 20 years. And
in southern Lebanon, American-mediated understandings have ensured that
Syria limits the activities of the radical Hizbollah and Palestinian gunmen
to attacks on the Israeli 'security zone' rather than sovereign Israeli
territory.
It may well be that, behind the scenes, Mr Rabin is signalling a certain
readiness for compromise with Damascus. That would seem to be a
pre-requisite for preventing President Assad from working actively to
torpedo the accord with the PLO.
But publicly, Mr Rabin continues to accuse the Syrians of 'preventing
progress', of inflexibly demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan,
of talking peace while quietly encouraging war.
For all the American presure and all the tantalising possibilities of wider
Arab reconciliation, Mr Rabin appears to have decided that a deal with Syria
can wait a while. He has been reading the banners.

MR Ghulam Hyder Wyne, a former chief minister of Punjab province and a close
associate of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, was assassinated
yesterday by gunmen near the city of Mian Chunun in central Punjab, writes
Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The killing raised concern over security in the run-up to elections next
Wednesday.
Ms Benazir Bhutto and Mr Sharif are both campaigning to make a political
comeback.
Mr Wyne was dragged from his car and shot after the vehicle was fired on and
stopped. His driver and two other passengers sustained serious injuries,
police said last night. The killing was condemned by politicians loyal to
both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto.
Investigators indicated the killing might have been a personal attack. An
injured passenger has apparently identified a gunman, which led the police
to discount political motives.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Devaluation call undermines peso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE peso has dropped sharply on foreign exchange markets this
week as government officials debate a devaluation of the currency.
The peso rate against the US dollar has fallen by up to 9.2 per cent since
the start of this week, or 21 per cent since January. Towards the close of
banking hours yesterday, traders were quoting the Philippine currency at
around 30.50 pesos to the US dollar.
Bankers say that although economic fundamentals favour the peso, the drop
has been induced by official debate on a call to allow the currency to fall
to 35 pesos to the dollar. The proposal further calls for a second rate of
28 pesos per dollar to support imports of essential items such as crude oil.
The call was submitted by Mr Edgardo Angara, the Senate president, at a
recent economic summit of Philippine officials. He says a sharp depreciation
in the peso rate would boost exports and 'restore the nation's international
competitiveness'.
The Senate head also proposed imposition of a 5 per cent surcharge on three
sectors likely to benefit from such a devaluation: exporters, depositors in
dollars, and Filipinos employed abroad.
The levy, he said, would be used to fund power generation and reforestation
projects, along with schemes (such as food subsidies and emergency loans) to
cushion the inflationary effect of a devaluation among low-income groups.
Even as officials of the Central Bank and of the House of Representatives,
the other chamber in the bicameral legislature, dismissed the proposal,
support for it came from leading economists.
Mr Benjamin Diokno, former budget undersecretary and currently a professor
at the University of the Philippines School of Economics, urged in a paper
that a devaluation now could become an 'offensive tool' that could be used
to restructure the economy. But he said a devaluation could only be
effective if accompanied by improved tax collection, speedier privatisation
of state assets, and a streamlining of the bureaucracy.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Libya assures UN over trial

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA informed the United Nations last night that it was willing to allow
the two alleged Lockerbie bombers to appear for trial before a Scottish
court.
But the announcement was received with considerable scepticism, after
numerous previous Libyan promises and evasions.
'The question of timing is still under discussion,' a UN spokesman said
after a meeting between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, and
Mr Omar al-Muntasser, the Libyan foreign minister.
They are to have further talks today, when Mr Muntasser will also address
the UN General Assembly.
Diplomats said Libya's response may have been prompted by a deadline set by
the Security Council. If it does not agree by tomorrow to submit the
suspects for trial, a resolution imposing a freeze on Libyan financial
assets abroad and an embargo on oil-related equipment supplies will be
considered.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, who is in New York for the UN
session, remained wary about Libyan intentions.
Reacting to a statement issued earlier in the day by the Libyan 'Bureau for
Foreign Liaison and International Co-operation', he said he was interested
only in getting the suspects to Scotland or the US to stand trial.
They are accused of masterminding the bombing of the Pan Am jet that
exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 with the loss
of 270 lives.
Under a Security Council resolution last year, Libya's air links were
severed and a ban on shipments of aircraft and parts was imposed, along with
an embargo on arms sales and a reduction of Libyan diplomatic staff around
the world.
While yesterday's developments indicated that Libya might be becoming less
intransigent in the face of tougher sanctions, its position remained
ambiguous. The Libyan official statement said the suspects would be
encouraged to go to Scotland but added that 'one step' remained: 'acceptance
by the suspects, their families and lawyers to appear before the Scottish
court'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Australian dollar hit as deficit widens
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar came under renewed pressure yesterday, after news that
a deteriorating trade balance caused the country's seasonally adjusted
current account deficit to widen to ADollars 1.39bn (Pounds 590m) last
month. The August figure compared with a ADollars 1.08bn deficit in July. On
a non-adjusted basis, the August result showed a deficit of ADollars 1.69bn,
up from ADollars 1.53bn in the previous month.
Much of the damage resulted from a turnaround on the balance of trade, with
exports falling by 4 per cent, while imports increased by 2 per cent. As a
result, the trade balance (seasonally adjusted) swung from a surplus of
ADollars 128m to a deficit of ADollars 153m. There were marked declines on
the export side in transport equipment and coal, as well as gold, machinery,
meat and wool; on the import side, fuel showed the sharpest rise.
Although analysts had predicted that the trade position would deteriorate
after July's surprisingly good results, the August balance of payments data
were at the gloomier end of expectations. Bankers Trust had forecast a
current account deficit of ADollars 1.15bn, and the market had expected the
unadjusted figure to stand in the ADollars 1bn-ADollars 1.3bn range.
However, in Canberra, Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, and Mr Paul
Keating, the prime minister, both insisted that the figures reflected signs
of increased economic growth.
On the foreign exchanges, the dollar fell after the figures were released
and, by early afternoon, was flirting with a six-and-a-half-year low. By the
close the currency had regained a little ground, trading at USDollars 0.646
 -down from an opening USDollars 0.647. The dollar has been under pressure
for more than a month because of the government's failure to push its budget
legislation through the Senate.

BRITISH officials greeted with scepticism yesterday a statement from Libya
suggesting it would 'urge' two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to
stand trial in Scotland.
The Foreign Office and UN diplomats said the statement fell short of demands
to hand over the men and that Britain, the US and France would proceed
tomorrow with the tabling of a proposed UN resolution to stiffen sanctions
against Tripoli.
The Libyan statement said that Libya was not against the two men standing
trial in a Scottish court and added: 'We urge them to accept that'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'If they come forward and are
handed over, then that will change the situation and sanctions can be
suspended. If not, after the expiry of the deadline on October 1 we will ask
the Security Council to impose new sanctions.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / India to end telephone monopoly
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA has approved a US company's Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) plan to build a
telephone network in a south Indian town, in a move which would end the
state's monopoly of telephone services.
The decision to allow US West, the telecommunications group, to install a
network in the industrial town of Tirupur will set a precedent for opening
up India's cash-starved telecommunications network to private investment,
including foreign capital. The government hopes to achieve a dramatic
improvement in India's telephone services which are among the world's worst,
with only five telephone lines for every 1,000 people, compared with a
global average of 100.
'In telecommunications we are on the verge of a revolution,' said Mr N
Vittal, chairman-designate of the government's Telecommunications
Commission, which supervises the industry. Mr Vittal, a market-oriented
reformer who has been dubbed 'the telecommunications tsar', was speaking at
a business conference in Delhi yesterday. He said private companies,
including multinationals, were welcome in the telecommunications sector.
The challenge is enormous: the Telecommunications Ministry estimates that
India must expand its network from 7m lines to 40m lines by the year 2000.
But the ministry can afford to install only a maximum of 2m lines in the
current year to March 1994.
The ministry is creating openings for private capital despite opposition
from public sector trade unions, fearing job losses, and the deep-seated
reluctance of many MPs who stand to lose patronage as the public sector
shrinks to countenance the privatisation of an essential public service.
Both privatisation and foreign investment are sensitive subjects in India,
as demonstrated by the decision this week by Cargill, the US trading
company, to abandon a proposed salt manufacturing scheme following bitter
opposition from salt farmers, MPs and unions.
The Telecommunications Ministry first invited proposals from private
companies a year ago, when it announced its intention to allow private
investment in new industrial townships and in rural districts, which are
particularly poorly served by public utilities. US West bid for two networks
 -Tirupur and the fast-growing industrial estate of Noida, on the outskirts
of Delhi.
The government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board this week cleared only
the Tirupur project. The board will take longer to decide on Noida because
44 companies have submitted applications.
Mr Vittal said the technology existed to make rapid improvements in
telecommunications without relying on the slow work of expanding land-based
lines.
US West's scheme involves establishing a wireless system for business users
and for public call offices within the first year of operation in a core
area of Tirupur. The company would also start laying fibre-optic lines in
the same area. Once the fibre-optic network was ready, the wireless
equipment would be moved further out, linking new areas to the core. The
system would operate in parallel with the existing public network and the
call charges would be the same.
US West would take a 50 per cent stake in a joint venture with Indian
partners, which, over 10 years, could install up to 1m lines at a total cost
of over Dollars 350m, including an initial Dollars 100m investment.

FT  30 SEP 93 / US sees annual second quarter growth of 1.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the second quarter,
slightly faster than the 1.8 per cent previously reported, the Commerce
Department said yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
This was an improvement on growth at an annual rate of only 0.8 per cent at
an annual rate in the first quarter, but disappointing compared with the
second half of last year when the economy grew at a 4 per cent annual rate.
Most forecasters expect economic growth to pick up in the third and fourth
quarters to an annual rate of 2-3 per cent, reflecting the positive impact
of sharp fall in long-term interest rates.
Several recent statistics, including a modest increase in consumer
confidence in September and sharp gains in housing starts and durable goods
orders in August, suggest the pace of economic growth is picking up again.
However, some analysts see a lack of optimism in corporate boardrooms. The
Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, recently reported a 7
point fall in its index of business confidence in the third quarter to the
lowest level in well over two years.
Growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by consumer spending and
non-residential fixed investment which grew at revised annual rates of 3.4
per cent and 16.6 per cent respectively.
Reuter adds: In his most optimistic comments since taking office in January,
Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday the US economy was poised
for a strong upswing.
'Inflation and interest rates in the US are now at their lowest level in two
decades,' Mr Bentsen said. 'The economy is preparing for a strong upswing.
There are increasing signs that business investment is growing and that
production will rise.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Germany seeks to join enlarged Security Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday offered itself as a candidate for a permanent seat in an
enlarged United Nations Security Council, but in lukewarm terms falling
short of an outright demand, writes Ian Davidson in New York.
Debate has gathered momentum within the UN membership on the question of
reforming and expanding the Security Council, which is currently dominated
by the five permanent members: the US, UK, Russia, France and China, who
hold their seats as a result of their victorious role in the second world
war.
The US administration has recommended Germany and Japan should become
permanent members of the Security Council, but neither country has
campaigned openly for a seat.
Yesterday, in his address to the UN General Assembly, Mr Klaus Kinkel,
German foreign minister, said only that 'Germany is prepared to assume
responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council'.
But he hinted that Germany supported growing demands from developing
countries that they too should gain representation on the council. 'We will
only be able to maintain and strengthen the credibility of the council,' he
said, 'if we also take into our consideration the growing importance of the
third world'.
China also urged yesterday that any reform should include fairer
representation for developing countries. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign
minister, told the General Assembly that 'the reform of the Security Council
should take account of the principle of equitable geographic distribution
and should accommodate the interests of the developing countries'.
Japan has taken an even more cautious line than Germany in the debate on the
reform of the council. In his speech to the UN General Assembly on Monday,
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, acknowledged there was a 'need
to expand the membership of the Security Council,' adding only that 'Japan
intends to participate constructively in the discussions'.
One reason for German and Japanese reticence is that both countries are
inhibited, by the legacy of their roles in the second world war, from the
use of military force overseas. This is widely seen as a serious handicap in
the new era of expanded UN peacekeeping, in which the Security Council plays
a key role.
France proposed last night that states in arrears to the UN be penalised by
imposition of market-rate interest on all late payments, Michael Littlejohns
adds.
In what appeared to be an allusion to President Bill Clinton's remarks this
week, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said one could not
simultaneously speak of UN reform and be exempt from the 'primary burden of
meeting the bills. It is high time to measure the generosity of words
against the yardstick of arrears due to our organisation'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Haiti awaits Aristide's resurrection: Why the former
president may be back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM SPINDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of the safe return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
lead Haiti appears to have increased over the last week.
Violence and intimidation by supporters of the military leadership which
ousted the president two years ago last week looked likely to jeopardise the
implementation of an accord aimed at his safe return.
But the violence - at least in the capital, Port-au-Prince - appears to have
subsided and a weekend decision to boost the UN presence in the country has
raised hopes that Mr Aristide can return safely.
Around 600 US troops begin to arrive in Haiti next week in a
'non-confrontational' role as part of a 1,650-member UN mission in Haiti to
help in the restoration of democracy. The contingent is expected to contain
more than 500 police.
The agreement between military leaders and Mr Aristide envisaging the
latter's return, was sponsored by the UN and the governments of the US,
France, Canada and Venezuela and signed on July 3. The accord contemplated
the appointment of a new Prime Minister by Mr Aristide and his return on
October 30.
But since Mr Robert Malval took office as Prime Minister on September 2, he
and his cabinet have been obstructed and intimidated by government employees
appointed after the coup, who do not want to give up their posts. The
employees have been helped by bands of civilian police auxiliaries known as
'attaches' who have attacked government ministers and the mayor of
Port-au-Prince, Mr Evans Paul.
According to human rights groups, the 'attaches' are also responsible for
this month's violence against Aristide supporters, in which dozens of people
have been killed or have disappeared, including an important backer of the
President, Mr Antoine Izmery, who was pulled out of a church service and
shot dead.
The prosecutor in charge of investigating some of these killings, Mr Wilson
Ciceron, has resigned after receiving death threats. Ministers have been
subjected to intimidation which, in some cases, has prevented them going to
work. Mr Malval and his government cannot go anywhere without heavy police
protection.
The man whose job it is to provide it, the police chief, Lt Col Michel
Francois, has been accused by Mr Dante Caputo, special envoy of the
Organisation of American States and the United Nations, of being responsible
for Mr Izmery's murder.
Mr Malval's government has invited exiled Haitians to return to the country,
but there is no evidence that any of those returning are Aristide
supporters. Most appear to be supporters of the former Duvalier
dictatorship, which ruled the country for three decades.
In an apparent attempt to keep the activities of the Duvalier supporters
above board, Mr Malval has legalised a Duvalierist party.
In spite of the violence, Mr Aristide is adamant that he will return to
Port-au-Prince next month. He is planning to arrive with a number of
prominent international personalities, including the Nobel Peace Prize
winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu and possibly former US president Mr Jimmy Carter.
If he does, he will find mountains of refuse blocking the streets of the
capital, hunger and disease throughout the country, and an economy almost in
ruins. His first priority, nevertheless, will be to stay alive and to try to
stem the violence.
His task will not be helped by a new organisation calling itself the
'September 30 Group' after the date of the 1991 coup. It has been
distributing leaflets in the streets of Port-au-Prince threatening to
'eradicate' Aristide's activists before his return.
'The days to come must be red with blood' they warn. They also pledge to
intervene immediately whenever an employee appointed since the coup is
fired. 'Our democracy', the leaflet states, 'consists of the law and the
machine gun'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Canada's poll focuses on social security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   VANCOUVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S two main political parties are struggling to reassure an
increasingly confused electorate that they can maintain one of the world's
most generous social security systems while making a significant dent in the
budget deficit.
Fiscal restraint and social security reform have emerged as the two key
issues in the campaign for the October 25 general election. Both the ruling
Progressive Conservative and the opposition Liberals have promised sizeable
cuts in the deficit over the next four to five years.
But they also acknowledge the need for sweeping reforms of the social
security system, which makes up about two thirds of government spending.
Both parties face the dilemma that any admission that spending cuts might
include social security entitlements would amount to political suicide in
the election campaign.
The Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the deficit, which totalled
CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.7bn) last year, within five years. The Liberals
say they will cut the shortfall from 5.2 per cent to 3 per cent of gross
domestic product.
Mrs Kim Campbell, the prime minister, has been trying to repair the damage
in recent days caused by her earlier remarks which raised questions about
the Conservatives' commitment to the social security net. She said in a
speech in Toronto that 'my approach does not cut social programmes. It fixes
them.'
Economists have dismissed the barrage of budget deficit targets as
meaningless without significant cuts in spending on programmes such as
unemployment insurance, social welfare and healthcare. Both parties'
scenarios also assume what economists consider as unrealistically strong
economic growth to bolster tax revenues.
The Globe and Mail newspaper said in an editorial yesterday that since both
the Conservatives and the Liberals 'still deny any intent to cut spending,
the choice before the voter is this: which party is it safe to hope is
lying?'
With less than a month to go in the campaign, the Tories have recently lost
ground in public opinion polls to the Liberals as well as to the regional
parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the right-wing Reform
Party in western Canada.

THE PHILIPPINES has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to resume
negotiations on a medium-term financing programme to support economic
recovery, the government announced yesterday.
The last of the decade-long series of short-term programmes for Manila ended
in March and subsequent disagreements over revenue-enhancement measures
brought discussions on a successor programme to a stalemate.
The Philippines is looking to a three-year financing worth about Dollars
800m (Pounds 528m) that will help propel its economy towards double-digit
growth towards the end of this decade.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK pushes for debt forgiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one message that Britain has hammered home during this week's
monetary meetings in Washington it is that western creditor countries should
move swiftly to grant the Trinidad terms for debt relief to those poorest
developing nations which are reforming their economies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has urged governments
to forgive two thirds, and in some cases 80 per cent, of the official debts
owed to them, against 50 per cent at present.
He has also called for the terms to be applied to the whole stock of debt
rather than selected maturities under the present workings of the Paris Club
of industrialised creditor countries.
The UK aim is to get these countries off the Paris Club's books and in a
position where they can rebuild their financial credibility with a view to
one day borrowing on the world capital markets.
The proposed two thirds to 80 per cent rates of debt reduction have been
chosen in the belief that they would permit 'exit rescheduling' after which
countries need never return to the Paris Club.
The call to apply the reduction to the whole stock of debt is to deal with
problems caused by a Paris Club convention that restricts reschedulings and
debt reductions to debts incurred before a specific cut-off date.
The cut-off date is usually around the time a country first applied to
reschedule its official debt.
In the case of some African countries it can be as far back as the early
1980s. In these cases present rescheduling and relief agreements have not
taken account of subsequent defaults and arrears that make up the lion's
share of their present debt burdens.
So far 17 countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, have benefited from the
Trinidad terms, and had Dollars 1.75bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of debt and debt
service obligations written off. Tentative UK estimates suggest if Britain's
call to relieve the stock of debt were to be accepted, a further Dollars 8bn
would be eligible for forgiveness.
Britain claims that it is close to achieving a consensus among creditor
countries on applying debt relief to the stock of debt. There is less
agreement on having a rate of debt reduction higher than 50 per cent.
However, the UK plan has still to win the support of Japan, which argues
that debt relief leads to 'moral hazard' that will encourage other borrowers
to renege on their obligations.
One attraction of the Trinidad terms for the UK is that they have no adverse
budgetary implications. The debt has largely arisen through defaults on
export credit guarantees that have already been paid by the government.
Other countries, notably the US, are less well placed. The US has to make a
provision in its budget for official debt relief. Britain has therefore
achieved something of a breakthrough in winning the support of the Clinton
administration for 50 per cent debt reduction, which the Bush administration
had refused to back.

FT  30 SEP 93 / US carmakers aim for 80 miles a gallon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CAR manufacturers yesterday joined the federal government in a research
programme aimed at developing cleaner cars with three times the fuel economy
of today's models.
The programme will pool resources from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler
with those of the government's space, defence and nuclear weapons
laboratories, and will redirect government research spending.
'Our long-term goal is to develop affordable, attractive cars that are up to
three times more fuel-efficient than today's cars - three times - and meet
strict standards for urban air pollution, safety, performance and comfort,'
President Bill Clinton said at a White House ceremony yesterday to launch
the initiative.
Some critics complain the goal of around 80 miles per US gallon is
technologically impossible. But Vice-president Al Gore said researchers
needed to be imaginative. 'After all, considering that this country spends
tens of billions of dollars each year to upgrade and improve bombers and
fighters, it is amazing we are content to use a technology on our highways
that was developed in 1876,' Mr Gore said.
US carmakers are currently required to produce a fleet whose fuel
consumption averages 27.5 miles per gallon. The US Environmental Protection
Agency, in statistics produced this week, showed the overall average of cars
sold in the US is around 28.1 mpg, twice as efficient as the cars sold in
the 1970s but with little change in the last seven years.
Only two car models studied by the EPA, the Geo Metro XFI and the Honda
Civic HB, exceeded 50 mpg.
Others worry that the programme lacks any commitment for transferring
greater fuel efficiency from the laboratory to the production line.
Some environmentalist groups fear that the research project might, in fact,
be used by Mr Clinton to cover his retreat from a campaign pledge to
increase the average fuel efficiency required by law to 40 mpg by the year
2000 and 45 mpg by 2015 - a move fiercely opposed by the car companies.
An increase in fuel efficiency requirements is also opposed by many
environmental economists, who argue that the problem is not the availability
of fuel-efficient cars but the lack of incentive for anyone to buy them
while US petrol prices remain so low.
Petrol taxes are due to rise by 4.3 per cents a gallon on Friday following
this year's budget, but Mr Clinton's efforts to impose a stiffer tax on all
forms of energy were shot down in Congress.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Some good news and a call to arms: This year's meeting may
one day be viewed as a turning point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS easy to be cynical about events such as this week's annual meetings of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
The descent on Washington of legions of pin-striped officials and assorted
hangers-on does wonders for the local hotel and stretch-limo trade. But the
jamboree often seems worlds away from the realities of widespread poverty in
many developing nations and near-zero growth and rising unemployment in the
industrialised world.
Take last Saturday's gathering of ministers from the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations.
The talks among the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada were never likely to be
more than a stock-taking exercise. The muted outcome, with no official
communique on economic policy but all participants claiming, with hindsight,
that decisions over the previous five months reflected Group of Seven
co-ordination, was bound to dissatisfy observers brought up on a heady diet
of G7 exchange rate activism in the 1980s.
And yet, the 1993 IMF-World Bank meeting, which ends today, may be viewed
one day as a turning point: when suddenly the glass that is the world
economy moved from being half empty to half full.
The meetings opened under the cloud of the latest IMF forecasts for the
world economy. The Fund's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook scaled back
already weak growth expectations for the industrialised nations in 1993 and
1994.
The talks in Washington have also produced no noticeable improvement in the
prospects for trade liberalisation through conclusion of the Uruguay Round
of trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. This was to be expected because finance ministers are not trade
negotiators.
But a more optimistic tone has been seeping into private conversations and
the statements of ministers and officials. Bankers on the cocktail party
circuit have been talking about better business than a year ago. The IMF
forecast downgradings, on closer inspection, did little more than reflect
the consensus of financial markets.
Seven days ago, there was widespread concern that Japan might be heading for
further economic contraction and that Russia would fall into chaos.
These worries have not gone away. But Japan is contemplating a tax reform
that may eventually boost the economy. There is greater hope that
continental Europe might have seen the worst of its recession and that
short-term interest rates will fall in Germany, allowing its neighbours to
benefit from easier monetary conditions.
In between valedictory parties for Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who hands over the
presidency of the Bundesbank to Mr Hans Tietmeyer tomorrow, German officials
have stressed their belief that Germany's recession is past its worst. As
inflationary pressures might also be easing, the Bundesbank, with its
customary caution, may be more inclined to use what scope it has to lower
interest rates.
The other good news has been the rapid growth of some developing countries
in east Asia and Latin America.
A visitor to Washington is quickly aware of the advertisements on US
television criticising imported cars and castigating the proposed North
American Free Trade Agreement, which will turn the US, Canada and Mexico
into a trading block.
But the IMF has underlined just how far the industrialised world is
benefiting from trade with fast-growing developing nations.
In his keynote speech to the annual meeting, Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF
managing director, noted that US exports to China, the Middle East and Latin
America grew in 1991 and 1992 at 10 times the rate of increase of US exports
to western Europe. Japanese exports to the same markets grew 10 times faster
than Japanese exports to the US. While EC exports to the US and Japan
declined, the Community's exports to China. the Middle East and Latin
America increased by 13 per cent.
Against this background, the chorus in favour of an early resolution of the
Gatt round has grown into a crescendo.
Officials take notice when the IMF's policy making Interim Committee, which
represents all the Fund's membership, says it expects 'leadership and vision
from all in order to resolve the remaining issues and conclude the (Uruguay)
Round by the end of the year'.
The repeated insistence on a speedy end to the Gatt round should put
pressure on negotiators in Geneva and on prime ministerial offices at home.
The strong language of the Interim Committee statement means that the
finance ministers and central bank governors representing the IMF's members
are really saying that the G7 heads of government who said after this year's
Tokyo Summit that completing the Gatt round was their 'highest priority'
will be manifestly lacking in 'leadership and vision' if the talks fail.
Any final verdict on this week's G7 and IMF talks will hinge on whether the
round is completed successfully.
In spite of all the problems surrounding the round, it is too early to
predict failure. International trade negotiations always go to the limit.
There are, among the finance ministry and central bank officials who
attended this week's IMF and World Bank meetings, some who argue that a
positive conclusion will be reached because the mid-December deadline,
unlike all the others in the past seven years of trade negotiation, is so
obviously a final crunchpoint.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Bentsen urges boost for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday called on the world's
industrial nations to remove barriers to employment.
Addressing the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, he said the fight to reduce unemployment in the industrial world from
its current level of 35m required more than action to stimulate demand.
'Policies that spur demand will urge companies to take on workers and
increase production,' Mr Bentsen said. 'At the same time, we must eliminate
the structural barriers employers face - the ones that convince them in a
thousand little ways that hiring the extra employee is just not worth the
trouble.'
Mr Bentsen said that the Group of Seven industrial nations' jobs conference,
which the Clinton administration plans to host in Washington this autumn,
would consider both demand-boosting policies and action to cut structural
unemployment. 'We must learn from each other's experience and find ways to
restore our ability to produce jobs,' he said.
There was a 'very real risk' of arriving at next year's IMF and World Bank
annual meetings 'with nothing more to say than recovery is still right
around the corner,' Mr Bentsen said. 'After three years, this line is
beginning to wear a little thin.'.
He said he believed the big industrial countries were finding the political
will to implement growth policies. The past week's discussions in the G7 and
IMF's policy-making Interim Committee had been enouraging. 'I believe we are
all moving together.'
Mr Bentsen made yet another plea for a conclusion of the Uruguay Round of
trade liberalisation talks this year. 'Time is running out,' he said. The
December 15 deadline for completing the round with the benefit of fast track
procedures in the US Congress was 'close at hand'.
Mr Bentsen warned against hopes the deadline might be flexible. 'I would not
expect the US Congress to approve an extension of it.'

FT  30 SEP 93 / Bosnia heads for another winter of civil war: Moslem
conditions mean virtual rejection of Geneva peace plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Moslem-dominated parliament yesterday defied Serbian threats and
voted to reject peace plan maps put forward in Geneva, although it agreed in
principle to the republic's partition into three ethnic mini-states.
US President Bill Clinton voiced concern at the parliament's decision,
declaring the ultimate cost of 'passing up this peace' might be very high.
'They want some more territory,' he said. 'I think they're entitled to some
more territory, but I don't know if they can get it.'
After a closed session in the shell-scarred Holiday Inn in Sarajevo, 58
Bosnian deputies voted to endorse the plan only on condition that
territories taken by force are returned to government control. Seven
deputies voted for outright rejection, with four in favour of unconditional
acceptance.
Since Bosnian Serb leaders have repeatedly refused to hand over any more
land to their outgunned Moslem adversaries, the decision appears to have
weakened hopes of an early peace settlement. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian
Serb leader, earlier warned that conditional acceptance was tantamount to
rejection. 'Enough is enough,' he said, adding that Serbs had made seven
territorial concessions.
After 18 months of war, Bosnian Serb forces hold about 70 per cent of
Bosnia. Mr Karadzic has agreed to scale back his territory to 54 per cent
but has stopped short of the additional 4 per cent of land, cited by Mr
Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, as necessary to have the minimum
essentials for the functioning of his land-locked, disjointed state.
Despite pressure to endorse the accord, Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign
minister, said: 'Territories taken by force, especially where genocide
occurred. . . must be returned to their rightful owners. Otherwise, we are
living in a jungle. It will be a new stone age.'
The rejection left diplomats at a loss for the next step to broker a peace
before the Balkan winter, and threw plans for the deployment of peacekeeping
forces into confusion again. Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators, will meet today in Geneva.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said the latest news on peace
negotiations in the former Yugoslavia was 'rather pessimistic' and the
Pentagon feared that Bosnia may suffer another winter of civil war.
Nato diplomats in Brussels indicated that the conditional acceptance would
not be enough for deployment of peacekeepers.
With the prospect of renewed war, fears are also growing about the further
fragmentation of Bosnia, heightened after Mr Fikret Abdic, a member of
Bosnia's collective leadership, declared autonomy in the Bihac region, an
isolated north-western pocket.
Tens of thousands of people were reported to have taken to the streets in
protest after security forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic seized police stations
in five enclave towns and ordered a curfew, Croatian radio said.
The Bosnian parliament yesterday ousted Mr Abdic from the collective
leadership.

<TEXT>
EC justice ministers are to try to thwart tax evaders and terrorists by
agreeing common rules on extradition.
At a meeting near Brussels they launched a year-long review of national
extradition procedures.
Officials at the meeting said the review would examine whether to abolish
the category of a politically motivated offence inside the EC, and whether
EC nationals can be extradited for tax evasion.
Mr Melchior Wathelet, justice minister of Belgium, the current EC
presidency, pointed out that extradition procedures inside Europe have
hardly changed for 50 years.
It was 'time to take a big step forward,' he said, to prevent criminals from
taking advantage of the EC's border-free single market. He cited as examples
that France and Belgium did not allow extradition of their own nationals.
Mr Wathelet added that 'the notion of political offences needs to be
reconsidered, and possibly abolished,' inside a Community whose members were
democracies governed by the rule of law.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Kohl stalls again on move to Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government faces internal criticism after again postponing a
decision on when the seat of government will move from Bonn to Berlin.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has been accused of distorting the
costs of the move, prompting fears that the longer Chancellor Helmut Kohl
puts off the decision, the greater the scope for wider divisions in the
government and the Bundestag.
The dithering over the move, which was agreed by the Bundestag on June 20
1991, is not only prompted by costs, which Mr Waigel claimed would be
between DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) and DM30bn. Sections of the CDU fear a move in
1998 would alienate voters in the Rhineland, whose interests are tied to the
government in Bonn.
Mr Dietmar Kansy, a CDU deputy and chairman of the Bundestag's construction
commission, said Mr Waigel's estimates for the move to Berlin were 'total
nonsense' and he was using these figures simply to prevent it. In
particular, Mr Kansy said the finance minister had included the cost of
building 12,000 apartments, which he said were not supposed to be included
in the costs, as well as transport, which in any case was going to be
upgraded regardless of the move.
Industrial orders in eastern Germany fell by 14 per cent in July compared
with the previous month, with the manufacturing sector registering the
sharpest fall, the federal Ministry of Economics said.
Ministry officials said the decline was partly caused by seasonal factors as
well as an unexpected 21 per cent increase in orders in June.
Meanwhile the annual rate of inflation in western Germany dropped by 0.2
percentage points to 4 per cent last month, the federal statistics office
reported yesterday.

FT  30 SEP 93 / New calling beckons for the mobile telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE out of 10 Swedes will have a mobile phone by the end of the decade, by
when the portable phone will be a mass consumer product across Europe, the
head of Sweden's state mobile communications operator said yesterday.
Mr Seth Myrby, chief executive of Telia Mobitel, an offshoot of Sweden's
state telecommunications operator, said the next five years would see a
'mobile revolution' as the portable phone was transformed from yuppy
accessory to household essential.
Addressing the FT's world mobile communications conference in London, he
said that almost nine in every 100 Swedes now had a mobile phone, one of the
highest ratios in the world.
In a pointed reference to the implications of rapid growth for the
industry's high prices and margins, Mr Myrby noted that department stores
and consumer electronics retailers would become the normal channel for
selling mobile phones, 'and they are used to handling consumer goods with
much lower margins than is the case with mobile phones today'.
Mr John Defeo, chief executive of US West NewVector Group, the US operator,
reinforced the message by pointing to the ready availability of
high-frequency radio spectrum for operators to offer new mobile services.
'We are in a very different world (from the 1980s)', he said. 'There will be
plenty of spectrum to go round. Value will be created through the
development of new products and services.'
He predicted that the emphasis for the consumer market would be on simple
tariff packages.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Rise in French unemployment rate slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE rise in French unemployment slowed markedly in August, with the rate of
joblessness remaining steady at about 11.7 per cent, according to official
figures released yesterday.
The figures showed that there were 3.22m people out of work in August, up
4,000 from July. The average monthly increase in unemployment this year has
been about 30,000, creating a serious political problem for the government,
which has committed itself to curbing the rise in joblessness.
A spokesman for the Labour Ministry welcomed the August figures, arguing
that they showed the rise in unemployment is beginning to stabilise. Private
sector economists also said the figures were better than expected but
predicted that the rate would continue to rise until the end of the year.
Mrs Marie Owens-Thomsen, economist at Midland Global markets, said
yesterday's figures suggested that the trend rate of increase had
stabilised, but that the rate of unemployment would probably reach 12.5 per
cent by the end of December. The release of the figures coincides with the
opening of the parliamentary debate on the government's five-year jobs plan.
The plan, introduced on Tuesday, aims to make working hours more flexible,
encourage part-time work and reduce the costs to employers of hiring new
workers. However, it has been criticised for not going far enough on
tackling labour market rigidities.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Big fines for Paris insider trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S biggest insider trading trial ended yesterday when a Paris court
imposed fines of up to FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) on seven businessmen and
confiscated FFr30m in illicit profits from Pechiney's 1988 purchase of
Triangle, owner of American National Can.
But the court acquitted Mr Alain Boublil, a former aide to the late prime
minister Pierre Beregovoy, giving him 'the benefit of the doubt' that he
tipped off others to the fact that state-owned Pechiney, the metals and
packaging group, was about to make its US purchase.
The court concluded that Mr Samir Traboulsi, a Lebanese-born financier, on
whom it imposed a two-year suspended sentence and a FFr25m fine, had other
contacts with France's socialist establishment that could have made him the
chief conduit of the leak. Mr Traboulsi is to appeal, as is Mr Max Theret,
founder of the FNAC record and book shops, who received a similar two-year
suspended sentence, a fine of FFr2.5m and confiscation of FFr8.5m in profits
that he and an associate made on the deal. The judgment comes on the eve of
France's large-scale programme of privatisation. The candidates include
Pechiney, whose management was never implicated in the 1988 affair.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the watchdog of the Paris
stock exchange, has held up the Pechiney investigation as a model of
co-operation among international regulators.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission detected a wave of foreign
purchases of Triangle shares in mid-November 1988, when the US stock was
trading at around Dollars 10 a share and just before Pechiney, with the
knowledge of Triangle's top executives, launched a Dollars 56 a share bid.
US regulators passed their suspicions to the COB, who also drew on
information from the London Stock Exchange authorities. In all, some FFr45m
in illicit profits were estimated to have been made.
Mr Beregovoy, who was finance minister at the time of the Pechiney-Triangle
deal, took the unusual step of making the COB dossier public in February
1989 before transferring it for prosecutors to act on. Last May Mr Beregovoy
shot himself, shortly after he lost the elections and after he had appeared,
in private, before Pechiney investigators.
One of the main beneficiaries of the Pechiney-Triangle dealing was the late
Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat who died in 1989 after being indicted for insider
trading.
A key element in the prosecution case was a lunch on November 13 1988 at a
well known Lebanese-run restaurant in Paris which was hosted by Mr and Mrs
Beregovoy to celebrate their wedding anniversary and to which Mr Pelat, Mr
Traboulsi and Mr Boublil were all invited.
In his defence, Mr Traboulsi maintained that he would not be so stupid as to
jeopardise, by trading on his own account, his FFr60m commission from
Triangle for acting as official intermediary between Pechiney and Triangle.
However, the court said it was 'certain' that Mr Traboulsi had tipped off a
Swiss-based Lebanese financier, Mr Charbel Ghanem, who was himself stripped
of FFr21m of his profits, as well as getting a suspended prison term and a
fine.

FT  30 SEP 93 / UK to share its summer with EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Europe will get an extra month of summertime under a plan agreed
yesterday by the European Commission to ensure all 12 states adjust their
clocks in unison.
The commission said a large majority of those consulted in government and
business wanted the convenience of EC-wide harmonisation of summertime.
From 1997 clocks will be changed across the EC at the end of March, and at
the end of October. At present continental Europe switches at the end of
September, while the UK and Ireland change at the end of October. If the
Twelve agree, the end of March start for summertime will come into effect
from 1995, with a two-year transition then allowed for adjustments such as
the updating of railway timetables.
The Commission had been unenthusiastic about the proposal originally,
fearing it would invite charges of meddling in national affairs.
Brussels had considered ditching the idea as a sign it was bowing to
'subsidiarity', the doctrine that the EC should only act where national
measures would be insufficient. A clear majority of member states appear to
want the change, however, and are more concerned to rein in the Commission
in other areas.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Hungary devalues as policy shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday further relaxed its exchange rate policy by devaluing the
forint by 4.5 per cent, leaving the national currency 15.1 per cent down on
a year ago.
The government cited the 'need to adjust the forint's exchange rate to its
real rate on international money markets'. Yesterday's was the fifth
devaluation this year and the increasing frequency of currency changes
indicates a shift from Hungary's earlier policy of real appreciation of the
forint.
Behind the change lies a precipitous drop in exports, which in the first
seven months of the year were 27-28 per cent down on a year earlier.
Independent analysts and the National Bank of Hungary's own forecasters now
predict that the export collapse could leave the current account in deficit
by Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) for the year.
The Hungarian authorities aim to finance the current account with capital
inflow but a shortfall of the order forecast would exceed expected foreign
direct investment of Dollars 1.5bn for 1992.
The increasing pace of currency depreciation offers relief to exporters.
But the latest devaluation will increase import prices at a time when
consumer inflation has in any case rebounded to stand at 22.3 per cent in
the year to August.
To offset the inflationary impact of devaluation and allow financing of the
1993 public-sector deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP, the National Bank of
Hungary has increased interest rates.
Last week the central bank raised its base rate by three points to 22 per
cent.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Spain's steel aid backed by Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has backed Spanish government plans to restructure
the steel industry in the north of the country.
Spanish officials in Brussels said yesterday they were happy with the
decision to recommend approval of Ecu2.82bn (Pounds 2.16bn) of aid to CSI,
the state-owned holding company.
But the Commission's decision must now be approved unanimously by EC member
states, two of which - Germany and Italy - are still negotiating with
Brussels about subsidies to their state-owned steelmakers.
In particular, the Commission faces a damaging political row with Germany if
it does not approve plans to subsidise the building of new steelmaking
capacity at the Ekostahl plant in east Germany.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, acknowledged yesterday
that his efforts to block new subsidies for the Italian and Spanish steel
industries had caused friction between Germany and its EC partners.
Bonn has argued that because the aid to Ekostahl would be given only once in
connection with the privatisation of the former communist companies, it
could not be placed in the same category as subsidies for Spanish and
Italian steel companies.
'We have good arguments why Eko is different,' Mr Rexrodt said yesterday.
Industry ministers will next meet in November for what could be their only
chance to vote on the Italian, Spanish and German subsidies. The
Commission's ambitious plan to revive the ailing EC steel industry will fail
if the subsidy issue is not resolved, because private steelmakers will not
agree to capacity cuts if the market still appears to be distorted by state
aid.
The Commission said yesterday it hoped that by approving the Spanish plan,
the whole steel industry would be encouraged to present firm restructuring
proposals. The original deadline for the submission of capacity reduction
plans was today.
The Commission's reluctance to agree the original plan for CSI a year ago
angered Basque and Asturian steelworkers, who would have borne the brunt of
cuts.
Formal approval of the programme still depends on the fulfilment of tough
conditions.
The Spanish authorities must make 'irreversible' cuts in capacity; bring
forward closure of the Anzio steel plant; and convince Brussels that a
majority of funding for building new capacity at Sestao comes from private
investors.
Meanwhile, private producers have been driven into loss by the effects of
recession, overcapacity and low prices.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, is set to propose a
formal investigation into a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) capital injection for
Bull, the French computer manufacturer, granted earlier this year by the
previous French government.
He would ask commissioners to back his call for an inquiry next week.
Only last year, Brussels approved FFr6.6bn of subsidies for Bull, on the
grounds that FFr2.6bn was research funding, and the rest was justified to
help return the company to profitability.

FT  30 SEP 93 / France's communist chief to step down: End of the road for
Marchais - the hardliner who preferred egalite to liberte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Georges Marchais, France's veteran Communist party leader, said yesterday
he would step down next January as the party's general secretary.
'I have held this position for 20 years and you know how old I am,' said Mr
Marchais, 73, who has a history of heart problems and is recovering from a
hip operation.
Mr Marchais, whose bushy eyebrows and booming voice have made him a
favourite target of France's satirists, has not only played a prominent part
in domestic politics but was a key figure in western communism during the
closing years of the cold war.
However, his reign over the French communists has been an era of dramatic
decline. Mr Marchais, long a protege of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, took
the helm in 1972 when the communists were the dominant force on the French
left, with 25 per cent of the vote. But their share had slipped to just over
9 per cent in this spring's first round of voting for the legislative
elections.
The first thorn in the communists' side was the rise of the Socialist party
after its resurrection by Mr Francois Mitterrand in 1971.
The socialists swiftly ousted the communists as the main faction on the
left.
When Mr Mitterrand won the presidential elections in 1981, Mr Marchais
polled 15.3 per cent, the lowest score of any communist leader since 1935.
Many commentators blamed Mr Marchais' orthodox view of communism for the
loss of appeal.
The decline of the Communist party accelerated during the 1980s.
Many of the party's traditional working class supporters defected to Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme-right wing National Front.
At the same time it lost prospective young recruits to Les Verts, the
radical wing of the environmentalist movement.
The party's problems were aggravated by Mr Marchais' refusal to adapt to
changing circumstances. Snubbing public opinion, he backed the 1979 Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan as well as the crackdown on Poland's Solidarity
movement in 1981.
Mr Marchais' hardline views came under regular attack from the reformists
within his party, who lobbied for the French communists to modernise along
the lines of their more dynamic Italian counterparts.
He always succeeded in staving off the attacks on his own position and in
clinging on to his Val-de-Marne constituency in the Paris suburbs, despite
the erosion in the party's support.
His position within the party was reinforced by his high public profile. Mr
Marchais, a miner's son from the Calvados region, was a talented television
performer who styled himself as a wise-cracking demagogue, in stark contrast
to the bourgeois intellectuals who tend to dominate French politics.
However, the attacks on his leadership continued, not least from Mr Charles
Fiterman, the outspoken reformist who is now the favourite to succeed him as
general secretary. Mr Marchais was recently forced to agree to a package of
internal reforms.
The most embarrassing aspect of his career was his second world war record,
which dogged him through the years. While other communists played key roles
in the wartime Resistance, he worked in an aircraft factory in Nazi Germany.
He always argued he was drafted as a forced labourer but never succeeded in
dispelling doubts that he went voluntarily because it offered him a job.
Suffering from arthritis and a weak heart, Mr Marchais said he would retain
his parliamentary seat for the Val-de-Marne.
Despite the rows, the communist leadership yesterday rallied behind their
departing general secretary. Mr Pierre Blotin, a member of the central
committee, described his resignation as 'an important and moving moment'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / US relaxes controls on high-tech exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday announced a sweeping liberalisation of
export controls on computers and other high-technology products and an
increase in subsidised export financing. He set a goal of raising US exports
from about Dollars 700bn (Pounds 455bn) in 1992 to Dollars 1,000bn by 2000.
The long-awaited initiative was developed by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce
secretary, and Mr Ken Brody, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank.
Mr Clinton said at a White House ceremony: 'I don't believe a wealthy
country can grow much richer . . . without expanding exports.'
The initiative was ordered by Congress, which forced the setting up of a
trade promotion co-ordinating committee. This made 65 recommendations,
putting much emphasis on boosting exports by small and medium-sized
businesses. These are expected to do most of the decade's job creation.
The reforms to the export licensing regime alone will reduce regulation on
Dollars 35bn of exports. The proposed liberalisation should significantly
increase the threshold of performance for computers that can be exported
without special licences.
Immediately, exports of computers with performance up to 194m theoretical
operations per second (MTOPS) will be decontrolled for all countries except
the former eastern bloc, China and a few other destinations. This frees
exports of computer workstations and high-performance personal computers.
Then, if there is agreement from members of Cocom - which co-ordinates
policies on restricting the export of products with potential military and
strategic value - controls would be removed from exports of computers with a
performance of up to 500MTOPS.
This second phase of liberalisation would decontrol a much broader range of
computer equipment including multi-processor servers, high-end workstations,
minicomputers and some mainframe computers.
In a move expected to smooth the way for Cocom approval of the plans, the US
will also propose the removal of prior export licensing requirements for
most telecommunications products.
The administration has also updated its definition of supercomputers, which
are used in research laboratories, raising the performance threshold of a
supercomputer from 195MTOPS to 2,000MTOPS. Today's most powerful
supercomputers have performance levels of over 20,000MTOPS. The new
definition will exclude a wide range of computers from export controls.
In export financing, the administration will mount a stronger challenge to
competitors. Mr Brody said Eximbank would switch funds from other programmes
to spend Dollars 150m a year on subsidies. This could produce Dollars 600m
in new sales.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Smith wins 'democracy' vote: Narrow victory for
one-member-one-vote after unity plea from Prescott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH stamped his authority on the Labour party last night with a
narrow but critical victory in his battle to inject greater democracy into
links with trade unions.
After a day of drama and intrigue at the party's Brighton conference, the
Labour leader declared that the decision in favour of a one-member-one-vote
(Omov) system to select parliamentary candidates marked 'a great day for the
Labour party'.
Earlier he had gambled his leadership on the outcome, arguing that without a
willingness to inject democracy into its own decision-making, Labour could
not win the trust of the electorate at a general election.
In a nail-biting conclusion, Mr Smith secured the 47.5 per cent to 44.3 per
cent margin for his plan only after a last-minute switch by the MSF
technical union and a powerful plea for unity from Mr John Prescott, the
party's transport spokesman.
But the Labour leader won comfortable majorities for a series of other
constitutional changes that will reduce trade unions' influence at party
conference and in the election of the leader.
The infamous 'block vote' at the annual conference will be replaced by a
system of individual voting by unions, although they will still wield 70 per
cent of the total votes.
Mr Smith said that by drawing a line under the year-long dispute over
internal democracy, the party could move forward 'to advance our agenda for
full employment and social justice'. He added: 'This is an important step
towards victory at the next general election.'
The victory over opposition led by the party's biggest paymasters - the TGWU
and GMB general unions - was not without confusion. Although the delegates
passed the vital change in party rules sought by Mr Smith, it also supported
a conflicting motion proposed by the TGWU. Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general
secretary, indicated that his union would continue its battle against Omov.
That stance, however, was brushed aside by Mr Smith, who insisted that the
change was irreversible.
Mr John Edmonds of the GMB indicated that he would accept the outcome,
saying the party leadership and the unions could unite behind Mr Smith's
policies for the economy and welfare state. Mr Edmonds added, however, a
warning that any further attempts to diminish the role of the unions would
provoke another damaging battle.
The excruciatingly narrow victory followed a day of arm-twisting, pleading
and cajoling to secure enough votes for Mr Smith. Mr Neil Kinnock, the
former party leader who began the process of reform, emerged as a pivotal
figure in winning over waverers to his successor.
Among the extraordinary tactics employed to persuade smaller trade unions -
and crucially to assure the neutrality of the MSF - was a warning from Mr
Smith that a defeat would wreck separate plans to promote the role of women
in the party.
The other critical point was a passionate address to the conference by Mr
Prescott, a leading figure on the left and a much-trusted figure among
unions. Mr Prescott's unequivocal backing for the proposals contrasted
sharply with attempts by Mrs Margaret Beckett, Mr Smith's deputy, to
distance herself from the plans.
That in turn raised strong speculation - openly encouraged by some members
of the shadow cabinet - that Mr Prescott will face pressure to challenge Mrs
Beckett for the deputy leadership next year.
Leading 'modernisers' in the senior ranks of the party said Labour could
resume the process of dumping the 'ideological baggage' that had cost it
four election defeats. But Mr Smith's declared aim of strengthening rather
than weakening the party's links with the unions were taken as evidence by
many on the left - including Mr Prescott - that he would not risk another
confrontation.
Mr John Major last night accused Mr Smith of surrendering to the unions over
his party's reforms. 'It's policy that people care about and as far as
policy is concerned the unions are still calling the tune and John Smith is
receiving the message on his knees,' he said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / S&amp;N buys GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer pubs for Pounds 703m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; NEWCASTLE, the brewing, retailing and leisure group, has agreed
to buy Grand Metropolitan's Chef &amp; Brewer estate of 1,654 pubs for Pounds
703m.
GrandMet is also selling property interests in 235 of the pubs, owned by
Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL), its joint venture with Courage, for Pounds 94m.
The pubs are believed to have attracted interest from Whitbread and
Allied-Lyons, two of Britain's largest pub operators, during GrandMet's
long-running search for a buyer.
GrandMet's shares, after an initial rise, closed 2p easier at 416p and S&amp;N
were 11p off at 459p. Whitbread, which the market now expects to turn its
attention to Forte's Harvester chain, closed 12p down at 529p.
The deal with S&amp;N, agreed after 10 months' negotiations, will give the group
a national chain of 2,700 pubs and provide greater opportunities to expand
sales of its McEwan's, Theakston and Beck's beer brands from its base in
Scotland and northern England into the south.
Mr Brian Stewart, the group's chief executive, said yesterday: 'The Chef &amp;
Brewer estate consists almost entirely of high-quality, managed outlets and
has considerable unexploited potential.'
S&amp;N will pay Pounds 622m in cash for Chef &amp; Brewer, which on completion of
the deal is expected to have Pounds 81.5m worth of debentures in issue.
The group is raising Pounds 405m in a one-for-four rights issue and will
meet the balance of the cash payment from its resources. The new stock will
be issued at 390p, payable in two instalments.
Because of the government limits imposed on the national brewers' ownership
of pubs, S&amp;N, which already operates about 1,800 pubs, will have to dispose
of 748 outlets from its enlarged estate.
It intends to sell 462 of the Chef &amp; Brewer houses and dispose of the rest
from among its present, smaller outlets.
The disposal process will be helped by a newly-formed subsidiary of Morgan
Grenfell, S&amp;N's financial adviser, which will acquire for Pounds 94m the
interests of IEL in 235 pubs leased to Chef &amp; Brewer, and will later pay S&amp;N
Pounds 22m for another 227 houses. It intends to sell the pubs as quickly as
possible, and S&amp;N and GrandMet have agreed to share any profits or losses
from the sales.
Chef &amp; Brewer, according to S&amp;N estimates, is expected to make profits this
year of at least Pounds 66m, and the acquisition should not dilute earnings
in the first full year after completion.
For GrandMet, which on a different accounting basis values the total deal at
Pounds 830m, the disposal underlines its intentions of developing the group
as an international branded business in food, drinks and retailing. Sir
Allen Sheppard, chairman, said: 'There is no doubt that this is the correct
strategic move.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Vontobel link to Swiss bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VONTOBEL Holding, the Zurich-based private banking group, has taken an
agreed one-third stake in Tardy, de Watteville &amp; Cie, a small Geneva private
bank. It plans to raise its share to two-thirds within two years. The price
paid - in cash and shares - was not disclosed.
The move represents a first step along the path mapped out last May by Mr
Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chairman of Vontobel Holding, to ensure an independent
future for the family-controlled group.
The three existing partners of Tardy, de Watteville will continue to run the
Geneva bank, which employs 55 people and had a balance sheet of SFr94m
(Dollars 64.9m) at the end of July. One partner, Mr Bernard de Watteville,
is to be proposed to the Vontobel board.
Mr Vontobel said the transaction fitted in with plans to reduce the family
shareholding, while ensuring the group remained independent. He hopes to do
this by enlarging the group of shareholders actively involved in management,
as well as by increasing the proportion of shares held by the public from
the present one-third to over a half.
The partnership with Tardy, de Watteville gives Vontobel a presence in
Geneva, a leading private banking centre, and access to new francophone
markets. Vontobel, a quoted company with 540 employees, had an end-1992
balance sheet of SFr1.49bn, and posted group net profits of SFr24.5m last
year.

FT  29 SEP 93 / EC 'social dialogue' underlines divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN employers and trade unions yesterday failed to reach a breakthrough
in talks on bolstering European competitiveness, but both sides agreed to
co-operation in order to narrow differences and overcome mutual suspicion.
The annual 'social dialogue' summit in Brussels between employers'
representatives and trade unions was billed as a step towards achieving a
consensus on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the same rates as the
US and Japan.
But both sides were reluctant to commit themselves to a joint position on
how to reconcile the EC's need to improve job creation with the preservation
of the welfare state.
Mr Norman Willis, president of the ETUC, made clear that his priority was to
safeguard social benefits and to tackle the recession. Mr Carlos Ferrer,
president of Unice, the employers' federation, stressed the need for new
models to tackle mass unemployment.
Before the meeting, employers asked Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, to refrain from a direct call for a European-wide
social pact as widely advertised in the run-up to the summit. Mr Delors
agreed, but later made no secret of his interest in the idea.
The Commission president said the EC was in danger of becoming simply an
'economic space', marked by a lack of solidarity and a lack of political
direction. He believed that a tripartite pact between governments, employers
and trade unions on the lines of similar agreements on the continent could
be a 'fantastic idea'.
Unions and employers agreed to set up a committee on competitiveness to
study how to improve European job creation. The two sides will make some
joint submissions for Mr Delors's White Paper on competitiveness. They
reserved the right to make separate reports before the EC summit in December
in Brussels.

The French government is considering requests from publicly owned companies
for more than FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in new capital. In general it has
resisted large injections of capital in an attempt to limit the budget
deficit, targeted at FFr317bn this year.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Air France, the loss-making airline,
has requested about FFr5bn in recapitalisation, while Compagnie Generale de
Maritime wants FFr500m. Aerospatiale, the aerospace group, said yesterday
that it sought about FFr3bn to finance new programmes. Bull, the loss-making
computer manufacturer which is drawing up a restructuring plan, would not
confirm it wanted FFr9bn.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (29): A pleasant place to do business - Best
cuisine in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIMA does not have a pretty reputation. A bloated population, mushrooming
slums, terrorism and economic chaos have seen to that. One Peruvian
commentator, writing in the mid-1980s, complained bitterly of attacks,
kidnappings, rapes and murders, characteristics which, he said, had
'coincided with increasingly aggressive driving habits.'
Wayward driving is still all-too obvious, but Lima itself is in many ways
one of Latin America's more pleasant capitals. The phone system works,
violence has abated, bureaucracy is minimal and Peruvian cuisine is often
excellent.
A 1960s description of Lima as an open, airy place may strike some as a
little ironic of a city often enveloped in mist and pollution. Nonetheless,
Lima can be an enjoyable place in which to do business.
Airport: Customs formalities are fairly straightforward. No visas are
required for citizens of western Europe, the US, Canada, Japan or most Latin
American countries. There are no restrictions on bringing in or taking out
currency. If you are staying for more than two weeks, you may be required to
pay a tax (refundable on leaving the country) on electronic items. There is
a Dollars 17.50 airport tax payable on international flights. A taxi from
the airport can cost anything from Dollars 10-Dollars 30. Haggle.
Hotels: Most business people stay in Miraflores, a coastal suburb about a
20-minute drive from downtown Lima. Now the capital's main social centre,
Miraflores is spilling over with restaurants, shops and hotels. Hotels
include El Condado (Alcanfores 465, tel: 443 614); Miraflores Cesar (La Paz
y Diez Canseco, tel: 441 212) and Las Americas (Av. Benavides 415, tel: 459
494). All three have air conditioning, satellite TV, fax service, bars and
restaurants. For longer visits you might consider one of Miraflores' many
short-stay apartment blocks.
The downtown Lima area has many beautiful old hotels, among them the Grand
Bolivar (Union 958, tel: 276 400). Even if you do not stay here, it can be a
wonderful place to have a pisco sour (Peru's national drink) on the terrace.
There is also the Sheraton (Paseo de la Republica, tel: 333 320). In the
off-season it is usually possible to negotiate substantial discounts. All
hotels add on taxes of up to 30 per cent.
Personal security: Sendero bombings are much less frequent since the capture
of Abimael Guzman, although an attack on the US embassy in July demonstrates
that the terrorist threat is not yet a thing of the past. President Fujimori
is fond of saying that Lima is no more dangerous than Florence, London or
New York - a claim somewhat negated by the number of heavily armed guards
stationed outside most office buildings.
Many offices require you to leave some form of picture identification at
reception before entering. It is probably best to carry a driving licence or
a photocopy of your passport. (One FT employee found his London Underground
travel pass perfectly adequate.)
As in any big city, walking around aimlessly at night is probably not a good
idea. Robbery is not uncommon (robbery with violence is). But there is no
need for the paranoia exhibited by some visitors. Miraflores and San Isidro
are generally safe.
Transport: Most large hotels have official cabs stationed outside which can
be hired per trip or for the day. Hotel cars have the advantage of being a
little more comfortable, safer (most have seat belts) and the driver is
likely to know where he is going.
But do not rule out flagging down some of the dilapidated Volkswagens which
ply Lima's streets. It is useful to know the name of a landmark near to your
final destination, as taxi drivers (often off-duty military or out-of-work
salesmen) sometimes do not know their way around too well. Fix a price
before you get in.
Internal flights to the main cities are frequent, if not regular. Early
morning flights tend to leave on time, but as the day wears on the timetable
can slip.
Leave plenty of time for connecting flights. Faucett (336 364), AeroPeru
(478 333), Americana (478 662), Expresso Aereo (452 545) and AeroCondor (425
663) all run services to main provincial towns.
Telephones: Peru's telephone service is probably pitched somewhere between
that of Mexico and Chile. It is usually fairly easy to dial direct but line
quality is sometimes poor, especially for sending data. International calls
can also be made through the operator on 108.
Restaurants: Peruvians boast that their cuisine is the best in Latin
America, a sentiment echoed by many visitors. Hotel food is often expensive
and internationalised and it is usually better to eat out. Seafood is often
excellent and highly spiced.
Ceviche is a cold dish of seafood, onion and hot green pepper. There is also
chupe de camorones, a shrimp stew, as well as potato dishes such as causa
and carapulcra. Olives are big and succulent. Coffee can also be very good -
for a strong espresso coffee with milk as drunk in Europe or the US, ask for
a cortado. You should also try Inca Kola at least once: a bubble-gum
flavoured soft drink which is Peru's answer to its more famous international
counterparts.
Recommended restaurants in Miraflores include: La Trattoria for home-made
pasta and imaginative salads (Manuel Bonilla 106, tel: 467 002); Rosa
Nautica, built on a pier, opulent (Espigon no 4, Lima bay, tel: 470 057);
Costa Verde, also with wonderful views of Pacific and good seafood (tel: 772
424); Las Tejas, a moderately priced Peruvian restaurant with good fish and
chicken dishes (Diez Canseco 340, tel: 444 360). Luigi's (Benavides) is
excellent for breakfast while Haiti (Diagonal) is a good place for coffee
and a snack.
Health: It is probably advisable to drink bottled water, although it is
perfectly safe to brush your teeth with tap water. As in most developing
countries, be wary of eating salads. Drinks are probably better sin hielo
(without ice). Ask instead for your drink bien helada (refrigerated).
Some Peruvian food is highly spiced. While most of it is perfectly safe to
eat you may find your stomach reacting a little to the change of cuisine.
The cholera epidemic, prevalent in 1991, has largely passed and is not
likely to affect you.
Weekend trips: Paracas is a coastal resort about two hours' drive from Lima.
Not only does it often have sun in winter, when Lima is soaking in damp
mist, but also it has a seal colony and a marine reserve. The Hotel Paracas
is comfortable and has excellent food (reservations in Lima, 465 079).
An hour or so beyond Paracas is the superb hotel Las Dunas, at Ica, another
favourite weekend retreat for capital-dwellers, especially in winter. Enjoy
sun or sand-surfing, or visit some of the local vineyards. Pisco, Peru's
famous grape brandy, is made near here. You can also take a small aircraft
and overfly the amazing Nazca lines. (Las Dunas - reservations in Lima, 424
180).
Also available for the sports-minded is white-water rafting. Closest to Lima
is in the pretty Canete valley, about two hours away. Ask a tour agency
(like Lima Tours, tel: 276 624) to make reservations.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (28): Review report awaited - Anti-drugs
efforts in Peru have been thrown into confusion by a shift in US policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new US administration and its shift in drugs policy threw anti-drugs
efforts in Peru into confusion.
This month the US Drugs Enforcement Agency said it would probably have to
cease operations out of the Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga
valley, Peru's main coca-growing area. The base is being put in jeopardy by
cuts called for by the US Senate in the State Department's anti-drugs
efforts.
Meanwhile the US administration is carrying out an inter-agency review of
its anti-narcotics efforts, which is expected to result in a reduced
emphasis on international interdiction and eradication efforts. Human rights
concerns, after President Fujimori's institutional coup on April 5 last
year, have already led to cuts in US military aid. The US Senate voted last
week to suspend aid to Peru until it compensates survivors of a US airman
killed when a Peruvian military aircraft strafed a US C-130 transport
aircraft on a Peruvian-authorised anti-narcotics mission in April 1992.
The Santa Lucia base - which costs an annual Dollars 13m - seems to have
succeeded in reducing trafficking out of the Huallaga Valley - only to move
it to more remote areas.
'It's worked as far as it goes, but you'd need 20 or 30 Santa Lucias to be
able to control the main trafficking regions in the country,' says one US
official.
Nearly two thirds of the world's supply of cocaine comes from coca produced
in Peru. The US State Department said in a report to Congress in February
that there are 129,100 hectares under coca production, of which over half is
in the Huallaga valley. (Peruvian officials often cite an area twice as big
or more.)
Official Peruvian policy is aimed at containing the growth of coca
production. It emphasises alternative development for farmers and crop
substitution, a solution hindered by the remoteness of the coca-growing
areas and a lack of roads.
Peru ratified the 1988 UN convention on narcotics in January 1992, after
which legislation was introduced to make money laundering a crime and to
control chemicals used in cocaine production.
The police have been responsible for anti-narcotics operations; the army for
the fight against terrorism. The links between drugs traffickers and
terrorism brought calls for efforts to be better co-ordinated.
However, the police have generally been jealous of their territory, while
the army is often accused of being in the pay of drugs traffickers.
Retired General Gaston Ibanez O'Brien denies that the corruption of army
officers by drugs traffickers is as widespread as often depicted. Still he
admits it goes on. 'Where there are drugs, there is corruption. It's fatal.'
The problem is worsened by low pay: a general commanding a division is paid,
he says, Dollars 320 a month. 'People are vulnerable when they are paid so
little: it's not justifiable but it's understandable.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (27): This was no ordinary skeleton . . . -
The tomb of the Lord of Sipan is the richest ever found in the Americas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the wonderland that is Peru, the line is a fine one between the magical
and the banal, the magnificent and the absurd.
Never more so than on the March day when a 1700- year-old skeleton was
received by the president at Lima's military airport with all the honours
normally accorded a head of state.
This was no ordinary skeleton, of course. Its arrival, together with others,
marked the triumphal return of the 'Lord of Sipan' and his entourage, whose
tomb, excavated in 1987, is the richest ever discovered in the Americas.
After five years of meticulous restoration work at Germany's Mainz museum,
the matchless contents of the tomb are now back in Lambayeque, the northern
Peruvian province where the pre-Columbian Moche culture flourished between
the first and seventh centuries AD.
But they will soon be on the move again.
From September, the Lord of Sipan and his treasures are scheduled for
exhibition in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, with the intention of
putting Peru squarely back on the archaeological - and, it is fervently
hoped, the tourist - map.
Briefly displayed to selected guests in Lima's government palace, the Sipan
treasures are breathtaking.
They include huge gold earrings inlaid with turquoise; intricately beaded
pectorals; head-dresses; a shield of solid gold weighing almost two pounds.
Then there is what experts call the finest single item of pre-Columbian
jewellery ever unearthed - a tiny warrior-priest wielding a miniature war
club, clad in a removable necklace and girded by a belt of tiny bells the
size of pinheads, each attached with gold wire. The figure is no larger than
a a man's thumb.
Small wonder that, down the centuries since the Spanish conquest four
hundred years ago, graves such as the Lord of Sipan's, with their exquisite
contents, have fallen prey to looters. In recent years the international
market has become increasingly avid for pre-Colombian art. Until the
discovery of the Sipan tomb, no Moche tomb had been discovered intact by
archaeologists.
The story of the Sipan discovery, which began in February 1987, is almost as
exciting as the treasures it produced. Mr Walter Alva, an archaeologist then
working at the Bruning museum in Lambayeque, received a late night telephone
call from the local police chief asking him to come urgently to examine
certain objects recovered in a raid on a local grave-robber's home.
While the telephone call was not a particularly unusual event, the recovered
booty certainly was. Some 30 items, including gilded cat-face masks, a
golden head with eyes of lapis-lazuli and several other perfectly crafted
gold objects, suggested that the looters had stumbled across an important
find.
Anxiously - but in the gloomy expectation of finding nothing but the
looters' rejects - Alva and his police chief ally followed the trail back to
Sipan.
There they found evidence of extensive tunnelling into a Moche 'platform'
built, like the famous pyramids of the Lambayeque valley, of sun-baked adobe
bricks. This platform, however, was a mere 33 feet high  - an easy
proposition for entire families of looters to plunder under cover of dark.
Local resentment boiled over at the arrival of archaeologists and police,
who were considered merely a higher class of thief. Ugly clashes followed;
one looter was shot dead. During the following year of excavations, the site
had to be protected by round-the-clock guards.
The early weeks were spent in clearing away rubble left by the tunnellers.
Dr Alva recalls: 'It was heart-breaking to find broken fragments of
jewellery and pottery, discarded for their lack of commercial saleability
but invaluable to the archaeologist.'
But, digging deeper, prospects for an important find improved when Dr Alva
and his assistant came across a contorted skeleton with its feet cut off.
Logic suggested that the remains were those of the 'guardian' of some
important personage; the amputation performed to ensure that he could never
 -even in death - desert his master.
Not far below this skeleton, Alva hit the archaeologist's ultimate jackpot:
an untouched wooden sarcophagus, banded with copper straps.
'For several seconds I couldn't breathe,' Dr Alva recalls. 'Then I gasped:
'A coffin] Sealed] And it's never been opened]'
The Lord of Sipan was the highest authority of the Moches; his supreme
powers encompassed all aspects of religious, civil and military life. Moche
tradition demanded that his possessions could be not inherited, but would be
buried along with him for use in the afterlife.
The wealth of this one man was stunning. Eleven elaborate pectorals
accompanied him to the grave, together with several gold headdresses and
various sets of ear ornaments.
A retinue of eight persons served as tomb companions for the Lord of Sipan.
They included two young women (presumed to be his wives or concubines), two
warriors and a child. The fragile bones, already half dust and splinters,
had to be coated with acrylic preservative before they could be lifted from
the tomb.
A side chamber revealed more than 1100 ceramic vessels arranged in
apparently ritualistic patterns. Some depict iguanas, the creatures which,
in Moche belief, ferried mortals to the afterworld. Unlike the Lord's
personal accoutrements, Dr Alva says, 'These look as if they were hastily
made on the death of the warlord, to meet some criterion of quantity rather
than quality.'
A recurrent motif in Moche craftsmanship is the 'decapitator god' who
combines elements of bird and cat. Although the Moche people were primarily
agriculturalists, a farming community, successfully turning the arid
Lambayeque valley into a fertile oasis, their rituals were bloodthirsty.
Moche art routinely depicts military activity. The prime purpose of forays
into neighbouring territory seems to have been to capture enemy warriors.
Moche pottery graphically depicts them being taken prisoner, stripped of
their weapons and clothing and paraded, ropes around their necks, before
their captors.
In the final sacrifice, the prisoners' throats are cut, and their blood
drained into elegant goblets which are offered to high-priest/warrior
figures. Dr Alva and other eminent archaeologists believe that the Lord of
Sipan was one such figure.
The Sipan tomb and its contents are likely to prove a big attraction both
within Peru and abroad.
As Dr Alva points out: 'Archaeological finds are often displayed as a
collection of separate objects - in this case the tomb gives a context. All
the information we have about Moche workmanship, ritual and customs can be
effectively presented around that tomb.'
And, as the Lord of Sipan prepares to sets out again on his travels as a
roving ambassador for the promotion of Peruvian culture, excavation at Sipan
continues to reveal more tombs - with the tantalising prospect of unearthing
more exquisite treasures belonging to another of equivalent rank to the Lord
of Sipan.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (26): A paradise for pioneering spirits - The
tourist industry is working to change the country's negative image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ancient Inca festival of Inti Raymi, celebrating the midsummer solstice,
is one of Peru's great tourist occasions.
In a spectacular three-hour pageant inside the sacred fortress of
Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco, locals re-enact the legendary clash between the Inca
and Spanish cultures. Fantastically colourful costumes and swirling dances
accompanied by a solemn narrative intoned in Quechua make for an
unforgettable experience.
Much of the charm of festivals such as Inti Raymi - repeated on different
themes and different levels of splendour throughout the year in every
Peruvian town, village and hamlet - is that they are not organised for the
tourist. They are times when local people abandon everyday austerity and
give themselves over totally to music, dance, religious or pagan ritual -
and drink.
Tourism in Peru is not for the faint-hearted. With a few important
exceptions, a certain pioneering spirit is required. Travelling by road and
air, while easier every day, demands stamina and good humour - flights may
be cancelled without warning, carefully booked hotel reservations may prove
untraceable.
For the past five years, numbers of tourists have plummeted from a high of
120,000 to maybe a quarter of that. Any news abroad concerning Peru seemed
bad news. Hyperinflation, economic chaos and guerrilla violence (although
tourists were rarely caught up in it) kept all but the most adventurous -
some would say the foolhardy - away.
Now Peru is working hard to change that image. 'Tourism is the great
multiplier,' says Mr Victor Joy Way, third vice-president of Peru, formerly
minister of trade and tourism. 'It creates a market for craftsmen, a boost
for restaurant-owners, taxi drivers, tour guides - almost everyone in a
community benefits.'
The fall-off in tourism has hit Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital, worst of
all. 'More than 95 per cent of local inhabitants are partially dependent on
tourism,' says Mr Edwin Gonzalez, manager of El Libertador hotel and a
director of the hoteliers' chamber. 'Since the 1988 collapse, many hotels
have closed, special tourist buses have been sold and experienced staff have
found other jobs. When the tourists come back in numbers, we'll be
unprepared.'
June and July were better months, however. Occupancy rates, at about 25 per
cent, were up on the previous year, although well below the 40 per cent
needed to break even. Europeans currently account for over half of all
visitors to Cuzco, according to Mr Gonzalez, replacing the Americans who are
still dissuaded by their embassy from travelling within Peru.
Lima hotels are now busier than for several years past, although the
mini-boom is largely business-led, according to Mr Eduardo Arrarte,
president of Canatur, the national tourist chamber. He points out that
international recession has hit the tourist industry worldwide in recent
years, but 'Peru's image is still bad, or it has improved only at the
highest, governmental levels. The message hasn't got down to the travelling
public yet.'
Changing trends in world tourism should eventually favour Peru, he says. The
average tourist, who wants to visit as many places as quickly as possible,
will be the mainstay of the market for many years to come, but specialist
tours are in ever greater demand. Peru is a paradise for nature-lovers,
bird-watchers and butterfly enthusiasts; the high Andes are wonderful,
largely unexplored terrain for hikers and climbers; and alongside the
long-famous Inca cities of Cuzco and Machu Picchu are dozens of less
familiar sites and less renowned cultures.
Adventure tourism is also growing. Paragliding and bungee-jumping have
caught on, while opportunities abound for white-water rafting, some as
little as two hours away from Lima. Peru's Pacific rollers draw surfers from
many countries.
While convinced that development of tourism must be a matter for the private
sector, the government is doing what it can to provide the bases for growth.
Deregulation of domestic airways has already spawned a clutch of small
airline companies which have inaugurated new air services to a number of
hitherto remote provincial towns. And the transport ministry has made a
priority of asphalting stretches of roads leading to tourist attractions.
Outside Lima, hotel infrastructure leaves much to be desired. But investment
has already begun. The discovery of the tomb of the Lord of Sipan led
directly to the construction of three new hotels in the nearby coastal city
of Chiclayo. And El Libertador, Cuzco's leading hotel, is expanding capacity
from 130 rooms to 250 in anticipation of a tourist boom.
South Korean hoteliers are reported to be taking a close look at investment
opportunities in Cuzco. Their government has offered Peru Dollars 18m to
rehabilitate the city's airport and feasibility studies are under way. One
prime hotel property which could soon become available is the former
monastery of San Antonio Abad, owned by Cuzco's archbishopric. Dollars 4m
has already been spent on it.
The government and Canatur would like to see cities such as Ayacucho - most
famous as the cradle of Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path, but also one
of Peru's loveliest colonial towns - become tourist centres. Official
estimates are that the average tourist spends Dollars 1,200 in a week's
stay, a potentially huge boost to national and local economies.
'The first tourists will be guinea-pigs, of course,' admits Mr Arrarte.
'They'll be roughing it a bit, but that's how it always starts. I bet we
find some very happy pioneers for Ayacucho.'
One opportunity to 'sell' Peru falls on November 4 next year, when a total
solar eclipse will be visible from the southern Peruvian coast. All 5,000
available hotel beds in the area have already been reserved by international
travel agencies.
'When those people come, visit a few other places, go home safe and happy
and tell their friends, it'll be the best promotion we've had for years,'
says Mr Arrarte. it

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (24): The future lies in returning to the
past - Traditional methods to restore an Inca canal will irrigate unusable
land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HUNDREDS of metres sheer above the valley floor near Ollantaytambo, in Cuzco
province, an ancient Inca irrigation canal hugs the contours of the
mountainside. Below are agricultural terraces abandoned for centuries by the
descendants of those who built them.
Soon however, these narrow strips of land - which often look more like a
stairway than a field - will be fertile once again with corn, wheat,
potatoes and the traditional Andean crops of quinua, kiwicha and tarwi.
Under the supervision of Dr Ann Kendall and a part-time team of visiting
British archaeologists, local labourers are reconstructing the stone-built
canal which once allowed them not only to feed themselves, but also to sell
a substantial agricultural surplus to surrounding towns.
Dr Kendall, who has spent 26 years on and off in Peru since writing her
doctoral thesis, embarked on canal reconstruction 15 years ago. The
Cusichaca Trust, which she founded, receives financial support from
Britain's Overseas Development Agency (ODA), although the initiative for the
rebuilding work on the six-kilometre Pumamarca canal came from the community
of Ollantaytambo itself.
The technology used in rebuilding is described by Dr Kendall as
'traditional' - using materials as nearly as possible the same as those used
by the Incas. Clay and stones are gathered from the rocky mountainside for
the retaining walls. Grated cactus provides an on-the-spot strengthening
agent.
'This is a tectonic area and there's almost constant minor earth movement,'
Dr Kendall explains. 'To use cement here has proved disastrous. Clay, on the
other hand, is wonderfully plastic and keeps the canal stable. Any small
landslide damage can be easily repaired using local materials - which, of
course, are virtually free.'
Traditional technology is slower and more labour-intensive than modern
bulldozers and cement mixers, but in this timeless land there is no lack of
volunteers. About 30 local men are employed on a weekly basis, working under
the supervision of a master mason from Ollantaytambo. They are paid
principally in food.
'An important part of our work also consists in training these men,' says Dr
Kendall. 'Some who have gone back to their villages are now looking at
possibilities for rebuilding ancient canals in their own areas too.'
The Pumamarca canal is costing about Dollars 225,000 over three years. It
will irrigate 160 hectares of otherwise almost unusable land. Today,
villagers may plant a crop on some terraces, but the unirrigated soil must
lie fallow for five years out of six; canal irrigation will allow them to
harvest two crops a year, including a plentiful surplus to sell.
At a little over Dollars 1,400 per hectare, the cost of the Cusichaca
Trust's canal rehabilitation scheme compares very favourably with that of
'traditional' irrigation works with dams and reservoirs.
'We're giving people an alternative to migration to the towns where, in any
case, there's no work and they must often live in appalling conditions,'
says Dr Kendall. 'With the possibility of new land here, we're already
starting to see reverse migration.'
The aptly named Mr David Canal, the recently elected president of the
Ollantaytambo community, says the number of local inhabitants applying for a
share of the communally-owned agricultural lands has almost doubled this
year. Once the canal is completed, the 'comuneros' to whom land is granted
will assume the obligation of maintaining the waterway.
'These are the old ways, the ancient techniques and our own resources,' he
says. 'We have always admired the achievements of our Inca ancestors, and
that gives us confidence in what we are doing here.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (25): Heeding the call of the deep - Coastal
fishing may over-exploit stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLIGHT into Lima on a clear day tells you a lot about the Peruvian fishing
industry. Seemingly hundreds of small boats are crowded along a narrow strip
of Pacific shoreline in pursuit of sardines and anchovy, most of which is
destined to be processed into fishmeal in one of the numerous coastal
factories.
The number of boats indicates the size of the industry in Peru, which last
year became the world's number one fishmeal producer, exporting a total of
1.37m tonnes. The boats' proximity to the coast also demonstrates the
shortcomings of the national fleet which, for the main part, cannot venture
into deeper waters where huge resources of horse and jack mackerel remain
largely unexploited.
According to Mr Cesar Chavez, executive director of the Peruvian Marine
Institute, the country is fishing close to its maximum sustainable level in
terms of anchovy and sardines. He believes that fishing companies should
concentrate their expansion efforts on jack mackerel, which can be processed
into fishmeal or sold for human consumption in Latin American markets such
as Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia. Last year only 100,000 tonnes of jack
mackerel were netted against a sustainable catch estimated by Mr Chavez at
2m tonnes.
To achieve such catches companies would have to invest heavily in
refrigerated deep-sea boats fitted with electronic equipment capable of
pin-pointing fast-moving shoals of jack mackerel. 'There has been
modernisation taking place,' says Mr Ismael Benavides, former fisheries
minister, 'but there's still a lot to be done.'
'Fishing has traditionally been too easy and too accessible,' he says. 'If
you can catch anchovy off the coast, why go out and fish for mackerel.' He
sees this attitude as short-sighted. 'The incentive would be that you could
fish all year round without the limitations of fishing bans. The other
advantage would be that you could use part of the catch for human
consumption and get better prices.'
Mr Salomon Manzur, president of Carolina fishmeal and canning company,
agrees that jack mackerel is 'very important to the future of the industry'.
Carolina is completing designs of two modern boats, which will cost a total
of Dollars 12m and which Mr Manzur hopes will be catching a quarter of a
million tonnes of jack mackerel by next year.
Most analysts agree that to consolidate on recent improvements in the
industry, Peru needs to take the twin-track approach of making fishmeal
production more efficient while expanding into other more lucrative areas,
such as canning, freezing and aqua-culture.
The debate is becoming more pressing with the proposed sale of state-owned
Pesca Peru, which produces about 40 per cent of Peruvian fishmeal in 20
antiquated plants along the length of the coast. There are growing fears
that if these factories are transferred to the private sector they will
become better managed, creating greater pressure on finite anchovy
resources.
'The problem in the short or medium term is that if the capacity keeps
increasing the fish resources will become exhausted,' says Mr Victor
Ostolaza, vice-president at Carolina. He estimates that there is already a
five-fold overcapacity in fishmeal production, a situation that would only
deteriorate if Pesca Peru factories were transferred to private hands.
Carolina, in conjunction with other private sector operators, hopes to
persuade the government not to sell Pesca Peru, but to close down its plants
instead. Proposals have been mooted to set up a fund collected by means of a
special industry tax which would be used to compensate the state for loss of
sales earnings.
The government is hoping to raise at least Dollars 200m from the
privatisation of Pesca Peru, although industry insiders describe this figure
as inflated. Mr Marco Espino of the Marine Institute says that fears over
fish stocks are unwarranted. He is confident that existing legislation,
which prevents the introduction of additional fleet capacity, will safeguard
fish levels. Potential changes brought about by the sale of state assets are
primarily 'social and economic', he says. 'Happily, they will not effect the
resource itself.'
But private sector worries continue. Among the most persistent is a fear
that Pesca Peru, which is to be sold off in separate units, may be snapped
up by the Chinese who last year bought 60 per cent of Peruvian fishmeal. The
concern is that private companies will be squeezed out of that lucrative
market and that the close relationship between Chinese buyers and sellers of
fishmeal could depress prices.
Whatever the outcome, it is certain that there is room for greater
efficiency and quality control in fishmeal production. According to Mr
Benavides, the fish to fishmeal ratio in Peru is about 19 per cent, a
recuperation rate that could be raised to 23 per cent.
There have been private sector efforts to modernise plant both to increase
efficiency and to produce fishmeal with higher protein content and lower
toxicity for sale to specialist markets. The private sector estimates that
it has spent a total of Dollars 200m in modernisation over the past two
years.
Mr Benavides says that such efforts must continue. 'The future for Peruvian
fishing is to be more efficient in fishmeal production and to try to
diversify into other areas such as canning, freezing and aquaculture.' He
sees great potential in areas such as shrimp farming (Malaysian shrimp
thrive in the Peruvian jungle), turbot and trout. Chile's highly successful
development of a thriving salmon industry points the way, he says. 'Frozen
fish is another interesting area that has yet to be exploited.'
Mr Espino agrees. The main challenge now facing the industry, he says, is to
diversify into more profitable areas. 'The aim should be to copy New Zealand
which has added a great deal of value to relatively small fish stocks. That
is the future.'

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (23): High export potential - There is almost
no known crop which cannot be grown in Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING could look less like prime agricultural land than Peru's coastal
strip, a 2,800km ribbon of greyish moonscape desert where rain never falls.
Yet there are 760,000 hectares of irrigated land already available, ideal
for a wide variety of export fruit and vegetable crops - about five times
the area on which Chile's agro-industrial boom is based.
There is almost no known crop which cannot be grown somewhere in Peru. The
coast is particularly well suited to high-price export crops such as
asparagus, melon, tomatoes, grapes, broccoli and snow peas. The temperate
climate and absence of rain means that there are effectively no seasons, so
produce can be harvested year round and 'windows' in international markets
exploited.
For years, Peruvian and foreign agriculturalists have been aware of this
potential. Until recently, however, legislation on land tenure has prevented
development.
Under the land reform enacted by General Velasco's military government 25
years ago, huge, privately-owned coastal haciendas were turned into
co-operatives. Elsewhere, minifundios - tiny plots worked by a single family
 -proliferated. A downward spiral of inefficiency and decapitalisation
converted Peru from a once flourishing exporter of sugar, rice and cotton to
a net importer of all those products.
Peruvian agriculture has now been on the decline for 40 years. In the decade
1950-1960, the sector accounted for more than 20 per cent of gdp. By 1970 it
had fallen below 15 per cent and, for the past 13 years it has hovered at
between 11 and 13 per cent.
'Traditional' exports from the former haciendas - primarily rice, sugar and
cotton - have slumped. Last year, for the first time, 'non-traditional'
produce (asparagus, cocoa, exotic fruits, colourants and so on) overtook the
historically more important crops, earning Dollars 151m in foreign exchange,
Dollars 36m more than their 'traditional' rivals.
'But Peru's potential is only relative unless there are adequate
conditions,' says Mr Salomon Diaz, a cochineal exporter and president of
Adex, the agro-industrial committee of the exporters' association. 'The
state still needs to devise positive export-oriented strategies to convert
Peru into an important agro-industrial exporter.'
Agricultural policy has always focused on big spending projects - irrigation
works more often than not. Research has been starved of funds. It has never
been directed towards identifying opportunities in national and
international markets.
The Fujimori government has laid down some essential foundations for the
modernisation of agriculture. Land has been declared a freely tradeable
commodity, strict land-holding limits have been relaxed and foreigners put
on an equal footing with Peruvian nationals for investment purposes.
Advances against terrorism have brought relative tranquillity back to the
countryside. Taming inflation has been especially important for medium to
long term activities such as farming.
But serious problems remain. 'Less than ten per cent of Peruvian farmers
hold legal title to their land, which prevents them using it as collateral
for credit,' says Mr Diaz. 'Then, financing costs - at about 18 per cent a
year - are absurdly high. So are costs of energy and transport.'
In the Andean highlands there is no agricultural land left. The jungle has
some 4,000 hectares suitable for cultivation, but lack of roads and
transport infrastructure renders this land almost useless. At least in the
short term, development must therefore centre on the coastal strip.
Here the old haciendas, now co-operatives, remain in possession of some of
the best irrigated coastal land. But according to Mr Diaz, they are wasting
the scarce resource of water by growing thirsty crops like rice and
sugar-cane.
'Peru's coast has the great advantage that, because there's no rain,
irrigation is man-managed. With high technology methods - drip or sprinkler
systems - we could irrigate four times the area with the same amount of
water we're now expending on crops we'd do better to import.'
Modern irrigation methods mean that even a five-hectare plot (and two-thirds
of all Peruvian farmers have less than that) becomes economically viable if
intensively cultivated with high-value export products. 'But the farmer
needs support from the state to switch. A Chilean farmer can bring in
irrigation equipment and claw back the import tariffs once he starts
exporting. We can't,' says Mr Diaz.
Mr Carlos Bolona, a former economy minister, would promote change and
efficiency in the sector by different means. 'Until the state charges
farmers a realistic price for the water they consume,' he says, 'they'll
never switch from the 'easy' crops to valuable export products.'
So far, the star of those crops is asparagus; exports last year topped
Dollars 26m. Export values of mangoes, mandarine oranges, grapes, apples and
bananas all stand at about Dollars 5m a year, the point at which, according
to Mr Diaz, they create their own export momentum and you can 'stop worrying
about them'. 1992 export earnings from cocoa products totalled over Dollars
13m. Colourants (marigold, annatto, cochineal and carmine) brought in
Dollars 24m. Principal buyers were the US and, in Europe, the Low Countries,
followed by Germany and Spain.
Agro-industry, in a small way, already exists in each of Peru's widely
distinct geographical zones and each specialises in a different range of
crops. The northern coast produces high-quality mangoes, bananas, passion
fruit and lemon-limes; the centre: asparagus, broccoli, green beans,
snow-peas and grapes; the south: beans (which have considerable export
potential), garlic, onions and oregano.
'All these are products in international demand, which Peruvian farmers have
long experience in growing,' says Mr Diaz. 'It wouldn't be difficult to
double or triple export quality output in the short term.'
The Andes and the jungle, too, have their own specialities. Peru's high
mountains (home of the potato) produce high-protein grains such as quinua
and kiwicha, which are starting to acquire an international reputation.
Other products include tarwi, a host of medicinal plants and herbs and the
colourant cochineal, of which Peru is the world's leading producer.
Descending the eastern slopes of the Andes towards the Amazon basin, crops
give way to world-class coffee and cocoa, annatto and every conceivable
tropical fruit.
'We're sleeping on our comparative advantages,' warns Mr Diaz. 'One of
Peru's best fruits, which we hardly export, is the chirimoya (custard
apple). But Chile has planted perhaps 400 hectares and is already strongly
entering the international market.'
Paradoxically, it may finally be the Chileans who get things moving in Peru.
Chilean entrepreneurs are in Peru now, sizing up opportunities for land
purchase.
'They've been through this themselves. They're aware that Peru's climatic
conditions are even better than their own - they know it's going to be
excellent business,' says Mr Bolona.
