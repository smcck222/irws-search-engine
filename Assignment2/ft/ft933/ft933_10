FT  16 SEP 93 / Lloyd's faces 'lingering demise': Gloomy forecast shows
reinsurance failures helping to keep market in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNDICATES at Lloyd's of London are suffering additional losses because of a
number of failures of reinsurance companies, according to Chatset, the
company which monitors the results of syndicates at the insurance market.
Up to 40 syndicates have mentioned reinsurance failures as a contributing
factor to losses in their accounts for 1990, according to Mr Oliver
Carruthers, a Chatset consultant.
Chatset believes that the insolvencies mean syndicates cannot claim in full
on some reinsurance policies they had taken out and this could cost the
market as much as Pounds 500m.
News of the problem emerged when Chatset presented a gloomy assessment of
the market's recent performance and prospects in its annual Lloyd's League
Tables.
Following losses of Pounds 2.9bn in 1990 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989, Chatset
forecasts that Lloyd's will lose a further Pounds 1.5bn over the next two
years when it reports results for 1991 and 1992.
'For 1992 we believe that another overall loss is inevitable,' Chatset said.
'The future for Lloyd's is bleak,' it added, saying that the market faced 'a
lingering demise, going down with a whimper rather than a bang as Names are
crushed'.
Chatset is particularly gloomy about the weight of US asbestosis and
pollution claims arising on policies underwritten up to 40 years ago.
Lloyd's announced earlier this year that it is intending to transfer some of
its reserves for claims on all policies underwritten before 1986 into a new
reinsurance company, NewCo, effectively 'ring fencing' new investors from
these liabilities.
These reserves, which are contained in Lloyd's premium trust fund, amount to
several billion pounds, but may need to be topped up because syndicates use
different actuarial standards for setting reserves.
Chatset has yet to carry out detailed work but says the shortfall could
amount to between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 6bn.
'We believe that such a demand on current Names is unfeasible. At best those
Names that have trade on will have to utilise their future profits to pay
past losses, so we do not see a rosy future for existing Names,' said
Chatset.
Chatset say the ring fence must be strong enough to allow the Lloyd's policy
to survive, but this is going to impose an 'intolerable' strain on the old
Names.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Headmasters' Conference schools hold fee increases to an
average of 4 per cent this year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADMASTERS' Conference schools have held fee increases to an average of 4
per cent this year, head teachers said yesterday.
This is the lowest rate of fee inflation for more than a decade, and follows
a 6 per cent drop in the number of boarders last year.
A pay freeze for teachers in the public sector would allow further
containment of fees, which are mostly driven by labour costs, for next year.
The conference also heard that further initiatives involving research into
US independent schools are being taken to reduce fees, by cutting staff.
Research by Mr Vivian Anthony, conference secretary, showed that 'the same
number (or more) of pupils could be taught by fewer teachers without
reducing the standard of their education'.
He said schools 'engaged in a struggle for their very existence' should
investigate the proper maximum and minimum class sizes they needed.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Tories co-operate in Nadir cash probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE Central Office has responded to concerns that it has not been
co-operating with the trustees in bankruptcy to Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive
businessman.
The office is believed this week to have provided greater information to Mr
Neil Cooper at accountants Robson Rhodes, head of the firm's insolvency arm
and Mr Nadir's court-appointed trustee.
Its action came as the trustee was considering demanding to interview
Conservative party officials to gather information using his powers through
English insolvency law.
Mr Cooper has been attempting to trace any assets to which Mr Nadir's
creditors may lay claim. These include up to Pounds 440,000 in political
donations made by Mr Nadir to the Conservative party during the 1980s.
But it is believed that the Conservative party had provided insufficient
information until recently to help determine the basis for any claim.
There was some confusion over whether three letters sent by Mr Cooper had
been received and dealt with by officials. A letter in late July initially
went unanswered and was followed by a further letter in August.
The Conservative party has previously said that it will return the donations
if the money was stolen.
Accountants at Touche Ross, the joint administrators to Polly Peck
International, Mr Nadir's former conglomerate, may also have a claim on the
donations, most of which have been traced to Unipac, a Polly Peck packaging
subsidiary in northern Cyprus.
But Mr Cooper may have a claim on the donations if the money was drawn on
cheques from Mr Nadir's personal bank accounts held with companies in the
Polly Peck group.
None of the donations were disclosed in the Polly Peck group accounts as
required by English law. Donations to political parties by companies based
in northern Cyprus are believed to be outlawed.
Conservative Central Office said yesterday: 'We are co-operating in every
way we can. We have co-operated fully and we have certainly acknowledged his
(Mr Cooper's) letters.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / Truck and van sector shows signs of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first cautious signs appeared last month that commercial vehicles as a
whole may be starting to follow the UK market for new cars out of recession.
Recovery is already well under way in the truck industry. Statistics from
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that last month's sales
of trucks over 3.5 tonnes jumped by 19.8 per cent to 4,910, compared with
4,097 in the same period last year.
The August total lifted total truck sales for the first eight months of the
year to 22,392, an 8.53 per cent increase over last year's 20,633.
Sales of light vans and panel vans - such as the Ford Escort and Transit
respectively - continued below last year's severely depressed levels, but by
a smaller margin than earlier in the year.
Light van sales were 6.72 per cent lower in August than in the same month
last year, at 8,913 compared with 9,545, but this was an improvement on the
first eight months as a whole, during which sales were 8.01 per cent lower
than the equivalent period last year.
Similarly, sales of panel vans in August, at 14,536, were only 4.08 per cent
lower than a year ago, compared with the 5.55 per cent cut recorded for the
the first eight months.
The commercial vehicles statistics reinforce figures covering the market for
used cars, which also indicate that economic activity is picking up.
Overall, 31,085 commercial vehicles were sold in August - a drop of only
1.95 per cent on the 31,707 achieved in the same month last year. Total
sales for the first eight months of the year were 4.76 per cent below the
period last year, at 135,340 compared with 142,098.
The share taken by imports last month was sharply higher, at 44.87 per cent
compared with 40.81 per cent, and 40.78 per cent for the first eight months
compared with 35.86 per cent a year ago.
The small vans sector is seeing a sharply increased challenge from Renault,
whose sales jumped 72 per cent in August and by 35 per cent in the first
eight months of the year. The main market casualty has been Rover, with
sales of the ageing Maestro van falling by 36 per cent so far this year.
The share of panel van sales taken by LDV, the management buy-out led
manufacturer of Leyland Daf vans, fell sharply in August compared with a
year ago, from 10.8 per cent to 7.8 per cent. But with August by far the
biggest sales month for commercial vehicles - as with cars, because of the
new registration prefix - LDV maintains that the drop reflects the still
relatively low production after LDV emerged from receivership in May.
The Iveco Ford group has been able to strengthen its hold on the truck
sector, with its share rising to 25.9 per cent in August compared with 17.98
per cent for the once market-leading Leyland Daf.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Universities warned over training snub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday threatened to close down
university teacher training departments which refused to co-operate with
independent schools.
This follows last week's announcement that the government will create a new
agency to control teacher training. Oxford University's education department
does not work with independent schools and a Headmasters' Conference
official described relations with the department as 'appalling'.
Mr Arthur Hearnden, Independent Schools Joint Council general secretary,
said it was well known that Oxford University's education department shunned
partnerships with independent schools.
Oxford said that no local independent schools had applied to it.
Mr Patten, a former Oxford don, speaking at the Headmasters' Conference
annual meeting in Oxford, said: 'Complaints have come about two or three
universities which have refused to have anything to do with what they call
public schools.' He described this as a 'very sad reflection on those
institutions' and said he would not hesitate to withdraw government
recognition from courses 'where institutions refused to co-operate with
independent schools seeking to set up teacher training partnerships with
state schools.'
Mr Pattern also announced that from next year, independent schools could
apply for government funds to offer teacher training of their own in
consortia with state schools.
He said state schools operating a pilot teacher training scheme this year
received Pounds 4,000 for each of the 2,250 trainees involved.
The headmasters gave these proposals a cautious welcome, although the
government's decision to continue publishing 'league tables' of academic
performance was attacked as misleading.
Mr Patten also voiced his support for the tough public sector pay policy of
the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
The National Union of Teachers called for a salary increase of eight per
cent, plus Pounds 1,000 for each teacher, which the union said was necessary
to maintain recruitment.
Mr Patten said that such a pay increase would mean the loss of 80,000 jobs.
He added: 'In the present economic climate, in a very tight public
expenditure round with no problem recruiting high quality teachers any such
claim would clearly be unrealistic.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / War over price of transatlantic calls heats up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE TO cut transatlantic telephone call charges will intensify
following a reduction of a quarter in the 'wholesale' price of delivering
calls carried by AT&amp;T, the US operator, and Mercury, the UK competitor to
British Telecommunications.
The agreement, to take effect next month, led to an escalation in the war of
words between AT&amp;T and BT. AT&amp;T accused BT of dragging its feet on
concluding a similar deal between the two carriers.
In a speech in London last night, Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, strongly
attacked AT&amp;T for lobbying for the break-up of BT. He warned the government
against 'pursuing the commercial equivalent of unilateral disarmament' in
its attitude to the US giant's ambitions to enter the UK market.
The AT&amp;T agreement with Mercury concerns accounting rates, the price
carriers pay each other for delivering international calls to their final
destination.
US-UK accounting rates have halved in the past four years. AT&amp;T says,
however, that the new agreement with Mercury still leaves rates at twice the
cost of carrying calls. Its existing agreement with BT sets the peak-rate
price at nearly three times the actual cost.
Mr Tom Luciano, AT&amp;T's deputy director for international settlements, said:
'We are looking for an agreement with BT similar to Mercury's, however BT's
response has been too little and too late.'
BT said that in May it had proposed a 'sizeable reduction' in its accounting
rate, and expected to reach agreement with AT&amp;T 'soon'. It declined to
disclose figures.
Since a majority of US-UK traffic originates in the US, AT&amp;T has a strong
financial interest in driving down accounting rates and destroying the
system which has kept them artificially high.
Its campaign to reduce transatlantic rates has acquired added intensity by
its growing rivalry with BT. In the past three months both companies have
formed international alliances - BT with MCI, AT&amp;T's main US competitor.
AT&amp;T has also applied for a government licence to gain direct access to the
UK public telecommunications network. The Department of Trade and Industry
is considering the application.
Mercury welcomed yesterday's deal as 'good for customers' and supported
AT&amp;T's objective of reducing accounting rates towards cost. It said that
prices had already fallen by 40 per cent for large customers in the last
three years and that the new agreement provided the world's lowest
inter-continental accounting rates.
In his speech last night, Mr Vallance called for stronger government support
for BT in its quest to become a global company. 'The UK may have given up on
the idea of national champions. The trouble is that the rest of the world
has not,' he said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Tamworth studying tram feasibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAMWORTH BOROUGH Council yesterday became the latest authority to commission
studies of a tram system designed to link outlying park-and-ride stations to
the town centres.
The system - Parry People Movers - has been designed to run on narrow-gauge
tracks and is powered by an innovative rechargeable flywheel rather than
overhead wires or electrified rails.
Council officials in Tamworth say the tram is less expensive than larger
light transit railways and does not require major construction work.
Plans to reintroduce trams have been taken up this week by a number of local
authorities seeking a solution to increasing traffic congestion.
Local authorities in Leicester and Ilkeston in Derbyshire are considering
the system, which has been pioneered by JM Parry Associates, a design
engineering company based in the West Midlands.
The company said yesterday that a feasibility study had been commissioned by
Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands Passenger Transport
Authority, which was considering trams among the options for a British Rail
branch line.
Interest in such systems has grown with the success of the tram network in
Manchester and the decision by Nottingham, Sheffield and Birmingham to
develop light transit railways. Mr Andrew Gordon, a director of JM Parry,
said the company had prepared prototype models which had been demonstrated
to local authority officials in the Midlands.
The company is seeking Pounds 200,000 of equity capital to move from
prototype manufacturing to full production.
Mr Gordon said: 'We have had approaches from a number of backers and
envisage beginning production now that the company has won government
approval to be a light transit operator.'
Studies of the tram system are expected to be completed by the end of the
year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Public pay freeze 'torpedoed' claims Labour: Industry says
price pressures 'almost totally absent' - Commercial performance patchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S attempt to justify a virtual freeze on public-sector pay
had been torpedoed by its own statistics, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow
chancellor, said yesterday.
He attacked Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, for
describing Britain as an 'inflation-free' economy when he must have known
that within 24 hours official figures would record increases in the actual
and underlying rate of inflation.
Mr Brown said: 'The government's talk of zero inflation and an
inflation-free environment has been a pretext for trying to introduce its
new incomes policy for the public sector.' The government, he said, wanted
to cut the living standards of millions of people while the real cost of
living was going up.
Mr Brown also accused the government of failing to acknowledge that by the
end of the year inflation in Britain was likely to be higher than the
average in the G7 group of leading industrial countries.
Deploring claims about 'zero inflation' he urged ministers to ensure there
was no repetition of the damage inflicted on Britain in the 1980s, when Mr
Nigel Lawson was chancellor.
Mr Brown said the government was increasing taxes and cutting living
standards.
Questioned about the likelihood of the Labour party backing any strike
action by unions representing public-sector workers, he said negotiation
should be the way forward.
Mr Brown called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to agree to a meeting
with the TUC. 'The government's high-handed behaviour on the issue of public
sector pay should come to an end,' he said.
Mr Alan Beith, treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said that the
latest figures simply showed that it was 'foolish for ministers to claim
they had defeated inflation'.
Renewing his party's demand for an independent central bank, he said there
was a need for continued vigilance against rising inflation.

THE controversial Sheehy inquiry proposals for reform of police pay are

The Sheehy inquiry looked at research into market rates in the public sector
before recommending performance-related pay for the police and a drop in
starting salaries.
But the federation has argued that there are no comparable public-sector
jobs.
Professor Robert Elliott, of Aberdeen University, dismissed the inquiry's
research as 'fundamentally flawed and an inappropriate basis from which to

FT  16 SEP 93 / Consumer goods lift index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE RISES for a range of goods including clothes, shoes, furniture, eggs
and tobacco were behind a larger-than-expected increase in the retail prices
index last month.
In the 12 months to August the RPI rose 1.7 per cent from 1.4 per cent in
the year to July. The year-on-year figure for last month was the highest
since March.
Between July and August the index rose 0.4 per cent from 140.7 to 141.3.
Of the 14 types of goods and services monitored by the Central Statistical
Office in calculating the index, 10 showed a higher year-on-year increase in
prices in August compared with July.
Between July and last month, prices of clothes and footwear rose 1.5 per
cent, the biggest August increase for 16 years. That took the year-on-year
change for this element of the RPI to 2 per cent, from 0.4 per cent in July.
Household goods including furniture and cookers saw price rises of 1.2 per
cent in the month to August, the largest increase for this time of the year
since 1979.
Pressure on the index also came from a 0.2 per cent increase in food prices
between July and August.
Petrol prices fell slightly during August, though by less than in the same
month last year. This was reflected in overall motoring costs showing a 5.3
per cent increase last month from a year previously, compared with 4.9 per
cent in the year to July.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Taurus successor riles fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institutional Fund Managers' Association has complained that a committee
set up to consider a successor to the failed Taurus settlements system
mainly consists of those with a potential commercial interest in the
project.
The trade body for UK fund managers has told the Bank of England that the
Crest committee - established by the Bank - contains only one institutional
investor, representing the largest group which will ultimately use the
system.
Most of the other members are representatives of custodial banks or
registrar banks - whom the Bank had said would play a secondary role in
deciding the specifications for the new system.
After the collapse of Taurus - which aimed to introduce paperless trading in
the City of London and narrow the settlement period to three days from two
weeks - City commentators said the Stock Exchange had tried too hard to
satisfy the demands of the different service providers such as custodians
and registrars, and the project became far too complex and expensive. The
Bank of England said it would establish Crest as a successor system and the
needs of end-users, such as institutions, would be paramount.
In August IFMA wrote to Mr Pen Kent, associate director at the Bank, to
express concern about the committee's structure. In reply Mr Kent offered to
let the group meet Mr Iain Saville, the Bank's project controller for Crest.
One IFMA member said: 'We are concerned about the lack of consultations
about business specifications.' In particular, the fund managers are
concerned about the recommendation that each Crest participant be allocated
a single account. Another IFMA member said: 'That means that our clients who
want their securities designated in their own names cannot have that.' About
85 per cent of UK pension funds insist that securities be held in their own
name, not in the name of the fund manager's nominee company.
Also, the institutions, which own 80 per cent of the shares traded in
London, are concerned about being held hostage to price increases if a
commercial vendor won a franchise to exclusively provide a portion of the
settlement service.
A fund manager said: 'They say they are concerned about the needs of end
users. But what they really want is a convenient system devised by the
service providers and we will have to fit into that.'
Among the members are Mr Brian Finnegan, head of settlement operations at
the London Stock Exchange - which, Mr Kent has suggested, may have little
role to play in securities settlement after Crest. Also on the panel is Mr
Ralph Walrond, chief registrar at Lloyds Bank Registrars.
Other members include Mr Terry Pearson, senior securities adviser at Royal
Bank of Scotland Securities Services, the largest independent custodian for
UK pension funds, Mr Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank and
Mr Geoff Newman, vice president at Chase Manhattan.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Retail sales edge upwards in 'fragile' climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOP SALES are steadily edging upwards, even though the sector's commercial
performance last month was patchy, according to government figures released
yesterday.
In the three months to the end of August, seasonally-adjusted retail volumes
increased 1 per cent compared with the previous three months and by 3.8 per
cent on the corresponding period last year.
However, sales volumes in August were up just 0.1 per cent on the month
before, when volumes fell 0.3 per cent on June. Shops selling clothes and
shoes, and those selling a mixture of food and non-edible items, performed
particularly weakly in August, according to the Central Statistical Office's
figures.
The data underlines how retail sales, which account for about a quarter of
gross domestic product, are continuing their pattern of slow upward movement
in line with signs of economic recovery.
In the three months to the end of May, volumes increased 0.9 per cent
compared with the previous three months, while between December last year
and February the three-monthly increase was 0.6 per cent.
Between July and August, food shops saw a 0.4 per cent increase in their
sales, while 'mixed retail' stores suffered a downturn of 0.3 per cent.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said many shops
were experiencing 'difficult trading conditions', in spite of signs of an
end to recession. People remained reluctant to buy non-essential items, a
sign that consumer confidence was 'fragile'.
In the area of clothing and footwear, where sales volumes slipped 1.1 per
cent between July and August, the consortium said: 'Basic necessity clothing
did comparatively well while the more exotic, less 'necessary' designer end
fared badly.'
Sales last month of recorded music, videos, furniture and carpets were poor,
while stores selling DIY goods experienced only modest growth.
A bright spot was that the large numbers of tourists in August pushed up
sales in many big London stores, a trend helped by the continuing weakness
of the pound.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Nervous City ponders rogue RPI figure: Emma Tucker reports
that a lack of inflationary pressure means the good times are not quite over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London broke into a nervous sweat yesterday morning when the
retail price inflation figures were released.
Did the alarming jump in the headline rate of inflation from 1.4 per cent to
1.7 per cent mean that the good news on prices was over?
Possibly, but judging by reports from industry, agriculture and retailing
yesterday's was a rogue figure. Inflationary pressure points in the economy
remain hard to detect. Short of an external shock, the only threat to the
government's 1 to 4 per cent target range for underlying inflation in the
near-term appears to come from the government itself - in the form of
administered prices such as rail fares and tax increases.
The message from manufacturing industry is that inflationary pressures are
almost totally absent. Companies are generally operating well below capacity
and productivity increases continue to outstrip wage rises.
There are expectations, however, that some manufacturers may start to look
for higher profits via price rises as demand in the marketplace strengthens.
Prices of many manufactured goods have been depressed in order to maintain
turnover but some manufacturers might test their markets to see if price
rises stick.
The outlook for wages is for only hesitant increases. Although
private-sector pay awards appear to have bottomed out at a level
considerably higher than the current inflation rate, there is not yet much
evidence that skills shortages are putting upwards pressure on salaries.
The Confederation of British Industry says its members have not run up
against skills shortages and in its last quarterly survey, the British
Chambers of Commerce reported that the percentage of firms experiencing
recruitment difficulties remained unchanged at 32 per cent for manufacturers
and 28 per cent for service sector companies.
Pressure from food and commodities is also muted. Very little of a 17.4 per
cent increase in the price of imported food raw materials in the year to
August has been passed on to consumers. Retail food prices over the same
period rose only 3.1 per cent and pent-up inflationary pressures do not
appear to be great, according to industry representatives and analysts.
Some products bought on world markets have seen sharp rises recently. Prices
for nuts and vegetable oils have shot up, largely because of the severe
flooding and drought in parts of the US.
By contrast, the sharp price rises for many EC raw materials which followed
sterling's devaluation last September have been partly reversed in recent
months. This is mainly because sterling has clawed back ground against the
Ecu, and because under CAP reforms, EC intervention and support prices were
cut in July for wheat and butter.
For food retailers increasing competition - due largely to the rapid spread
of cut-price discount stores - means supermarkets will make every effort to
absorb any increase in wholesale prices. So even if seasonal factors that
have kept food prices down start to change, consumers may not find
themselves paying much more.
In non-food retailing too, price competition is increasing and stores are
nailing prices down.
Perhaps the biggest threat to inflation comes from the government itself.
Measures announced in the last Budget will add an extra percentage point to
underlying inflation, currently at 3.1 per cent, when they are introduced
next year.
The Central Statistical Office has calculated that a decision to restrict
tax relief on mortgage interest to 20 per cent from April will add 0.25
percentage points to the all-items index, while VAT on domestic fuel will
add about 0.8 percentage points over two years.
Petrol prices are also set to rise by 3 per cent above the rate of
inflation. This means an extra 6 pence per gallon, which would add 0.1
percentage points to the RPI.
Administered prices, are another potential source of inflation. The
possibility of rail fare increases in the New Year of up to 15 per cent
ahead of British Rail privatisation have been touted.
The only utility where significant price rises are expected is water. The
requirement to meet EC quality standards means that the formula for
controlling price rises agreed by the official regulator allows for
increases to pay for the necessary investment.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Poll tests level of racial discord: A possible British
National party victory in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

<TEXT>
A POSTER campaign against racial attacks will be launched by the Commission
for Racial Equality in London today with government, police and local
authority support.
While the event takes place the far-right British National party will, a few
miles away to the east in Tower Hamlets, be fighting to gain its first
council seat. Should predictions that the party has an outside chance of
winning today's by-election prove correct, members of ethnic minority
communities say the single good effect of the win might be to jolt the
government, police and local authorities into a more powerful bid for racial
harmony than poster campaigns.
The by-election comes in a week which has seen clashes in Tower Hamlets
involving Asian youths, BNP supporters and members of far-left groups
following a savage attack by a white gang on Mr Quaddus Ali, a 17-year-old
Asian student.
Members of ethnic minority communities, mainly Asian, form more than a third
of Tower Hamlets's population. The borough, one of the most deprived in
Britain, is a particular target for BNP activity.
The party contested both parliamentary seats in the general election, and in
another council by-election last year on the Isle of Dogs - scene of today's
by-election - polled 20 per cent of the vote, well ahead of the
Conservatives. Predictions of a possible victory this time have been
promoted by Labour canvass returns showing the BNP at 34 per cent, only five
points behind Labour.
Levels of racial violence and harassment are hard to measure. Not all
disputes between black and white people are racially motived, while many
that are do not get reported. Crime survey and police figures indicate,
however, that racial attacks have increased in many parts of the country in
recent years.
In Newham, which borders Tower Hamlets and has one of London's biggest
ethnic minority populations - 42 per cent - a long-established monitoring
project collects information on incidents of racial violence. Its files
contain reports of a three-year-old knocked unconscious by a brick; homes
daubed with racist graffiti; knife attacks and arson attempts.
No one engaging in such activities is likely to be deterred by poster
campaigns, and last year the Commission for Racial Equality demanded tougher
laws. It wants a specific new offence of racial violence. But some lawyers
argue that this would make it more difficult to secure convictions, while
the government has shown itself reluctant to strengthen existing race
relations legislation.
Complaints of rising racial violence are not confined to London. 'It is
becoming a disgrace to what is supposed to be a civilised society,' said Mr
Maxie Hayles, director of Birmingham's racial attacks monitoring unit. 'I
live in the suburbs, and feel that I have to keep looking over my shoulder.
We need funding for case workers to work alongside victims of harassment and
attacks, providing long-term support.'
Members of ethic minority communities know that their concerns about racial
attacks, and the dangerous influences of far-right political groups, can
easily sound exaggerated. Yet Sir Michael Day, who was the chairman of the
Commission for Racial Equality until earlier this year, left office with a
vivid warning that the extreme right in Britain felt events were moving its
way. 'There is a boldness in the political rhetoric of the extreme right
which conveys a wider acceptability of their views,' he wrote.
The latest test of that political rhetoric will come in today's by-election.
Leaders of the borough's ethnic minority communities hope that, if there is
any strengthening of BNP support, the government will lose no time in
responding to Sir Michael's warnings with stronger legislation.

FT  16 SEP 93 / MoD pays in pregnancy test case: Claims may run into
millions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER medical assistant, dismissed from the Royal Air Force in 1985 after
she became pregnant, accepted Pounds 22,000 in damages from the Ministry of
Defence in an out-of-court settlement yesterday.
The claim was brought by Miss Jacqui Thornber, a 33-year-old single mother
from Leicester.
It is seen as a test case for up to 4,000 servicewomen dismissed after they
became pregnant. The MoD could now face claims running into millions of
pounds.
Settlement was reached at an industrial tribunal hearing in Croydon, south
London, to set the level of damages.
The MoD had admitted unlawful sex discrimination but disputed the level of
compensation to which she was entitled.
MoD policy in 1985 was to discharge servicewomen who became pregnant, but it
had accepted that this policy was unlawful in an earlier test case in the
High Court in 1990.
Miss Thornber's fight for compensation was aided by a recent decision of the
European Court of Justice that Britain's statutory Pounds 11,000 ceiling on
tribunal awards was unlawful.
The Luxembourg court ruled in August that people who have suffered sex
discrimination must be compensated in full for loss and damage actually
suffered even if that meant exceeding the ceiling.
Miss Thornber is now on income support and in the final year of a science
degree course in information and library studies.
She told the tribunal she was a medical assistant at RAF Bruggen in Germany
when she learned she was pregnant, and that she was faced with the stark
choice of having an abortion or leaving the forces.
She said she did not attempt to re-enlist after her son was born because she
did not think she could.
A second case involving a former aerospace systems operator from Humberside
is due to be heard on October 8. Mrs Deborah Miller, 28, is claiming Pounds
54,000 plus interest after rejecting an MoD offer of Pounds 3,688.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Cadbury delays measure by a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REQUIREMENT for companies to comment on the state of their internal
controls in their annual reports is unlikely to be in force before the end
of next year, it emerged yesterday.
Commentary on whether a company is a viable 'going concern' is also likely
to be delayed at least until next summer, after an announcement yesterday by
the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance.
Draft proposals prompted by the committee for a third financial statement on
companies' interim accounts will probably be considered by accounting
standards-setters within the next six months.
The delays come in response to growing concerns by companies that they are
being expected to comply too quickly with excessive new demands for
financial information.
Big companies' concerns began with an initial requirement by the Stock
Exchange that they comment on compliance with the Cadbury code from
financial year-ends after June this year.
Yesterday's statement said there would in future be proper consultation and
adequate time for companies to implement guidance for compliance with
Cadbury.
It said proposals on internal controls would be published 'shortly', but are
expected to be followed by a consultation period of at least six months.
'Going-concern' guidelines are to be submitted to the committee for
consideration at the end of November, but are unlikely to be in place for
financial year-ends next March. Interim accounts proposals currently being
considered are to be recommended in the next six months.
The statement followed a meeting on Tuesday between representatives from the
100 Group of leading finance directors, the Accounting Standards Board, the
Financial Reporting Council, the Auditing Practices Board and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Diversion of Jordan arms to Iraq 'ignored'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government ignored intelligence warnings that Jordan was being
used to divert arms to Iraq in the 1980s because of a very 'confident
relationship' with the Jordanians, a senior foreign office official said
yesterday.
Mr Rob Young, former head of the Foreign Office's Middle East department,
told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry: 'Our relationship with Jordan was a
very special one - close and confident. We exchanged a lot of information.
There was no expectation that they would play dirty with us.'
The relationship was so close that it led Whitehall to try to suppress
publicity after the arrest of four businessmen suspected of selling arms to
Iraq via Jordan in summer 1990, the inquiry heard.
The disclosure raises further questions about the conduct of government
ministers who signed public interest immunity certificates preventing
information about Whitehall policy emerging during the subsequent trial of
the businessmen, executives of Ordtec, a military engineering firm.
During the trial, which mirrored the later one of Matrix Churchill
executives, defence lawyers argued that their clients had traded with the
full knowledge of government. The men are currently appealing against their
convictions.
The conduct of Whitehall officials in supervising government guidelines
restricting defence exports to Iraq was questioned yesterday by Lord Justice
Scott. 'It looks as if something has gone wrong with the system,' he said.
Mr Young spoke of a 'very difficult Whitehall tactical battle' in which
Foreign Office officials fought unsuccessfully against pressure from the
Ministry of Defence and the Department of Trade and Industry to relax the
restrictions on trade with Iraq.
The official, who is now minister at the British embassy in Paris, also said
that UK companies did not give as much importance as the judge to the text
of parliamentary questions and answers.
'Exporters go to the DTI and the MoD and say 'Hey chaps, I've got this
application for an export licence. What's the chance of success? What's the
form?',' Mr Young said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Major offers wage rise hope to lower-paid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday held out the prospect that some public-sector
workers will get pay rises next year in spite of warnings of a freeze in the
public-sector pay bill from the chancellor of the exchequer.
The prime minister said there was scope for salary rises for some lower-paid
workers.
Speaking in the Midlands yesterday following private meetings with party
activists, Mr Major said public expenditure had to be restrained to maintain
low inflation.
He warned public-sector workers that they might have to settle for little or
no increase next year so that the government could maintain spending 'to
protect people who are vulnerable' without resorting to further borrowing.
He added: 'Some areas of expenditure have had to increase, but the overall
pay bill cannot rise.'
He was speaking in Loughborough, where he opened a Pounds 30m chemistry
laboratory at the Fisons pharmaceutical company.
Earlier he urged party activists in Birmingham and Telford to unite behind
the Tory leadership as it pursued a policy of low inflation and steady
growth.
His constituency tour was overshadowed by the news that local Conservative
associations had failed to meet their fundraising targets.
The 63 Tory associations in the West Midlands raised Pounds 105,482 in the
past financial year against a target of more than Pounds 280,000.
Local party leaders blamed the shortfall on disenchantment with government
policy.
Mr Major faced questions over the handling of new fiscal measures,
particularly VAT on domestic fuel. Mr Bernard Zissman, Tory leader on
Birmingham City Council, said that during frank exchanges the prime minister
was told the government should have announced measures to help the elderly
and less well off in the Budget.

AIRLINE deregulation negotiations with the US should remain the province of
individual European governments and not be taken over by the European
Commission, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said yesterday.
Mr MacGregor rejected the suggestion by a US airline commission that the EC
should take over the negotiations of multilateral airline agreements with
the US.
However, for liberalisation to be effective, UK and other foreign airlines
must have greater access to traffic originating from smaller US airports, he
said.

FT  16 SEP 93 / DSS undermines morale, MP says
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPANSION OF the role of the state in welfare provision had resulted in
excessive public expenditure and undermined individual responsibility, Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, argued last night.
He said: 'For many people the role of government has sapped from them - one
might almost say confiscated - their sense of responsibility towards other
people.'
Mr Portillo, who is primarily responsible for limiting government
expenditure, maintained that too broad a benefit system could undermine the
morale of those who received help.

THE European Commission is worried that a new satellite television channel,

Hill writes.
The Commission has written to Mr Peter Brooke, the minister for national

European programmes to meet EC requirements.
TNT &amp; Cartoon Network belongs to Turner Broadcasting System, owner of the

FT  16 SEP 93 / Amnesty urged for crowded jails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRISON governors proposed an amnesty for some prisoners when they met Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, for the first time yesterday.
A delegation from the Prison Governors Association, led by national chairman
Mr Brendan O'Friel, governor of Risley and former governor of Strangeways,
also suggested that low-security prisoners could be left in the community on
bail after being sentenced and called up only when there were cells
available for them.
Mr O'Friel said: 'There is a limit to how far we can go before we reach a
point where it would be dangerous to overcrowd further and we signalled to
the home secretary that we are not far off that point.'
The governors also voiced fears that the power to punish and control
rule-breaking and violent prisoners had been reduced 'too fast and too far'.
After the meeting Mr Howard said he had ordered a thorough review of prison
discipline.
The prison population has risen sharply this year by about 500 a month to
46,000. The prison system in England and Wales is nearing its certified
capacity.
Amnesties were used in the 1980s to ease overcrowding. Two thousand
prisoners were released on one day in June 1983 and another 1,000 petty
criminals freed on one day in August 1987.
Retailers are spending about Pounds 400m on combating crime each year and
losing about Pounds 175m in burglaries, preliminary findings of the British
Retail Consortium show.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Fuel VAT could be permanent warn MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats yesterday urged the government to
retreat over the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel before
European Community law made it impossible to reverse the move.
The two parties warned that unless the government acted before April next
year when the tax comes into effect, it would become a permanent feature. EC
agreements prevent the removal of the tax from goods or services once a rate
has been imposed.
'Time is running out for the Tories to see sense on VAT on gas and
electricity,' Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, said.
The Liberal Democrats said there was a risk that unless ministers reversed
the move, the UK could be hit by a 'double whammy', with the government
unable to end VAT on domestic fuel and unable also to resist pressure within
the Community for an EC energy tax.
Launching their party's proposals for environmental tax reform, Mr Alan
Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, and Mr Simon Hughes, the
environment spokesman, contrasted their proposals with the government's
stance.
They said that the Liberal Democrats favoured revenue-neutral measures, in
which the money raised was put into compensation schemes for those least
able to cope with high fuel bills, and invested in public transport.
As well as a tax on energy, based broadly on the EC model, the party
proposes transport taxes in the form of road pricing in urban areas, changes
to vehicle excise duty, and a new system for taxing company cars.
While the Liberal Democrats emphasise the difference between themselves and
the government on this issue, however, the Tories have said they believe the
plan for energy taxes undermines the Liberal Democrat campaign against the
extension of VAT.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Shops' burglary bill hits Pounds 175m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS are spending about Pounds 400m on combating crime each year and
losing about Pounds 175m in burglaries, according to preliminary findings of
the British Retail Consortium.
The findings will be discussed today at the first meeting of the Home
Office's Retail Action Group, a committee including retailers, police and
local authority officials set up to tackle the growing problem of retail
crime.
The difficulties faced by retailers were highlighted in June by Mr Stanley
Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, who told a
conference that shops were being forced to adopt 'vigilante tactics' to
combat crime. He said crime cost Dixons Pounds 20m last year.
A report last month found a quarter of shops in some parts of London had
been victims of a robbery or attempted robbery in the past year.
The consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of the retail
industry, set up an initiative on crime in June to gather information about
the true size of the problem. Its survey is the first attempt to collect
figures in such detail from across the industry.
The study says 150,000 burglaries were committed against retail premises
last year, with losses totalling about Pounds 175m. That would account for
more than half of the Pounds 320m attributed to all commercial burglaries in
Home Office statistics on crime.
The study also found that 440,000 customers were apprehended for theft by
retailers last year.

FT  16 SEP 93 / A half-written play between two acts: Japan's new coalition
policies are expected to emerge soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE politics, in its present confused and fluid state, is like a
half-written play, in between two acts. As the interval drags out, the
actors behind the scenes are hammering out the next stage of the plot.
That is the analysis of Mr Shigeru Ito, top political theorist in the Social
Democratic party, the largest and shakiest partner in Japan's month-old
coalition government.
The jovial Mr Ito, once dubbed the 'brain of the Socialists' by Mrs Takako
Doi, former party chairwoman and current speaker of the lower house of
parliament, became transport minister a month ago. The SDP, formerly called
the Japan Socialist party, was thrust into power by the collapse of the
conservative LDP government following defections from its ranks.
'For nearly 40 years, Japan was run by a millionaires' party, the LDP, with
one party of opposition: us. Act One consisted of the change of
administration. I believe that in the latter half of next year, the bell for
Act Two will start to ring. At that stage, you will see new policies begin
to solidify, placing Japan in a new world,' says Mr Ito, 65.
What those new policies will be remains to be seen. Between now and the
general election which he expects late next year, Mr Ito believes that the
seven-party government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa will manage to hold together,
despite its divisions.
The big uncertainty in all this is whether the SDP will walk out, so
depriving the coalition of its majority in parliament. Its left wing is
offended by the fact that the party, humiliated in the July general
election, has now suppressed some cherished policies, such as support for
North Korea, to please its coalition partners.
Mr Sadao Yamahana, party chairman, who like Mr Ito has tried to steer the
SDP towards the moderate right, has stood down as a result. However, Mr Ito
is convinced the battle for Mr Yamahana's successor, to be chosen at the
weekend, will be won by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, a moderate candidate with
support from both right and left.
'It is almost a fact that Murayama will become chairman of the SDP. He will
fully support the Hosokawa administration,' says Mr Ito. Mr Murayama is said
to count on the support of two-thirds of the membership.
In the year ahead, political movements born of the summer political upheaval
will gather into five main streams, Mr Ito believes.
The LDP has already redivided into two groups: a conservative old guard and
young members keen on party reform, represented by Mr Yohei Kono, who was
elected LDP president after the election defeat.
A third stream consists of liberal-minded former LDP politicians who belong
to new parties. They include Mr Hosokawa's Japan New party and the New
Harbinger party headed by the prime minister's close friend and ally, Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. The pair are planning a merger.
Fourth, there are the former LDP powerbrokers who masterminded the old
government's defeat, such as Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-founder of the Japan
Renewal party, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, party founder and present foreign
minister, who hold to a conservative line.
The fifth and largest, but divided, stream is the centre-left, led by the
SDP with a handful of smaller fringe groupings around it.
The next election, Mr Ito predicts, will be fought between two coalitions
made up from these groupings. 'A US-style two-party system just would not
suit Japan because it could not cover our complex mentality,' he argues.
He has no illusions about the uncertainty of his own party's future in all
this. Mr Ito has no idea exactly which parties the SDP will choose as
coalition partners for the next election. However, he says, 'it is clear we
will have to co-operate with the liberals' (by which Mr Ito means Mr
Hosokawa).
First, the SDP needs to work on its image, he acknowledges. The party did
even worse than the LDP in the election, losing half its parliamentary seats
as voters shunned the two oldest mainstream parties in favour of new
political movements and promises of change from the rigid system of the
past. 'We made a strategic error. Voters thought we stood against progress,
like a red light. We must change that light to green.'
Mr Ito knows he faces a hard task. The SDP in parliament is larger than the
former Tanaka faction of the LDP to which Mr Hosokawa used to belong, but
much less powerful, he says. Meanwhile, the party has to adjust to the
decline of socialism the world over.
He wryly recalls being told by Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist former
French prime minister, when on a visit to Japan, that the secret of French
socialism was its intellectual advantage. Clearly, that is no longer true in
France and has not been true in Japan for the past 45 years in which the SDP
has been out if power. Even so, he claims, 'I am not pessimistic about the
future.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / State Bank of Pakistan goes independent

<TEXT>
MR MOHAMMAD YAQUB, governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, has been handed a
formidable task. The central bank is to become independent following a
decision by the cabinet of Mr Moeen Qureshi, caretaker prime minister.
A presidential ordinance due within days is expected to give powers to the
bank to set its own monetary and administrative agenda in an effort to end
manipulation by government officials, politicians and businesses.
Mr Yaqub, who has had a career with the International Monetary Fund, took up
his position in August after Mr Qureshi, also a former IMF and World Bank
official, was appointed following the resignation of Premier Nawaz Sharif.
Mr Yaqub, an economic adviser to the finance ministry under Mr Sharif,
became alarmed about the growing budget deficit. 'The ordinance is not going
to make us a Bundesbank. We are trying to get closer to what central banks
are in most developing countries,' Mr Yaqub said in an interview.
Independence is intended to help prevent the bankrolling of profligate
public spending.
'You have a situation where the government has been living beyond its means.
The central bank should be in a position as an adviser to the government to
go and tell them: here is the package of monetary variables consistent with
your overall objectives. If you want those objectives, your budget
discipline must be enforced in line with that,' he said.
Mr Yaqub hopes to strengthen the bank by advising the government on the
limits on deficit financing, by halting external influences on commercial
banks to give loans, and by having independence in appointing employees.
He has already raised interest rates by two percentage points in an effort
to attract savings and counter rising inflation, and recommended a target of
Rs20bn (Pounds 438m) for government borrowings during the fiscal year which
began in July, roughly a third of recent levels.
The State Bank's powers have been gradually eroded since the early 1970s
when Pakistan's four largest commercial banks were nationalised. State-owned
banks have since built up bad debts of Rs80bn.
Rampant growth in government spending has caused large budget deficits and
uncontrolled government borrowing from banks. Public-sector deficit
financing squeezed new credit to the private sector.
Mr Yaqub has refused to withdraw fines imposed on two of Pakistan's largest
public sector commercial banks, despite concerns among some officials that
this could damage their commercial credibility. He says he will not permit
banks to violate requirements such as those related to maintaining a certain
level of reserves or credit-deposit ratios, nor artificially show higher
profitability despite bad loans.
Commercial bankers welcome the steps, seeing an opportunity to recover
loans. 'Its not as if the borrowers have defaulted because they had no money
to pay back.
'It's just that they were too powerful and the finance ministry in Islamabad
was behind them, so there were no fears of any clampdown,' says one leading
banker in Karachi.
Mr Yunus Khan, head of the Pakistani network of Deutsche Bank, says:
'Hopefully, the State Bank will not play to the tune of the bureaucrats or
the politicians'.
However, he cautions that the loan recovery process may not be an easy one
because of likely 'legal entanglements'.
Mr Yaqub hopes that a bold and independent central bank will help improve
the country's monetary health and enforce prudential regulations.
He will inevitably come under heavy political pressure when a new government
is elected on October 6, but is confident Pakistan will adhere to Mr
Qureshi's reforms, because it has no other option.

FT  16 SEP 93 / IFC infrastructure investments increase by 65%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Finance Corporation is rapidly expanding its support of
private sector infrastructure investment in developing nations to help meet
an annual demand for finance of about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 97.4bn) in the
sector in the current decade.
Sir William Ryrie, vice president of the World Bank affiliate, said the IFC
approved a 65 per cent increase to Dollars 379m in its own investments in
private sector infrastructure in the financial year to June.
The past year's investments in such projects as private power generation,
telecommunications, transport and environmental services were concentrated
in Latin America and Asia. They amounted to about half the corporation's
total infrastructure investment since it was set up in 1956.
Presenting the IFC's annual report, Sir William said it intended to put
about a quarter of its investments into private infrastructure in the years
ahead in the expectation that every dollar of investment approved on the
IFC's own account would mobilise Dollars 9 from other investors. In the past
business year it approved a record Dollars 2.1bn in finance for 185 private
sector projects worth a total of Dollars 17bn in 54 developing nations.
However, net income declined to Dollars 142m from Dollars 180m, partly
because of reduced returns on its liquid assets as a result of lower
short-term interest rates, and partly because of a drop in income on the
loan portfolio due to war and economic uncertainty in the former Yugoslavia
and parts of Africa.
The corporation expects to approve investments of about Dollars 2.4bn in the
current financial year, up from Dollars 400m in fiscal 1984. Sir William
retires at the end of 1993. He will be succeeded by Mr Jannik Lindbaek,
president and chief executive of the Nordic Investment Bank.

<TEXT>
MR CHUAN LEEKPAI, Thai prime minister, has sacked one of the five members of
his ruling coalition, the Social Action party, for plotting to merge with
four opposition parties.
The SAP will be replaced by the small Seritham (Liberal Democrat) party,
trimming the coalition's parliamentary majority from 26 to 13 seats. This is
considered rather small, given Thai politicians' lack of discipline.
The SAP, dubbed one of the 'devil' parties before last year's election for
its willingness to support a military junta, has been an irritant during the
coalition's first year.
Seritham is the creation of Mr Arthit Urairat, a former House of
Representatives speaker who earned plaudits last summer for his role in
engineering a snap election to break a political impasse which followed the
military's killing of 50-odd pro-democracy protesters in Bangkok.
Disruption will be limited because the SAP held no important cabinet posts
and because the original four 'angel' parties - the Democrat party, Palang
Dharma (Buddhist Force) party, New Aspiration party, and Solidarity - can
probably lose only by breaking up a modestly successful partnership.
The opposition ranks appear bruised by a proposal from Mr Chatichai
Choonhavan, the former prime minister, to create a 90-seat super-party.

MORE THAN 100 companies connected with the Allied group of Mr Lee Ming-tee,
a Malaysian-born entrepreneur, were raided by Hong Kong's Commercial Crimes
Bureau yesterday. The affair has become the colony's most significant
corporate crime investigation since the Carrian group collapse in 1983,
writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong.
A government-appointed inspector recently completed a report on five listed
companies connected with Allied, and part of this document is likely to be
made public within a week.
There has been no explanation, however, for the involvement of the police.
Allied said it was 'surprised that this action should be taken after 13
months of investigation during which the group has co-operated fully with
the Inspector who, with his team, had an office in Allied's building for 10
months'.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Jordan fears being left out: West Bank trade is a priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPEED with which Jordan ratified its 'agenda' for peace with Israel,
after months of waiting for the Palestinians to hammer out a settlement,
indicates the kingdom's concern that it may get left behind in any Middle
East economic regeneration.
Having the longest common border with the occupied territories and with over
half its population of Palestinian origin, Jordan has been perceived for
many years as vulnerable to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The country is now in
an ideal position to benefit from rapprochement, yet the government fears it
will be economically marginalised under the present terms of discussion.
The West Bank and Gaza Strip are potentially lucrative markets for Jordan.
The kingdom imports goods worth some Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.40m) a year from
the occupied territories. Government officials complain, however, that trade
prospects are hindered by Israeli constraints which will impose a Dollars
15m ceiling on Jordanian imports.
Further, they say that the Israelis are pushing for goods sold by Jordan to
the West Bank and Gaza to be restricted to those exempted from Israeli
tariffs. 'This basically leaves us with little else but headdresses and
henna to sell,' jokes Mr Jawad Anani, a minister of state.
Jordanian officials fear that Israel will continue to impose itself
economically on the occupied territories.
A recent World Bank report on the economic development of a Palestinian
entity assumes that the monopolistic relationship of Israel over the
occupied territories will continue.
In Jordan's 'agenda' with Israel, trade with the West Bank and Gaza is said
to be high on the list of priorities. Crown Prince Hassan says that free
trade is the ideal. But Jordan's view that Israel intends to use a
Palestinian entity as a Trojan horse to enter the Arab market, in tandem
with Israel's protectionist stance over the occupied territories, bodes ill
for future economic relations.
The crown prince says a development plan for the region should be drawn up
among all parties. He criticises the international community for restricting
development aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip and calls on the World Bank
and other international institutions to reassess the development needs of
the whole region.
'Unless a regional perspective is sought which includes the Syrians,
Lebanese, Iraqis and Jordanians, then the Dollars 60bn economy of Israel
will take the initiative to develop the hinterland, which is totally
unacceptable politically as well as economically,' he says.
He further expressed concern that development ideas such as the construction
of an oil pipeline from Elat on the Israeli side of the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean and a proposed canal from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea
will be detrimental to Jordan and the region as a whole. 'You can't continue
to ignore us (in such discussions) yet at the same time expect us to
participate in peacemaking,' he warns.
Having weathered the Gulf crisis along with a virtual embargo on Jordanian
goods by the Gulf states, the kingdom's tiny economy (GDP was Dollars 4.8bn
last year at current producer prices) has proved itself resilient. Thanks
partly to remittances from Palestinians expelled from the Gulf, real GDP
growth was over 11 per cent in 1992.
But fears that the kingdom will be restricted from entering markets in the
West Bank and Gaza which Jordanians feel are rightly theirs could strain
relations with the Palestinians as well as the Israelis.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Telecom row sours ANC call

THE difficulties faced by foreign investors in South Africa are unlikely to
end with the call to lift sanctions by the African National Congress,
expected any day now.
While the stigma of doing business with South Africa will at last have been
removed, the green light for investors risks being undermined by a damaging
dispute between the government and the ANC over cellular telephone licences.
The issue has become so serious that Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, and
President F W de Klerk this month held a meeting purely on this subject. The
cabinet was yesterday expected to authorise issue of the two licences which
on Tuesday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, warned would be
reviewed and possibly revoked by a new government. However, the cabinet
delayed a ruling after deciding that further talks were required.
Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake in Vodacom, one consortium
expected to win a licence. The public utility Telkom has a 50 per cent stake
and Rembrandt 15 per cent. The other consortium likely to be successful
includes Cable &amp; Wireless. The two winners will run competing services.
Although the ANC says it is not opposed to cellular telephone networks, it
has raised numerous objections to the way in which the government is issuing
the licences.
The ANC maintains the government is proceeding with 'unilateral
restructuring' of the economy, that is trying to privatise the
telecommunications network, and that the technology chosen is too expensive
and unsuitable for South Africa. Within the government and the business
community these reasons are widely dismissed as a fig-leaf for objections
that are purely political - that government money should no longer be spent
without the ANC's agreement.
There is also a more insidious suspicion that the ANC is trying to delay the
issue of the licences in order to allow various US and Scandinavian
companies to participate when sanctions in those countries are lifted. There
have even been unsubstantiated suggestions that the ANC expects financial
contributions from successful bidders.
On the ideological level, the ANC believes cellular phones should be run by
the state - and subsidised if need be - while the government sees them as a
means of introducing competition into the telecommunications sector. It also
sees a cellular network as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most
South Africans access to a telephone.
The message to foreign investors will be clear and unpalatable: the ANC
remains an organisation thatfavours state over market, and South Africa
remains a country where political interference can be expected in business
decisions. If the government presses ahead with awarding licences, there
must be some doubt as to whether those chosen will proceed while the
security of their investment remains in doubt. Each licence is expected to
involve the investment of about R1bn (Pounds 193m), with an estimated R700m
of this coming from abroad.
In South Africa telephone penetration (fixed phones per 100 people) is only
9.6 (about 2.4 in the black community; ten times that among whites).
The tender documents stressed that a criterion which would 'weigh heavily'
was the extent to which the applicant was prepared to provide telephone
services to the underdeveloped part of the community, almost certainly at
subsidised tariffs. Vodacom's plans include introducing at least 22,000
subsidised card-operated community telephones to over 60 township and rural
areas. Mr Alan Knott-Craig, chief executive, argues: 'It took us 100 years
to provide 1 per cent of blacks with telephones. Within five years we aim to
provide 10m South Africans with meaningful access to telephones.'

FT  16 SEP 93 / Arafat set to go to Jericho: Palestinians 'have a friend in
White House'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
returned from the US to his headquarters in Tunis yesterday declaring that a
Palestinian state was within reach and that he had discovered a new friend
in President Bill Clinton.
The PLO leader said that he hoped to travel to Jericho in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank within 10 weeks to begin setting up the new
Palestinian authority agreed in the declaration of principles signed with
Israel in Washington on Monday.
'After that will come a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and
in confederation with Jordan,' he asserted.
The PLO-Israel accord provides only for limited Palestinian autonomy in the
Gaza Strip and Jericho which will be later broadened to include most of the
West Bank.
Negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories, including the
future of Jerusalem, which has been annexed by Israel, will not begin until
the third year of the five-year period of autonomous Palestinian rule.
Israel and the US remain opposed to the concept of an independent
Palestinian state. They will continue to press for Palestinian
self-determination to be expressed within a confederation with Jordan.
However, Mr Arafat declared yesterday that his talks with Mr Clinton had
been 'cordial, friendly, positive and fruitful'. He added: 'I can say that
the Palestinian people have an important friend in the White House.'
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, had earlier returned home from
Washington to warn Syria against aiding groups which opposed the peace
process.
He accused the Syrians of supporting Islamic radicals in Lebanon while also
providing shelter in Damascus for 10 hostile Palestinian groups.
'One hand is supposedly outstretched to peace while the other hand opens
fire,' he said in a broadcast on Israeli radio shortly before the start of
the four-day Jewish new year holiday. He added that Syrian radio continued
to 'preach hatred against the peace negotiations'.
The Israeli premier also defended the deal struck with the PLO. 'It seems to
me that in this agreement we are taking the smallest chance,' he said.
'If they will be able to maintain public order and prevent terror - between
themselves and certainly against Israelis - that is the essential test for
us,' Mr Rabin said. 'Therefore, if we succeed in this, and we can succeed, I
think we'll have made an opening to a new period.'
Israeli security forces were placed on alert yesterday in anticipation of
attacks during the holiday period by opponents of the Israeli-PLO peace
accord, police and the army said.
Israel has barred nearly 1m Palestinians from leaving the Gaza Strip until
Sunday.
The army will also limit the number of Palestinians who will be allowed to
enter from the West Bank.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: French warn of crisis over farm accord

MR JEAN PUECH, the French agriculture minister, warned yesterday that the
'spectre of crisis' would be released if the EC did not agree to renegotiate
last November's US-EC farm trade accord.
Mr Puech is engaged in a frenetic round of diplomacy with his EC partners
ahead of Monday's special meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers in
Brussels.
Yesterday he met Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, before flying on to
Madrid for talks with his Spanish counterpart.
Mr Puech told journalists in Brussels that Spain, Germany and Italy were
rallying behind the French position.
Mr Steichen told the minister that the European Commission would do
'everything in its power' to try to solve the political problem over the
EC-US farm trade accord, named Blair House after the Washington mansion
where it was signed last Novem-ber.
A spokesman for Mr Steichen said the two men had discussed the possibility
of 'completing and clarifying' the Blair House agreement, which is supposed
to be a cornerstone of a world trade pact. Mr Puech welcomed what he said
were 'positive developments' and said Mr Steichen was 'completely open' to
the French position.
In separate talks, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, stressed to
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, the importance of keeping
open the line of communication with the US.
Sir Leon talked to his US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, in Washington
earlier this week, but he did not propose changes to the Blair House deal.
The Commission is treading a difficult diplomatic path in its attempt to
avoid offending France or the US.
Members of France's main wildcat farm union, Coordination Rurale, succeeded
yesterday in sporadically blocking some roads and rail lines around Paris,
but highway officials said the disruption was less than that in the recent
national return from the summer holidays.
Using what their leaders called 'Vietcong guerrilla tactics', small groups
of Coordination Rurale members started in the early hours of yesterday
morning putting up blockades, often at highway tolls where cars have to stop
anyway. They mainly relied on pushing lighted rubber tyres onto roads and
some rail lines - including that carrying the high-speed TGV-Atlantique
between Paris and Tours - but in a few places they briefly blocked roads
with cars and tractors.
Some FNSEA pig farmers joined in the action yesterday, temporarily blocking
the Paris-Lyons rail line with straw bales, but the FNSEA and CNJA have
timed their anti-Gatt demonstration for next Monday, when EC ministers meet
in Brussels to discuss the EC-US farm deal.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also expected to discuss the Gatt farm issue with
President Francois Mitterrand when the German leader comes to Paris next
Monday, it was announced in Bonn yesterday.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture secretary, said yesterday the UK would
strongly object to any backtracking on the Blair House agreement.
'If you try to re-negotiate bits of it, the whole package could come
unravelled with implications for other industries as well as agriculture,'
Mrs Shephard said.
The Blair House deal agreed last November cuts subsidised exports of wheat
and other farm products by 21 per cent over 6 years.
France wants to improve the terms of the accord, agreement on which holds
the key to successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay round talks. It has
some support for its position from Spain and Ireland.
Mr Rexrodt said there was room for clarification on Blair House and hoped
the French would be able to fulfil their interests within the accord.
Although German farmers are putting some pressure on their government ahead
of Monday's council meeting, the UK farm lobby has come out in support of
Blair House.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC's textile imports 'will rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXTILE and clothing imports from outside the EC will increasingly dominate
European markets over the next few years, says a market report*, writes
Daniel Green.
Commissioned by Messe Frankfurt, organiser of one of the world's largest
textile exhibitions, the report says that by 2001, 70 per cent of the EC's
consumption of 8.8m pieces of clothing will be imported.
In 1991, 54 per cent of the 6.4m garments sold in the EC were imported.
Much of the change will result from new retailing patterns in southern
Europe, where only a small proportion of clothes is now imported from
outside the EC.
Some 64 per cent of clothes imported from outside the EC are today sold
through price-conscious chains prepared to organise large-scale imports.
While such chains dominate in northern Europe, they are only beginning to
penetrate Mediterranean countries such as Spain and Italy.
Rising wages in southern European countries will also help to push
production to lower-wage countries.
European manufacturers are responding through outward process - in which up
to 49 per cent of the manufacturing is in low-labour-cost countries, usually
in eastern Europe or north Africa. This still allows the garment to be
labelled as being manufactured within the EC.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France seeks to stem US cultural avalanche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE brought its campaign to save Europe from Hollywood to the European
Parliament in Strasbourg last night, and it was quite a show, writes David
Gardner in Strasbourg.
The Euro-MPs suspended their plenary session to flock into one of the most
crowded meetings in the city's recent memory. It was hosted by Mr Alain
Carignon, France's communications minister. But the real draw was the
constellation of French cinema stars he had in tow: a cast including Gerard
Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, and the director Claude Berri.
Mr Carignon pleaded for audiovisual trade to be taken out of Gatt's Uruguay
Round negotiations, to preserve Europe's 'cultural specificity' and
diversity, in the face of the Hollywood avalanche burying European,
especially French, cinema.
In 1979, US films accounted for 31 per cent of cinema ticket receipts in
France, whereas in 1989 the US take was 57 per cent.
'French films work,' a French Gatt negotiator said, 'but they are only
attractive within a system which allows them to survive'.
France wants to be able to continue subsidising its cinema, and to require
its national TV stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made programmes.
EC legislation recommends that member states put on a majority of European
programmes, and EC trade negotiators reckon that getting some form of
'cultural specificity' enshrined in Gatt will impede unilateral sanctions
from the US. Mr Carignon's companions were having none of this.
'We should not allow the Americans to deal with us the way they dealt with
the redskins,' Mr Berri exclaimed. 'If the Gatt accords succeed as currently
framed, the European cultural identity has had it,' he added, using a
slightly earthier verb.

FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Big Bang ends in a whimper - Unctad
challenges shock reforms in E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE PROTECTION, weak commodity prices and high levels of indebtedness
continue to dog the development efforts of many poor countries, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development says in its annual report
published today.
In a controversial challenge to current economic orthodoxies ahead of the
IMF/World Bank meeting later this month, Unctad calls for fiscal reflation
combined with a one-off wealth tax to pull the industrialised nations - and
the global economy - out of recession. It also questions the shock therapy
prescription for developing and former communist countries.
Growth in the developing world was a healthy 4.4 per cent last year and is
expected to maintain that pace in 1993, the report says. However, the strong
performance of east and south-east Asia is in sharp contrast to stagnation
elsewhere, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
The report also warns that recent economic expansion in Latin America has
been fuelled by large-scale short-term capital inflows which may not be
sustainable.
Unctad, the main UN body for discussing north-south issues and a consistent
critic of laissez-faire capitalism, says industrialised countries need a
co-ordinated reflation to boost demand and cut unemployment. High budget
deficits and government debt, which now constrain expansionary policies,
should be reduced through privatisation and a levy on private financial
assets.
Recession in industrialised countries has nurtured protectionism at the same
time as many developing countries have been liberalising trade regimes, the
report says. It estimates that a fifth of developing country exports to the
rich nations are covered by non-tariff barriers to trade, such as quotas,
'voluntary' export restraints and anti-dumping actions. For products
excluding fuels the ratio rises to nearly a quarter and for textiles it
reaches over 70 per cent.
Over the past two years alone, developing countries have lost a sixth of
their commodity export earnings due to falling commodity prices, it says
continuing a decline that began in the 1980s. For Africa the earnings loss
was nearly a quarter and for Latin America one-fifth.
Unctad adds that although the international financial system is no longer in
danger the debt crisis is not over. More than 60 countries, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa, are in arrears with their foreign creditors and the debt
of some former socialist countries, notably Russia, poses new challenges.
For developing countries Unctad urges bigger reductions in official
bilateral debt, rescheduling of debt owed to multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank, and more pressure on private creditors to agree debt
reduction.
It also calls for a comprehensive programme for Russia's Dollars 78bn
(Pounds 50bn) foreign debt, over half of which is owed to governments. This
might include extra aid or debt relief in return for a cut by Russia of its
claims on other troubled debtors, including former Soviet republics.
Looking at the factors which propel growth, Unctad argues that east and
south-east Asian economies have built their success on trade, investment and
strong government support to private business and exports.
The success of gradual economic reform in China, which notched up growth of
about 13 per cent last year, also casts doubt on the conventional wisdom
concerning transformation of planned economies.
China has introduced market-based reforms without formal privatisation of
state-owned enterprises while a dual price system has until recently kept
inflation under control and so avoided disruptive stabilisation programmes.
By contrast, Unctad says, the formerly socialist countries of central and
eastern Europe have tried 'big bang' reform through abrupt liberalisation,
deregulation and privatisation. Since the beginning of the transition
process output has declined on average by a third.
Many of these countries now find themselves in 'a twilight zone where there
is neither plan nor market', says the report arguing that government
intervention is needed to give shape to the new market system and to cushion
the transition.
The Asian experience shows export success requires not only 'getting prices
right' but also 'active government support and. . . well-targeted protection
of domestic producers'. In sub-Saharan Africa, the report says a decade of
structural adjustment programmes have failed to reverse economic decline.
Per capita incomes are still falling and remain below 1970 levels. 'On
current trends it would take 70 years to double them,' even in countries
undertaking intensive adjustment measures.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIA, Ecuador and Venezuela have signed an agreement aimed at
strengthening regional vehicle assembly industries and discouraging imports
of fully assembled vehicles.
The agreement, signed in Caracas this week, sets common external tariffs on
imports of fully-assembled vehicles ranging from 15 to 35 per cent at the
initial stage, and 3-5 per cent duties for imports of complete knock-down
kits (CKDs). The signatories also will ban imports of used vehicles, or new
vehicles from earlier model years.
The accord will take effect on January 1, 1994 for Colombia and Venezuela
and later in 1994 for Ecuador. Participants said the new pact would cover
about 70 per cent of the Andean vehicle market, which includes Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
Lower trade barriers in the three signatory nations have had a negative
effect on domestic assembly plants as imports of fully-assembled vehicles
have grown sharply in recent years. The accord is expected to provide a
boost to local car parts markers.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Dangers of a US share and bond bubble: Group warns of
'irresponsible' Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Federal Reserve monetary policy is irresponsibly expansionary and
creating a bubble in bond and share prices, according to a group of US
monetarists.
If it does not change course soon, the US will face an 'asset price bubble'
similar to that which destabilised financial markets in Japan in the late
1980s, the group says.
In recent days the bull market has shown signs of fragility with sharp falls
in share and bond prices. In late trading yesterday, however, confidence
returned, pushing the yield on the long bond back below 6 per cent. The Dow
Jones industrial average closed 17.89 higher at 3,633.65.
The critique comes from the shadow open market committee, a group of
economists set up 20 years ago to challenge conventional wisdom on US
monetary policy. The monetary base has risen 11 per cent in the past year -
double the rate of growth of nominal GDP of 5 to 5.5 per cent, Prof Allan
Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, the head of the group, said this
week, publishing its twice-yearly report. The economy is thus awash with
liquidity most of which has found its way into financial markets.
Long bond yields have fallen steeply, he claims, not because of confidence
that inflation will remain low but because, with growth of reserves far
exceeding loan demand, excess cash is being used to purchase government
securities.
'We believe the Fed has delayed too long in responding to an emerging bubble
in asset prices,' he says. 'The time has long passed when the Fed should
have tightened monetary policy.'
The criticism that Fed policy is too lax runs counter to the views of many
mainstream economists who argue that the Fed ought to consider cutting rates
further in order to stimulate a still sluggish economic recovery. Those
wanting the Fed to be more expansionary complain that M2, the main measure
of broad money, has barely grown at all in recent years.
Prof Meltzer and colleagues, however, prefer to focus on narrow measures of
the money supply, such as the monetary base which consists of currency in
circulation plus banks' reserves with the Fed. Unlike M2 this measure has
not been distorted by a shift from bank deposits to money market instruments
in recent years.
The initial impact of excessive growth of the monetary base is to raise
asset prices. But it will eventually feed through into higher consumer price
inflation, the group warns. The Fed has thus been lulled into a false sense
of security.
'We urge the Fed to slow the growth of the monetary base by three percentage
points to an annual rate of no more than 8 per cent,' says Prof Meltzer.
He refuses to predict how large an increase in short-term rates this might
require but concedes that it will be more than the quarter-point increase
which was recommended by some analysts earlier in the summer.
In congressional hearings, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has
indicated that real short-term interest rates (the nominal interest rate
minus inflation) are close to zero and cannot be maintained at this
historically low level indefinitely.
But the Fed has so far postponed a raising of rates because economic growth
has been slower than expected and because an apparent spurt in inflation in
the spring has since been reversed.

FT  16 SEP 93 / St Louis bank cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Southwest Bank of St Louis, which in the past has acted as a bellwether
for bank lending rates in the US, yesterday cut its prime rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 5.75 per cent, its first cut since July 1992,
writes Richard Waters in New York.
Most other banks failed to follow suit, and several of the biggest
commercial banks said they had no intention of cutting their prime rates.
However, after two years in which US banks have rebuilt their lending
margins, the move seemed an early sign that these are likely to come under
pressure soon.
The Southwest Bank of St Louis said its cut reflected a weakening of the US
economy. Higher taxes in this summer's budget are also likely to weaken
small businesses, said Mr Drew Bauer, chairman.
Lending margins grew from just over 4 per cent in 1990 to 4.5 per cent last
year, partly as a result of the large gap then between short-term and
long-term interest rates.
The improving financial health of the US banking industry prompted the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to announce yesterday it would shed
half the 6,600 jobs in its liquidation division by the end of 1996. Only 34
banks have failed so far this year, compared with 122 in 1992. The agency
takes over failed banks and repays depositors.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Argentina sees low inflation and strong economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA forecasts record low inflation, continued strong growth and a
smaller trade deficit in its 1994 budget, sent to Congress on Tuesday
evening, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Economy minister Domingo Cavallo once again plans to balance the federal
government's books. Rock-solid government finances were one of the keys to
suppressing hyperinflation and unleashing rapid growth.
Mr Cavallo has trimmed spending slightly by Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 39.98bn
 -equivalent to a 10 per cent cut in real terms. Nonetheless, he has used
big savings on debt service payments and subsidies to increase spending on
education and social services.
One of the budget's key assumptions is a forecast 4 per cent inflation rate,
the lowest in Argentina's recent history. Independent economists believe
this is attainable and should strengthen confidence in the ability to
sustain Argentina's fixed exchange rate.
Low inflation, plus continued economic liberalisation, is expected to
generate 6.5 per cent economic growth.
If this objective is met, it will bring Argentina's accumulated growth rate
to over 30 per cent since Mr Cavallo took office in January 1991.
The budget forecasts 1994 GDP at Dollars 285.31bn, giving Argentina income
per head of Dollars 8,800 - the highest in Latin America. Despite strong
growth, Mr Cavallo expects the trade deficit to fall by almost half from a
projected Dollars 3bn this year to only Dollars 1.81bn in 1994.
Social services are the biggest item, with Dollars 25.66bn - 3.7 per cent
more than last year. Spending on education will rise 20 per cent to Dollars
2.44bn.
The defence budget is set at Dollars 3.58bn, an increase of 14 per cent.
These rises are offset by 9 cuts in debt service payments to Dollars 3.12bn
and the Economy Ministry's spending, which falls to Dollars 3.76bn. The
Interior Ministry's budget is halved to Dollars 720m.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Congress Republicans set out health plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPUBLICANS in the US Congress yesterday produced their proposals for health
care reform, pre-empting the formal announcement of President Bill Clinton's
plan by a week.
But the reform plans, announced separately by Republicans in the Senate and
the House of Representatives, differ almost as much from each other as they
do from Mr Clinton's blueprint, and both groups said they were willing to
work with the administration.
On the Senate side, a Republican task force led by Senator John Chafee of
Rhode Island laid out a proposal intended to phase in universal health
coverage by the turn of the century and to slow the growth of medical costs.
Mr Chafee said his plan would set up a standard healthcare benefits package,
to be established by a national commission, and would create healthcare
purchasing co-operatives. These co-operatives, however, would be voluntary,
unlike the Clinton proposal for 'regional health alliances,' which would
require everyone in their geographical area to enrol, except for companies
with more than 5,000 employees.
The plan would aim to cut the annual rate of growth in government spending
on its existing Medicare and Medicaid programmes, which provide health
coverage to the elderly and the poor, respectively, to 7 per cent, compared
with 12 per cent today.
Senator Kit Bond, another of the architects of the plan, said it would make
health insurance premiums tax deductible up to a set limit for individuals,
including the self-employed. As savings began to be realised, vouchers could
be phased in to help the less well-off buy insurance.
While the Republican Senate plan would require everyone to buy health
insurance - much as drivers are required to buy car insurance - the
Republican House plan would oblige businesses to offer a health plan to
their employees.
Neither Republican proposal would force employers to pay for the coverage,
unlike the Clinton plan, which would require employers to pay 80 per cent of
the premiums (although there would be caps for small businesses.)
The House Republicans plan for extending health insurance to the estimated
37m people who have none is a tax-free 'Medical Savings Account,' similar to
the Independent Retirement Accounts allowing tax-free pension savings.
The plan suggests allowing people to keep any unused money from these
accounts at the end of the year, so giving people a financial interest in a
more economical consumption of medical services.
The Republicans have a credibility problem on health care, to judge by
opinion polls which show them to be much less trusted than the Democrats by
voters on this issue.
This may help account for the somewhat tentative offerings yesterday, where
both House and Senate Republicans acknowledged that their plans were not the
final answer.
'We are not here to criticise the administration's draft,' said Senator
Robert Dole, the Republican leader.
The administration, meanwhile, sought to allay the fears of the health
industry that its efforts to consolidate or share equipment and co-operate
on services could run foul of antitrust law.
The Justice Department laid out guidelines which clarify the sorts of merger
and joint venture that would normally be safe from antitrust challenge.
These include hospital mergers where one hospital has fewer than 100 beds,
fewer than 40 patients a day and is over five years old; joint ventures to
buy expensive equipment, and physician networks with less than 20 per cent
of the doctors in any specialist field and any geographical area.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Canada Liberals pledgeto renegotiate Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S opposition Liberal party has pledged to renegotiate the North
American Free Trade Agreement and the 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Pact if it
wins the October 25 general election.
The country's Liberals yesterday issued their policy platform, which also
includes a planned shift in government spending priorities away from defence
and grants to business, in favour of apprenticeship and other training
programmes, research and development and expanded child-care subsidies.
The Liberals are at present slightly ahead of the ruling Progressive
Conservatives in public opinion polls. However Mr Jean Chretien, their
leader, trails well behind prime minister Kim Campbell in personal
popularity.
Many seasoned political observers predict that the most likely election
outcome is a fragmented parliament with neither of the two main parties able
to muster an outright majority.
Besides the net savings from the switch in public spending priorities, the
Liberals are relying on accelerating economic growth to bring down the
federal budget deficit from 5.2 per cent to 3.0 per cent of gross domestic
product by 1998.
The Progressive Conservatives have promised to eliminate the budget deficit,
which stood at CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.44m) last year, within the next
five years. But they have yet to spell out precisely how this thorny task
will be achieved.
According to their policy document, the Liberals would seek to include a
subsidy and anti-dumping code in the free trade agreements, and to set up a
'more effective' dispute settlement mechanism.
A Liberal government would also aim to secure the same protection for
Canada's oil and gas producers as that enjoyed by the Mexican energy
industry.
A Liberal Party official said yesterday that Mr Chretien would visit
Washington soon after the election, in the expectation of making a
'convincing case' to the Clinton administration to re-open the free trade
agreements.
The Liberals are vague, however, about what would happen if the Americans
and Mexicans turned down their demands.
The official said that any decision on whether to implement Nafta as it
stands, or to abrogate the two agreements would be up to the cabinet.
According to the policy document the bulk of the savings in public spending
under a Liberal government would come from the cancellation of Canada's
CDollars 5.8bn order for 50 European designed EH-101 helicopters, which are
built by the UK's Westland Group.
Ms Campbell earlier this month said the Conservatives would cut the
helicopter order from 50 to 43 aircraft if she was returned to office.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Task force for telecom future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday set up a task force to co-ordinate
government and private sector efforts to develop new 'electronic highways'
for voice and data communications.
Vice-President Al Gore said the task force would review existing federal
laws and rules governing the telecommunications market - many of them dating
back to the 1930s - and seek to speed the creation of a national information
infrastructure.
The plan Mr Gore announced yesterday outlines a future of telecommuting,
long-distance education, interactive television and widespread access to
databases through a network of cable and satellite links.
'It's critically important to the economic future of the United States,' Mr
Gore said.
The task force is expected to conduct a thorough review of the
Communications Act of 1934, which has been modified over the years but casts
a dominating shadow over the entire telecommunications field.
Designed in the days of a monopoly telephone company, the act is based on a
principle of universal access which has been somewhat overtaken by
technological developments.
Mr George Fisher, the chief executive of Motorola and chairman of the
Council on Competitiveness, a business grouping, yesterday welcomed the
administration's policy announcement.
'We are especially pleased to see the establishment of an information
infrastructure task force and a private-sector advisory committee, both
vital to success,' Mr Fisher said.
At stake in the discussion on a national information infrastructure are huge
economic interests.
While almost all of the US is equipped with basic telephones and
televisions, the development of satellite broadcasting, cable television and
computer bulletin boards and databases has left a higgledy-piggledy web of
often incompatible technologies.
While visionaries dream of fibre optic cables taking such services to every
home, cynics suggest this sort of cabling would cost Dollars 200bn to
Dollars 400bn (Pounds 130bn to Pounds 260bn).
Compressing digital information on to existing telephone lines, on the other
hand, could be much cheaper but would offer far more limited capacity, a
maximum of perhaps 144,000 bits per second, compared with several billion
bps for fibre optics.

FT  16 SEP 93 / The Polish Election: Ex-communists get it right with wrong
message
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the sort of message that goes down well with the World Bank and
foreign investors. 'Creating a free market is too serious a business to
leave to right-wing liberals.'
However, the speaker, Mr Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, an election candidate
representing Poland's neo-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), was
listened to with only polite attention by the audience of diehard
communists, ageing workers and pensioners who had gathered in the town of
Ciechanow, north of Warsaw, for his campaign meeting.
With 40 years of party discipline behind them, they can be relied on to turn
up at the polls on Sunday to vote for Mr Siemiatkowski, while around half of
the Polish electorate is likely to stay at home.
The mainly grey-haired audience has no desire to see the demise of
Ciechanow's new shops, full of attractively packaged Polish products
alongside expensive imported goods. But at the same time they want higher
pensions, better health care and secure jobs for their children .
At the 1991 elections, Mr Siemiatkowski won 16 per cent of the vote when the
unemployment rate in Ciechanow province was 17 per cent. It has since risen
to 22 per cent, with peaks of up to 56 per cent in the towns, where the
closure and scaling back of state enterprises have greatly exceeded the
creation of jobs by service industries and small businesses.
On Sunday the SLD expects to gain around 25 per cent of the vote, provided
the discontented do not opt for more radical alternatives with barely
disguised anti-Semitic and xenophobic undertones, such as Samobrona, the
rural 'self-defence' party, or Party X, headed by Mr Stan Tyminski, the
populist Polish-Canadian, who gained more than 3m votes when he stood
against President Lech Walesa in the 1990 presidential elections.
Keeping his party together in the face of radical siren songs from both
right and left promises to prove a difficult task for Mr Alexander
Kwasniewski, the SLD leader. These strains first emerged earlier this year
when he persuaded his party to support the coalition government in a vote
for mass privatisation involving foreign investment managers.
Mr Kwasniewski, a 39-year-old pragmatic former reform communist who played a
key role in the peaceful handover of power to Solidarity in 1989, knows the
SLD's internal divisions would widen if it wins enough votes on Sunday to
become part of a future centre-left coalition government.
He would then have to satisfy the aspirations of his core supporters for
more social security spending and job creation schemes. But this would lead
to higher inflation and destroy the party's credibility as a genuinely
modernising force.
Mr Kwasniewski knows that it will take time before economic growth can
deliver the higher living standards his voters are looking for. So no matter
how many votes his party wins on Sunday Mr Kwasniewski now says that he will
only take part in a future coalition if it enjoys a majority strong and
stable enough to run a full four-year parliamentary term.
What he wants to avoid at all costs is to share the responsibility of power
in a weak coalition with the prospect of having to face early elections
before the economy is able to deliver the goods.

FT  16 SEP 93 / The Polish Election: 'Feel bad' factor threatens Poland's
reformers - Despite economic success, free-market parties are trailing in
the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past four years Poland has been transformed from an economic basket
case into what will almost certainly be the fastest-growing economy in
Europe this year. Yet the two political parties which have done most to
steer Poland through the grinding process of economic transformation - the
Democratic Union (UD) of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister, and
the free market Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) of former prime minister
Jan Krzysztof Bielecki - are both trailing in the opinion polls.
Mindful of the Clinton campaign's exhortation to concentrate on 'the
economy, stupid' both parties have sought, ineffectually, to capitalise on
the positive aspects of Poland's economic performance. A stern-looking Ms
Suchocka stares down from a poster with a caption reading weakly 'The
economy comes first', while the KLD is running a campaign praising foreign
investment and promising a million new jobs over the next three years.
But, in spite of the overwhelming visual evidence of brightly lit shopping
streets, a boom in new car, colour television and washing machine sales, a
rash of new hotels and a million and a half private entrepreneurs hustling
for business in a 60 per cent privatised economy, a bemused electorate is
being bombarded by propaganda from a plethora of right- and left-wing
opposition parties which portrays an economy in ruins run by criminals or
incompetents.
This bizarre dichotomy leaves Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance
minister whose 1990 shock therapy reform strategy abolished subsidies, made
the zloty internally convertible and set the economy on course for recovery,
unsure whether to laugh or cry.
'The problem is that even successful reform carries a high price,' he sighs.
Sitting in the spartanly furnished Warsaw offices of the Foundation for
Economic Education, set up specifically to create greater economic awareness
among non-specialists, the principal author and executor of Poland's reform
programme adds: 'The shift from disguised to open unemployment alone
generates much discontent.'
In Poland's case official unemployment has risen from practically zero, when
factories and offices were full of full-time smokers, drunks and tea-makers,
to 15.4 per cent of the workforce, over 2.8m people in August.
But even the high and still rising unemployment rate does not tell the full
story. More than 8m Poles out of a population of 39m now receive a pension
from the state. Pension subsidy payments have risen from 4 to 24 per cent of
spending over the past four years. This is largely due to a sharp rise in
invalidity pensions which were doled out to middle-aged workers in heavy
industries such as steel and mining to smooth their dismissal.
Such workers were formerly the proletarian heroes of communist propaganda,
with higher than average pay and perks. Statistics showing that pension
payments have risen simply do not wash with these unemployed former workers
in the grim housing estates of the industrial cities. They are unable to buy
the cornucopia of consumer goods now on offer and suffer the additional
indignities of being splashed by the new rich as they zoom past the
dilapidated tram stops in their shiny imported cars.
But envy and relative deprivation are not the only factors working in favour
of a resurgence in electoral support for the revamped former communists of
the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the dissipation of votes among a
gaggle of hysterical nationalists, irrational populists and rabid
anti-communists who will fail to leap the minimum 5 per cent vote hurdle
needed to enter the new parliament.
Around 40 per cent of Poles still live in rural areas. Farmers in particular
resent the unfair competition from a European Community which restricts
access to Polish farm goods by both tariffs and thinly disguised
protectionist moves such as this year's ban on meat imports from eastern
Europe after a small outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Balkans.
The former communist-aligned Peasants party (PSL) is pulling in support on
the basis of a pledge to build an EC-type tariff wall around Polish farmers
to recoup their falling incomes and protect them from unfair subsidised EC
competition.
'The EC has a doubly malign influence on Polish politics. Unwillingness to
open the European market to sensitive goods like steel and textiles raises
unemployment, while the level of EC protectionism permits critics of the
pro-market Liberal Democrats (KLD) in particular to accuse them of naivety
and ignorance of the real world,' Mr Balcerowicz says.
The timing of the unplanned, early elections is also unfortunate for the
ruling parties. The enormous political capital built up by the Solidarity
movement by its victory over the communists in 1989 evaporated fast.
Solidarity disintegrated in a welter of unseemly personal squabbles as
realisation dawned that the institutional changes needed to consolidate the
transition to a market economy would be both long and painful.
For many, the pain still outweighs the gain. Rising output has been
accompanied by soaring productivity gains of around 11-13 per cent this
year. But growth only resumed a year ago after three tough years of overall
decline. Real wages, which the World Bank estimates dropped by 3 per cent
net of tax in the 12 months ending July, remain very low while prices have
soared to world levels.
The 'feel bad' factor cannot have been alleviated by economic developments
since the dissolution of parliament at the end of May. On July 5 the
caretaker government introduced valued added tax with a 22 per cent top rate
and on August 27 it devalued the zloty by 8 per cent in an attempt to boost
declining exports and compensate for the import boom which preceded the
introduction of the tax. (A 27 per cent rise in imports and a 7 per cent
drop in exports led to a record Dollars 1.4bn trade deficit over the first
seven months.)
Technically, the smooth introduction of VAT, and the broadening of the tax
base which results from it, will help to improve the sustainability of the
economic recovery. Higher revenues will also help Poland keep within the IMF
guidelines necessary to attract foreign investment and finance a future
Dollars 12bn debt reduction and rescheduling agreement with the commercial
banks.
In the short run however the combination of higher taxes and devaluation
will add to the squeeze on incomes and make it difficult to reduce inflation
from around 35 per cent a year at present.
Which is why, as election day looms on Sunday, the government parties look
gloomy, and the reformed communists are quietly expecting to become cock of
the electoral roost.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Tougher EC line urged on aid for steel: Germans say
Commission is compromising over proposals for subsidies discipline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE German steel industry said yesterday that action being considered by the
European Commission to enforce cuts in subsidies for state-owned steelmakers
in Europe was not tough enough.
It said negotiations on a rescue package for the European steel industry
would fail if the Commission backed proposals from public producers in Spain
and Italy which did not lead to real cuts in overcapacity.
'There are signs that the Commission is compromising too much and departing
from its earlier principles to impose strict discipline over subsidies,' Mr
Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said yesterday.
He said he would ask the German government to oppose any agreement on
subsidies if it amounted to 'window-dressing'.
Mr Vondran's warning followed the Commission's proposal, outlined on
Tuesday, for the restructuring of the Spanish steel industry which EC
industry ministers will be asked to approve on Monday.
Under the plan, Spanish authorities will be asked to find a private investor
to keep open a mini-mill in Sestao, in the Basque country. The plan also
foresees the closure of another Basque plant, at Anzio, by mid-1995, 18
months ahead of schedule.
But German private steel producers say such an agreement does not go far
enough in curbing subsidies for state-owned producers and in forcing cuts in
categories with overcapacity.
'Private investors cannot be used as scapegoats to rescue ailing state-owned
steel plants,' Mr Vondran said.
He also warned against steelmakers inflating production levels before
offering capacity cuts and excluding social rehabilitation payments to scale
down subsidies which they are asked to reduce.
German private steelmakers want Spain and Italy to undertake half the
closures needed to meet the restructuring targets set by the Commission and
which aims to cut 30m tonnes of crude steel-making capacity.
They are offering to cut 5m tonnes of crude steel capacity this year but
refusing to offer larger cuts unless a clear agreement on state subsidies
for state-owned producers is reached.
The EC timetable for such an agreement has been delayed several times this
year after fruitless negotiations with state producers in Europe,
particularly in Italy. An overall decision on subsidies, intended for
September, has been postponed to November.

The German government submission to the European Commission's review of jobs

welcoming a greater role for the social partners - unions and employers -
written into the Maastricht Treaty, writes David Goodhart.
In addition to existing directives it suggests seven general rights which
workers throughout the EC should enjoy: equal treatment for people in
part-time employment; ban on discrimination against workers who exercise
their legal rights; the right of the worker to be heard in internal company
matters; protection of privacy; entitlement to four weeks leave; adequate
protection against dismissal and ban on sex discrimination.

<TEXT>
Italian and Norwegian judicial authorities are investigating a series of
deals involving the North Sea oil business, including those of Eni, the
state oil concern, and Statoil, its Norwegian counterpart, Robert Graham
reports from Rome.
This was disclosed yesterday in a brief statement from the Italian financial
police, the Guardia di Finanza, after a visit to Milan by a team of
Norwegian investigators.
Eni has been at the centre of Milan magistrates' corruption investigations
for more than nine months and previously suspect commissions and payments
have been identified in contracts in developing countries or the former
Soviet Union. But this is the first publicised instance of an investigation
of alleged corrupt deals in a European country.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Croats pull back after clashes in Krajina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIAN forces yesterday withdrew from three villages wrested last week
from Serb control in Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia, as
United Nations peacekeepers were deployed between the warring Croatian
troops and rebel Serbs.
But with the Serb forces threatening to retake the villages, the fighting in
the last five days has rekindled fears of a wider war in the enclave.
Although the battles in central Bosnia have overshadowed the rumbling
conflict in Krajina in recent months, it is the broader struggle between
Croatia and Serbia that seems set to shape the future of any peace - or
further fighting - in the former Yugoslavia.
The Croat offensive against the Serb-held villages last week was not, it
seems, a serious attempt to recapture territory lost to the Serbs after the
six-month war in 1991. Instead it appears to have been an attempt to flex
Croatia's military muscles in the face of pressures from the Serbs and the
international community.
One of the pressures facing Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, is
the knowledge that the UN mandate for the peacekeeping forces in Croatia is
due to expire at the end of the month. Since the January 1992 ceasefire, the
disputed areas in Croatia have been monitored by 15,000 peacekeeping troops
in UN zones known as Sectors North, South, East and West.
Although UN officials expect the mandate will be renewed, the uncertainty
about the UN's role, and the future of the enclaves, has renewed Croatian
fears that partition of Bosnia could lead to a division of Croatia as well.
With a third of Croatia under Serb control, Mr Tudjman is now at pains to
deflect domestic attention from Zagreb's apparent weakness.
He is also under pressure to dampen domestic suspicions that Croatia has
struck too close a deal with Serbia.
Since Croatia would be hard pressed to fight on two fronts, the conflict
with the Serbs has apparently prompted Mr Tudjman to try for a
reconciliation with Mr Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president.
Meanwhile, fighting continued in central Bosnia yesterday in spite of
Tuesday's apparent ceasefire.
A meeting of the Nato council in Brussels yesterday agreed to start formal
planning for a force of around 50,000 troops to police a future peace
agreement in Bosnia.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Belgian interest rate cut follows German easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S central bank again cut two of its key interest rates yesterday in
the wake of the easing in German monetary policy at the end of last week,
writes James Blitz. However, unlike the rate cuts of the past few days, the
move was followed by a depreciation in the value of the Belgian franc
against the D-Mark.
The Belgian authorities cut their central rate from 10.25 per cent to 10 per
cent. They also cut their end-of-day rate from 12 to 11.75 per cent.
The Belgian currency ended the day weaker against the D-Mark, closing at
BFr21.41 against a previous BFr21.47. The currency may have fallen amid the
buying of D-Marks against the dollar, sterling and most European currencies.
But there were new signs yesterday that dealers are not interpreting the
easing in European monetary policy as a harbinger of more cuts. Belgian
interest rate futures, among the best guides to the market's expectation of
rate moves, failed to rally yesterday. French interest rate futures were
also weaker, despite the easing in the 5-10 day lending rate last week.

Relatives of Croats killed in the village of Uzdol crying over bodies
yesterday in the town of Prozor. Croat military officials in Bosnia have
threatened to flatten Stari Vitez, an encircled Moslem enclave in the town
of Vitez, in retaliation for the apparent massacre by Moslems of more than
30 Croat villagers in Uzdol, UN sources say, Reuter reports.
Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban declared a day of mourning for the
villagers, most of whom were said to have been civilians by reporters who
saw the bodies. 'The Croats. . . issued an ultimatum warning everyone in
Stari Vitez to vacate the area by noon or face the consequences,' a UN
worker in Vitez said.
Stari Vitez has been besieged by Croat forces for the past four months.

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of the International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a new
agreement with Hungary providing a SDR340m (Pounds 312m) standby loan
facility and giving the go-ahead to further funding from international
institutions.
The IMF and Hungary suspended their previous agreement in the first half of
last year when the budget deficit ran over target. The new accord restores
Hungary's financial respectability.
It triggers the release of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) credit tranche from
the World Bank and Japan's Eximbank, and a further Dollars 100m World Bank
loan in support of Hungary's privatisation programme.
Renewed borrowing will enable Hungary to reduce slightly its reliance on
international capital markets and manage more cheaply its gross foreign debt
of Dollars 23bn, the highest per capita in eastern Europe. Yesterday's
decision also clears the way for the World Bank delegation, at present in
Budapest, to recommend backing for Hungary's efforts to recapitalise the
largest state-owned banks after heavy loan losses.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Italy losing resolve on plant closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of 333 surplus workers at an ageing state-owned phosphorus plant in
southern Italy has become a test case of the government's resolve to
rationalise loss-making industries at a time of rising unemployment.
The workers' plight at Crotone on the Ionian coast of Calabria has also
become a symbol of southern Italy's desperation with unemployment rates of
23 per cent. From President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro downwards, everyone in
authority has sympathised with the workers and the government has followed
the line of least resistance.
As a result, the compromise solution now being hammered out looks set to
disregard the government's brave talk of allowing state industries to be run
as commercial operations. It also encourages the numerous other worker
protests in progress, which have yet to receive full publicity, to take the
law into their own hands. The 70-year-old phosphorus plant is part of a
petrochemical complex owned by Enichem, the chemicals arm of Eni, the state
oil concern. On September 7 the plant was occupied and vandalised in protest
over plans to lay-off 333 of the 500 workers.
Throughout this period the Crotone railway station has been blocked to all
traffic by protesters sitting on the tracks, while drums of chemicals have
obstructed the main coastal road. The authorities have made no efforts to
unblock these essential communications for fear of provoking further
violence involving toxic chemicals.
Behind the protest lies a sorry history of disinvestment in Crotone - the
oldest industrial zone in Calabria - coupled with the politically motivated
planning of petrochemicals ventures in southern Italy and the change in
management at Eni following its transformation in August 1992 into a joint
stock company. Eni inherited the plant from Montedison through their
ill-fated chemicals venture, Enimont. Although it is the sole phosphorus
producer in Italy, losses have been accumulating. Last November, after
12-month losses of L24bn (Pounds 10m), it was shut down and the 333 workers
were left idle on full pay. Of these, more than 100 had been reabsorbed
under a court order following the failure of an Enichem project to produce
tennis rackets on the site.
The trigger for the protest was Enichem invoking the mechanism to lay them
off - a process whereby they lose approximately 20 per cent of their pay.
The workers feared this was the first step towards ultimate unemployment,
and were determined to force Eni and the government to come up with
alternate plans to create long-term jobs.
After tortuous negotiations Eni has agreed temporarily to maintain full pay;
but has tried to make the point that, as a public company, its loss-making
operations have to be rationalised. No longer can it fulfil a role in the
south of providing padded state employment.
After three days of talks in the prime minister's office, the compromise
centres on the government declaring Crotone a zone of economic emergency.
This enables special state funds to be made available from the budget as
well funds from the EC. These monies will aid an as yet undefined industrial
project involving the Eni group and regional financial institutions. In
return Eni, will take back only a small number of the 333 workers due to be
laid off.
This solution suggests Enichem will be subject to similar pressures when it
seeks to cut some 800 of its 2,900 workforce in economically depressed
Sicily.
Finally the Crotone affair has played into the hands of the populist Lombard
League. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, claimed this week the south was
being protected at the expense of the north where the recession is keenly
felt but without such protests.

EUROPEAN machine tool manufacturers yesterday called for a European
Community industrial and trade policy to deal with the industry's
deep-seated structural problems, Andrew Baxter reports from Hanover.
They unveiled a five-point plan aimed at correcting 'flagrant imbalances'
between Europe, Japan and the US, according to Mr Yves de Boisfleury,
president of Cecimo, the umbrella body for Europe's machine tool
organisations.
It was launched on the second day of EMO, the world's largest machine tool
fair, in Hanover. Production of machine tools in the 12 Cecimo countries has
fallen from a peak of SFr27.2bn (Pounds 12.5bn) in 1990 to SFr22.6bn last
year. Employment in the industry has fallen by 32,000 to about 167,000 in
two years.
The Cecimo document says competitiveness is mainly influenced by the social
costs that industry must pay. It says a comparison of hourly costs in
Germany, Japan and the US shows a disparity of 27 per cent in favour of
Japan and 37 per cent in favour of the US. Cecimo says this position is
untenable in the short and medium term.
It also says methods should be devised to enable industrialists to keep
under contract the maximum number of personnel during a period of recession
so that the industry is fully equipped for recovery. Its three other
recommendations are:
An EC study that should produce concrete proposals for stimulating
specialised training for technicians;
The urgent establishment of a specific research and development programme in
European manufacturing, adapted to the needs and means of small to
medium-sized companies
A strong trade policy to maintain the European machine tool industry's
competitiveness. This means 'a positive and rapid conclusion of the Gatt
negotiations and a co-ordinated policy to promote exports'.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Plan to create 'dual anchor' for ERM: European Monetary
Institute to be urged to move more quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which presides over the
EC, yesterday hinted at a plan to create a 'dual anchor' for the ERM, with
the D-Mark locked to a new form of 'hard' Ecu, or European currency unit.
The plan is due to be unveiled next month by the European Parliament's
monetary affairs committee.
Its essence is that the European Monetary Institute (EMI), due to be set up
by January in Emu's second stage, should assume more quickly the functions
of the European central bank it is meant to prefigure, by issuing and
managing the Ecu as a joint anchor to the system alongside the D-Mark.
The Ecu would be fixed against the D-Mark, with other EC currencies having
their weighting in the Ecu 'basket' adjusted according to whether they
appreciated or devalued, but with much tighter monetary co-ordination, and
more joint intervention capability.
Mr Joao Cravinho, the Portuguese socialist and economist who has devised the
plan, has already discussed it with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, the Belgian presidency, the Bundesbank, and the Spanish prime
minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez. Spain is the country most worried that if hard
currency member states try to establish a mini-Emu to salvage something from
the wreckage, both the Emu project and the single market will come apart.
The plan will include proposals that:
Member states turn over 20 per cent of their gold and foreign exchange
reserves to the EMI to manage;
The member states issue all new debt in Ecus;
The EMI and Bundesbank assume joint responsibility for holding the
Ecu/D-Mark parity;
The Twelve set a joint 'interest rate indicator';
The Twelve evolve a joint incomes policy linking wage rises to productivity.
'If you're going to keep Emu on track the problem of the anchor (to the ERM)
has to be tackled,' Mr Cravinho said.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night elected eight judges for the international war
crimes tribunal that will try those accused of murders and other atrocities
in former Yugoslavia since 1991, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
But three more jurists are needed to complete the court and secret balloting
will resume in the general assembly today.
The tribunal will be based at The Hague and is due to begin work on November
15. But it could be months before the judges - each of whom will receive an
annual stipend of Dollars 145,000 (Pounds 94,155) - hear their first case
and then not in the Netherlands but closer to former Yugoslavia.
The court, the first to deal with war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo
tribunals after the second world war, will not impose the death penalty.
Governments are being asked to volunteer to incarcerate those convicted and
sentenced.
The US has already named as suspected war criminals Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, for
their alleged responsibility for mass killings by Serb forces.
To be elected, each nominee required a majority of 94 votes in the
184-nation assembly. A black American jurist, Ms Gabrielle McDonald, came
top of the list with 137 votes.
Other judges elected included Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general
of Australia.

It also says methods should be devised to enable industrialists to keep

losses.
Under discussion in Budapest, and contingent on IMF approval of Hungary's
macroeconomic policy, is a World Bank credit of about Dollars 200m for
restructuring of the banks and a second programme to restructure large
corporate debtors.
Hungarian officials describe World Bank support as crucial in bringing the
capital adequacy of the fragile banking sector up to 4 per cent of assets
before the end of the year and closer to the Bank for International
Settlements's recommendation of 8 per cent.
The IMF credit agreement has its price for Budapest.
It ties the conservative government to a programme of deficit reduction even
as elections scheduled for next spring approach.

CROATIA said yesterday it would withdraw from three villages wrested last
week from Serb control in Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia,
and place them under United Nations supervision.
But with the Serb forces threatening to retake the villages, the fighting in
the last five days has rekindled fears of a wider war in the enclave.
Although the battles in central Bosnia have overshadowed the rumbling
conflict in Krajina in recent months, it is the broader struggle between
Croatia and Serbia that seems set to shape the future of any peace - or
further fighting - in the former Yugoslavia.
The Croat offensive against the Serb-held villages last week was not, it
seems, a serious attempt to recapture territory lost to the Serbs after the
bitter six-month war in 1991. Instead it appears to have been a limited
attempt to flex Croatia's military muscles in the face of pressures from
both the Serbs and the international community.
One of the pressures facing Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, is
the knowledge that the UN mandate for the peace-keeping forces in Croatia is
due to expire at the end of the month. Since the January 1992 ceasefire, the
disputed areas in Croatia have been monitored by 15,000 peacekeeping troops
in UN zones known as Sectors North, South, East and West.
Although UN officials generally expect that the mandate will be renewed, the
uncertainty about the UN's role, and the future of the enclaves, has renewed
Croatian fears that the proposed partition of Bosnia in the latest peace
plan could lead to a division of Croatia as well.
With a third of Croatia under Serb control, Mr Tudjman is now at pains to
deflect domestic attention from Zagreb's apparent weakness.
He is also under pressure to dampen domestic suspicions that Croatia has
struck too close a deal with Serbia. Even if the Serb leadership is
eventually willing to hand over parts of their self-styled state, Belgrade
will be loath to cede the disputed Sector East, with the fertile areas of
Baranja and Eastern Slavonia on the borders of Serbia, without an all-out
war.
Since Croatia would be hard pressed to fight on two fronts, the conflict
with the Serbs has apparently prompted Mr Tudjman to try for a
reconciliation with Mr Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president.
Mr Tudjman's sudden request for a meeting with Mr Izetbegovic this week
fuelled suspicions in Belgrade of a revived Croat-Moslem alliance which
could destroy any Serb-Croat plans for a two-way partition of Bosnia.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Delors suggests bringing back capital controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER, PETER BRUCE and JAMES BLITZ

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday raised
the possibility of a partial reintroduction of controls on the movement of
capital, to combat the sort of currency speculation that led to this
summer's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism.
'Cars are free to drive,' said Mr Delors, the original animator of the
economic and monetary union project, 'but they are subject to traffic rules.
I see no reason why at international level we shouldn't study means of
limiting monetary traffic.'
Mr Delors suggested that the safeguard clauses in the EC directive on the
free movement of capital could be used by the 12 member states in concert.
'Why can't what one country does be done by all together?' he argued.
The free movement of capital is one of the foundation stones of the European
single market, but Mr Delors seemed to imply that what he was putting
forward would not conflict with internal market rules.
The safeguard clauses in Article 3 of the directive, which, for instance,
allow member states temporarily to impose reserve requirements on lending to
currency purchasers, were used by Spain and Ireland last year in vain
attempts to avert devaluation.
Mr Delors was speaking at a European Parliament debate on monetary policy,
where calls for capital controls were made on the eve of today's first
anniversary of the forced departure of sterling and the lira from the ERM.
But his suggestions were swiftly countered by Mr Phillipe Maystadt, finance
minister of Belgium, which currently presides over the EC.
Mr Maystadt said 'reintroducing barriers to the movement of capital would be
contrary to our objectives', of completing the single European market and
reaching Emu.
But Mr Maystadt himself has recently stressed the need for vigorous measures
to rebuild the ERM, ' to prevent speculative shocks' as he put it yesterday,
and get Emu back on track.
European monetary officials have suggested that with the possible exception
of the Belgians, there was no enthusiasm for the reintroduction of exchange
controls at this week's meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, reiterated his scepticism about the
introduction of capital controls when talking to leading financial and
industrial figures earlier this week.
Asked whether he thought capital controls should be introduced as a means of
stabilising exchange rates, Mr Clarke said: 'My advice is, forget it.'
Currency analysts were also highly critical yesterday of Mr Delors'
comments.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Rise in inflation hits markets: FT-SE 100 falls 38.6 points
 -Government strategy under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGER than expected increase in inflation increased the pressure
yesterday on the government's economic strategy and sparked big falls in
London bond and share prices.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading equities suffered its biggest setback for
seven months and the gilt-edged securities market had its worst day since
the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago today.
News that the retail prices index rose in the year to August by 1.7 per
cent, up from 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to July, came the day after
government ministers imposed a near-freeze on public-sector pay next year on
the grounds that inflationary pressures were weak.
It provoked an angry response from the Labour party and union leaders
representing some of the 5m workers affected. The change between July and
August in the year-on-year RPI rate was the highest monthly increase since
November 1991. It was triggered by a broadly based rise in prices of retail
goods and services, particularly affecting clothes, shoes and household
goods.
The Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation - the year-on-year
increase in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - edged up to 3.1
per cent in August from 2.9 per cent in July to its highest level since
March.
The figures affected perceptions among UK investors about the outlook for
inflation, the weakness of which has helped prolong the recent London share
and bond rally. With long-dated gilts closing down 2 points, investors also
sold London equities, pushing the FT-SE 100 down 38.6 to 2,989.4, its
biggest one-day fall for seven months.
Investor nervousness about the UK economic outlook was heightened by
separate Central Statistical Office figures indicating barely visible growth
in retail sales volumes in August, and by weaknesses in share and bond
prices across the rest of Europe prompted by worries about the effects of
high interest rates and poor corporate earnings.
Sterling lost ground against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.4725, down
more than 1 pfennig, with little change in New York. Against a weak dollar,
the pound strengthened by half a cent to Dollars 1.5515, easing in New York
to Dollars 1.549.
The news increased speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may
have difficulties keeping the underlying measure of inflation within the
bottom half of the Treasury's 1-4 per cent target range within the life of
this parliament.
However, the Treasury stressed that inflation remained low by postwar
standards and the figures met with a calm response from Mr John Major.
Speaking in the Midlands, the prime minister said: 'People want steady
growth with low inflation. That's what we're planning for in the long-term.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour shadow chancellor, ridiculed government claims
that it had created an 'inflation-free' environment and said price pressures
would increase in the next few months. Mr Bill Morris, Transport and General
Workers' Union general secretary, said government ministers were 'living in
an economic fantasy world'.

FT  16 SEP 93 / Taiwan puts pressure on France to buy BAe jets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN, which recently formed a joint venture with British Aerospace, is
putting pressure on France to buy regional passenger jets from the company
in return for its own purchase of Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.5bn) worth of
French Mirage jets and missiles.
Air Inter, part of the state-owned Air France group, is planning to buy up
to 15 regional jets and is understood to be considering the Boeing 737-500,
the new Airbus A319 launched at the Paris air show in June, the Dutch Fokker
100 and the BAe 146RJ.
BAe is currently attempting to finalise the details of its joint venture to
build regional jets in Taiwan, rting with the 146RJ. Taiwan Aerospace will
hold 50 per cent of the new company, Avro.
The French deal, which could be worth between Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m,
would represent a significant breakthrough for BAe's regional jet business
in the mainstream European airline market. BAe has until now sold the
four-engine 146 mainly to smaller regional carriers.
However, the British company has been facing especially fierce competition
from Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace, for the Air Inter contract.
The Dutch authorities are also understood to have put considerable political
pressure on the French government, suggesting that selection of the
twin-engine Fokker 100 by Air Inter could clear the way for a Dutch purchase
of Franco-German Cougar military helicopters.
Taiwan has now stepped in by raising the threat of retaliation over the big
Mirage deal if Air Inter does not choose the BAe 146. The sale of 60 Mirage
fighters and 1,500 missiles to Taiwan is regarded as a lifeline for the
French Dassault aerospace group, which has not won a military export order
for four years.
The pressure by Taiwan on the French government also appears to confirm
Taiwan's determination to complete the joint venture deal with BAe and
develop a presence in the world civil aircraft market.
After hectic negotiations in Taiwan last month, BAe and Taiwan authorities
finally agreed on the financial structure of Avro.
But Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, confirmed yesterday that the two sides
were still negotiating technology and development issues in an effort to
complete the deal.
A senior Taiwanese delegation was in London last week, but the two parties
failed to reach final agreement.
However, BAe appeared confident yesterday that the issues would eventually
be ironed out to clear the way for completing the deal.

FT  16 SEP 93 / ICI seeks buyer for stake in Teesside plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest chemicals company, yesterday
said it wanted to sell a substantial stake in its Teesside ethylene plant,
one of Europe's largest petrochemicals operations. The move would continue
ICI's withdrawal from commodity petrochemicals.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said the 850,000 tonne a year plant,
located at Wilton, was not a core activity and he expected ownership to
change hands. Ethylene is the basic building block for plastics.
'There's no urgency. We won't be a distressed seller and we want to dispose
of it in a constructive way. But it is not a core business in the sense that
it will be part of ICI for ever and certainly not in a 100 per cent way,' he
said.
ICI has already set up a joint-venture with Enichem of Italy for its
polyvinyl chloride operations and is in the process of selling its European
polypropylene operations to Germany's BASF.
While it came as no surprise on Teesside to learn that some ICI activities
at the site were vulnerable as the company focuses on core businesses, Mr
John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers Union, was enraged at Mr Hampel's comments.
'I find that statement appalling,' said Mr Newbold, whose union represents
2,000 of the 5,000 blue collar ICI employees at Wilton.
'It would have been common courtesy to explain to the workforce first of
all. His first responsibility is to his workforce, not to cause more
uncertainty amongst them with generalised statements like this.'
The vagueness of the comments could only damage morale, he said.
Speaking at a chemicals industry seminar hosted by SG Warburg, Mr Hampel
said: 'The Teesside ethylene cracker is modern and cost-competitive and will
remain part of the European petrochemical industry for a long time to come.'
He stressed that the PTA and Melinar ethylene derivatives businesses were
not for sale and that the company would require secure supplies of ethylene
for these operations. Mr Hampel said: 'Gone are the days when ICI could
afford to carry businesses in which we have no competitive advantage and
which do not have profitable growth potential.'
The ethylene facility is part of the industrial chemicals division which
generated profits during the first half of the year of Pounds 60m on
turnover of Pounds 1.8bn.

FT  15 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) When disasters lead to riches in Bermuda: The
international reinsurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th September 1993) appended to this article.
International investors have been gripped by enthusiasm for the catastrophe
reinsurance market in recent months. A string of new ventures has brought
more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in new capital to Bermuda, the Atlantic
island whose loosely regulated and tax-free offshore market has been the
focus of much recent activity.
The current boom ought to be relatively long and very profitable. With the
departure of up to 200 reinsurance companies because of recent catastrophe
losses, rates have increased sharply.
However, many in the industry are already warning that expansion has been
too quick and that the rapid supply of capital into the market could lead to
a resumption of rate competition. Mr Angus Runciman, analyst with BZW, says:
'The speed with which the fresh capital has been sucked in is alarming. It
could end in tears.'
Rates for catastrophe reinsurance initially rose steeply in 1990 and 1991
after billion dollar losses sucked up to Dollars 10bn in capital from the
industry. Many leading players - including the Gooda Walker and Feltrim
Lloyd's syndicates - were eliminated, reducing competition among the
suppliers of high-level covers and destroying the so-called 'spiral' market,
where reinsurers offset their own exposures with each other.
Two losses in particular - a typhoon in Japan in 1991 and Hurricane Andrew
in the US last year - have given impetus to the upswing, strengthening the
hand of underwriters and allowing them to force through price increases.
Mr Charles Skey, a veteran London underwriter now working with a new
Bermudian company, Mid-Ocean, says that rates are 'the best I have ever seen
in 28 years of underwriting. We've never had rates at these high levels in
four of the biggest markets - Japan, Australasia, North America and the UK -
at the same time'.
Over the past four years catastrophe rates for Japanese insurers have risen
more than 700 per cent, while buyers in other markets have seen rates at
least double or triple.
Andrew in particular, which with losses of more than Dollars 15bn is the
US's costliest natural disaster, has been a decisive factor prompting some
reinsurance companies to leave the market. 'Andrew made people sit up and
realise the size of the numbers we are potentially talking about,' says Mr
Runciman.
Mr Michael Butt, the former head of Eagle Star who took over as Mid-Ocean
chief executive in April, says the sudden shrinkage of capacity in London
accelerated the pace of developments in Bermuda.
Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the
merchant bank, sponsored Mid-Ocean's formation last November with capital of
Dollars 350m. Less than a year later the company has already been to the US
capital markets to raise an extra Dollars 325m, has reported its first
profits and is preparing to step up the scale of its activities.
Since the summer, US and overseas investors and insurance companies have
been launching ventures at the rate of almost one a week in Bermuda. There
have been initiatives by American International Group, the world's biggest
insurer, and General Re, the US's biggest reinsurer. Last month's decision
by Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer, to join forces with New
York investor, Mr John Head, to raise up to Dollars 850m for a new Bermudian
venture, is seen as an important show of confidence for the Bermuda market.
London too has benefited. At least three new reinsurance companies have been
formed this year and the lure of profits is encouraging institutional
investors to look seriously at backing new corporate members at the Lloyd's
market.
Mr Butt suggests that the scale of capital formation will be insufficient to
reintroduce rate competition, dismissing comparisons with the early to
mid-1980s, when a wave of speculative capital flooded into London.
New Bermudian companies are using their capital more cautiously than was
typical in London in the 1970s and 1980s, by underwriting a maximum of 50
cents of premium for each dollar of capital, giving them solvency ratios at
least twice as high as was common five years ago.
Reinsurers are also now tending to underwrite what the market calls bigger
'net lines', retaining more exposure on their own books. Mr Butt expects the
demand for catastrophe reinsurance could increase as a result of trends in
the proportional reinsurance market (where reinsurers accept a proportion of
premium from a direct insurer in return for the same proportion of exposures
less a ceding commission), especially in Europe.
Big European reinsurers such as Munich Re and Swiss Re which dominate this
market are placing limits on the amount of catastrophe exposure they are
prepared to accept in proportional deals, forcing many European insurers to
buy more catastrophe cover and lending support to upward rating trends.
Nevertheless many in the industry remain unconvinced that the new capacity
will not affect rates. There are already isolated reports that brokers are
attempting to use the threat of competition to obtain better rates and
although Bermudian companies have so far tended to write 'following lines',
underwriting portions of risk but leaving lead underwriters in London to
determine rates and conditions, this could begin to change next year.
Some of the new Bermudian capital is out to make short-term profits. Next
year if some of these companies find they are writing insufficient premiums
they may start to 'press rates down', sugone analyst.
'At the moment the new Bermudian companies are swimming alongside the
whales. But how long will it be before they want to make waves of their
own?' asks Mr Runciman.

NET PROFITS at Barco, the Belgian electronics group, increased by 34 per
cent in the first half of 1993 to BFr373m (Dollars 10.9m) from BFr279m.
Current profit after tax rose from BFr436m - restated to take account of new
valuation rules - to BFr535m on sales of BFr5.12bn against BFr4.94bn. Sales
outside the EC make up 41 per cent of total turnover, compared with 36 per
cent in the first half of 1992.
The group said it expected the trend towards better results to continue in
the second half, in spite of the fact that Europe is suffering from
recession. 'A slight recovery of the economy can, as in the US, bring with
it a significant increase in turnover,' the company said yesterday.
Barco said that demand for its products remained positive in the US, which
accounts for 27.5 per cent of the turnover in the group's dominant division,
manufacturing video display units and projection systems.
Consolidation of goodwill reduced current profits by BFr162m, compared with
a reduction of BFr156m last year, but current cash flow rose from BFr963m to
BFr1.03bn.
Almanij, the Belgian financial holding company, will pay a net interim
dividend of BFr180 per share at the end of October. The company is extending
this financial year to 18 months to bring its accounts in line with those of
Kredietbank, the Belgian bank in which it has a substantial stake. In the 12
months to June 30, the group made a profit of BFr1.87bn, against BFr1.71bn
in the equivalent period. Kredietbank will announce its interim results
tomorrow.
The European Commission said it had cleared the purchase by Alcatel Cable of
the submarine telecommunications systems and satellite television antenna
business of the UK's Northern Telecom Europe Ltd a unit of Northern Telecom

<TEXT>
CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French banking group, plans to float one-third of Union
des Assurances Federales, its insurance subsidiary, on the Paris second
market, the company announced yesterday.
A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais said that the decision to sell a stake in
UAF was part of the group's strategy of raising capital through the listing
of subsidiaries.
UAF is valued at about FFr1.6bn (Dollars 285m) in Credit Lyonnais' accounts.
A sale of one-third of the group would raise between FFr500m and FFr700m in
capital, according to analysts' estimates.
Following its listing, expected by the end of the year, UAF will be one of
the biggest companies on the Paris second market. One of France's 20 largest
insurance groups, it had turnover in 1992 of FFr8.49bn in life assurance and
FFr955m in general insurance. Last year it posted net profits of FFr368m. A
spokesman for Credit Lyonnais said that he expected UAF to increase profits
by 10 per cent this year.

EMS-CHEMIE, the Swiss speciality chemicals group headed by Mr Christoph
Blocher, has reported a 13 per cent rise in operating profits in the first
eight months of the year to SFr61m (Dollars 43.3m).
However, the group forecast only that operating profits in the full year
'should reach at least last year's level'. Operating profit last year was
SFr92m.
EMS, which sells a large volume of speciality chemicals to the automotive
industry, said it assumed that its environment would continue to be
difficult.
The recession in Germany, its most important market, was likely to last
longer than in other countries, it said.
Sales in the first eight months were down 4 per cent to SFr554m, and the
group said full year sales could be slightly below last year's SFr896m.

S. G. WARBURG, the London-based investment bank, has appointed Mr Lutz Wille
as head of securities for its German operations.
For the past two years Mr Wille, 54, has been chief financial officer of the
Colonia insurance group, and before that he spent 20 years at Commerzbank,
latterly as head of securities.
The appointment is symptomatic of international investment banks' desire to
recruit high-ranking German financiers to help them penetrate the difficult
German market.
Warburg has had problems in Germany, recently losing a managing director and
its highly rated team of German equity analysts to separate US investment
banks.
It has also suffered disruption as it moved its office from Munich to
Frankfurt this year.

FT  15 SEP 93 / French try to protect Europe from Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as a US
attempt to use the world trade negotiations to swamp Europe with Hollywood
films.
Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Dollars 8.8m) in aid to encourage
film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also
warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) deal were to cover the cinema, the French government 'will
not sign it'.
France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over
agriculture, because it cannot credibly claim that the livelihood of less
than 4,000 French employed in full-time film-making is as vital a national
interest as the future of more than 1m farmers. Paris would therefore
probably allow itself to be outvoted on any audiovisual deal.
But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into
its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture.
Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park and Last Action Hero were
already taking too large a slice of the French cinema market, the minister
claimed that Gatt's general free trade principle of non-discrimination would
make it impossible for France to keep its regular FFr1.3bn a year subsidy
for the making of French films and its requirement that French broadcasters
must air a minimum of 60 per cent EC-made films.
The special aid announced by Mr Toubon yesterday is particularly aimed at
helping French studios fighting competition from lower cost locations in
eastern Europe and Portugal.
As with agriculture, France is at odds with some of its EC partners, and the
European Commission, over the right approach to the US in Gatt. Paris argues
that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by claiming a total
'exception' for it.
By contrast, the Commission maintains that by including audiovisual
products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of this sensitive cultural
area, the EC would be better placed to defend Community broadcasting
legislation, as well as the tougher national provisions of countries like
France, from unilateral US attack in the future.
The EC's television broadcasting directive merely recommends that European
stations schedule a majority of EC-made programmes. French legislation
requires national stations to air a minimum of 60 per cent of EC-made
programmes, while also subsidising local film-making from a 5.5 per cent
levy on TV station turnover and an 11 per cent tax on cinema tickets.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Clinton underlines his support for Nafta pact: President
calls on US to embrace global economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a
North American Free Trade Agreement.
However, an unexpected twist in Mexico City saw President Carlos Salinas
using the same occasion - for the signing of labour, environmental and
import surge side agreements - as an opportunity to downplay the deal's
importance to the Mexican economy.
'No one will do for Mexico what Mexico does not do for itself,' he said.
In Washington, Mr Clinton said his administration would 'make our case as
hard and as well as we can,' in support of the pact between the US, Canada
and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe
that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The US ceremony began with the entrance of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter
and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the Chief.
Vice-president Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta.
He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war . . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the Middle East.'
Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta
debate, in a way that has been previously lacking, as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
The president said workers had become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is
behind most of the opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in
a time of change, the only way to recover your security is to broaden your
horizons and to adapt to the change.'
Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Mr Jimmy Carter to
take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a
demagogue . . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.
The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month
would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the
month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further
pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday he saw no
evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of
previous economic stimulus packages to emerge.
The Economic Planning Agency, traditionally more optimistic than the central
bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the second half of
the current tax year to March.
Private sector analysts' forecasts for the full year range widely, from an
economic decline to something below last year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself
the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade surplus is going up and there is no
growth in the short term. Now let's get some policy response,' said Mr James
Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the
past 16 months, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn
(Dollars 226bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the first
quarter, holding out the short-lived prospect of a recovery.
The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a
5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this
was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5
per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private
consumption, down 0.6 per cent as Japanese spent less on cars, furniture and
clothes.
Japan's trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent
from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand
and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of Japan's exports were
the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent over the same
period.
Japan's surplus with the US, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars
3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with Washington just a few
weeks before Mr Morihiro Hosokawa meets US president Bill Clinton for the
first time since he became prime minister.
A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in August in bankruptcies with liabilities of
more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, Teikoku Data
Bank. This was the first increase in four months; compared with July,
company collapses were up 5.6 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lafarge Coppee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Several special factors may have helped protect Lafarge Coppee's half-year
earnings, but its trading performance has proved surprisingly resilient
nonetheless. Although the French construction market has fallen away sharply
this year, Lafarge has contained the damage thanks to its cost cutting
campaign and overseas expansion. The US recovery has helped offset the
downturn in mainland Europe while other markets, such as eastern Germany and
Brazil, have remained particularly perky. The French cement market is also
proving more orderly than that in many other countries. While volumes have
fallen sharply, prices have remained relatively firm. France is certainly
better protected than the UK from cheap imports: its main population centres
are located further from the coast making transportation costs prohibitive.
Despite its sanguine trading statement, Lafarge cannot expect to evade the
downturn indefinitely. This perhaps helps to explain why the company is now
seeking to capitalise on its share price strength to raise FFr2.5bn in new
capital. This will keep gearing within sensible limits and may subsequently
enable Lafarge to pick off acquisitions. Many French companies may be keen
to follow the example. With the Paris bourse touching new highs, companies
must be tempted to raise equity finance before the privatisation deluge
begins.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday played down the importance to Mexico of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, in apparent response to concerns
that the treaty might be rejected by the US Congress.
In a speech which appeared to have been written before US President Bill
Clinton's strong endorsement of Nafta yesterday, Mr Salinas said neither the
treaty nor the side accords were a panacea. They would not resolve Mexico's
problems, and were just one element of the country's opening to the world
economy.
The Mexican president was speaking as he signed the supplemental accords to
the treaty. 'No one will do for Mexico what Mexico does not do for itself,'
he said. 'This is the truth, independently of the treaty and the accords.'
The president now appears to be lowering the expectations of future wealth
generated by Nafta, which he helped build up, and preparing Mexico and
foreign investors for the possibility that the US Congress might reject
Nafta.
The speech was considerably less upbeat than one he gave after the side
accords were concluded last month.
Mr Andres Rozental, deputy minister of foreign affairs, said: 'It is evident
that there is still a question of whether the US constitutional process will
be finalised and that obviously has a bearing on the way the treaty is
looked at.' Congress is expected to vote on the trade pact later this year.
The president chose the signing to stress advances that Mexico had made that
did not depend on Nafta. He said Mexico would probably join the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development before the end of next year, and
would shortly sign a trade treaty with Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia and a
separate one with Central America.
'Mexicans', the president said, 'are not waiting for the day that the treaty
comes into force to redouble our efforts. We have already been working so
that Mexico integrates more intensely with the world economy.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / GM planning to acquire Japanese car parts makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US carmaker, is looking to acquire one or more Japanese
parts makers to increase sales of components in the Japanese market.
Mr Philip Austin, vice-president of GM's Automotive Components Group in
Japan, said: 'To be a strong player in any market you need a manufacturing
presence and we don't have one in Japan.'
Although acquisitions of Japanese companies by foreign groups have been
rare, Mr Austin said the timing was good since many Japanese car parts
suppliers had suffered from the economic downturn. 'Their investments in the
US have become a burden and they are overcommitted in Japan with borrowings,
so opportunities obviously exist,' he said.
GM's move reflects its growing interest in developing its Asian operations.
The components division, which currently sells over 70 per cent of its
product to the parent company, is working to reduce its dependence on the
North American market to 50 per cent of revenues by 2000.
US and Japanese trade negotiators will meet in Hawaii next week to discuss
the possibility of encouraging Japanese purchases of US cars and car parts
in an effort to moderate Japan's huge trade surplus.
US-made car parts have been more successful in penetrating the Japanese
market than US-made cars. GM, for example, sells more than twice as much in
components in Japan as it does in cars, and Mr Austin said GM expected sales
to Japanese carmakers to reach Dollars 2bn globally by 1998, compared with
Dollars 900m last year.
Japanese carmakers have stated their willingness to try to buy Dollars 19bn
of foreign car parts in fiscal 1994 and there is a move on the US side to
push Japan to set a similar target for 1995 and 1996 as well. Although the
political pressure has helped raise awareness on the part of Japanese
carmakers of the need for change, GM has sought to expand its business by
working to better meet the needs of customers.
As a result the US company has even joined the supplier associations of
Japanese car parts makers which supply a particular car company. These meet
regularly to discuss their customers' policy and improve communications with
them.

FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Northern weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food manufacturer Northern Foods weakened on busy turnover of 3.5m in the
face of a number of profits downgrades. Hoare Govett cut Pounds 7m from its
1994 forecast to Pounds 165m, and Pounds 6m to Pounds 180m for 1995. Two
other brokers were reported to have moved their figures to similar levels,
according to dealers.
A food manufacturing analyst said worries over the company's meat division
had surfaced at what was described as a cautious meeting with institutions
this week. Concern over the performance of part of the biscuits business was
also said to have contributed to the downgrades. Northern shares retreated 8
to 273p.
A 30 per cent jump in interim profits to the top of market expectations sent
Kingfisher shares forward, although they slipped back in late trading to
close a penny down on balance at 645p. Turnover was a hefty 5m. Stores
analysts said that in spite of the good headline figures, lower operating
margins were giving cause for concern.
The worrying home improvement business, which has been the cause of heavy
losses at Kingfisher's DIY rivals, saw B&amp;Q post a small profits rise.
However, Kingfisher said the market remained difficult, with margin pressure
increasing. Ladbroke, which owns Texas, edged down a penny to 198p. Do It
All co-owner WH Smith 'A' lost 7 to 446p.
Reports that BT is considering moving into cable television and video
transmission was said to be behind falls in Rank Organisation and Carlton
Communications.
BT is developing a video-on-demand by telephone line for the UK, and is
drawing up plans to launch it next year. Rank and Carlton are both heavily
involved in the video duplication business. Rank shares lost 8 to 794p,
while BT slipped a penny to 419p.
Carlton received support from Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank arguing
that the current rating understates the earnings per share growth of the
next two years. The house believes the group will achieve eps of 53.1p in
1994, against 34.2p in 1992. Carlton shares shed 10 to 735p.
Vague talk about a possible sale of Granada's stake in the BSkyB satellite
venture was heard, although leisure analysts were dismissive. Granada added
7 at 453p. Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities were again recommending Thorn
EMI, up 7 at 990p. Following the sale of 5m shares by directors of Airtours
the stock declined 6 to 403p, the price at which they were placed in the
market on Monday.
A bout of nervous trading hit British Aerospace ahead of today's interim
figures, sending the shares 8 lower to 420p in trade of 2.7m.
Analysts expect profits to be in the region of Pounds 28m to Pounds 30m,
against a loss of Pounds 129m a year ago. At the time of last year's interim
report the company announced that it was to make a second-half provision of
Pounds 1bn, a move that more than halved the share price.
Shares in industrial management group Porter Chadburn fell sharply, giving
up 9 to 25p, after the company reinforced an earlier profits warning, saying
first-half profits will be well below last year's on a like-for-like basis.
Chemicals group Laporte eased 2 to 621p in front of tomorrow's interim
results. Profits forecasts range from Pounds 46m to Pounds 49m, but hope
that there will be some accompanying surprises was offset by the general
worries overhanging the sector. Many of those worries surround BOC, which
has been out of favour since this summer's profits warning. Yesterday there
were no takers for stock slushing around the market; the shares fell 6 to
636p.
Shares in Reuters Holdings hit a new high yesterday on the back of the
company's presentation to the New York investment community. Breaking out of
a tight and recent 35-point range, the stock climbed 14 to 1580p.
Rothmans International 'B' shares weakened 16 1/2 to 661 1/2 p on concern
that the group's Footsie status is in doubt. Meanwhile, investors switched
into BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group, whose shares rose 7 to
466 1/2 p.
Buyers of Zeneca sought the attractive yield, ahead of the company going
ex-dividend next month. The stock appreciated 14 to 733p.
Foods group Dalgety continued to benefit from Monday's results, adding 3 at
493p. Strauss Turnbull was recommending the stock on dividend considerations
and as reasonable value on price/earnings grounds.
Hazlewood Foods fell back as talk of a downgrade was heard. There was also
speculation that one of its board members, rumoured to be involved in
takeover talks at Manchester City football club, might sell his shares to
raise funds. Hazlewood shed 8 1/2 to 174p.
A positive round of press meetings gained good coverage for plans for
expansion by Boots, the chemists. The shares put on 2 at 491p. Next moved up
5 1/2 to 208 1/2 p on speculative buying amid reports that it, too, was
poised for expansion.
United Friendly 'B' shares fell 42 to 635p after posting a 36 per cent slide
in first-half profits to Pounds 6.1m from Pounds 9.5m.
Printer Watmoughs jumped 16 to 748p after revealing raised half-year profits
of Pounds 6.4m and an increased dividend.

Nervousness in the pharmaceuticals sector following the previewing of US
health proposals dried up yesterday as some UK houses looked at the sector's
relative value against the market.
NatWest Securities published a buy recommendation, arguing that 'short-term
performance will continue to be underpinned by low valuations and a lack of
value elsewhere'. Over the past 12 months the UK health and household sector
has underperformed the FT's All-Share Index by more than 45 percentage
points, and a number of economists are beginning to question whether the
broader market has topped out. Meanwhile, SGST concentrated on the Clinton
health reforms in its weekly reviews and said Wellcome would be the company
least affected.
The leading drug stocks opened weaker on the after-effects of US selling the
previous night but closed up on balance. Glaxo finished 2 firmer at 625p,
SmithKline Beecham 'A' 5 ahead at 409p and Wellcome up a penny at 724p.

<TEXT>
Shares of electrical engineering company Delta plunged as brokers cut
full-year profits expectations after the group announced interim figures
well below market forecasts.
The stock lost 8 per cent of its value, finishing 43 down at 511p, after the
company reported a 6 per cent decline in profits to Pounds 29.1m. The
figures were accompanied by a gloomy chairman's statement, in which he
warned that 'the UK recovery as far as manufacturing is concerned remains
more anaemic than many observers suggest, and activity in continental Europe
has yet to see the benefit of progressive interest-rate reductions'.
Analysts downgraded full-year profits forecasts and the range is now Pounds
60m to Pounds 62m, having been Pounds 68m to Pounds 70m.

FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance brokers shaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOCK results from Steel Burrill Jones sent the insurance broker's share
price plummeting by a third, the biggest slide in the London market
yesterday, and knocked the rest of the sector.
The firm announced a first-half loss of Pounds 3.9m, against a profit of
Pounds 6.23m last time, and an interim dividend reduced to 3p from 4.25p. It
said in the company statement that it would expect to make around Pounds
3.5m in the second half, suggesting a full-year loss of Pounds 400,000.
An insurance analyst at Hoare Govett said the market had been looking for a
full-year figure of Pounds 11.5m and a dividend of 13.3p. 'There were some
real bulls out there and they were caught out,' he added.
Steel Burrill's share price was marked down heavily at the start of trading
and closed 86 lower at 161p. The rest of the sector was also hit, although
some analysts said Steel's problems were specific and no reason for the
sector to suffer. Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the leaders, held up well but
CE Heath fell 14 to 396p, Lloyd Thompson 6 to 307p and Hogg Group 8 to 218p.

FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous close to a confused session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER nervous trading day saw London equities abandon much of a midsession
rally after British government bonds reacted to weakness in New York in the
face of the latest US consumer price data. Once again, UK securities houses
traded busily between the blue chip shares and stock index futures ahead of
Friday's expiry in futures markets.
Wider economic uncertainties also played a part in market trading. At home,
the rebasing of official industrial production data overshadowed the
market's initially favourable response to the statistics for July. The stock
market took a cautious view of the possible implications of a firm statement
on public sector pay policies from the UK government.
A lower opening in London equities, which took the FT-SE 100 Index down by
10.5 points, reflected the 200-point fall in the Nikkei average following
the announcement of a slight decline in gross national product and a high
trade surplus.
However, the stock market rallied as soon as stock index futures started
trading, and showed a premium on the September contract on the Footsie which
expires on Friday and currently dominates stock market attention.
By early afternoon the FT-SE 100 had replaced its early fall of 10 points
with a similar gain, taking it to the day's peak of 3,035.3. But the premium
on the Footsie futures contract then began to melt away, leaving the London
market exposed to the effects of a setback in UK bond prices and a fall of
22 Dow points in early trading on Wall Street.
The final reading put the Footsie at 3,028, with the day's gain reduced to a
mere 3.2 points. This contrasted with a fall of 12.9 to 3,458.6 for the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index as profit-takers in the smaller stocks had to pay a
price penalty.
Underlying worries over corporate earnings trends were not helped by reports
yesterday from the insurance and engineering sectors, and good half-time
figures from Kingfisher, the stores group, were taken coolly.
Rumours that Mr Nicholas Knight, king of the UK market bulls, was losing his
nerve, proved incorrect. However, while standing to his Footsie forecasts of
3,500 at end-1993 and 3,700 at end-1994, he admitted to a 'more hesitant
stance in the short term', adding that the move to 3,500 could come very
late in the year - and/or from lower levels.
SG Warburg, linked to its more cautious Footsie prediction of around 2,900
at end-1993, commented that the key to further gains in the stock market
remains strong earnings growth, 'and it is precisely here that the questions
are arising . . .'
Heavy turnover in stock index futures was the chief factor behind the
increase in Seaq volume in equities to 593.1m shares from Monday's 585.3m;
non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the total.
But retail, or customer, business, the true measure of the health of
investment activity in equities, fell away on Monday as trading was
dominated by intra-market dealings by securities houses bracing themselves
for the stock index future expiry. By value, retail business fell to Pounds
1.06bn, well at the lower end of the range established over the past 12
months. Daily retail business has averaged around Pounds 1.4bn since
sterling left the ERM network in September 1992.

FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE single trade by a leading US house in the September Footsie futures
contract boosted turnover in the sector as general trading in the
derivatives continued to be dominated by this week's expiry in both the
options and futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, US investment bank Salomon Brothers stole the limelight with a
single cross trade of 6,500 lots in the December contract. It was executed
at 3,060, and dealers said the trade was the equivalent of around Pounds
490m in underlying equities. That trade boosted volume in the December
future to 15,837 contracts.
In the September future, trading was volatile as dealers continued to close
positions and roll forward ahead of Friday's expiry. It opened at a discount
to cash at 3,017, but recovered to trade ahead of cash for most of the
session before a poor opening on Wall Street pulled it back in the last few
minutes of the day.
It still finished at a 5-point premium to cash at 3,033, with volume
reaching a hefty 16,342 lots.
Volume in the traded options jumped to 43,455 contracts, against 29,789 for
the previous day. Amstrad, whose September stock options expire today, was
the day's busiest trade with volume of 13,649 lots. Sheppards was said to
have sold 6,200 of the September 30 calls and bought 6,200 of the December
30 calls. Reuters, Zeneca and Glaxo were also busy.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail sales data fail to
provide lift for Dow

Wall Street
DISAPPOINTING news on inflation and a weakening bond market pushed share
prices on Wall Street lower, as stronger than expected retail sales figures
failed to impress equity investors, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 18.45 down at 3,615.76. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.16 to 459.90, while the American SE composite shed 1.54
to 452.76 and the Nasdaq composite fell 7.68 to 732.64. New York SE trading
volume came to 258.6m shares.
Stocks opened moderately lower in reaction to an early sell-off in the
Treasury bond market. The bearish mood was triggered by the release of
August's consumer price index, which showed a 0.3 per cent rise in retail
prices last month. Analysts had expected a 0.1 per cent uptick. A surprising
0.6 per cent decline in the August producer price index, released last
Friday, had served to heighten expectations of moderating inflation on the
retail level as well.
As the day progressed and the bond market tumbled, stock prices slipped
further. Investors took little comfort in a 0.2 per cent increase in August
retail sales, even though a slight fall had been predicted. Any indication
of growing consumption - and a more buoyant economy - was undercut by an
upward revision in July's figure, to a 0.3 per cent increase, which suggests
a declining month-to-month trend.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, edged Dollars  3/8 down to Dollars 64 3/8
after it announced 5,000 job cuts by the end of 1994. Other leading US
airlines, which on Monday cut fares by up to 45 per cent, lost ground as
well. UAL, operator of United Air Lines, shed Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 142
1/4 and Delta Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 5/8 .
Viacom, which this week agreed to acquire Paramount Communications in a
cash-and-stock transaction now valued at Dollars 7.9bn, dropped on a report
that heavy buying by Viacom's chairman had helped to boost its share price
in the weeks before the announcement. On the Amex, Viacom's class A shares
fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 , while its B non-voting stock was down
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 3/8 . Paramount slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
63 1/8 .
After a big sell-off late on Monday, Compaq Computer sought to downplay its
announcement of relatively flat personal computer shipments in the second
half. By the close the shares had recovered Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 .
Home Depot dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 36 1/4 after Goldman Sachs removed
the building supply retailer from its recommended list.
Canada
TORONTO closed mixed after busy trading. The TSE 300 index gained just 0.3
at 3,972.1, but declining issues outnumbered advances by 445 to 313. Volume
was 68.5m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices were lower, led by energy, off 1.0 per cent. The
gold shares index, after dropping 5.4 per cent on Monday, rallied 2.7 per
cent, helped by a recovery in the bullion price, which firmed USDollars 2 an
ounce to USDollars 345 in New York.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich returns to work in
positive mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger dollar helped some of the bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH returned to work after Monday's local holiday in unexpectedly
positive mood. The SMI index rose 22.7 to 2,388.3 with Soffex related
position squaring helping.
Mr Beat Alpiger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich commented that signs had begun
to emerge last week that the market was bottoming out.
However, yesterday's trend had been unexpectedly positive since the overall
environment had not changed. He had expected a further consolidation;but
instead, he thought that the market was now beginning to build hopes that
the Swiss National Bank would follow Germany's lead and reduce interest
rates.
Among banks, UBS added SFr29 to SFr1,140 and SBC added SFr11 to SFr454, and
in pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates put on SFr50 to SFr1062.
Swissair dipped SFr5 to SFr730 in spite of announcing that negotiations were
continuing on its planned merger with KLM, SAS and Austrian Airlines and
that it was confident of a decision soon.
Ms Susanne Borer of Bank Vontobel in Zurich, commented that such a link
would provide a number of benefits for Swissair, including access to the
European Economic Area, and further opportunities for rationalisation of
services and cost cutting.
FRANKFURT managed an 8 point gain as investors remained generally inactive,
partly on account of Friday's triple witching.
The DAX index closed at 1,880.57, after a high of 1,884 and a low of 1,876.
Turnover was DM5.4bn.
Mr Jochen Waiblinger of BHF bank commented that the market was going through
a consolidation phase at present and that it was possible that the next two
weeks could see the index dropping further.
A number of factors remained on investors' minds, he said, including the
macro economic picture. Data should be available later in the month, he
noted, which would provide an indication as to the expected direction of the
German economy. If the signals were that the recession had bottomed-out it
was to be expected that buyers would come back into the market, he said, and
that a range of cyclicals would provide attraction, as well as some
financials and chemicals.
Among the day's movers, Preussag and Degussa both rose DM5 to DM411 and
DM344.50 respectively.
PARIS moved in a narrow range before settling higher on the day. The CAC-40
index finished up 15.07 at 2,134.14, after a high of 2,141 and a low of
2,121. Turnover was FFr3.1bn.
Eurotunnel maintained Monday's active trading, although there was an absence
of news to explain the gains. Having seen a year's high of FFr44.60 the
shares slipped back in late trading to close 35 centimes higher at FFr43.70.
Lafarge Coppee announced that it planned to raise FFr2.5bn in cash and to
offer a 1 for 10 share issue by the end of the year, and the shares put on
FFr7 to FFr421, but off the day's high of FFr427.
The news from Legrand, which announced its interim results, pleased market
analysts and the shares gained FFr205 to FFr4,815.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by a stronger dollar as the CBS Tendency index added
0.9 to 125.2. Activity was seen in Akzo, up Fl 3.40 to Fl 172.20 and DSM, up
Fl 1.40 to Fl 94.40 and Ahold, up Fl 1.80 to Fl 89.70.
MILAN was helped ahead by US fund buying and the firmer lira, with
telecommunications issues and insureres among the beneficiaries. The Comit
index added 8.59 or 1.4 per cent to 606.14, with prices underpinned by
short-covering ahead of today's close of the monthly trading account.
Fiat's insurance unit Toro rose L1,576 or 5.2 per cent to L31,731, aided by
speculation it will soon be sold as part of Fiat's asset disposals. Alleanza
added L692 to L20,958 and Generali was L638 higher at L40,444.
Trading in Ferruzzi began almost two hours late after no buyers could be
found for 27m sell orders. Subsequently, the share again plunged L40.40 to
L363, the fall matching 10 per cent declines seen in the two previous
trading sessions.
San Paolo shed L521 or 4.8 per cent to L10,272 after details of its proposed
merger with two subsidiaries, Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda,
were announced on Monday night. Analysts noted that this had presented an
arbitrage opportunity to short San Paolo and go long on Lariano as a way of
buying into San Paolo at a discount.
STOCKHOLM saw profit-taking in Ericsson B shares leave the stock down SKr11
to SKr398, while Volvo B managed a SKr2 rise to SKr432. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 1.9 to 1,287.5.
MADRID rose at the close, pulled up by US quoted stocks and the general
index added 3.53 to 288.68. Banesto recovered Pta95 or 3.8 per cent to
Pta2,560 as one US broker upgraded the stock.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips back as
institutions take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors looking to realise profits on their holdings took
advantage of the Nikkei average's jump on Monday, and the index closed below
the 21,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index, which closed above 21,000 for the first time in five
trading days on Monday, shed 200.32 to 20,947.79 on active selling ahead of
the mid-term settlements for tokkin, or specified money trusts and fund
trusts.
The Nikkei rose to the day's high of 21,171.72 shortly before the opening,
and fell to the day's low of 20,924.69 in the afternoon session. The market
saw support from public funds and foreign investors.
Volume totalled 300m shares, against 283m. Declines led advances by 721 to
285, with 179 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
dipped 14.18 to 1,680.33, its first fall in three trading days. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.11 to 1,287.02.
Market participants moved to adjust positions ahead of a public holiday
today. Investors also remained cautious ahead of the spate of economic
indicators announced after the market closed.
Japan's August trade surplus rose 7.5 per cent, while the first-quarter GNP
for the fiscal year to March fell 0.5 per cent. Machinery orders, however,
cast some light on the gloomy outlook, as August private sector orders rose
5.6 per cent from the previous month.
Euphoria over the government's economic support package, to be announced
tomorrow, faded as many investors now expect the package to be centred
around tax breaks for housing and education, which may not have a direct
impact on the economy.
A fall in gold bullion prices depressed metal and mining issues. Sumitomo
Metal Mining weakened Y26 to Y927 and Mitsubishi Material Y9 to Y491.
Large-capital issues, which gained ground on Monday, were lower on
profit-taking. Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y346 and NKK Y4 to Y285, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries slipped Y10 to Y687.
Housing-related shares were among the gainers yesterday, on hopes of a rise
in housing demand due to the government's move to ease housing taxes. Sanwa
Shutter put on Y50 at Y1,110 and Takara Standard firmed Y20 to Y1,490.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 34.58 to 22,963.97 in volume of 57.8m shares.
Roundup
MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets were under pressure.
AUSTRALIA fell to its lowest level for almost a month, hit by tumbling gold
prices and a lower local dollar. The All Ordinaries index sank 25.4 to
1,912.9, although turnover held up at ADollars 392m.
The golds marker plunged 126.8, or 7 per cent, to 1,703.0, influenced by
bullion's losses. North Flinders Mines tumbled 64 cents to ADollars 11.24.
News Corp was a notable loser among industrial stocks, sliding 20 cents to
ADollars 10.58 on profit-taking.
NEW ZEALAND's consolidation continued, with forestry stocks still under
pressure, and the NZSE-40 capital index ended 8.19 down at 1,963.22 in
turnover of NZDollars 50.2m.
The market was unmoved by Prime Minister Jim Bolger's announcement that the
general election will be on November 6 or the latest poll which gave the
Labour party opposition a slight lead.
Brierley Investments ended steady at NZDollars 1.22 in heavy trading that
accounted for almost half the volume.
HONG KONG finished slightly lower after a day of slow and narrow trade amid
cautious sentiment due to renewed Sino-British friction over proposed
political reforms. The Hang Seng index closed 2.12 lower at 7,473.85.
SEOUL was subject to aggressive institutional selling which put further
pressure on the market in a day of sharply reduced trading volume, pulling
the composite index back 5.38 to 695.37.
TAIWAN saw late bargain-hunting lift stocks off early lows, but turnover
shrank with many investors sidelined on a lack of fresh news.
The weighted index closed 14.79 lower at 3,826.50.
BOMBAY saw a late rally triggered by foreign institutional buying in a
trading session halved to one hour to enable settlement in cash shares. The
BSE-30 index rose 18.44 to 2,807.64.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila enjoys benefit of renewed
overseas interest - The rally in Philippine equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philippine equities have been enjoying a rally recently as foreign investors
have been active buyers of the market.
Although the composite index yesterday fell back slightly, closing at 1,954,
the mood remains bullish. In the past week the index has set a succession of
record highs, closing on Monday at 1,978.81.
A surge in turnover, to a daily average of 720m pesos last week, has also
fortified support for historic highs for selected commercial-industrial
counters. During the previous 'mini-boom' in May, average turnover was 510m
pesos a day, which slowed down to some 450m in the succeeding months.
Analysts had been anticipating profit-taking in early September after the
market reached record levels in late-August. Since the index broke through
the May peak on August 23, however, the advance has been sustained by strong
buying support.
Obervers had expected a slowdown in the rally to coincide with the return on
September 7 of the body of Mr Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine
president, ousted from office in 1986 and forced to flee to Hawaii, where he
lived in exile until his death in 1989.
However, lean crowds turned up at the Marcos homecoming and funeral, which
bolstered earlier assessments by government officials that the former
dictator and his supporters were really 'a spent force'.
Analysts also cited the Philippine GNP figures reported late last week as a
positive factor for shares. According to government data, GNP grew by 1.8
per cent in the first half, after remaining mainly stagnant since 1990.
Providing the most inspiration to the market's recent advance has been PLDT,
which has also been moving up in New York where it is listed as an ADR.
Brokers say US investors have found the stock an attractive buy among the
telecommunications groups traded on Wall Street.
Another active issue, beer and food giant San Miguel, has seen the 'B'
shares rise to 150 pesos, from 136 pesos in late-August.
Analysts see the 'excess liquidity' in the financial system as a factor that
could favour the market over the short term, even if a rise in interest
rates soon could provide a dampener.
A reversal of the recent decline in Treasury bill rates, which had become
the benchmark for commercial lending rates, has started diverting funds back
into the money market, according to brokers.
The government is rumoured to be planning a cut in the volume of T-bills
being auctioned weekly. That, however, does not change the budgetary gaps
that the government will continue to contend with, and which it had filled
in the past with huge borrowings through Treasury bill flotations.
The recent softness of the peso rate against the US dollar, which could
continue in the next few weeks as industries increase imports of raw
materials ahead of the seasonal year-end rise in consumer purchases, has
also lured investible funds away from equities, finance executives admit.
The peso has dropped by some 8 per cent since the beginning of the year, in
spite of occasional central bank intervention in forex trading.
The Manila market has been trading at a price/earnings multiple of around 15
in recent weeks, which local brokers still view as a competitive level in
the Asian context.
While economic growth for 1993 is now conceded to be slower than earlier
targets, an improvement in the power situation is expected to provide a
boost next year. Daily power outages have been shortened to about four hours
(from six-to-eight hours three months ago), thanks to the commissioning of
some of the so-called 'fast-track' power plants built over the past 12
months.
A central bank survey early this year showed that optimism over prospects
for the second half of this year ran high among industries based in metro
Manila. Many of these industries, according to the survey, were also making
expansion plans.
The stock market is also expected to gain from the projected link-up in the
computerised trading operations of the two local exchanges. The
interconnection will result in a 'one-price market' for equities, as against
different prices quoted at the two exchanges.
Market capitalisation is also expected to gain further towards the year-end
with the expected new listing of at least five companies, along with an
additional offering of 2.5bn pesos by Meralco, whose initial listing early
last year was among the most successful locally.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Figures fail to hold D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS called a halt to Monday's profit-taking against the D-Mark
yesterday, pushing the German currency back up against the dollar and most
European currencies, writes James Blitz.
Few had interpreted Monday's sharp fall in the value of the D-Mark as
anything more than position squaring after a sustained rise. Yesterday, the
German currency's power was reasserted. It gained  1/2 pfennig against the
dollar to close at DM1.6065. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6097.
The D-Mark's rise came in spite of US data which might have suggested that
the Federal Reserve was leaning towards a tightening of policy.
In particular, US consumer price inflation rose 0.3 per cent in August,
against expectations of a 0.1 per cent increase.
The story of D-Mark strength dominated an otherwise untidy European session.
The German currency was stronger against the French franc, ending at
FFr3.487 from a previous FFr3.482. This was in spite of reduced optimism in
French money markets about lower rates.
Sterling closed unchanged at DM2.4850. Money market dealers increasingly
assume that there will be no cut in sterling base rates before the end of
this year. But the pound may have been hindered yesterday by slightly
disappointing manufacturing output figures.
The yen was higher at the start of trading amid signs that Japanese life
insurance companies were selling huge quantities of Australian dollars for
Japan's currency.
The selling pushed the Australian currency down to a new all-time low
against its trade weighted index. But the yen's strength did not last long.
The currency slipped back against the dollar in Europe as dealers braced
themselves for tomorrow's announcement of a fiscal stimulus package by the
Japanese authorities.
The US dollar closed at Y105.80 from a previous Y106.25. It finished New
York trading at Y105.85.
Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said
currency dealers would be looking for a number of key pointers in the
Japanese package. The first was the size of the stimulus. In his view, the
market is anticipating a fiscal boost of some 5 trillion yen, with plenty of
scope for tax cuts.
An announcement of a cut of  1/2 percentage point in the official discount
rate is also anticipated, although Mr Hannah thinks this might not take
immediate effect. A third key issue will be whether the Japanese authorities
set a concrete target for the reduction in the trade surplus. Japanese
officials have contradicted each other when asked if this is being
considered.
Tomorrow's announcements will be a milestone in the medium term outlook for
the yen. The recent sharp downturn in the yen has been predicated on the
belief that Japan will offer something concrete to President Clinton in
Washington next week.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Gloom in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in sterling interest rate markets suddenly became a good deal more
gloomy about the prospect of another cut in UK base rates this year, in
spite of economic data which might have suggested otherwise, writes James
Blitz.
Yesterday's UK data gave a mixed view of the economic recovery.
Manufacturing output rose 0.7 per cent in July for a year-on-year increase
of 1.7 per cent. But the figure was not much higher than economists had
expected and was still 0.3 per cent below its average in the second quarter
of this year.
Some dealers were led to think that this would help to bring about another
cut in UK base rates, which have been unchanged since January.
But, instead, sterling interest rate dealers appeared to be more influenced
by the slide in the gilts market yesterday, which was itself triggered by a
fall in US bonds. The December sterling contract dropped 7 basis points to
close at 94.29 and the March contract was down 13 basis points at 94.44. In
the cash market, three-month money was about 1/32 higher at 5 31/32 per
cent.
Some dealers felt that the futures contracts were extremely cheap at
yesterday's closing levels. As one dealer put it: 'There are three months of
time value in the December contract, and in that period you have got a
budget and a host of economic indicators. Anything can happen over that
time.' Others felt that the chances of a base rate cut were diminishing all
the time.
The cash market was again subject to the uncertainties over the removal of
the daily shortage. A Pounds 1.3bn deficit was forecast at the start of the
day, but an offer of assistance in the early round was not taken up at all,
pushing overnight lending to a high of 7 per cent. Most of the shortage was
suddenly removed later in the morning.
In Europe, the focus was on a sharp fall in the December French franc
contract, which ended 14 basis points down at 93.75. Some dealers continued
to be affected by the failure to lower the intervention rate on Monday,
suggesting that Ger-man rates were set to remain on hold for some time to
come.
In the German cash market, call money remained very high at around 7.25 per
cent, although there are expect-ations of a large liquidity addition in
today's operations. The Bundesbank will deal a fixed rate repo for 16 days
at 6.70 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper prices slide further as
supply squeeze eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON METAL Exchange copper prices yesterday extended the decline that has
continued uninterrupted since the exchange management acted a week ago
against the squeeze on supplies that had been propping up nearby delivery
positions.
The three months position, which stood at Dollars 1,947.50 a tonne before
the LME announced that the cash/one day premium would be limited to Dollars
5 a tonne, fell by Dollars 30 yesterday to Dollars 1,858.50 a tonne. The
cash position has fallen even more sharply since the announcement, by
Dollars 112 to Dollars 1,899.50 a tonne.
Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank
group, said that yesterday's sell-off followed the breach of the support
level at Dollars 1,880 a tonne that had been under pressure since the end of
last week. The resulting fall was exacerbated by the triggering of stop-loss
selling orders, he added.
Even before the LME move the holders of short positions who were caught in
the squeeze had been heartened by the uneventful passing on the first of
this month of a critical options date. It had been feared that this could
have been the occasion for the administration of the coup de grace as the
influential holders of call (buying) options declared them and forced
granters to scramble for cash supplies at ever widening premiums. In the
event, however, most of the options holders simply rolled them forward into
October and December.
That was why, explained Mr Bielski, the backwardation (cash premium) against
forward positions remained substantial while the cash/one day premium had
been eliminated altogether. The one-month premium yesterday was about
Dollars 27 a tonne while the three-months was Dollars 41, having narrowed
from Dollars 70 a week earlier.
If the 'shorts', further encouraged by the one-day backwardation limit, were
feeling more comfortable now, the longs were 'not too worried', Mr Bielski
suggested. He thought much of the long options position represented actual
physical demand.
There were reasons, moreover, for believing that the perceived fundamental
situation could have changed substantially by the time those options fell
due again. 'We are on the fringes of the seasonal pick-up in demand,' Mr
Bielski said. 'Elections are coming in Chile (an important supplier of
copper) and there are still a number of production disruptions around the
world.'
Although LME warehouse stocks of copper stood at a 15-year high, Mr Bielski
argued that the overall stock level, at between seven and eight week's of
world supply, was 'a low level for coming out of a recession' and could
quickly be brought down to size by an upturn in demand.
Demand was holding up quite well in developed countries and was strong in
developing economies, he said. And there was not enough new smelting
capacity in the pipeline to cover probable demand growth over the next few
years.
In the past few years oversupply had been aggravated by shipments form the
former Soviet Union, the analyst noted. But most of that metal had been
'toll' smelted using European concentrates (an intermediate material) that
were excess to requirements. Europe's surplus concentrates had now been used
up, he said, and there was not enough to keep its own smelters fed. So there
was bound to be a sharp reduction in shipments from the Commonwealth of
Independent States.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton export quota
falls short of expectations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government yesterday announced a cotton export quota of 500,000
bales (170kg each) for the year beginning September l.
The quota falls well short of trade expectations that at least l3m bales
would be allocated to exports, the quantity that was sold abroad last year.
The trade has projected a crop of at least 13.5m bales this year, and with
the carryover stock of 3.65m bales the total availability is expected to be
17.2m bales, up by 300,000 bales over last year.
The export quota is comprised of 100,000 bales of short staple cotton,
called Bengal Deshi, and 400,000 bales of staple cotton.
Mr MB Lal, chairman of Cotton Corporation of India, said the administration
wanted to keep a close watch on the crop because of the vagaries of nature.
It feared an announcement of a large export quota might fuel a spurt in
prices affecting exports of yarn and garments.

THE FORECAST for Australia's wheat crop in 1993-94 has been reduced. The
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said yesterday it
now expected only 15.3m tonnes to be produced, compared with its previous
estimate of 15.7m tonnes.
'Planted areas in South Australia, Queensland and western New South Wales
have been revised downward,' it commented. 'Drought in central Queensland
severly reduced wheat plantings.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad and Tobago tries to
gear up for oil and gas recovery - Canute James on moves to expand output,
despite sagging prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE face of a soft international market, Trinidad and Tobago's small
hydrocarbons industry is moving to expand production of oil and natural gas,
with government officials claiming that the Caribbean producer should be
ready to take early advantage of any bounce in the market.
The country's economy is heavily dependent on the petroleum sector, and has
suffered in recent years from a decline in production because of maturation
of the major fields. Crude production last year averaged 135,800 barrels a
day, compared with an average of 155,000 b/d five years earlier. Production
fell further to 126,000 b/d in the first quarter of this year.
In an effort to rationalise the industry, the government has changed its tax
legislation for oil producers, repealing an oil recovery impost that was
introduced in 1987 but increasing the level of its existing petroleum
profits tax from 45 per cent to 50 per cent.
Government officials estimated that the new tax legislation would cost the
treasury about TTDollars 150m (USDollars 26m) in the first year, but that
the changes were expected to encourage more investments in the oil industry.
They said the government was hoping that new investors in the oil sector
would increase national production as demand for oil was not buoyant because
of a sluggish world economy. The government is particularly keen to attract
companies that would drill to 20,000 feet if necessary - a depth that would
incur costs of USDollars 20m per well, the officials said.
There is no lack of foreign investor interest in Trinidad and Tobago's
petroleum sector. The industry is to benefit from a USDollars 411m
investment for an off-shore and on-shore secondary oil recovery programme,
and to expand refining throughput. It is being financed by the
Inter-American Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank and the country's state-owned oil company.
Government officials say the oil recovery programme will start on-shore and
is expected to yield 13m barrels of heavy crude. The off-shore recovery
programme is expected to yield 17m barrels of lighter crude. The refinery
throughput expansion will lift the processing of domestic crude from the
current level of about 100,000 to 160,000 b/d.
The government has projected that the oil recovery and refinery throughput
expansion will earn the country about USDollars 1.3bn over the next 15
years. The industry is benefitting from two agreements with Maraven of
Venezuela for processing crude. One is for 40,000 b/d day of lago treco
crude and the other for processing 30,000 b/d of lago cinco.
The rationalisation of the industry has seen the creation of a new company,
the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago (Petrotrin), which will take
over and merge the operations of two existing state-owned companies.
Petrotrin's formation followed the government's conclusion that neither of
the existing companies 'has the financial ability at this stage to embark on
the widespread activity that is required to develop the assets they have in
their possession,' say industry observers.
The creation of Petrotrin is a condition for the loan for upgrading the
refineries and secondary the recovery of heavy oil. 'The first project of
Petrotrin will be implementation and management of this project,' one
official said. 'This will coincide with Petrotrin's divestment of the
government's two-thirds shareholding in the Trinidad and Tobago Marine
Company, which produces from offshore wells. The money from the divestment
will go towards Petrotrin's contribution to refinery improvement and heavy
crude recovery project.'
Among the new foreign companies that are moving into the industry is the
Unocal Corporation of California, which has signed an agreement with the
government to explore for oil in a block 45 miles off the east coast of
Trinidad. The company will spend USDollars 22m to explore the block over
three years. It is drilling three wells and acquiring seismic data,.
There is also foreign interest in the country's natural gas industry. Enron
Oil and Gas of Houston, Texas is investing Dollars 250m over five years to
develop gas fields and produce natural gas off Trinidad's south-east coast.
The project aims to develop three off-shore gas fields, with the first
scheduled to start production before the end of this year at a rate of 50m
cubic feet a day. The venture's production rate will reach 150m cu ft a day
when all three wells are brought on stream by 1997.
British Gas and Texaco Incorporated are investing USDollars 350m in a
project off Trinidad's east coast to produce 275m cu ft a day. Mr Arthur
Beall, president of British Gas, said Trinidad and Tobago could become one
of the leading gas producers in the hemisphere.
Trinidad and Tobago has 9.5 trillion (million million) cu ft of proven
reserves and 17.5 trillion cu ft of probable reserves of natural gas. The
country's natural averages 730m cu ft a day.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banker says aluminium prices
are too low to finance smelter borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS WOULD want to see the aluminium price at between USDollars 1,600 and
Dollars 1,700 - nearly 50 per cent above the present depressed levels -
before offering loans for new aluminium smelters, said Mr Louis
Vincinguerra, former finance director of Pechiney and now a general partner
at Banque Rothschild in France.
Only at that price level would new smelters cover their full costs.
Prices would return to that level if the industry shut down 1.5m tonnes of
annual capacity, he suggested. That was far higher than recent estimates
made by other analysts, but Mr Vincinguerra was considering not just the
west in isolation but all the world, including eastern Europe.
Eastern European producers should contribute to these cuts, he suggested,
adding: 'They must learn that it is better to sell less aluminium at
significantly higher prices.'
Mr Vincinguerra said at Metal Bulletin magazine's annual aluminium
conference in Montreal that only 3 per cent of western smelter capacity was
profitable at today's prices. If annual aluminium demand grew at only 1 per
cent it would be virtually impossible to claw back to a price of Dollars
1,600 a tonne. However, if the previous 3 per cent growth rate was resumed
world stocks would start to go down from 1995 onwards, though it would take
several years for all the excess to be absorbed.
Nevertheless, there was no reason to be pessimistic about the future of the
industry, he said. All the main markets - transport, construction, packaging
and electric cable - were growing.
Some 300,000 tonnes of aluminium capacity in Brazil, about 25 per cent of
the total, was threatened with closure because of high power costs, Mr Ivo
Barone, president of the Brazilian Aluminium Association, told the
conference.
Inefficiency and poor management at the state-owned power companies had
boosted the cost of hydro-electric power to a level where it was absorbing
as much as 35 per cent of the revenues of some smelters and making energy
the single most significant cost.
Alcan Aluminium had already shut 36,000 tonnes of capacity because of
increased power costs and others in the industry would follow unless special
power rates could be negotiated.
Even the two new large export-oriented smelters in the north of Brazil -
Albras and Alumar - were threatened when their special power contracts ended
in 2005.
One solution would be for the industry, which exports about 75 per cent of
its production, to build its own power plants, but at present companies were
not generating enough cash to do this because of the low world prices for
the metal.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa futures climb to fresh
highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON cocoa market continued its recent upward trend yesterday as
bullish sentiment was fuelled by rumours of defaults on Indonesian
shipments.
For while it looked as though an assault would be mounted on the
psychological barrier at Pounds 900 a tonne for the December futures
position; but the rise faltered at Pounds 890 and by the close the December
contract had eased back to Pounds 880 a tonne, up Pounds 13 on the day and
the highest second position close for 38-months.
Dealers were undaunted, however, and most thought further gains were on the
way. 'We had been forecasting that the December price would reach 1,000 by
the end of the year,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI,
the London trade house. 'Now it looks as though it could make that by the
end of the month.'
To achieve that level, he noted, further technical hurdles would have to be
cleared at Pounds 958 a tonne, the life-of-contract high for the December
position, and at Pounds 967, the long-time high for the second position
(reached on May 24, 1990).
The main inspiration behind the latest upsurge, which lifted the December
quotation by Pounds 30 last week and has added another Pounds 24 so far this
week, has been the growing conviction that the level of world stocks is set
to fall heavily.
Mr Eagles explained that the settlement of disposal arrangements for the
230,000 tonnes in the International Cocoa Organisation buffer stock, under
which regular monthly releases will be made, meant that the buffer stock
effectively became a supplier and that its beans could be deleted from
overall stocks. Together with an expected world production shortfall of
between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes in the coming season, that meant that the
world cocoa stock, about 1.2m tonnes at present, would shrink by between
430,000 and 530,000 tonnes.
Further upward pressure has been provided of late, Mr Eagles said, by the
lifting of 'short hedges' (market insurances against price falls) as
operators became more confident about the outlook for prices.
In addition, he said, speculators who had gambled on a substantial
'correction' being made to the recent price rise were cutting their losses
and making covering purchases.

Base metals prices were mostly lower at the London Metal Exchange in line
with copper (see story above). The three months ALUMINIUM price slumped to a
4 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne and dealers said fresh production
cuts were sorely needed to turn sentiment around. Losses were pared in late
trading but the price still ended ended Dollars 6 down at Dollars 1,128 a
tonne. Three months TIN slipped to a fresh 20-year low of Dollars 4,510,
maintaining the current downtrend, and ended at Dollars 4,525, a Dollars 25
fall on the day. The NICKEL market was depressed by rising stocks and
lessening concern over supply disruptions at Inco's Thompson Manitoba
facilities, as a tentative pact was agreed. Some support appeared near
Dollars 4,500, however, and final business was at Dollars 4,530a tonne, down
Dollars 20. ZINC generally ignored the trend, with trade interest helping to
hold the market steady, and the three months price closed at Dollars 887.50
a tonne, a Dollars 1.50 gain. At the London bullion market the GOLD price
steadied after an early fall to finish just above the technically
significant Dollars 345-a-troy-ounce mark.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower as report prompts

US TREASURY bonds fell sharply yesterday as news of a greater-than-expected
rise in consumer prices, coupled with a modest increase in retail sales,
undermined the market's confidence.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 3/8 at 103 27/32 ,
yielding 5.970 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was  5/32 lower at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent.
The expectation of low inflation which has fuelled the bond market's recent
rally was rattled by both of the day's main economic reports.
The August consumer price index, which showed retail prices rising by 0.3
per cent last month, compared unfavourably with analysts' forecasts of a 0.1
per cent increase. The larger-than-expected figure was especially
disappointing after a 0.6 per cent decline in August producer prices.
Concern over inflation was reinforced by 0.2 per cent growth in August
retail sales, which suggested that economic conditions were more robust than
analysts had thought. Retail sales had been expected to show a slight
decline.
However, the figure's value as an indicator of economic growth - and
stronger inflationary pressure - was undercut by an upward revision of the
estimated increase in July retail sales, to 0.3 per cent.
Although this suggested that the pace of consumption was actually
moderating, it had little impact on the negative sentiment dominating the
market.
CANADIAN government bonds fell steeply on the back of the downturn for US
Treasuries, a weak Canadian dollar and political jitters ahead of the
October 25 federal elections. Prices were under further pressure as traders
prepared for today's auction of some CDollars 1.8bn of 7 1/2 per cent
10-year bonds.
GERMAN government bonds outperformed most of their European counterparts,
although they erased most of their early gains to end little changed. The
December bund futures contract ended at 98.41, up 0.02 point from Monday.
Bunds are expected to continue range-trading until the release of August M3
money supply numbers, expected early next week. Most analysts are calling
for an annualised M3 rate of around 8 per cent, up from 7.4 per cent in July
due to heavy currency intervention in August. However, a higher number is
widely discounted and unlikely to cause a strong market reaction, traders
say.
UK GILTS dropped in sympathy with US Treasuries, the five-year paper falling
about  1/2 point and long-dated bonds down nearly a point. But dealers
reported little cash market activity, with many investors sidelined before
today's inflation data.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, expects the
underlying inflation rate to have risen 0.2 per cent on the month and 2.9
per cent on the year. A number at or above 3 per cent could disappoint the
market, he said.
Also subduing sentiment is the Bank of England's imminent auction
announcement, expected Friday. Most traders expect the government to start
issuing bonds due 2004, which will become a 10-year benchmark next year.
FRENCH government bonds ended some  1/8 point lower. Many traders are
looking to Thursday's Bank of France repo allocation for a possible cut in
the 6.75 per cent repo rate. They are also waiting for Friday's
second-quarter gross domestic product data. Until then, prices are expected
to stay locked in a narrow trading range.
JAPANESE bonds eased in Tokyo but recouped some of their losses in London
trading, where the December JGB future rose 0.12 point to 111.12.
Fears that the long-awaited cut in the 2 1/2 per cent official discount rate
has been delayed caused short-term rates to rise. The three-month
certificate of deposit rate rose to 2.67 per cent from 2.60 per cent on
Monday.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy to tap into well of demand for
high-yield bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy is expected to give a greater weighting to the 30-year
than to the 10-year tranche of its Dollars 5bn global offering, which is due
to be launched today, in order to tap the well of demand for high-yielding
bonds.
Now that yields on US Treasuries have fallen to a 25-year low, investors
need to look much further along the yield curve in order to secure higher
returns. However, there has been a shortage of paper ever since the US
Treasury decided to auction fewer 30-year bonds.
Italy is expected to raise at least Dollars 3bn through the 30-year tranche
and the remainder through the 10-year tranche, which had been the borrower's
preferred maturity at the start of the roadshow.
Investors expect the 30-year bonds to carry a generous yield of between
80-85 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. This compares with a yield
spread of 60-65 basis points for the 10-year bonds.
Issuance in the international bond market remained slow yesterday ahead of
Italy's first global offering. In the D-Mark sector, Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), the German government agency for re-development, raised
DM1.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds.
Syndicate managers said the narrow yield spread of 14 basis points reflected
the borrower's triple-A rating. However, some said that the yield appeared
meagre to investors who have turned bearish following the Bundesbank's
easing last week, believing that there is little room for further interest
rate cuts in Germany
Meanwhile, the World Bank has awarded the mandate for its first D-Mark
global bond offering to Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers. The market
expects the offering to be launched early next month, with a maturity of
more than seven years and a size of at least DM5bn.
Syndicate managers also expect a handful of Eurobond offerings from Latin
American borrowers. Banobras, one of the Mexican government's primary
vehicles for financing economic development, is about to launch a Dollars
100m five-year offering via CSFB. Argentina and Venezuela are likely to tap
the D-Mark sector in the coming weeks.
Among other issues yesterday, Credit Foncier de France injected liquidity
into the long end of the French franc sector with its FFr3bn offering of
15-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which were priced to yield 20 basis points over the yield on the
French government's 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2008, offered a marginal pick-up
over the borrower's 14-year Eurobond issue, which was increased by FFr500m
to FFr3.5bn last week.
Credit Local de France was encouraged to tap the Ecu sector in the light of
the strong demand on Monday for the Council of Europe's eight-year Ecu150m
Eurobond issue.
The French bank raised Ecu175m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds which
were re-offered at 100 1/8 . Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds held
their re-offer price in spite of weakness in the underlying Ecu market.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Consob staggers under
criticism of political role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a suspicion that the knives may be out at Consob, Italy's stock
markets and companies watchdog. Its performance in regulating the troubled
Ferruzzi group has been widely criticised: and this week one of its five
commissioners announced his resignation.
The criticism has highlighted a number of broader questions about the future
role of a regulatory agency whose activities are still split between its big
Rome headquarters and an understaffed markets unit in Milan.
Observers are asking whether Consob's highly-politicised structure remains
appropriate. Links between politics and business have come under increased
scrutiny following Italy's 17-month old political corruption scandal, and
the government is poised to launch a big privatisation programme.
Last month, Consob's reputation took a severe blow when Milan magistrates
investigating political corruption arrested Mr Bruno Pazzi, a veteran Consob
chairman, now in retirement, over allegations that he was secretly on the
Ferruzzi payroll.
Moreover, small shareholders have bitterly attacked Consob over what they
claim was its failure to monitor the affairs of Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), Italy's second biggest private company, which has borrowings of
more than L28,000bn (Dollars 18.26bn).
Shares in Ferfin have seesawed wildly as investors were stunned by
allegations that its previous management paid substantial bribes to
politicians and covered up vast trading losses since 1989.
Although the attacks on Consob are seldom specific, many investors claim the
Ferruzzi affair has pinpointed gaping holes in Italy's company and bourse
supervision systems.
Matters reached a head this week, with the news that Mr Roberto Artoni, a
Consob commissioner associated with the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS),
was planning to resign. Although the move was officially described as a
personal decision to return to university teaching, Mr Vincenzo Visco, a PDS
senator and deputy chairman of the Senate finance committee, claimed in
yesterday's La Repubblica newspaper that it reflected much deeper
differences within Consob.
Mr Visco accused the agency of being too slack in its company supervision.
He cited its failure to replace until recently Mr Giuseppe Zadra, the
current director general of Italy's Bankers' Association, who was formerly
in charge of Consob's bourse division.
Some analysts echo accusations of dilatory behaviour or an excessively
bureaucratic approach.
Consob's current chairman, Mr Enzo Berlanda, is a respected former
politician, who played an important part as a Christian Democrat senator in
steering through much of the recent laws which have helped to bring Italy's
financial markets up to date with those in other big European countries.
However, some observers attack the agency for an excessively legalistic and
bureaucratic approach to its job. Even Consob's recent decision to ban Price
Waterhouse, Ferfin's accountants, from auditing the group's books because of
the accountants' failure to detect the alleged financial irregularities,
backfired after some critics accused Consob of trying to pass the buck.
The attacks are 'just political machinations', said a Consob official.
Mr Zadra's job was left open deliberately, pending a reorganisation which
includes reinforcing the Milan office, while the latest criticisms have been
motivated by interested parties who want Consob to suspend Ferruzzi group
shares, he said.
'We have to apply the law. If people don't like what we do, they should
change the laws so we can apply them differently.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Soft shoe start at Lithuanian
stock exchange - A footwear group making the running on day one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLINKING champagne glasses, paeans to capitalism and a row of women in folk
costume were the main feature at yesterday's ribbon cutting ceremony at the
Lithuanian Stock Exchange in Vilnius. Trading volume came a poor second.
Modelled on the French system, the first national stock exchange in the
former Soviet Union began with 29 registered brokers and 19 listed
securities, including three offering preferred and ordinary shares.
The opening day was, by any standard, quiet with five securities traded for
a total turnover of just 1,630 Litas (Dollars 408). Silva, a footwear and
haberdashery concern, was the hot stock with 285 shares traded at Lts1.05
each.
The Paris bourse, which helped set up the exchange under a FFr5m (Dollars
870,000) grant from the French government, has taken a cautious tack.
Securities can rise or fall by no more than 10 per cent between the weekly
Tuesday sessions. All transactions will be done by cash trade only on a
book-entry basis, with a clearing settlement delay of four days.
The Lithuanian exchange, like the one in the Czech Republic, grew directly
out of the mass privatisation programme which has sold 1,586 state-owned
enterprises since 1991. Only 16 companies were registered in time for the
start of trading, but all companies privatised by public offer eventually
will be listed.
Trading volume, in the meantime, is going to stay tiny. Mr Stephane Remus,
project manager from the Paris bourse, said the market was intentionally
simplified to attract small investors. 'If someone expects a million dollar
turnover the first year,' he said, 'they're foolish.'
Instead, a weak banking system, shortage of capital and insider trading are
possible problem areas. Crime has been a prominent feature of capitalism in
the former Soviet Union.
But Mr Remus views bankruptcy, not yet seen in Lithuanian despite the
existence of a year-old bankruptcy law, as the biggest threat to engendering
public trust in the exchange.
Vilnius hopes to emulate the growth at other east European exchanges. In
Warsaw, turnover is now running at Dollars 250m per week. Budapest and
Prague manage weekly volumes of Dollars 5m and Dollars 3m respectively.
Next in line is the Kiev exchange, due to open around the New Year.
The Ukrainian government has set up a central depository but has not yet
formalised the legal framework needed for trading securities, according to
Mr Paul-Francois Dubroeucq, director for international affairs and
development at the Paris bourse.
Lithuania has been an 'exceptional success', Mr Dubroeucq said, because
legal and economic reform has been synchronised.
At the freshly renovated exchange headquarters, only six of the 29
registered brokers have offices above the main floor.
A lucky one, Mr Vaidas Savukynas, a 24-year-old who seven months ago founded
his one-man brokerage, reported a good first day: four deals, worth Lts528
(Dollars 132). 'Just the beginning,' he said.

NATIONAL Commercial Bank, the Saudi bank, is to raise paid-up capital to

The capital increase plan was completed last year but will be announced when
privately-owned NCB's results are published 'in the next few weeks,'
according to Saudi press reports.
NCB, which has not reported audited results since 1989 and which ran into
trouble over the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
has vigorously denied foreign media reports that its business is threatened.
The press reports did not indicate how the additional capital would be
raised. But the bankers said NCB did not plan to go public to raise the
capital in Saudi Arabia's stock market. At the end of 1989, NCB had assets
of put at the end of 1989 at SR86.6bn.
Sheikh Mohammad, chief executive officer, said last month the bank would
soon issue audited 1992 financial results which 'will demonstrate the solid
foundation and high standing enjoyed by the National Commercial Bank'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Politics of money dominates
Kuala Lumpur - Kieran Cooke on accusations that business deals are used to
further Malay interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year, the Kuala Lumpur stock market was set ablaze by a sudden
surge in the shares of Union Paper Holdings, a small Malaysian company
producing toilet paper and joss sticks.
This stratospheric rise to MDollars 23 from MDollars 1.73 was triggered by
rumours that Union was about to be taken over by a co-operative linked to
the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the political party which
has dominated Malaysia's government since independence in 1957.
But the takeover soon proved to be an illusion, and Union's shares dropped
to earth. They were subsequently suspended, and many shareholders lost
heavily. The Union fiasco highlights the influence of politics - and in
particular of UMNO - on Malaysia's corporate community.
'Union Paper is only one example of the way many investors here make
decisions solely on political grounds,' said one Kuala Lumpur broker.
'Company fundamentals are often ignored. The trouble is that the local
speculators are often proved right: political connections, mainly to leading
figures in UMNO, are a vital element in a large number of business deals.'
At around USDollars 105bn, the capitalisation of the Malaysian stock market
is bigger than Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. Analysts point out that
funds from abroad, encouraged by Malaysia's economic growth, have been
flooding into Malaysian stocks recently. Yet often outsiders are ignorant of
local political considerations.
UMNO's corporate power and influence grew in tandem with a government
programme called the New Economic Policy (NEP), which was inaugurated in the
early 1970s.
At that time the Chinese, who make up about 35 per cent of the population,
controlled most economic activities in the country.
The NEP was designed to give 'bumiputras', or indigenous Malays, who account
for about 50 per cent of the population, a greater share in the country's
wealth.
They were favoured in government jobs, in education and in business.
UMNO, the party of the Malays which has traditionally controlled all senior
government posts, used its political clout to further Malay business
interests. In the process, UMNO itself became directly involved in the
corporate sector.
By the mid-1980s, UMNO controlled a complex web of businesses which
stretched into most areas of the economy. Through the Fleet Group, UMNO's
investment holding company, the party owned the New Straits Times Group, the
country's leading newspaper and publishing group.
In 1988, United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), another UMNO company, was awarded
what was then Malaysia's biggest infrastructure project - the MDollars 3.4bn
(Dollars 1.34bn) contract for the privatisation of a highway running the
length of peninsular Malaysia.
More recently, UEM won a multi-million dollar contract to build a new link
between Malaysia and Singapore.
Party assets were transferred to trustees following a split within UMNO in
1988. Since that time, the party's extensive business shareholdings have
been dispersed among various groups and business people, most of them seen
to be closely connected with the UMNO Baru party, or new Umno, led by Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister.
The Renong group, a listed holding company which now controls one of
Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, was the main vehicle for the transfer of
UMNO corporate assets.
Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and now UMNO treasurer, is
adamant that since 1988, UMNO has had no business interests. 'I
categorically state and place on record that UMNO is not involved in any
business,' said Mr Daim earlier this year. 'It does not own any company, nor
shares in any company.'
Mr Terence Gomez, a Malaysian academic who has made an extensive study of
UMNO's corporate investments, says that while it might be correct to say
that UMNO no longer has direct control of companies, the connections are
still there.
'Umno patronage has led to the formation of very powerful business
conglomerates,' says Mr Gomez.
'Now a stage has been reached when a business elite, made up of bumiputras
and their Chinese partners, and with close connections to leading
politicians, is able to dominate a large segment of corporate life. It can
also seriously influence stock market behaviour.'
The topic of 'money politics' has hit the headlines in Malaysia recently as
different factions within UMNO line up for battle.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the present finance minister, is challenging the position
of Mr Ghafar Babar, the UMNO number two, in party elections due in early
November.
Whoever wins the race is seen as the likely successor to Dr Mahathir as UMNO
president, and next in line to be prime minister.
Opponents accuse Mr Ghafar of plundering state bodies for campaign funds,
while Mr Anwar is said to have raised a substantial election war chest from
the corporate sector.
Mr Anwar is generally believed to have assisted the recent rise to
prominence of Malaysian Resources Corp. MRCB, with little experience in the
power sector, has become the lead partner in a project to build, own and
operate a MDollars 3.5bn power plant.
The company also played a key role in a MDollars 800m management buyout of
the New Straits Times group and the country's only independent TV station
from Renong earlier this year. Mr Anwar denies he was suspicious of the
Renong management's political sympathies. But it is clear the media group,
under its new management, has swung solidly behind the finance minister.
Some analysts have become a little uneasy about developments. They say a
substantial amount of corporate engineering has been going on, with little
apparent benefit to minority shareholders.
Managers of large foreign funds have begun asking questions about their
investments in Malaysia's privatised entities, particularly Tenaga Nasional,
the electricity utility, and Telekom, the telecommunications service.
They say there is evidence of growing political interference in the
operations of these companies, which undermines the privatisation process
and could jeopardise long-term prospects.
'There are some noteworthy companies here who get on with business,' said
one Kuala Lumpur broker. 'But for others, political connections are
all-important. The system is so entrenched - it's part of the business
culture.'

SHARES in Viacom, the cable television operator which is seeking to buy
Paramount Communications, fell sharply yesterday as it emerged that chairman
Mr Sumner Redstone had been a big buyer of his company's shares in recent
months.
The slide pushed down the value of Viacom's bid, mainly for shares, to
Dollars 7.6bn from Dollars 8.2bn at the time the deal was announced at the
weekend, apparently increasing the chance that a rival bidder for Paramount
may step in.
Viacom said that Mr Redstone's purchases 'complied with all applicable laws
and regulations'. The purchases 'had been fully disclosed to Paramount' and
were 'never intended to affect the price of Viacom stock', it added.
In New York, Viacom's B shares closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 3/8
yesterday, while its A shares slid Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2.
Paramount shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 .

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: American Airlines to cut 5,000
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, underscored continuing
cost-cutting in the loss-making US airline industry yesterday when he
announced that the company planned to eliminate 5,000 jobs by the end of
1994.
The job losses, to come through attrition, early retirement and lay-offs,
include cuts of between 200 and 300 managers which the airline announced
recently. American currently employs 97,000.
Mr Crandall also told an analysts' conference in New York that the company
would be grounding 11 more DC-10 aircraft, in addition to 31 it recently
grounded. Four would be in 1994 and the remainder in 1995-96. However, it
did not expect this to involve any charges against earnings.
American's capacity, measured in available seat miles, would be down 4.5 per
cent in 1994, compared with this year.
Mr Crandall said American would welcome an employee stake in the company.
This would presumably be in return for concessions by labour, following the
lead set by troubled Northwest Airlines, where employees have agreed to make
some Dollars 886m in concessions in return for stock.
At United Airlines, labour leaders are considering a buy-out bid for the
company which would also involve large cost concessions.
Mr Crandall said it would be 'a good thing' if investors and employees in
AMR - the parent of American Airlines - were one and the same. However, he
added that the company had not been approached by any of its labour groups
for a stake in the business.
On Monday, the carrier's pilots told analysts that structural problems, not
labour costs, had caused the large losses suffered over the past two years.
They said the airline should consider modifying the so-called 'hub and
spoke' route system which most of the US airline industry uses.

TELEFONICA de Argentina, the Argentine telecoms group, expects capital

Mr Eduardo Arrotea Molina, director of investor relations and risk
management, also said the company expected capital expenditures of about
Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m in fiscal 1994.
Telefonica de Argentina, which provides telecommunications services to the
southern half of Argentina, also plans to expand its network by more than 70
per cent by 1997 to 20 lines per 100 inhabitants, compared with 13.4 lines
per 100 inhabitants as of June 1993.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Biotechnology back to rude
health - Survey paints rosy picture of the US industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biotechnology industry is 'surprisingly healthy' after a difficult year,
according to a comprehensive survey of almost 1,300 US biotech companies.
The annual survey by Ernst &amp; Young, the US consultancy, shows total revenues
up 20 per cent to Dollars 10bn for the year to June 30 1993, compared with
Dollars 8.3bn in the previous 12 months. Product sales amounted to Dollars
7bn (up from Dollars 6bn), and the remaining Dollars 3bn came from licensing
and research fees.
The total market value of the biotech industry fluctuated wildly during the
period. It declined by 30 per cent and then rallied to end at Dollars 45bn,
just 6 cent down on the previous year's Dollars 48bn.
But Wall Street treated the biotech sector rather better than the mainstream
pharmaceutical industry, and its total capitalisation overtook that of
Merck, the largest drug company, for the first time.
Seven new drugs produced by genetic engineering received approval from the
Food and Drug Administration during the year, including Factor VIII for
haemophilia and Betaseron for multiple sclerosis.
Twenty genetically engineered drugs are already on the US market. The two
best-sellers both come from Amgen, the most successful biotech company so
far: Neupogen and Epogen had sales of Dollars 544m (up 134 per cent) and
Dollars 506m (up 24 per cent) respectively.
Behind them, Ernst &amp; Young estimates that the industry has 270 drugs in
clinical trials and 2,000 at earlier stages of development. 'One hundred
represent truly novel substances with no precedent in medical therapy,' the
report says.
Ernst &amp; Young concedes that there may be as much biotechnology R&amp;D going on
within traditional pharmaceutical companies as in the specialist biotech
industry (up to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5bn). 'Even so, biotech companies
produce drugs far more efficiently. According to our survey, biotech
companies' average development cost (for a new drug) is Dollars 125m versus
Dollars 230m for the pharmaceutical industry. Biotech companies are leaner,
more flexible, and attract talents that would not flourish as well in more
traditional corporate structures.'
Yet investors' faith in the industry has been damaged by setbacks to
well-publicised biotech drugs in the final stages of development, such as
two treatments for septic shock (Centocor's Centoxin and Synergen's Antril).
The view of Ernst &amp; Young is that investors operate a double standard: 'For
big pharmaceutical companies, clinical trial tribulations are business as
normal. Yet the financial markets expect biotech's clinical trials to be
linear and predictable.'
Fears that the Clinton administration's healthcare reforms will do
disproportionate damage to biotech have also damaged market sentiment.
As a result, the industry managed to raise only Dollars 5.2bn in new funds,
compared with Dollars 6.5bn in the previous year. The sharp fall in new
equity offerings on the stock market was partly balanced by a revival in
private and venture capital funding.
Although the overall tone of the Ernst &amp; Young report is upbeat, the authors
do express concern about the 'feverish' rate at which many biotech companies
are burning cash. 'The number of public companies with less than two years
cash is alarming, while capital sourcing is less predictable than ever,'
they say. 'More than ever, biotech CEOs are compelled to engineer creative
financing methods.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian court may hold key to
outcome of McCain brothers' feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE McCAIN frozen foods empire urgently needs a new chief executive if it is
not to lose the confidence of customers, suppliers and employees, says one
of the two feuding brothers who head the family-owned Canadian company.
In an affidavit filed in a New Brunswick court, Mr Harrison McCain outlines
an increasingly hostile relationship with his brother and co-chief executive
Wallace, which has reached the point where the two are unable to agree on
important business decisions.
The court is due to hear an application by Wallace next week seeking to
overturn a decision by other family members to oust him as joint chief
executive by September 30.
The 33 McCain family shareholders have resorted to litigation after failing
to resolve differences over top-management succession, and over various
offers and counter-offers for each other's shares in the CDollars 3bn-a-year
business.
Wallace's branch of the family owns about one-third of the shares of McCain
Foods. The remainder is split between Harrison's family and the children of
two dead brothers.
Harrison alleges in his affidavit that bad blood between himself and Wallace
dates back to Wallace's unilateral decision three years ago to appoint his
son Michael as head of McCain Foods' US subsidiary.
Wallace, aged 63, alleged in an earlier affidavit that Harrison, who is two
years older, has sought to speed up the search for a new chief executive
since suffering a heart attack early last year. Wallace favours maintaining
the present arrangement of joint chief executives until a group of outside
directors can identify a suitable successor.
Harrison responds that 'it seems absolutely incredible to me that Wallace
thinks that he and I could function at all as co-CEOs while we are fighting
each other in the courtroom'.
Harrison also dismisses a proposal by Wallace to split McCain Foods into two
roughly equal parts, with one covering the Americas and the Pacific Rim, the
other the UK and European businesses. 'To divide the operating company in
any way would put both parts at risk in every market,' he says.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Citibank sees revival in
consumer banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER banking profits at Citibank, the US banking group, will be
'substantially higher' this year than last, due mainly to falling levels of
bad debts in the US and cost-cutting, Mr Pei-Yuan Chia, head of consumer
banking, said yesterday.
He added, though, that recession in Europe and the slow economic recovery in
the US was holding back income growth.
'Revenue growth is still not very robust. It is anaemic. But the bottom line
will be very good.'
Citibank's consumer business generated record net income of Dollars 941m
last year after bad debts had dragged it down to Dollars 530m in 1991.
The biggest improvement has come in the US market, largely as a result of
declining credit losses on credit cards and other products, Mr Chia said.
Although he declined to disclose figures, Mr Chia said that the bank's
write-off ratio was back to the 'reasonable' level it had been at before
1991.
Increasing competition in the US credit card business is likely to reduce
revenues in that sector by between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m, as the
bank spends more on marketing and reduces its fees in order to keep
customers.
'We have lost market share. Our aim is now to defend our share. If that
means lower margins, so be it,' Mr Chia said.
Mr Chia's up-beat assess-ment came as Citibank announced plans to complete
the remodelling of all 1,400 of its branches around the world over the next
two years.
The aim of the programme is to increase the revenues earned by the branches
 -which currently generate 40 per cent of the consumer bank's revenues -
rather than to reduce costs or improve productivity, said Mr Chia.
Most of the bank's branches in Asia and many in Europe have already been
revamped, and the remodelling programme is now being accelerated in the US.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase in foreign
investment by US funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US FUND managers indulged in a 'a minor tidal wave' of international
investment in the first half of this year, compounding the process by which
national barriers are breaking down in the world's financial markets,
according to a leading analyst of institutional investment.
A report issued by InterSec Research Corporation*, a US-based consultancy
which specialises in monitoring asset allocation by fund managers, claims
that there has been a surge in the purchase of overseas bonds and equities
by institutions such as pension funds.
InterSec reports that the total value of US tax-exempt assets with
international and global mandates rose by nearly Dollars 50bn in the first
half of 1993, from Dollars 154bn to almost Dollars 200bn.
This investment is a sharp increase on US fund managers' investments
overseas in 1992, which saw an increase over the whole year of only Dollars
30bn.
The report suggests that some of the increase may have been due to the
strength of overseas equity and bond markets. But although this may have
been responsible for a significant proportion of the investment, InterSec
says that net cash flows (new money less withdrawals) still amounted to
Dollars 18bn in the first half.
'This is an unprecedented mid-year number,' the report says. '1992's net
flows for the entire year were an all-time high of Dollars 22bn.'
US fund managers have traditionally been more conservative than their
European and Japanese counterparts when considering whether to make
investments overseas.
About 8 per cent of Japanese pension fund assets are invested outside Japan,
while 26 per cent of UK assets are invested in non-UK markets.
However, analysts anticipate that interest in non-domestic investments will
grow faster in the US than in other countries.
The report claims that there were signs in the first six months of this year
of a larger proportion of US fund managers' money being invested in equities
than had been the case in 1992.
Of the net new money allocated to active international and global mandates
in the first six months of this year, only 18 per cent went into
fixed-income mandates. At the end of 1992, the market share of fixed-income
investments was 23 per cent, while equities absorbed the remaining 77 per
cent.
The general increase in international asset allocation has strong
implications for currency market dealing. Banks dealing in foreign exchange
find they are making increasingly large returns by managing the exposure of
internationally-held assets to exchange rate movements.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW agrees rescue package for
Seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEAT, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, warned yesterday that
it expected to suffer a loss of around Pta100bn (Dollars 784m) this year.
The announcement followed a crisis meeting of the Seat board, which agreed a
Pta120bn (Dollars 941m) financial rescue package.
The meeting was called to discuss the company's deteriorating financial
position, which is likely to be a significant factor in ensuring that the
Volkswagen group will report a loss for the full year.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the embattled chairman of the VW management board, had
insisted earlier this year that the group would succeed in breaking even for
the full year, despite suffering a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months.
The VW supervisory board was forced to admit earlier this month, however,
that the group's financial performance was being burdened by worsening
problems at Seat as well as in North America and in the Asia-Pacific region.
It forecast a profit for the full year only for the VW parent company.
Volkswagen agreed a financial rescue package for Seat yesterday centred on
its takeover of some of the main assets of the Spanish subsidiary.
In deals worth around Pta120bn (Dollars 941m), Volkswagen is taking over
directly Seat's plant at Pamplona in northern Spain, which manufactures the
VW Polo small car range, as well as Seat's Spanish finance company, Fiseat.
At the same time Seat management has been ordered to draw up an emergency
plan for returning the company to profit 'by all necessary measures,
including cuts in the workforce'.
Seat said its financial performance had been hit by a series of factors,
including the sharp devaluation of the peseta, a heavy debt burden and a
steep decline in new car sales.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: San Paolo stock falls sharply

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking
group in asset terms, fell sharply yesterday as investors digested details
of the merger with two quoted subsidiary banks announced on Monday night.
Stock in San Paolo, which was floated in January, dropped by almost 5 per
cent to L10,272. By contrast, shares in Banco Lariano climbed by 4.4 per
cent to L4,750 while Banca Provinciale Lombarda rose by just over 3 per cent
to L4,010.
The merger will confirm San Paolo's position as Italy's dominant banking
group, with total assets of about L200,000bn (Dollars 130bn) and almost
1,000 branches. However, the bank is expected to maintain the separate
trading identities of its three operations to retain customer loyalties.
Both Como-based Banco Lariano and Bergamo-based BPL are situated in the
wealthiest parts of Lombardy, Italy's richest province.
Shareholders in BPL will be offered 10 San Paolo shares for every 24 shares
held. The swap ratio for Banco Lariano shares involves 10 San Paolo units
for every 21 shares currently held.
The share price movements caused little surprise among analysts, who said
the terms had been devised to encourage shareholders in the subsidiaries to
take up the offer. If all shareholders agree, the proportion of San Paolo's
capital which is floating will rise to about 26 per cent from about 22 per
cent at present.
The amalgamation is predominantly tax-driven, with San Paolo taking
advantage of a special Italian law to encourage bank mergers by granting
substantial tax breaks for a number of years. The San Paolo group is
expected to save about L70bn a year between 1993 and 1995 once the deal is
completed.
Separately, the three banks have also reported first-half earnings. San
Paolo said net earnings amounted to L213bn, while Banco Lariano reported net
profits of L70bn and BPL net profits of L67bn. None of the banks provided
comparable figures.
San Paolo is likely to need all its tax savings to offset a severe rise in
bad-debt provisions this year owing to the recession. The bank is believed
to be very heavily exposed to the troubled Ferruzzi group, and is also among
the principal lenders to a number of other big companies which are now
negotiating debt rescheduling pacts with their creditors.

THE Spanish government is preparing to create one of the largest natural gas
companies in Europe. Gas Natural, the national domestic gas distributor 45
per cent owned by Repsol, the state controlled energy group, is to buy
Enegas, Spain's monopoly industrial gas supplier, which is fully owned by
the state.
The deal, it is understood, could raise between Pta80bn and Pta120bn
(Dollars 939m) for the government and help control its billowing public
deficit.
The move will transfer control of all of Spain's gas purchasing and
distribution to the private sector, reconfiguring the power currently
invested in Mr Oscar Fanjul, the president of Repsol.
The purchase, which Gas Natural will probably finance through a capital
increase, could be finalised by the end of the year.
Mr Fanjul, who has led a series of partial privatisations at Repsol to the
point where the state's stake has dropped well below half, is also chairman
of the Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, which controls Enegas.
He has been a firm supporter of faster privatisations than the country's
nominally socialist government has been prepared so far to undertake.
Government officials believe that by merging Enegas and Gas Natural, Spain
will be able to create a gas company capable of competing at an
international level with larger rivals such as Gaz de France and British
Gas.
Similar reasoning lay behind Madrid's support in the late 1980s for mergers
among the country's banks.
Gas Natural was created in 1991 through a merger of Catalana de Gas in
Barcelona and Gas Madrid. The group, controlled by Repsol and La Caixa, the
big Catalan savings bank, has since been absorbing domestic gas distributers
throughout Spain.
It now accounts for about 40 per cent of the gas sold in Spain and has begun
to compete, with other state-backed Spanish corporations, to buy privatised
assets in Latin America. Last year, it took control of the natural gas
distributor to northern Buenos Aires.
The group made net profits last year of Pta12.3bn and analysts are
forecasting profits of nearly twice that in 1995 as gas consumption grows in
Spain.
According to the state's national energy plan for 1991 to 2000, non-electric
gas consumption will grow by 7 per cent a year for the next seven years,
doubling its contribution to national energy consumption from 6 per cent to
12 per cent.
Enegas, Spain's only importer of natural gas, is also the only supplier to
the urban distributors, now dominated by Gas Natural.
It also supplies gas directly to large industrial users outside the Basque
Country and Catalonia. It is building a pipeline to carry gas into Spain
from North Africa and account for half the gas sold in the country.
But its commercial fortunes are sometimes hampered by the Gas Protocal of
1985, through which it is required to supply gas to Spanish distributors at
a fixed price, whatever it is able to buy at on international markets. In
1991 Enegas reported losses of Pta3.6bn.
This formula is due to be revised in 1995 and it is possible that instead of
throwing itself into an exhausting round of regulatory and pricing
negotiations with distributors, the government has thought it easier and
more profitable to slide Enegas across the table to Mr Fanjul and La Caixa
and let them control both supplier and distributor.
In a further move designed to shore up the government's shaky finances,
Argentaria, the pool of state-controlled banks which privatised a part of
its stock earlier this year, said yesterday it was in touch with more than
40 national and international institutions in an effort to gauge enthusiasm
for a further flotation soon. Argentaria was given cabinet permission
earlier this month to float more of its shares.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Lafarge to make FFr2.5bn
international share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is one of the world's largest
building materials groups, is seeking to capitalise on the strength of
international stock markets through a FFr2.5bn (Dollars 446m) share issue.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, said that the proceeds of the issue, which
was announced yesterday, will be used to contain the level of the group's
debt while expanding in rapidly growing markets. He said the issue would not
dilute earnings per share, even in the short term, because of the reduction
in financial charges and the earnings potential of the funds to be raised.
The announcement of the share issue coincided with the release of the
group's results for the first half of the year. Net profits were stable
compared with the first six months of 1992, slipping by 0.3 per cent to
FFr693m. Sales of FFr14.3bn were 5 per cent down on the same period in 1992.
Shares in the the company rose sharply, by FFr8.3 to FFr422.3. Market
analysts in Paris said this was because the profits were stronger than
expected while the share issue was smaller than anticipated.
The new shares will represent about 10 per cent of the group's capital. The
shares will each have a warrant attached, with two warrants giving holders
the right to a further share. A bonus share, for every 10 shares held, will
also be issued by the end of the year.
Mr Collomb said that the company had decided against a rights issue to
attract foreign investors and to enable the shares to be offered
simultaneously on international markets. The shares will be issued on the
Paris, London, Frankfurt, Madrid and Barcelona stock markets.
The terms and pricing of the issue will be set next Monday, subject to
market conditions. The company said it wanted to move quickly to take
advantage of the rally in French and international stock markets and to
pre-empt the French government's privatisation programme. The programme will
be launched with the sale of the state's 73 per cent stake in Banque
Nationale de Paris within the next few weeks.
Mr Collomb said that the company's performance in the first half of the year
showed resilience in the face of depressed European markets. He said he
expected the trends in the first half to be repeated in the second six
months of the year, prompting analysts to forecast stable full-year net
profits of about FFr1.25bn.
The company said the French market continued to be depressed, but the rate
of contraction had slowed and could stabilise next year. In the first half
of this year, the downturn in most of its European markets was offset by a
strong performance in eastern Germany and increased prices in the US.
According to Mr Collomb, the group would continue to expand through
acquisitions in fast growing markets in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean
region and east Asia, and through the introduction of higher value added
products.
Lafarge Coppee said that it would strike a balance between further
acquisitions and containing group debt, which stood at a net figure of
FFr10.2bn at the end of the first half. Analysts said that the proceeds of
the rights issue should allow gearing to be brought down from the current
level of 44 per cent to nearer 30 per cent by the end of the year.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Greek bank plans rights to fund
Balkan expansion
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Bank, Greece's second-largest banking group, is seeking to raise
Dr49.3bn (Dollars 210m) through a rights issue to help it expand into other
Balkan markets.
The bank, which has a market share in Greece of about 20 per cent, reported
pre-tax profits of Dr14bn for the first half of 1993, up from Dr11.8bn the
previous year.
Commercial Bank started restructuring two years ago, disposing of
non-banking assets and writing off some Dr14bn in debt owed by public sector
Greek companies.
The bank last year sold a loss-making shipyard to a London-based Greek
shipping company and a small banking subsidiary, Bank of Piraeus, to a group
of Athens businessmen.
It is considering a merger with Ionian Bank, another, profitable,
subsidiary, which has also undergone restructuring. The move would raise the
group's local market share to over 25 per cent and add another 100 branches
to its Greek network.
Another subsidiary, Investment Bank, is being liquidated. Most of its
assets, amounting to around Dr19bn, will be divided between Commercial Bank
and Ionian Bank, the two main shareholders.
Commercial Bank's two-for-five issue is being made at Dr8,500 per share,
close to book value. Once the issue is completed, later this month, one
bonus share will be offered for every 10 old shares held.
About Dr30bn of the funds raised will be used to set up branches in Romania
and Bulgaria by next year. The bank also plans to become the first Greek
commercial bank to operate in Turkey.

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Austrian construction group to
raise Sch850m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAU HOLDING, Austria's largest construction group, is raising around Sch850m
(Dollars 75m) in a one-for-six rights issue of ordinary voting shares to
ordinary and preferred shareholders.
The family controlled group, which has been expanding rapidly in eastern
European markets, plans acquisitions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to
consolidate its position there.
Bau is the second Austrian construction group to seek new equity in recent
months, arch-rival Maculan having raised Sch695m in late June, also to
finance eastern European expansion. Maculan has tended to concentrate its
expansion in eastern Germany while Bau has spread its interests more widely.
The Haselsteiner family and a few associates, who hold 73 per cent of the
unlisted 3.4m ordinary voting shares, are not taking up their rights, so
their position will drop to about 55 per cent following the issue. All other
ordinary shareholders, mainly an Austrian bank and a few Bau executives,
have also waived their rights.
Their shares will be placed by Bank Austria and S. G. Warburg in domestic
and international markets. It is agreed that about half of the total issue,
that is, 450,000 shares, will be placed internationally.
The 1.7m non-voting preferred shares are held widely following a flotation
in 1990. Bank Austria is also underwriting the 280,500 new ordinary shares
in the rights issue allocated to them.
The price of the rights shares is to be fixed on September 22, and is
expected to be close to the current Sch1,000 market price of the preferred
shares.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Quarto seeks Pounds 9.5m for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUARTO is calling on shareholders for Pounds 9.5m to treble its art print
business, as the publisher and publishing services company yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.63m for the six
months to June 30.
The company is to acquire Scafa, a publisher and distributor of art prints
in the US, for Dollars 4.4m (Pounds 2.9m) plus between Dollars 1.2m and
Dollars 6.5m on a profit formula basis payable by September 1998.
The deal pushes Quarto's art business up from 30 per cent to 37 per cent of
total turnover, of which art prints will be a third, compared with 10 per
cent now.
The rights issue is on a 3-for-11 basis at 225p, underwritten by Samuel
Montagu.
The company plans to allow Scafa Dollars 5m in 'acquisition finance' with
the balance going to reduce Quarto's net debt.
At the half-way stage Quarto had net debt of Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 6.4m) and
gearing of 96 per cent. Pro forma, this will fall to 25 per cent post
rights.
Net interest payments climbed to Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 177,000) because the
company moved Western Signcraft, a silk-screen printer, 20 miles from
Bristol to Corsham, costing Pounds 900,000.
Turnover rose to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 16.5m).
The sales increase was in volume rather than price. The new administration
in the US, where the company sells more than 40 per cent of turnover, had
been 'positive' for Quarto. Sales had also benefited from favourable
currency translation.
Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said that following a slightly flatter second
quarter trading in the seasonally more significant second half had 'picked
up'.
The interim dividend is 2p (1.6125p) payable from earnings per share of 6.4p
(3.9p).

FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Avonmore ahead 16% to IPounds
11.2m

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPANSION programme worth IPounds 71m (Pounds 66.5m) during 1992 by
Avonmore Foods, the Irish dairy and meat processor, was the main factor
behind a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.2m,
against IPounds 9.63m.
Turnover rose 54 per cent to IPounds 514.7m (IPounds 335m) for the six
months to July 3.
Ten acquisitions and two joint ventures were completed last year, largely in
the meat processing business where turnover advanced more than 2 1/2 times
to IPounds 214.7m (IPounds 80.6m) and now accounts for more than 40 per cent
of group sales.
However meat division operating profits grew by only 22 per cent to IPounds
3.9m (IPounds 3.2m), reflecting the present very tight margins in the
market.
The company said: 'The overall performance of the meat division was affected
by difficult trading conditions in the European market and the turnaround
nature of the 1992 acquisitions.'
Mr Brendan Graham, group secretary, said: 'Our meat business has grown very
rapidly and six months is a short time for companies which are being turned
around.
'But we believe we have put a good business together at a modest cost, and
the fundamentals are good. We are selling good products into 25 countries.
The focus for the division from now will be on integration and efficiency
measures.'
Further growth will come through in the second half from the IPounds 21.6m
acquisition of the Birmingham area operations of Dairy Crest last July. As a
result Avonmore is the UK's fifth largest liquid milk supplier with a 7 per
cent share of the market.
Interest charges increased 53 per cent to IPounds 6.71m (Pounds 4.37m), as a
result of the acquisition programme.
The composite tax rate increased from 10.2 per cent to 13.8 per cent,
reflecting the ending of tax exemptions for co-operatives in Ireland, and a
growing contribution from overseas subsidiaries which face higher rates. The
tax charge was IPounds 1.55m, compared with IPounds 985,000.
Earnings per share were 5.38p (4.74p). An interim dividend of 1.55p (1.45p)
has been declared.
Mr Liam Igoe of Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin forecast a year-end pre-tax
profit of IPounds 29.1m and for earnings of 13.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lopex, the advertising and marketing services company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 144,000 for the first half of 1993. The comparable figure
was a loss of Pounds 602,000, restated for FRS 3, and after losses on
disposals of Pounds 477,000.
The pre-tax figure also benefited from lower interest charges of Pounds
187,000 (Pounds 465,000). However an increased tax charge of Pounds 270,000
(Pounds 136,000) contributed to retained losses of Pounds 141,000 (Pounds
766,000).
The company said there had been a big improvement in the UK largely due to
the cost savings programme. Losses per share were 0.38p (3.24p).

<TEXT>
BRITANNIA GROUP is raising Pounds 3.75m net by way of a 1-for-1 rights issue
at 35p a share primarily to fund the acquisition of housebuilding land.
The group, which yesterday also announced its results for the half year to
June 30 showing pre-tax losses up from Pounds 155,000 to Pounds 868,000, has
continued to reduce its financial commitment to property development and the
policy of concentrating resources on construction had met with some success.
Britannia Homes, in its first full year of operation under the new
management, showed a profit after interest of Pounds 277,000 on a turnover
of Pounds 5.9m. Residential house sales were budgeted to rise substantially
in the current year with unit sales completed in the half year up from 38 to
69. In July and August it completed a further 41 sales.
Group turnover in the half year from continuing operations was Pounds 15.61m
(Pounds 15.83m). Gross profit came to Pounds 878,000 (Pounds 1.64m) after
land provisions of Pounds 750,000 (nil).
Losses per share emerged at 7.6p (0.9p). The shares dipped 1p to 40p.

DOMESTIC &amp; General, the domestic appliance breakdown insurer,reported
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 7.7m for the year to June 30.
Mr Martin Copley, the chairman, said he was 'delighted with the progress'
made by D&amp;G, which has a share of about 12 per cent of the Pounds 350m a
year appliance breakdown market.
Earnings per share were up 24 per cent to 75.63p and the dividend increased
by 25 per cent to 22.5p. Turnover grew by 27.3 per cent to Pounds 56.29m
(Pounds 44.23m), while underlying premium income, net of reinsurance, rose
by 29.9 per cent to Pounds 50.03m.
Total contribution (underwriting profits before expenses) amounted to Pounds
13.57m (Pounds 11.23m) and investment income Pounds 6.14m (Pounds 5.86m).
Expenses were Pounds 11.46m (Pounds 10.45m). Interest payable amounted to
Pounds 282m (Pounds 380m) and the group contributed Pounds 277m (Pounds 68m)
to the Policyholders' Protection Board.
Mr Copley said that less than 30 per cent of domestic appliances are insured
and that D&amp;G is seeking to increase penetration of the market by persuading
customers to insure other appliances.
D&amp;G launched a 'multi-appliance policy' in June and aims to step up its
efforts to expand in Europe, especially France and Germany. #

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, the computing services company
created through a buy-out from the US aerospace group earlier this year,
performed encouragingly in its first half year of independence.
For the six months to June 30 pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.2m on revenues
of Pounds 66.5m.
Mr Jerry Causley, chief executive, said he was pleased with the result given
difficult trading conditions and the time and energy the company's
management had devoted to the buy-out.
'We continue to generate profit from our focus of providing total IT
solutions to specific market niches,' he said. These include the health
service and the police.
The company this year won the contract to manage all the computer operations
for the Devon and Cornwall Police. Yesterday it announced it had won a
Pounds 8.3m contract let by four hospitals in East Anglia.
MDIS traditionally performs significantly better in the second half of the
year. Last year it reported operating profits of Pounds 19.6m on revenues of
Pounds 160m.
No date has yet been set for flotation, although it is clear the company is
waiting only for encouraging market conditions to complement its financial
performance. Cash remains strong but no acquisitions are anticipated.

flotation this autumn

<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT INSURANCE, the general insurer, is aiming to go public in the
autumn, with a stock market flotation expected to value the group at more
than Pounds 80m.
It will be the first general insurance company to seek a listing for at
least 30 years.
The group announced its plans when disclosing pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.29m (Pounds 4.29m) for the six months to June 30, struck after a Pounds
5.2m (nil) provision for a Lloyd's stop-loss policy.
Operating profits increased 121 per cent to Pounds 9.49m (Pounds 4.29m). The
underwriting profit came out at Pounds 2.1m (loss of Pounds 1.8m) excluding
stop-loss provisions.
The company had intended to float earlier this year, but postponed the move
because of uncertainty over the size of losses stemming from underwriting
stop loss reinsurance for Lloyd's Names, stemming from the 1989 and 1990
years.
With the scale of these losses now clearer - they are not expected to exceed
Pounds 15m - listing plans are back on track.
It is understood that a placing and intermediaries offer could proceed by
November. Lazard Brothers have been appointed financial advisers and Noble &amp;
Company will be co-sponsors. James Capel have been appointed brokers to the
issue.
Gross written premiums increased by 56 per cent to Pounds 106.2m (Pounds
68.1m), with Independent taking advantage of increasing rates in both the
personal and commercial risks markets.
Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said extra capital was necessary to
'keep solvency up' and fund further growth.
The group increased its interim dividend to 7p per share (6p) and forecast a
final of 9.5p making 16.5p for the year (14p).

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Polypipe sees revival as profits rise 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-depressed UK building sector is beginning to show vigorous signs of
life, according to Polypipe which yesterday reported buoyant sales and
profits for the year to June 30.
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the group was experiencing increased
business 'right across the building sector'.
The order book had returned to normal levels, he said. 'This is the first
normal year we have had in four years.' New buildings account for about 12
per cent of group sales.
Polypipe, which manufactures pipes for industrial and commercial use and
other domestic plastic products such as bathroom fixtures, windows and
garden furniture, said sales volumes were running between 4.5 per cent and
6.5 per cent ahead of last year in the various divisions.
The group reported an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
17.1m (Pounds 15.4m), on sales also 11 per cent ahead to Pounds 120.5m
(Pounds 108.3m). Acquisitions contributed Pounds 600,000 to sales and Pounds
50,000 to profits.
The growth was achieved through a combination of new products and and
growing market share, said Mr McDonald. Exports also rose by 15 per cent to
Pounds 9.4m, with the strongest increase in sales to the Middle East.
Operating margins were slightly ahead of last year, rising from 14.26 per
cent to 14.42 per cent.
The group's core business, above and below ground pipe fittings continued to
grow, the company said. Polypipe claimed 21 per cent of the above ground
drainage market, and 16 per cent of the domestic underground sector.
Mr McDonald said the group had increased market share in spite of the
imposition of higher prices. He stressed that the group would not hesitate
to raise prices again if raw material costs continued to increase.
Polypipe spent some Pounds 12.5m on capital expenditure, similar to that of
last year, and 1.7 times the rate of depreciation. It planned to spend
Pounds 12m this year. The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 6.7m.
Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 7.4p (6.69p). The proposed final
dividend is being increased by 7.5 per cent to 1.44p for a total of 2.1p
(1.97p).

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Watmoughs shows 24% improvement to Pounds
6.37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATMOUGHS (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer, yesterday reported a 24
per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits and an improvement in its
interim dividend.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 6.37m in the six months to June 30
against Pounds 5.12m in the year-ago period on turnover which grew by 18 per
cent to Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 55.5m). Interest costs fell to Pounds 76,000
(Pounds 164,000).
Earnings per share improved to 13.38p (11.14p) out of which the group is
paying an increased dividend of 3p per share compared with 2.7p at the
interim stage last year.
In addition the group is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue 'in view of the
substantial increase in the market price of the company's shares' which has
more than doubled over the past two years. Yesterday the shares closed up
16p to 748p.
The board has also proposed the early redemption of the group's 5 per cent
and 6 per cent preference shares. The proposals are subject to shareholder
approval.
Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the group's UK
activities 'continued to benefit from a slight improvement in the overall
level of demand, our capital investment programme over recent years (which
has totalled Pounds 100m), and firm management and financial controls.'
He said the slight upturn in demand in the UK experienced towards the end of
last year continued throughout the 1993 first half 'with an improving trend
in the second quarter.'
Mr Walker added that moves by a number of newspapers to produce colour
tabloid sections had resulted in an increase in demand for web-offset
printing. 'It is not a sellers' market, but there is certainly an increase
in demand,' he said.
Over the past few months Watmoughs has won a number of new newspaper
printing contracts, including part of the new colour tabloid for the Mail on
Sunday and the new Observer colour supplement.
Elsewhere, Mr Walker said the group's new Spanish printing operations came
on stream progressively during the second quarter and produced a small
initial pre-tax profit contribution, as did the group's Revai Nyomda
Hungarian subsidiary, which 'continued to make good progress.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BZW seeks Pounds 20m for endowment fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW is launching a Jersey-based closed-end investment company which is to be
listed on the London stock exchange. The BZW Endowment Fund will invest in
the second-hand with-profits endowment policies which are issued by
insurance companies.
The fund is raising up to Pounds 20m to invest in the policies, which it
will buy from market-makers Beale Dobie and Policy Portfolio.
The shares are being offered at 100p, with 50p payable in October and the
remaining 50p in April 1994. No dividends will be paid. The costs of the
issue are expected to be about 5.5 per cent and the annual management fee
will be 0.5 per cent.
As a Jersey-based company, it will be able to distribute its assets as
capital profits during the final five years of its life between 2001 and
2005. This option is not open to an onshore investment trust.
Private investors may find the five year pay-off efficient for financial
planning and for capital gains tax purposes.
With-profits endowment policies have terms ranging from 10 to 25 years.
Policyholders face surrender penalties if they want to cash in their
policies before maturity. Instead, many sell the policies in the second hand
market, where investors are willing to pay more than the offered surrender
values.
Bonuses on endowment policies are being cut, as insurance companies adjust
to the lower investment returns available in the 1990s. However, even
allowing for a 10 per cent bonus cut over the next year and no growth in
bonuses after that, BZW estimates that the fund can grow at 10.1 per cent
per year.

SEASONAL LOSSES at Vaga, the lingerie offshoot acquired last year, left
Magellan Industries with pre-tax losses of Pounds 174,000 in the half year
ended June 30.
In the same period last year the Marks and Spencer supplier, formerly known
as Celestion Industries, recorded losses of Pounds 93,000, restated for FRS
3.
However, the company said the figures were not comparable because of the
number of changes. Two companies had been discontinued and one acquired.
Continuing businesses recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 739,000 last time.
Turnover this year was Pounds 17.1m and the pre-tax figure was struck after
interest charges of Pounds 222,000 and an exceptional charge of Pounds
496,000, relating to provisions against the holding in Dunkeld and losses
following the sale of the Slix brand.
Turnover last time was Pounds 17.6m, of which Pounds 5.86m related to
discontinued businesses, and the interest charge was Pounds 230,000,
discontinued businesses Pounds 118,000.
Losses per share came out unchanged at 0.4p.
Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said progress was being made and order
books were higher than a year ago.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest payments help lift BDM 69%
to Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP FALL in interest payments following flotation early last year helped
to boost pre-tax profits at British Data Management by 69 per cent to Pounds
4.22m (Pounds 2.51m) for the year ended June 30.
Operating profits at the specialist data storage group were ahead 24 per
cent at Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 3.59m) on turnover up at Pounds 15.6m (Pounds
13m).
Interest payments fell to Pounds 224,000 from Pounds 1.08m previously. Net
borrowings, which were around Pounds 10m before the flotation, were Pounds
5m at the year end, giving the company a 30 per cent gearing.
The pre-tax profits were also helped by a low tax charge following
over-provision in previous years.
Mr Stephen Crown, chairman and chief executive, described the first full
year as a listed company as 'particularly exciting.' Three commercial data
management businesses had been acquired for a total outlay of Pounds 3.5m.
This had added 225 customers, taking the total to 1,200.
BDM is the UK market leader in data storage for the oil and gas industry.
The group commissioned a second data centre in Aberdeen after winning a
contract to manage BP Exploration's library and records centre. It was
opened last week by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister.
Mr Crown said that more companies seeking to concentrate on their core
activities would be looking outside for data management. 'We can take away
the hassle of filing.'
In addition there was plenty of potential for contracts from Government and
the National Health Service.
BSS, the division which makes specialist racking systems, had had a
'fantastic year,' said Mr Crown, boosting its contribution to group
operating profit by 55 per cent on turnover ahead 24 per cent.
Turnover at Eurocrate, which supplies the removals industry with plastic
crates, was ahead 16 per cent - the first rise for three years.
The group's earnings per share were 14.3p, up from a previous 11.9p. The
final dividend proposed is 3.25p, giving a total of 4.75p for the year
compared with a notional 4p given in last year's prospectus.

HEWITT Group, the manufacturer of industrial ceramics and refractories,
reported a Pounds 76,000 drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 335,000 for the

However, the company said, last year's interim figure of Pounds 469,000 had

During the period Hewitt entered into a joint venture with the technical
ceramics division of NV Koninklijke Sphinx, the Dutch sanitaryware and
ceramic tile group, and the result this time had benefited from a
three-month contribution amounting to Pounds 96,000.
Turnover for the six months rose from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 4.36m, boosted
by Pounds 975,000 of sales from the Sphinx operation.
Borrowings had risen during the first half, the company said, in order to
finance the acquisition of Sphinx and the continuing investment programme in
Germany. Gearing at the period end stood at 64 per cent, but that was
expected to fall in the second half, the directors added.
The interim dividend is being raised by 20 per cent to 1.5p (1.25p) and is
paid from earnings per share down from 7.3p to 6.4p.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Scholes advances 36% to Pounds 4.31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLES, the electrical installation materials group, lifted pre-tax profits
by 36 per cent from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 4.31m in the year to June 30
despite 'no overall growth' in the group's markets.
Mr Bill Riches, executive chairman, said that, although there had been 'a
marked reduction in costs', the main engine of profits growth had been
increased productivity.
But he acknowledged there was 'not a great deal more scope' for reducing
costs and increasing efficiency - the workforce was cut by a further 5 per
cent to 1,545 in the year - without paring the group too thin.
Mr Alan Baxter, who has been chief executive for a little over a year, is to
leave the group.
Mr Riches said: 'It just didn't work out.'
Turnover edged up Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 62.7m and operating profits
advanced 27 per cent to Pounds 4.81m (Pounds 3.8m). Mr Riches said that, in
spite of strong competition, margins in the core electrical equipment
manufacturing activities rose from less than 8 to 9 per cent. Good quality
products were part of the reason for this, he added.
An important factor in this, and 'a crucial component of future strategy',
was the alliance with Asea Brown Boveri, where ABB provides technology and
components, especially to Wylex. Mr Riches said that all the technology on
Wylex's miniature circuit breakers came from ABB and 40 per cent of Wylex's
products overall.
The turnover figure concealed a small domestic decline, though there was
also a 30 per cent rise in exports to Pounds 8m, of which Pounds 5.6m (up 47
per cent) came from the Middle East. Mr Riches reckoned that sterling's
devaluation accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in exports. Net
interest charges fell to Pounds 654,000 (Pounds 834,000) as net borrowings
fell to nil (Pounds 3m). Earnings grew to 7.7p (5.9p) and the final dividend
is held at 3.4p for an unchanged total of 5p.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Porter Chadburn fell 9p to 25p yesterday following a warning by Mr
Patrick Barrett, chairman, that on a like-for-like basis first-half profits
of the packaging, consumer products and specialist distribution group would
'be well down on last year'.
He added that the operating performance for the whole year would also be
below that of last year.
In the consumer division, anticipated profits of the Seasons Christmas
decoration and barbecue business have fallen sharply. Margins on Head
footwear have been poor. Sales in Leeda have been below last year's levels.
The disposal of surplus leasehold warehousing space has been slower than
expected: with previous provisions exhausted, the carrying cost of the
properties will be higher this year than expected.
In packaging, margins were likely to be lower in the first half than
previously, because of planned increases in overheads.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: VHE worth Pounds 37m in placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VHE HOLDINGS, a specialist contractor, is coming to the main market via a
placing which values the company at Pounds 36.9m.
Founded in 1979, the Barnsley-based company is involved in environmental
land reclamation and regeneration and civil engineering, mostly in the
Midlands and the north of England.
A roadshow has given presentations to about 100 institutions in London and a
further 10 in Scotland and it is believed the placing, sponsored by Panmure
Gordon, will be comfortably over-subscribed.
Some 10.9m shares are being placed at 115p each, of which 2.1m are new, and
represent 34 per cent of the enlarged equity. At present Mr Brian Waldron,
the 54-year-old founder and chairman, and Mr Brian Thomson, the 45-year-old
managing director, who joined in 1984, each hold 50 per cent.
After expenses VHE will receive Pounds 2m, leaving the company with about
Pounds 6m in cash.
In the year to March 31 pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 946,000)
on turnover of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 15.8m). Currently its order-book stands
at Pounds 20m. VHE has made no profits forecast for the year to March 31
1994, but analysts are expecting between Pounds 3.4m and Pounds 4m pre-tax.
About 19 per cent of VHE's turnover in the current year is expected to
derive from St Paul's, a property company of which Mr Waldron and Mr
Thomson, directly or through trusts, each own 40 per cent.
VHE's contracts range in value from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 10m. The
reasons cited for the flotation include the fact that its enlarged capital
base and increased resources will allow it to 'tender for larger contracts
as main contractors and to perform those larger contracts which it is
awarded'.
The Department of the Environment has reckoned that there are about 101,000
acres of derelict land to be reclaimed in England, such as former coal
mines, steel works and power stations.
Since 1991 VHE has reclaimed about 1,000 acres of contaminated land.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Utd Friendly's big general branch loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the underwriting loss on the general business account has
hit first-half profits at United Friendly Group, the life assurance company.
The shares fell 42p to 635p yesterday as the group announced a fall in the
pre-tax figure from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 6.08m.
The general branch underwriting loss rose to Pounds 6.98m (Pounds 1.69m)
while total net premiums written increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 53.5m.
Mr George Mack, finance director, said a review had strengthened claims
reserves, especially in the motor business, where claims for injuries had
run ahead of estimates. In addition the group had stopped taking some
categories of business.
Strengthening the reserves had accounted for a third of the increased loss,
he said. Another third reflected the cost of new business because of the
expansion of the property and motor sectors.
Life business profits rose to Pounds 5.6m from Pounds 3.9m. Total premium
income in the life accounts was Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 98.7m).
Earnings per share fell to 6.98p from 9.14p. The interim dividend is raised
from 4.9p to 5.5p.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goal net profits rise 18% to Pounds 2.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOAL Petroleum, the UK independent exploration and production company,
reported an 18 per cent jump in net profits to Pounds 2.8m for the first
half of the year despite a 13 per cent fall in production. Earnings per
share also rose 18 per cent to 2.07p.
The decline in output was offset by favourable exchange rate movements which
resulted in higher sterling prices for oil. Turnover to the end of June
remained unchanged from the same period last year at Pounds 20.9m, according
to Mr Roger Bexon, chairman.
He said the company would use its financial strength - net borrowings fell
Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 16.2m to give a gearing ratio of 18 per cent - to
expand reserves, either through successful exploration, acquisition or by
boosting output of existing reserves, such as the Wytch Farm and Magnus
fields in the UK.
Mr Bexon added that the changes made earlier this year to the UK's petroleum
tax regime would 'substantially increase' Goal's discretionary income and
enhance its flexibility in making any acquisitions. 'While the North Sea
still offers many opportunities ..we continually review possible investments
in other areas,' he said.
The company's average production rate was 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day during the first half of the year (11,500). The fall was due to planned
maintainence shutdowns at the Buchan and Wytch Farm fields. There is again
no interim dividend.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sale helps Heywood Williams to Pounds 22.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEYWOOD WILLIAMS, the building materials group, reported half year pre-tax
profits up from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 22.7m, which included a Pounds 15m
profit on the sale of most of its glass business to Pilkington.
Turnover fell to Pounds 170.3m (Pounds 190.4m) in the six months to June 30,
including Pounds 34.3m from discontinued activities. This reflected the
three month lacuna between the Pounds 95m sale of the glass distribution
business in April and the maiden contribution of a US building products
company acquired for Pounds 42m at the end of the half year.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said the glass business had not been making
any money. He added that the profit rise reflected cost cutting in its
aluminium and plastics businesses.
'Our automotive business has benefited from the inclusion of windscreens in
the MOT test from January 1, with the trade up 30 per cent overall. Our US
interests equalled the record profits they achieved in 1992 in dollar
terms.'
He added: 'Recovery in the UK is hesitant but the underlying trend is
positive.'
The acquisition of LaSalle-Deitch, a US buildings material company, gave the
company further access to growth markets in prefabricated houses and
recreational vehicles, Mr Hinchliffe said. Mainland Europe was likely to
remain difficult for a little time.
At the end of the period net cash was Pounds 19m, against net debt of Pounds
24.6m 12 months earlier. Interest income was Pounds 86,000 compared with
charges of Pounds 1.16m last time.
The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 4.5p from earnings per
share of 23.7p (3.4p).
COMMENT
Management deserves credit for harsh cost cutting last year which has helped
the company bear the seasonal losses of its old glass distribution business
and improve underlying profits. The strategy of supplying higher margin
components for specialist niche markets such as prefabricated houses and
recreational vehicles looks good. But the cyclicality of both markets calls
for caution. Stripping out the exceptional profit, forecasts are for Pounds
20m pre-tax giving a multiple of about 20.5 this year, a 30 per cent premium
to the market, thanks mainly to loss elimination and growth in windscreens.
But the multiple falls to 15 in 1994, which looks reasonable for a recovery
stock.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jeyes tumbles to Pounds 374,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEYES Group, the cleaning products manufacturer which stunned the market
with a profits warning in June, yesterday reported an 82 per cent drop in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 374,000 on sales 61 per cent higher at
Pounds 57.9m.
Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, was confident, however, that the sharp
profits downturn had been a hiccup after a series of one-off factors. These
included over-enthusiastic spending on marketing in the company's bleach and
wipes business, and the costs of restructuring the group's divisions
following the acquisition last year of Globol in Germany.
Mr Moir said Jeyes had spent some Pounds 4m on marketing bleach and wipes in
the UK, leaving it with a greater market share. Although the spending had
been budgeted for, margins were severely hit when competition forced down
prices. However, Mr Moir said conditions had now returned to normal.
The chief executive remained cautious about the full year, however, until
autumn trading became more clear. 'It is crucially important that we deliver
the bacon at that time,' he said.
The UK division, which accounts for 45 per cent of turnover, was showing a 5
per cent increase in year-on-year sales. The international division,
excluding Germany, had been hindered by difficult trading in France and
Spain and destocking in North America. Mr Moir said the North American
business had since improved significantly.
Germany was showing a 10 per cent increase in sales at the half year, he
said.
Jeyes took an exceptional charge of Pounds 610,000 to pay for redundancy
costs. A further provision of Pounds 5.8m was shown in the balance sheet to
cover restructuring costs. Some 27 management jobs were cut in the first
half, and Mr Moir said the group expected to reduce the workforce by a
further 250.
Earnings per share tumbled from 9.4p to 1.2p. The dividend was increased to
3.3p.
COMMENT
As Mr Moir frankly admits, Jeyes may have 'chased the market a little too
hard'. But since the group has won greater market share as a result, the
most severe damage in the medium term may well have been to its credibility
in the City. The shares are likely to tread water at least until the finals,
when Mr Moir's cautiously optimistic statements will be put to the test.
Jeyes will also have to prove that it can get gearing, currently at 54 per
cent, to an acceptable level. Expectations are for pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.7m, leaving a prospective p/e of 22 times. It is likely to be 1994 before
Jeyes begins to recover its shine.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum Pounds 16.2m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE PETROLEUM, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday
reported a Pounds 16.2m loss in the six months to June 30 after writing off
Pounds 21.6m due to failed exploration, mainly in Malaysia.
Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said he was disappointed that the company's
international exploration programme had 'led to a high level of write-offs
during the last two years'.
The Pounds 16.2m net loss for the first half of this year compared to an
Pounds 11.8m loss last time. The loss per share was 4.6p (3.7p), but Dr
Phipps predicted that Clyde would return to profit in 1994 and reinstate a
dividend in October 1994.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said planned maintenance shutdowns at
the Wytch Farm field and the Forties pipeline system in the UK led to a
lower average daily output during the first half of 21,072 barrels of oil
equivalent. Production had returned to normal levels and he predicted
average output for the full year would be close to the 23,900 b/d achieved
last year.
The drop in first half production caused turnover to decline to Pounds 39.2m
(Pounds 43.7m). But the company benefitted from selling forward 73 per cent
of its estimated 1993 output at Dollars 18.67 per barrel, against recent
prices of under Dollars 16 a barrel.
Cash inflow of Pounds 25m was supplemented by the Pounds 34.2m received from
the company's rights' issue last March. Gearing, currently at 100 per cent,
is likely to be slightly higher by year-end, according to Mr Gourlay. But he
expects it to fall to 60 per cent by next year because of the cashflow
expected when the North Sea Gryphon field begins producing next month. Clyde
has a 35 per cent stake in the field.
Mr David Basham, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the size of the
interim loss took the market 'a little bit by surprise,' and added that
Clyde was 'trying to tidy up its balance sheet before the Gryphon production
began.'
Mr Gourlay said the company's exploration efforts would focus in future on
the Netherlands, UK and Yemen. He said Clyde would be 'opportunistic' about
possible disposals.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BT's Pounds 400m Spanish venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is forming a Pounds 400m joint venture company
with Grupo Santander, Spain's fourth largest financial services group and
parent of Banco Santander, to sell data communications services in Spain.
The joint venture will own, manage and upgrade Megared, Grupo Santander's
existing data communications network, which covers 31 Spanish cities.
The move is a further push into Europe's liberalising telecommunications
market.
The new company, expected to employ over 300 people when fully established,
will offer a range of managed data communications services to Spanish
companies and other large users. Megared, set up in 1989 to serve the

international experience and Grupo Santander's knowledge of Spanish business
and its extensive data communications network'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow in the black - Refocusing
and cost cutting help put constructor back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW, the restructured construction group, returned to the black
in the first half, posting pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m against a
restated Pounds 16.9m loss last time.
Turnover in the six months to June 30 increased to Pounds 622.6m (Pounds
594.4m) despite a reduction in contracting turnover which slipped to Pounds
418.8m, against Pounds 435.1m in the 1992 first half.
Earnings per share of 1.3p compared with losses of 3.7p in the comparable
period and the group, which cut the interim dividend to 0.5p last year, is
maintaining it at the reduced rate.
Commenting on the turnaround Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said the structural
changes - including refocusing the group on its four core businesses and
cutting back on overheads - have put Taylor Woodrow 'back on the track
towards the level of performance which our shareholders expect'.
Overall the group reported operating profits, excluding a Pounds 5.3m gain
resulting from the implementation of the FRS 3 accounting rules, of Pounds
16.4m compared with a Pounds 10.7m loss a year earlier.
Despite the reduction in turnover in the core contracting business losses
were reduced from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 3.4m in the latest period. Mr
Parsons expressed confidence that although conditions remain highly
competitive, the contracting losses should be eliminated this year.
The group's property business performed 'reasonably' in the first half,
although net rental income fell by about 9 per cent following disposals.
Overall the division posted a Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.2m) profit on turnover
of Pounds 57m (Pounds 43m).
In the housing division profits of Pounds 3.9m compared with a Pounds 16.4m
loss last time and came on turnover up at Pounds 91.3m (Pounds 65.6m). Mr
Parsons said the group's worldwide housing operations, including those in
Australia, Florida and Canada, continued to make progress with sales of
houses and plots increasing by 34 per cent to 1,095.
In the UK house sales grew by 35 per cent to just over 300, but the average
price fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 71,000 and the land bank fell slightly to
2,200 plots.
The group's net borrowings fell by Pounds 87.3m from the year-end to Pounds
141.3m at June 30, equivalent to gearing of 27 per cent against 44 per cent
at the end of December.
COMMENT
Taylor Woodrow's management team deserves credit for strengthening the
balance sheet and improving performance despite the continuing dire problems
of the construction sector. The turnaround has been achieved mainly by
selling off non-core operations and reducing overheads by some Pounds 20m.
However, only about Pounds 18m of pre-tax profits are expected this year,
equivalent to earnings per share of about 4.4p. At current prices the shares
are trading on a prospective p/e of 27, which looks unjustified.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Intl turns in Pounds 9.44m and
enfranchises shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY INTERNATIONAL, the fast-expanding UK regional newspaper publisher,
is to enfranchise its ordinary shareholders.
This will end the voting structure which has made it immune from takeover
since it floated as the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo in 1904.
Trinity coupled its announcement yesterday with news of a 27 per cent rise
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.44m from Pounds 7.44m and an increase
in interim dividend to 3p (2.7p).
The group is joining a band including Great Universal Stores and several
other companies which have recently declared a change in their restrictive
voting structures.
Mr Philip Graf, chief executive, said yesterday enfranchisement was meant to
improve the attractiveness, marketability and value of Trinity's shares.
He did not accept Trinity was now vulnerable to predators.
'The best long-term defence against a takeover is sustained performance. We
have a good record and excellent relations with our shareholders,' he said.
Trinity's shares closed up 3p at 388p.
Trinity lost its main disgruntled shareholder earlier this year when Mr
Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher of the Daily Telegraph, sold a 10 per
cent stake he had bought in 1989 in the hope of building a long term
relationship.
Trinity's directors, who control the 12 management shares that are the only
ones with voting rights at present, saw him as a potential predator and are
understood to have rebuffed Mr Black's overtures for a seat on the board and
enfranchisement of Trinity's shares.
Mr Black failed to take up his rights in an oversubscribed rights issue last
year and Goldman Sachs had no difficulty placing his shares with
institutions.
Trinity's biggest shareholder now is Mercury Asset Management, which has 25
per cent. Other financial institutions own at least another 55 per cent.
The group, which has its headquarters in Chester, owns the daily newspapers
in Liverpool and groups of weeklies and free sheets in Merseyside, north
Wales, western Canada and the US. Last year it divested from papermaking and
packaging to concentrate on media.
It bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers (SUN) from Lonrho, having
withdrawn from a contested bid for Southern Newspapers on the English south
coast.
This year, Trinity has made an agreed offer for the Huddersfield Examiner
group of newspapers in West Yorkshire and is in exclusive negotiations to
buy Argus Press, in south-east England.
Both deals are awaiting government clearance.
Under the enfranchising proposal, each non-voting stock unit will be
converted into one share with full voting rights.
Each management share will be converted into 10 ordinary shares with no
compensation for loss of voting power.
Trinity's turnover rose 32 per cent to Pounds 64.67m (Pounds 48.96m),
reflecting the Scottish and Universal acquisition.
Earnings per ordinary stock unit were 9.2p (8.0p). Gearing was 18.3 per
cent, although this is likely to double if the Argus and Huddersfield deals
are finalised.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill incurs Pounds 4m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONS against possible settlements in a number of legal disputes, heavy
reorganisation costs and slow growth in its new business yesterday plunged
Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, into the red.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.92m for the six months to end-June surprised the
market and explain a cut in the interim dividend to 3p (4.25p).
The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 6.23m, was the
first recorded by SBJ which has grown rapidly since its launch on the market
in the mid-1980s and is prompting a round of job cuts.
Mr George Boden, chief executive, who described the trading performance as
'very poor', said at least 70 of the group's 860 staff would lose their job,
45 of them immediately.
Underlying trading profit, including investment income was Pounds 3.52m. But
provisions of Pounds 4.39m were made for the expense of reorganising back
office and other operations and Pounds 3.05m for the cost of possible legal
settlements.
Mr Boden said half of the legal provision related to one particular dispute.
The group has not made any extra provision for any costs it might incur as a
result of any out-of-court settlement to the litigation between Names and
agents at the Lloyd's market.
After tax losses per share amounted to 7.62p (earnings 8.77p).
Slow progress in the group's core marine markets, especially in the marine
reinsurance and offshore energy sectors, depressed turnover. Broking
revenues fell to Pounds 23.37m, 4.8 per cent below the level achieved in
1992.
After stripping out the impact of exchange rate movements and the impact of
acquired businesses which did not operate for the first six months,
underlying growth was down by 8 per cent.
Competition in the energy market, especially from the US on both price and
policy wordings, was described as 'continuing and persistent'.

Pre-tax profits at Emess, the lighting and electrical accessories group,
remained static at Pounds 1.1m for the half year ended June 30. However, the
comparative figure included a Pounds 1.3m contribution from discontinued
operations.
Turnover of continuing operations edged ahead from Pounds 59.1m to Pounds
59.5m for trading profits of Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.7m). Interest costs were
Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.9m).
Fully diluted earnings emerged at 0.5p (0.6p).

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Restructure planned for Gartmore Value Invs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Gartmore Value Investments, a split-capital investment
trust, are being offered shares in Gartmore Shared Equity Trust, a new
investment trust, in a restructuring operation. Gartmore is also planning to
raise up to Pounds 50m through an offer for subscription in the new trust.
The new trust will have the same investment objectives as the old one, but
will have a longer life and be less highly geared. It will also be based on
a wider spread of equities.
Greig Middleton, on behalf of Gartmore Shared, is offering 34 new shares at
100p for every 100, equivalent to a price of 34p per share. It also offering
89.3 new zero dividend preference shares at 103p for every 100 old zeros,
equivalent to 91.979p. No offer is being made for the debenture stock.
The market price of the ordinary shares is 34p, with the zeros at 92p. Net
asset value per share stands at 40.9p.
The new shares are expected to have a gross dividend yield of 12 per cent,
compared with the present 14 per cent. The new zeros will give a gross
redemption yield of 8 per cent, compared with 7.3 per cent.
Greig Middleton has already received irrevocable undertakings to accept the
recommended offer from holders of 46.87 per cent of the ordinary.
There is no cash alternative, but Gartmore Value Investments will continue
to be run alongside the new trust until it is wound up as planned in January
1995.
The new trust is expected to be wound up on April 30 2002.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham Intl asset sale after Pounds
62.5m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM International, the property, hotels and nursing group, is in
talks with its bankers after it wrote down the value of its property by
almost Pounds 60m leading to a loss before tax of Pounds 62.5m in the half
year to May 2.
Net borrowings rose to Pounds 95.5m, representing gearing of 200 per cent.
Interest increased to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 4m). The rise in debt led to a
breach of covenants with its banks.
Mr David Hardy, chairman, said: 'We are talking to our lenders about a
programme of disposals. We expect the discussions to be resolved
satisfactorily and the sale of assets should result in a big reduction in
debt. The banks are not going to pull the plug.'
An exceptional charge of Pounds 60m mainly relates to the write down of the
group's assets, which includes property in Portugal. The provision amounts
to 49p per share and leaves net assets of 35p (80p) per share.
Mr Clarke, who became a multi-millionaire after the Greenalls takeover of
Devenish, has been given 5m share options exercisable in five years at 10p
each. Buckingham's shares, which rose to Pounds 1 four years ago, were
yesterday unchanged at 6 1/2 p.
'The group is a shadow of its former glory' said Mr Hardy. 'But with new
management and a disposal programme in place I hope better times are
coming.'
Profit before exceptional items rose to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.27m) on
increased sales of Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 19.5m).
Operating profits from hotels and nursing homes increased to Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 2.4m) and Pounds 521,000 (Pounds 459,000) respectively. The Portugal
development business made a loss of Pounds 273,000.
Losses per share of 51.85p compare to losses of 1.84p. The interim dividend
has been passed again.

FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: National Express blames recession for 45%
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach service operator floated late last year,
yesterday blamed a 45 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits on the
continuing effects of the recession on domestic services and the costs of a
redundancy programme designed to cut the workforce by 10 per cent.
Reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 585,000 on turnover of Pounds 57.4m in
the 28 weeks to July 10, the company said the performance would have been
healthier had it not been for Pounds 427,000 in exceptional redundancy costs
in its UK express coach arm.
The figures compare with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.06m on turnover of
Pounds 56.9m in the 28 weeks to July 11, 1992. A maiden interim dividend of
2.5p is declared, payable from earnings per share up from 0.2p to 1.3p.
Mr Ray McEnhill, chief executive, said the decline was due to the poor
performance of the express coach division, which reported an operating loss
of Pounds 621,000 compared with a deficit of Pounds 211,000 in 1992. The
division 'has not yet seen any evidence of sustained economic recovery', he
said.
The group has been strengthened by the acquisition of three new businesses
for a total of Pounds 159m: Scottish Citylink, the scheduled coach operator;
Eurolines (Nederland), part of the inter-European network; and East Midlands
International Airport.
The airport's trading results have not been included as the purchase was
completed after the end of the results period.
The group's other divisions, meanwhile, moved ahead. Operating profits at
Eurolines (UK) were Pounds 462,000 (Pounds 411,000); Airport Coach Services
was up to Pounds 241,000 (Pounds 219,000).
National Express has shelved plans to upgrade its core coach business with
refurbished stations and a new reservation system while it assimilates its
new acquisitions.
The company has, however, been careful not to abandon its investment plans,
designed to woo passengers back from British Rail, and has only postponed
them until the coach market shows signs of generating the passenger volume
to make the outlay worthwhile.
In the meantime, the group says its has substantial spare cash which it
intends to use to develop its new businesses rather than embark on further
acquisitions.

FT  15 SEP 93 / GM seeks Japanese acquisitions to boost sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US carmaker, is looking to acquire one or several
Japanese parts makers to increase sales of components in the Japanese
market.
Mr Philip Austin, vice-president of GM's Automotive Components Group in
Japan, said the company could acquire several small components makers or a
larger company. 'To be a strong player in any market you need a
manufacturing presence and we don't have one in Japan.'
Although acquisitions of Japanese companies by foreign groups have been
rare, Mr Austin said the timing was good as many Japanese car parts
suppliers had suffered from the economic downturn. 'Their investments in the
US have become a burden and they are overcommitted in Japan with borrowings,
so opportunities obviously exist.'
GM's move reflects its growing interest in developing its Asian operations.
The components division, which sells more than 70 per cent of its product to
the parent company, is working to reduce its dependence on the North
American market to 50 per cent of revenues by the year 2000.
US and Japanese negotiators meet in Hawaii next week to discuss encouraging
Japanese purchases of US car and car parts in an effort to reduce Japan's
huge trade surplus. US-made car parts have been more successful in the
Japanese market than US cars.
GM sells more than twice as much in components in Japan than it does in
cars, and Mr Austin said GM expects sales to Japanese carmakers to reach
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) globally by 1998, compared with Dollars 900m last
year.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Delta shares fallas group douses recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Delta fell 8 per cent after the UK cables and engineering group
became the latest industrial company to disappoint the market's hopes of
recovery.
The group said: 'The UK recovery as far as manufacturing is concerned
remains more anaemic than many observers suggest, and activity in
continental Europe has yet to see the benefit of progressive interest rate
reductions.'
Delta has cut its workforce by a third since 1989 and had been identified as
one of the companies best placed to benefit from any upturn. The shares were
marked up sharply in the spring, but yesterday fell 43p to 511p after the
group announced a small drop in profits.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said that in April he had seen renewed signs
of a slow, if patchy, recovery except in continental Europe: 'This pattern
has persisted with continental European markets remaining depressed and any
recovery in the UK and Australia being limited to specific sectors of the
economy.'
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 30.97m to Pounds 29.11m in the six months
to July 3, in spite of a 6 per cent increase in sales, from Pounds 402m to
Pounds 428m.
Mr Wilson said exports from the UK rose by 14 per cent from the already high
levels reached last year to a new record of Pounds 83.8m, greatly helping to
offset low domestic demand. Currency translation added Pounds 1.25m to the
profits figure.
Cables continued to suffer from volatile markets and severe price
competition, with operating profits down from Pounds 5.6m to to Pounds 5.4m.
However, restructuring improved the performance at Surprenant, Delta's US
cable subsidiary, which suffered from defence cuts.
Lower demand across continental Europe reduced the profitability of the
engineering division from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 10.4m, but industrial
services increased profits to Pounds 9.1m (from Pounds 8.4m), as did circuit
protection, to Pounds 8.1m from Pounds 7.4m.
Group gearing rose slightly, from 26 to 28 per cent. Interest payments rose
from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 3.9m.
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said Delta was continuing to invest in
new products and was interested in further acquisitions, particularly in the
US.
Earnings per share dipped to 12.5p (from 12.7p), but the interim dividend
was held at 4.2p.

FT  15 SEP 93 / NatWest picks CIN chief to run investment arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Whitney is quitting as chief executive of CIN Management, manager of
British Coal's pension funds, to join National Westminster Bank as a
managing director in charge of investment management.
The appointment will be followed by a radical reorganisation of NatWest's
fund management operations. Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest
Markets, said the group's diverse investment management businesses would be
brought together into one centralised operation under Mr Whitney.
County NatWest Investment Management, the bank's main investment arm - which
will be renamed NatWest Investment Management - has suffered departures of
senior executives in recent years, undermining its ability to attract UK
pension funds according to pension consultants.
Mr Whitney was first approached by NatWest two months ago. He said yesterday
he decided to join the bank because the new job is potentially far bigger
than his current one. CIN manages Pounds 15bn of funds. 'NatWest has up to
Pounds 30bn,' he said.
However, at the moment this is divided between five different parts of the
bank.
Mr Owen said NatWest took the decision several months ago to bring its fund
management operations together. The bank then decided to search for an
executive to manage the process.
In the past two years, NatWest has adopted a similar strategy with its other
commercial and investment banking operations and has put all of them into
NatWest Markets under Mr Owen.
According to data from pension consultants William M. Mercer and Co, CNWIM's
average UK pension fund portfolio underperformed the market median from 1987
until the middle of 1992.
Increasingly, CNWIM has marketed itself as a 'quantitative' fund manager
incorporating both passive index-tracking techniques and 'active'
mathematical stock and asset selection processes.
Mr Whitney has been at CIN for 10 years. The investment decision of which he
is proudest was the sale for Pounds 800m of the group's US property
portfolio during 1988 and 1989, before prices collapsed.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Darty purchase helps Kingfisher to 30% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the retail group that includes Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Comet and
Superdrug, showed it was reaping the benefits from its purchase of Darty,
France's largest electrical retailer, as it announced a 30.6 per cent
interim profit increase.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose from Pounds 62.8m to
Pounds 82m - towards the upper end of expectations - including a Pounds
16.1m contribution from Darty since the acquisition was completed at the end
of May. Excluding Darty, profits increased 8 per cent.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, warned that retailing in the UK would
continue to be highly competitive with increasing pressure on margins. 'But
we have seen a somewhat firmer undertone to sales in recent months.'
Sir Geoffrey claimed success for Kingfisher's strategy of lowering prices to
drive up volume, with retail turnover excluding Darty rising 9.4 per cent
and all four UK chains increasing market share. But he said Kingfisher faced
a period of volume increases outstripping profits growth, while the group
completed the 'virtuous circle' by improving merchandise and service,
cutting costs and increasing productivity.
The impact of the Mulcahy strategy was clearest at B&amp;Q, which has adopted an
'everyday low prices' campaign for 500 items, accounting for about 20 per
cent of sales. Turnover rose 8.5 per cent to Pounds 600m, but profits rose
only Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 41.6m.
At Superdrug, which has cut prices on some products, sales rose 4.4 per cent
to Pounds 290m, with profits unchanged at Pounds 12.8m. Woolworths saw sales
rise 12 per cent to Pounds 514m, with profits rising from Pounds 0.8m to
Pounds 2.1m, while Comet increased sales 13 per cent to Pounds 210m, and
turned a Pounds 0.5m loss into a Pounds 0.7m profit. Chartwell Land, the
property arm now focusing on retail property for the Kingfisher group,
lifted profits from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 19.5m.
The Pounds 16.1m contribution from Darty was in line with expectations, but
Sir Geoffrey warned that sales had declined in recent months, and little
improvement in the French electricals market was likely until next year.
Group turnover, including Pounds 155m at Darty, increased 17.7 per cent to
Pounds 1.83bn. Earnings per share rose 18.3 per cent to 10.2p, and the
interim dividend was lifted to 4.4p (from 4.2p).

FT  15 SEP 93 / Japan's economy contracts in second quarter as demand falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economy contracted in the second quarter this year, with gross
national product shrinking by 2 per cent on an annualised basis and by 0.5
per cent from the previous quarter.
The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month
would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the
month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further
pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday he saw no
evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of
previous economic stimulus packages to emerge.
The Economic Planning Agency, traditionally more optimistic than the central
bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the second half of
the current tax year to March. Private sector analysts' forecasts for the
full year range widely, from an economic decline to something below last
year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade
surplus is going up and there is no growth in the short term. Now let's get
some policy response,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the
past 16 months, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn
(Pounds 146bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the first
quarter, holding out the short-lived prospect of recovery.
The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a
5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this
was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5
per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private
consumption, down 0.6 per cent.
Japan's trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent
from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand
and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of Japan's exports were
the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent.
Japan's surplus with the US, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars
3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with Washington just weeks
before Mr Morihiro Hosokawa meets US president Bill Clinton.
A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in August in bankruptcies with liabilities of
more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, Teikoku Data
Bank.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Rexrodt abandons peace role in Volkswagen row with GM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, has unexpectedly abandoned his
role as peacemaker between motor industry rivals Volkswagen and Adam Opel,
the German subsidiary of General Motors.
He was being kept informed on the bitter dispute over the alleged theft of
data and possible industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, the new VW production director. But the minister was 'no longer
active', a spokeswoman said yesterday.
'Nothing has changed, and when there is no willingness, then it is just a
waste of time,' she added. It is understood there are no plans for any
further contacts with either side.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Mr Rexrodt's personal spokesman, said recently that the
minister's aim had been to try to prevent damage to political and business
relations between the US and Germany and to find a way for the two companies
'to work together sensibly'.
Political observers said yesterday that, by leaving the legal investigation
and the row to run their natural courses, Mr Rexrodt has withdrawn from an
fast-moving, unpredictable situation in which he was ill-advised to
intervene in the first place.
He was drawn into the fray by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, after Opel
said it would agree to written exchanges with the VW chief if he publicly
retracted statements that the US group was conducting a 'war' with the
intention of 'defaming' Volkswagen.
However, Mr Piech was prepared only to offer not to repeat his accusations.
The minister last met Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on August 26 in
Frankfurt, the same day public prosecutors raided and searched VW
headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and seven of his colleagues. Since
then there has been no further contact.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Factory output growth weaker than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S manufacturing output bounced back in July after falling sharply in
June, but changes to the way the figures are collated show that growth so
far this year is not as strong as previously reported.
Output in July showed a 0.7 per cent rise over June, when there was a 2.1
per cent fall from the previous month. Compared with the same month a year
ago, July output was up 1.7 per cent.
Although manufacturing output is still growing faster than other sectors of
the economy, a new series of Central Statistical Office figures shows growth
in the first half of the year as much weaker than thought.
Figures rebased to 1990 show that output grew by 1.2 per cent and 0.6 per
cent in the first and second quarters of this year, against 2 per cent and
1.4 per cent under the old series. However a drop in production towards the
end of last year was not as steep as previously recorded and, compared with
a year ago, the growth rates for the first six months of the year were
revised downwards only slightly.
The latest figures show that in the three months to July, manufacturing
output grew by 0.1 per cent compared with the previous three-month period.
However, compared with the same three months a year ago, output was up 2.2
per cent.
The CSO said the changes would not have a big impact on gross domestic
product. They may change the quarterly profile of non-oil GDP, but the
strength of manufacturing output on a year-on-year basis means the changes
are unlikely to alter the recent trend of steady growth.
The monthly rise in manufacturing output was concentrated in investment
goods. Output of this category rose by 1.5 per cent compared with June, when
it dropped 2.9 per cent.
The strongest industries were textiles, leather and clothing, coke, petrol
and nuclear fuels. Food, drink and tobacco and chemicals suffered the
sharpest quarter-on-quarter drops.
Mining and quarrying, which under the new series no longer counts as
manufacturing, grew by 6.3 per cent compared with the previous three months.
Within this, coal production was 14.7 per cent lower, reflecting
lower-volume contracts between British Coal and the electricity generating
companies from April.
Electricity, gas and water production was also strong, rising 4.1 per cent
in the latest three months.

The UK stock market has already put on its glad rags to celebrate the
recovery party, but Delta has become the latest of a string of companies to
suggest that the champagne should be left on ice. That the cables market
remains subdued should come as no surprise to those who heard BICC's
comments last month. Still, the market was sufficiently unnerved by Delta's
near-static profits and cautious trading statement to knock 8 per cent off
its shares.
There is little doubt that the theory underpinning the surge in Delta's
shares over the year is sound. Like so many engineering companies, Delta
should experience a sharp pick-up in profits on even small increases in
sales. The upswing should be accentuated as prices recover. At present, they
are languishing at less than three-quarters of their peak. Moreover, Delta
has gone a long way to put its own house in order. Having chopped its
workforce by 30 per cent since 1989, it is now wielding the axe at its
recession-struck plants in mainland Europe. The balance sheet is strong
enough for it to contemplate a splash of acquisitive growth.
The unknowable factor is the speed and strength of the upturn. Delta's
experience only confirms the impression that recovery stocks have generally
shot too far ahead of the game. Top down forecasts may set the market's
mood. The bottom up numbers, though, will determine its final shape.

Yesterday's economic figures confirm that Japan is experiencing its very own
double-dip. Stagnation at home and the brow-beating from Washington on trade
can only increase pressure on the government to deliver an economic package
of substance tomorrow. Two rounds of blunt fiscal stimulus totalling
Y24,000bn have failed to stimulate recovery. Something more imaginative is
now required. Since Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's fragile coalition is split on
personal tax cuts and the scope for deregulation of business, it is far from
clear that he can deliver. Still, serious gestures in the direction of
deregulation and measures to stimulate personal consumption might at least
relieve upward pressure on the yen. Evidence that the structural causes of
Japan's trade surplus are finally being addressed might persuade the US to
stop talking up the Japanese currency. The impact on the markets would be
all the greater if such a package were to be followed by a cut in official
interest rates.
While the trade surplus remains stubbornly high in dollar terms, though,
anything more than a gentle depreciation of the yen would again upset the
apple cart with Washington. On that basis, the recent strength of the Tokyo
equity market is perplexing. As in other markets, low deposit rates are
encouraging a flow of savings into equities. But without coherent measures
to nurture a consumer-led recovery, reasons for optimism are few and far
between.

The government must be particularly anxious to keep the lid on public sector
pay. Any hint of weakness would undermine its credibility on inflation and
raise new worries about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.
The result could be a nasty setback in the gilts market at a time when the
funding need is still high. It is thus no surprise that the Treasury has
come out with a stand on pay which could bring it into direct and
embarrassing confrontation with the review bodies.
Cynics will say that that by allowing increases to be financed by efficiency
gains, the government has opened the door to spurious productivity deals
that will end up breaching its cash limits. Doubtless there will be an
element of fudge: it would be a miracle if the government could keep its
wage bill unchanged in cash terms next year. But its 1.5 per cent limit for
the current year has worked better than many anticipated and public sector
workers will attract little sympathy from their counterparts in the private
sector, many of whom are still enduring pay freezes.
Although the Treasury's plan looks ambitious, the prospects are thus for
continued constraint on public sector pay. Desirable as this may be for the
overall economy, it will not do much for consumer confidence. Individuals
will need rising real incomes before rushing back to the housing market and
resuming purchases on credit. Indeed, there is an inherent contradiction
between pay restraint working only because of a weak economy and
expectations of a sustained consumer-led recovery. That makes yesterday's
weak figures on manufacturing output all the more disappointing.

<TEXT>
Kingfisher's passionate adoption of everyday low pricing is certainly a
marketing success. The 'key DIY' initiative from B&amp;Q has put a stop to the
blitzkrieg price battles of last year. Since B&amp;Q has by far the largest
sites and is striving for high productivity, it is well placed to win the
trench war it has started instead. Significantly, B&amp;Q increased its first
half profits while Texas slipped back and Do It All's losses ballooned.
Yet while it has sold the message, Kingfisher has a long way to go before it
fully implements the low price philosophy. Only some 20 per cent of B&amp;Q's
sales are explicitly covered by it and the company is clearly still
tinkering. The jump in sales at Woolworth suggests it may have been a little
too aggressive in cutting gross margins. Superdrug's poor performance shows
how its weak market position makes it even more vulnerable to supermarkets
than Boots, however much Superdrug hypes its promotions. The weak service
element in several Kingfisher chains also needs correction, while the tardy
roll-out of electronic point of sale equipment makes streamlining operations
more difficult. Perhaps the arrival of Mr Alan Smith from Marks and Spencer
will help. He brings experience of innovation, systems and of grinding out
consistent performance gains.
As Kingfisher is having most of the right ideas, however, it does not do to
carp. Its strategy may slowly throttle some groups which are currently
better placed. In the longer term, Kingfisher's cash generation bodes well
and even the French romance with Darty may not end in tears.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Hungary for capital: Budapest's search for western aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The frailty of central European banks has come to light most rapidly in
Hungary. The country was the first in the region, in late 1991, to enact a
comprehensive package of western-style legislation on bankruptcy, accounting
and commercial banking. These laws have introduced greater transparency, in
turn revealing accumulated losses at companies and exposing the capital
weakness of the banking system.
A joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund study of the banking
system earlier this year revealed the extent of the problem.
It showed that most of the country's banks, including the two largest
commercial banks, Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, were 'technically
insolvent according to internationally accepted accounting standards'. The
report concluded that 'the financial system is unable to finance the
transformation to a market economy'.
The findings have spurred the authorities and international institutions
into action. A World Bank delegation arrived in Budapest last week to pave
the way for a loan for financial restructuring; Hungarian officials say the
loan could total Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m.
One important condition for World Bank assistance should be met today when
the International Monetary Fund is expected to approve Hungary's
macroeconomic programme, designed to reduce the budget deficit.
World Bank financing will in turn allow the authorities to inject new
capital into the banks by the year-end. The World Bank has recommended an
injection of Ft100bn to bring capital ratios to an initial target of 4 per
cent of risk-weighted assets, a big step towards the 8 per cent goal laid
down by the Bank for International Settlements.
But the Ft100bn may not be enough. Hungarian banks have this month been
submitting up-to-date estimates for their bad loan portfolios. While no
official figures on the extent of the problem are forthcoming, initial signs
are that the defaults and recapitalisation costs could be higher than first
thought.  This week, criminal investigations by the chief prosecutor's
office have also disclosed that fraud, bribery and other financial crimes
have cost banks Ft16bn-Ft18bn.
Hungarian government officials alarmed by the cost of the bail-out, are
anxious to ensure that loan losses never again spiral out of control. 'We
must not convey the message that whenever you run into difficulties someone
will bail you out,' says Mr Peter Bod, chairman of the National Bank of
Hungary, the central bank.
The authorities are therefore improving bank monitoring. The central bank
has set up its own banking supervision department. And the State Property
Handling Company (AV RT), the holding company which exercises the state's
controlling stakes in the largest banks, is also tightening controls. 'We
have drawn up a list of 10-15 indicators to monitor the banks' performance,'
says Mr Szabolcs Szekeres, AV RT chairman.
But monitoring by the authorities, at least in an economy which is rapidly
being liberalised, cannot substitute for better management. The greatest
effort is required at Magyar Hitel Bank, banker to Hungary's largest and
most troubled enterprises and in need of the largest recapitalisation.
The shake-up at Magyar Hitel Bank began in April last year when it appointed
Mr Istvan Torocskei, a former foreign exchange dealer at the central bank,
as its third new chairman in three years.
Mr Torocskei's first act was to order an audit of the loan portfolio. Magyar
Hitel Bank found that its non-performing loans had tripled from Ft25bn in
December 1991 to a peak of Ft78bn last year. Mr Gyorgy Szepesi, deputy chief
executive responsible for the investigations, says: 'The amounts, the level
of risk, the consequences of expansive credit policy up to 1991, all gave us
a shocking surprise.'
Now that the bank has a clearer idea of the problem, it has moved on to the
remedial phase. This summer the board authorised senior management to set up
a special corporate finance unit. To manage the unit Mr Torocskei has
brought in Mr Robin Winchester, an experienced international banker who
built up Citibank Budapest into one of the most profitable foreign banks in
central Europe.
This 'bank within a bank', on the fifth floor of Magyar Hitel Bank's
headquarters in Budapest's banking hub, has taken over responsibility for
Hitel's 80 largest debtors and their outstanding loans of more than Ft100bn
(Dollars 1.05bn). Hungary's banking reforms depend as much as anything on
the success of this 'bank within a bank'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's pay policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, self-styled champion of the cabinet's hard centre but
suspected by many of softer inclinations, was always going to have an image
problem in his early months at the Treasury. Faced with a gaping fiscal
deficit, and with Britain's recent inflationary past still fresh in the
memory, the chancellor could not afford to give the impression that the
government will be lax on either wage inflation or public spending.
Yesterday's announcement that the government will freeze next year's public
sector wage bill may help to dispel doubts about his resolve, as well as
bolstering his credentials as a fearless combatant against the trade unions.
By buttering up the Tory right, the move should also enable him to keep open
the option of a tax increase in the November Budget. Whether it will serve
the longer-term interest of the economy is another question.
The precise nature of the medium-term framework for pay-setting, towards
which Mr Clarke appears to be moving, remains rather obscure. The sentiment
is clear enough: 'For next year, 1994-95,' yesterday's statement said, 'the
government will expect any increase in pay for its own employees to be
matched by improvements in productivity.' But what does this mean in
practice? 'Government departments,' the statement continues 'will be
expected to keep their running costs, including pay budgets for their own
employees, to their 1993-94 level in cash terms, except where there are
significant changes in activity above that which can be accommodated by
marked improvements in productivity.'
Credibility
For most of the public sector, the consequence of cash limiting pay bills is
clear enough: accept a pay freeze or reduce employment. The chancellor's
calculation must be that the economic and political risk of adding to
unemployment while the economy remains depressed will be outweighed by the
rise in fiscal and political credibility from holding back public sector
wages.
The medium-term danger is that the gain in fiscal credibility will be
undermined by the inflationary signals that the chancellor's public pay
policy implies. For Britain's new chancellor appears to have fallen into the
very same trap into which chancellors and wage-bargainers have fallen for
decades: endorsing the fallacy that real wage increases at the company level
are justified if, and only if, they are matched by productivity gains.
Unstable recipe
For the economy as a whole, this principle makes sense. But at the sectoral
level, it is an unstable recipe. Productivity gains are inevitably faster in
manufacturing than in public services. In the short term, encouraging
manufacturers to pass their productivity gains to employees, while holding
down public sector wages, stores up the old problem of recruitment and
motivation of public servants. In the medium term, it just pushes the
average rate of wage inflation higher, as public sector workers seek to
catch up with the more rapid rises which have been justified in the private
sector on the basis of productivity ad-vances.
Moreover, it is the private sector that continues to generate inflationary
pressures, as the government's submission to the pay review bodies yesterday
makes clear. Public sector wage settlements for this year were just 1.5 per
cent compared with expected underlying inflation of 3.75 per cent. But
average earnings in manufacturing are still rising at an unsustainable 5 per
cent a year.
The chancellor's short-term case for keeping the lid on public sector pay is
reasonable enough and it is true that the scale of the problems it causes
will depend on whether private wage inflation falls further and stays low.
It is for this reason that the chancellor should follow up his public sector
pay strictures with a sustained effort to persuade the private sector of its
responsibilities. The success of the government's economic strategy requires
that average pay in the private and public sectors should rise in line with
underlying economy-wide productivity. By appearing to endorse the muddled
notion that productivity-related pay increases are always acceptable, he
risks sending precisely the wrong signals to private sector wage-bargainers.

Full marks to the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales for a strongly worded missive on Monday. The bean-counters
savaged proposals emanating from HM Customs &amp; Excise to prevent holding
companies from receiving VAT rebates.
Unfortunately, last Friday Customs issued a press release announcing it had
all but abandoned its proposals.
Perhaps the tax faculty had difficulty understanding the release; it
contained so many double negatives that a sceptic might think Customs was
trying to conceal all suggestion it had backed down. Or maybe the tax
accountants were just exhibiting their characteristic caution and holding
fire until they knew they had backed a winner.
Then again, those more familiar with the labyrinthine workings of the
Institute might feel there is another explanation. After all, the original
Customs proposals were announced last October.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Observer: Bock and tackle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Palumbo says his father gave him a maxim, which was 'only do one thing
well'. This may explain the chairman of the Arts Council's 35-year obsession
to redevelop the site adjacent to the Bank of England.
Now joining Palumbo in the parade ground of Mansion House square is Dieter
Bock, joint chief executive of Lonrho, whose own property company is putting
money into the scheme.
Bock's father probably passed on a different motto. Recently hard at work
refocusing Lonrho in tandem with his Tiny Rowland, Bock is perhaps trying to
do many things well.
Lonrho remains the priority, he says, but his assertion that his involvement
in Palumbo's project would only occupy a couple of days a year touched
Palumbo's perfectionist streak. How could Bock resist straying on to the
site each day, given he passes it en route to Lonrho HQ in Cheapside?

Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Germany's Deutsche Bank, may lack the
urbanity of his predecessor, Alfred Herrhausen, but he's still a dab hand at
verbal finesse.
In Milan yesterday for a rare board meeting outside Frankfurt, Kopper
recalled Deutsche Bank's role as a co-founder 98 years ago of Banca
Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's biggest and most prestigious financial
institutions.
'We could be available for a rebirth,' said Kopper, when quizzed about his
bank's possible interest in buying assets from the newly
privatisation-minded Italian government.
Then he realised the need to avoid giving the impression that Deutsche Bank
might want to buy BCI, rather than just peddle some of the shares in any
flotation. 'Let's just say we would very much like to help with the
delivery,' he explained.

It has been just a year since Prince Hans Adam, the last monarch in Europe

because of the resistance of the government (five members) to moving closer
to the EC.
Now a new parliament has voted out its youngest ever prime minister after
only four months, his own party deserting him because he put a member of the

The prince, who opined that the 34-year-old Markus Buchel had done no wrong,
warned again that he would dissolve parliament if they voted him out. Watch

Poor Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He desperately wants an east German, or Ossie,
to succeed Richard von Weizsacker as president. Yet the candidate he has in
mind is currently enjoying a miserable 5 per cent popularity rating in
national opinion polls, while the candidate he least desires is scoring 55
per cent.
The favoured contender of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party is Steffen
Heitmann, 49-year-old justice minister of Saxony.
Before reunification Heitmann had been active in the Lutheran Church, a
focal point for opposition to the communist regime. He is something of a
traditionalist, preaching the virtues of nationhood, security and the need
for German womanhood to spend more time at home. Despite such credentials,
Heitmann has not yet been folded fully into the bosom of the CDU.
But having struggled to get Heitmann accepted in the first place, the CDU's
movers and shakers in Saxony are determined to see it through.
Nevertheless, Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, is still
the runner most favoured by the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the
governing coalition.
Genscher has said no many times; but then so did Mae West.
Genscher has distinct advantages. He is easily the public's favourite; he
can also boast Ossie credentials - he was born in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. His
only handicap, it appears, is that Kohl would not wish to see his former
rival bask in such limelight.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Clean-up prior to going on sale: The urgent need for reform
of central Europe's banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than three years the bankers of post-communist central Europe have
been waiting in vain for economic growth to solve the problems of
loss-making state enterprises.
But growth has proved elusive. Ironically, this is partly because the banks,
ill-equipped to assess risk and weighed down by large levels of bad debt
inherited from the communist past, have been unable to respond flexibly and
imaginatively to the needs of a rapidly expanding private sector.
Now, as Poland and the fast-track economic reformers of central Europe stand
poised for a resumption of growth, a radical overhaul of the banking sector,
including privatisation of state-owned commercial banks, has become a high
priority for governments, central banks and western lending institutions.
The need for urgent modernisation was highlighted in a recent report by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a joint study by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund into the specific ailments of
the Hungarian banking system (see below).
EBRD officials estimate that bad debts represent some 60 per cent of the
balance sheet of the largest east European banks, adding that
recapitalisation and the introduction of competition, ideally through
privatisation, was now urgently needed.
Throughout the region, singling out the main bad debtors has become the
first stage in tackling the wider problems of undercapitalised, debt-laden
banks. The second, more expensive stage of recapitalisation requires
privatisation and funds from both tightly stretched national budgets and
international institutions.
It is in Poland, where the dangers of an unregulated banking system were
graphically illustrated three years ago by the failure of the ART-B bank
with an estimated loss of Dollars 500m, that the privatisation process is
most advanced.
It began four months ago with the sale of Wielkopolski Bank Kreditowy, the
first of nine state-owned commercial banks to be privatised in the region;
the EBRD is a principal shareholder. Last month the government announced
that 60 per cent of Bank Slanski, the leading bank in the industrialised
Silesian province, would be auctioned to private foreign and domestic
investors shortly. Seven other state-owned regional banks, all hived off
from the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, four years ago, are also
earmarked for sale.
While the Poles have taken the lead on reform, the Czechs have taken a
different approach which involves, first, the partial removal of bad debt
from the books of banks awaiting privatisation. The Czech government has set
up a special institution, the Konsolidacni Banka (Consolidation Bank), to
tackle inter-enterprise debt. This has accumulated as factory managers have
bypassed the banks by supplying each other with goods and services that they
have not paid for.
An idea of the compulsive limits that this process can reach was revealed in
a recent report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank. The
study noted that mutual default on payments between enterprises grew 82-fold
in Russia over the first half of last year and had become the main source of
financing economic activity in that country.
Central Europe does not have a problem on the Russian scale. But in 1991 a
third of the total Kcs250bn debt portfolio of Komercni Bank, the largest
Czech state-owned commercial bank, was transferred to the Konsolidacni
Banka, which acts in effect as a state-financed 'dustbin' for non-performing
loans.
A different approach is being attempted by the former Yugoslav republic of
Slovenia, which has issued 30-year government-guaranteed bonds worth
DM3.5bn. The bonds will be swapped for specific portions of the bad debt
held by Ljubljanska Bank and other state-owned commercial banks.
Across eastern Europe, refinancing inherited bad debts and 'cleaning'
balance sheets is being undertaken as a prelude to privatisation. It is
accompanied by an explosion of spending on training and new equipment and a
big effort to strengthen the supervisory functions of the central banks. The
Czech banks alone have created 50,000 jobs in the past three years.
In some cases, as in newly independent Slovakia and Slovenia, central banks
have had to be created. Elsewhere, existing central banks, which used to
deal with virtually all banking business in the centralised communist
system, have been remodelled on western lines and told by their governments
to concentrate on banking supervision. Governments have also introduced
banking laws covering bankruptcy and related issues, to bring financial
markets legislation into line with the European Community.
To attract much-needed expertise as well as fresh capital, western banks are
being encouraged to set up local branches or take stakes in the new
state-owned commercial banks (hived off from central banks) and the small,
under-capitalised local private banks.
Many of the smaller private banks were set up in the lawless early days of
post-communist euphoria by private entrepreneurs or enterprising state
factory managers to raise capital for their own needs. Some have already
folded and most face rapid demise unless they receive injections of capital
and knowhow. Some, like Poland's ART-B, have been closed after the belated
discovery of large-scale fraud and embezzlement.
The introduction of western-style laws, with their demands for greater
financial transparency and minimum reserve requirements, has exposed the
fragile condition of many of the region's banks. The loan books of
state-owned commercial banks are full of what were once regarded as the
jewels of socialist industry. But most of these so-called jewels, especially
the privileged defence plants, were found to be severely tarnished with
non-performing loans granted under political, rather than economic,
priorities.
'Now the state-owned banks are caught in a trap,' said Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, a
former governor of the Hungarian central bank, who runs Central-European
International Bank, the oldest, largest and most profitable of the private
joint-venture banks set up with Hungarian and foreign capital.
'Bad loans mean higher provisions. These require higher profits, which in
turn require the state-owned banks to seek higher spreads (between borrowing
costs and lending rates) and higher fees. In this way the banks gradually
lose their best clients or weaken the performance of those which remain,' he
said.
The handicaps borne by the new state-owned banks have placed them at a big
disadvantage as they try to confront competition from banks such as CIB and
other joint-venture banks, formed with foreign partners or with the local
branches of wholly owned overseas banks. Unencumbered by inherited debt
burdens, the banks with foreign links have lured away many of the
state-owned commercial banks' best customers, including the multinational
corporations and other foreign investors who have poured more than Dollars
9bn into central Europe over the past three years. For instance, CIB has
grabbed some General Electric business from Magyar Hitel bank, Hungary's
largest commercial bank.
Experienced and globally well-connected, the foreign banks have also been
able to pick up a growing share of profitable niche services, such as
foreign trade finance. But the specialised state-owned foreign trade banks,
such as Bank Handlowy in Poland or Hungary's Kulkereskedelmi Bank, which in
the communist era enjoyed a near monopoly of trade finance, have managed to
hold on to a large share of this business despite the inroads by new
players.
As the World Bank, the EBRD, and governments throughout the region prepare
to invest heavily in an effort to clear the decks for what they hope will be
profitable lending in the future, many of the region's most experienced
private sector bankers, like Mr Suranyi, argue that the need for further
capital injections will persist until the privatisation process is complete.
But central European governments cannot afford repeated bail-outs while
committed to tight IMF-imposed budget constraints and a host of competing
claims on their slender resources. Ultimately, their lack of cash will prove
the most powerful force behind the drive to modernise and privatise the
banking system.
From then on, it will be up to the managers and shareholders of banks to
shoulder the responsibility for making lending decisions on a purely
commercial basis - and to pay the price if they fail.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Multi-media merger mania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTI-MEDIA, convergence, communicopia. Talk to top executives at telephone
utilities, entertainment groups or computer companies these days and you are
likely to hear such buzzwords. Hardly a week passes without a new alliance,
project or merger being announced with the aim of positioning the
participants for the coming world of multi-media.
This week Viacom, the US-based cable television group, bid Dollars 8.2bn for
Paramount Communications, the film production and publishing company, while
news leaked out that British Telecommunications is pressing ahead with
proposals to provide a national video-on-demand service via its telephone
lines. Earlier in the year, telecommunications group US West agreed to
invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner's cable and entertainment operations -
which were in turn formed as part of a Dollars 11.6bn merger in 1989.
The essential hypothesis underlying all the buzz about multi-media is that
technologies in the computer, telecommunications, consumer electronics,
entertainment and publishing industries are converging. The time is rapidly
approaching, the theory goes, when homes will sport smart terminals -
something of a cross between televisions and computers - linked into
advanced communications networks. Over those, they will get access to
services such as video-on-demand, interactive computer games, picture
telephones and home shopping, as well as ordinary TV and telephone services.
Over-impressed
Heard it all before? Sceptics with long memories may well suspect they are
being bamboozled with techno-hype. Enthusiasm for convergence between
telecommunications and computing in the early 1980s led to a wave of
unsuccessful mergers such as that between computer giant IBM and Rolm, the
switchboard manufacturer. Strategists were over-impressed by technological
convergence. But it was difficult in practice to devise 'killer products'
that appealed to consumers or to manage companies with different cultures.
A second version of the convergence hypothesis, popular in the late 1980s,
was that consumer electronics manufacturers and entertainment groups should
combine forces. This led to Japan's Sony acquiring Hollywood's Columbia
studios and CBS records, while rival Matsushita took over MCA. There never
seemed much logic in the idea that makers of video recorders should tie up
with film producers - it is not as though they could provide them with
better distribution channels. But the deals have not been failures, since
the Japanese parent have largely left their software arms to run themselves.
Main focus
The current enthusiasm for multi-media convergence is rather different. The
main focus is on entertainment distribution. This in turn comes in two
versions: vertical integration between entertainment groups and distribution
networks; and convergence in telecommunications and entertainment
distribution channels.
In the first category comes the proposed tie-up between Viacom and
Paramount. This may make business sense in that it will give Viacom's cable
networks ready access to a critical mass of films and TV programmes, while
securing outlets for Paramount's products. But vertical integration will, at
best, provide only a partial way forward. Entertainment companies need
global distribution - something no single cable network will come close to
delivering - while no network will appeal to consumers by distributing a
single company's products.
In the second category comes BT's planned move into videos. The industrial
logic here is compelling. There is sense both in telephone utilities
carrying entertainment over their networks and in cable companies providing
telephone services over theirs. Sadly, in most countries, such convergence
is stopped by regulation.
The reason for feeling more confident about the current convergence wave
compared with previous ones is that it is driven less by techno-hype and
more by a popular application - entertainment. Restructuring entertainment
distribution does not, of course, amount to full-scale multi-media
convergence. But it may prepare the way for such a future.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Local attraction of pacts Britannica: Liberal Democrats are
gaining influence through alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commander 'Chipps' Selby Bennett bears a heavy burden. In the Dorset council
seat of Lytchett tomorrow, it falls to him to strike the first blow in a
putative Conservative fightback against the Liberal Democrat hordes sweeping
southern England.
Chipps, a Conservative councillor for four years, will carry the tattered
Tory flag in a by-election ordered by the High Court following an
investigation into an unstamped ballot paper cast in the county council
elections in May.
But as he marches towards the Liberal Democrat gunfire, Chipps sounds like a
reluctant champion, mainly because the by-election campaign, which ought to
be about local issues, has focused instead on complaints about the
government.
In the wake of the Christchurch by-election in July, in which the Liberal
Democrats overturned a Conservative majority of more than 23,000, it was
never going to be easy. But Chipps has had his work cut out to fend off the
anger of local people about national issues such as water charges and the
extension of value added tax to heating fuel.
'When they protest, I say: 'Join the club, you are not nearly as fed up as I
am,' ' he says wearily. Describing himself as an 'independent-minded chap',
he adds: 'It is not a very clever government.'
Sentiments like that will be shouted from the rooftops of Torquay next week
when the Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference. After decades
in the parliamentary wilderness, the party is inherently prone to
over-optimism. But this year, the delegates will be able to celebrate the
achievement of real power, albeit at a local level.
Almost unnoticed in Westminster, third-party candidates have been gaining
ground in local elections for two decades. In 1978, the Liberal party held
800 council seats across the country. After gains in 12 of the last 15
years, its Liberal Democrat successor now holds 4,250.
The real breakthrough came in May's county council elections, when an
anti-government landslide left the Conservative party in control of just one
county - Buckinghamshire - in the south of England.
Even Conservatives are admitting publicly that the Liberal Democrats'
increasingly professional and well-organised approach has made them a real
threat to the Conservatives, especially in the party's southern heartlands.
'There is a new Liberal Democrat establishment being built up,' says Mr Tony
Speller, the former Conservative MP for North Devon, who lost his seat to a
Liberal Democrat at the last general election.
'Many of the people who are serving as Liberal Democrat councillors would
have been Conservatives 10 years ago, and they are running things perfectly
well. There is very little of the brown bread and sandals nonsense you used
to get from the Liberals.'
It was this realisation that sent Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, scurrying to the south-west earlier this month to assess the
damage. Pointedly, Mr John Major, the prime minister, trod much the same
ground in the first of his morale-boosting forays into the regions last
week.
With the prime minister's backing, Sir Norman delivered a strong warning to
last week's cabinet meeting about the urgent need to halt the Liberal
Democrat bandwagon. As of now, he told the cabinet, the Liberal Democrats
are the number one political target.
To the Liberal Democrats, that kind of talk smacks of King Canute ordering
the waves to retreat. Mr David Fox, the party's western region co-ordinator,
acknowledges that it benefited in May from a protest vote, but argues that
people were also responding to the party's long-standing local campaigning.
'We didn't just get elected as a protest but as a result of two years of
planning and of consistent campaigning,' he says. As proof, he claims that
membership growth has accelerated since the election.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, goes further. 'It is quite clear that
the Conservatives are running scared in the south-west, and well they might
be, since they are now the third party in many places,' he says.
'It is very sensible of them to perceive that we are the major challengers
in the south of England, but it will not do them any good. We know there is
no room for complacency on our part, but we will just go on campaigning with
good, solid common-sense policies, and the Conservatives have no idea how to
combat that.'
There is some evidence that this jibe is correct. Local Conservative
activists who heard Mr Major speak in the south-west last week say he
appeared more comfortable attacking Labour than spelling out how the party
would respond to the Liberal Democrat threat.
However, events since May have shown that the Conservatives are not alone in
their confusion. The Tories' losses in the county council elections left all
the parties in un-charted territory but the Liberal Democrats can claim to
have a clearer strategy.
Put simply, their aim is to grab whatever share of power they can, wherever
they can, on whatever terms. The rationale is that the party's best hope of
long-term gain is to build up a record in local government administration.
That, the strategists believe, will undermine the 'untried' label often hung
on the party by the Conservatives, and help to establish a cadre of good
parliamentary candidates.
As a result of May's elections, the Liberal Democrats find themselves
playing a role in administering almost all the 22 southern counties,
sometimes depending on Labour support, as in Berkshire, East Sussex and
Hereford/Worcester; sometimes supporting the Conservatives, as in
Hertfordshire; or backing Labour, as in Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Norfolk.
In some, such as Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire, all three
parties share control; and in others, such as Avon, Essex, Kent and
Hampshire, the Liberal Democrats and Labour have established unannounced
alliances.
Most of these arrangements are informal, and all have been negotiated
locally, sometimes without the participation of national party officials.
Some, as in Berkshire and East Sussex, are operated under 'conventions'
which regulate relationships between the parties.
Others are fiercely disputed. In Wiltshire, for example, the Liberal
Democrats claim they have been excluded by an 'unholy alliance' of the
Labour and Conservative groups. Both major parties deny the charge.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats fight shy of characterising any of
these loose agreements as 'pacts'. None involves an agreed policy programme,
and in many, alliances sometimes shift as issues change.
In Wiltshire the Tories and Labour combined to vote through an operational
arrangement (in which the chairperson is elected at each meeting and has no
casting vote) but the Liberals and Labour combined to reverse Conservative
spending cuts on secondary schools, aid for voluntary organisations and a
disabled workshop.
Mr Ashdown and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, have ruled out any
extension of the county council arrangements to parliamentary or European
parliament seats.
Nevertheless, the Conservative party's inability to rely on the loyalty of
its heartland is a serious blow to the government. The Tories will have to
reverse this state of affairs to have any real hope of winning the next
general election. Much is riding on Commander Selby Bennett's shoulders.

<TEXT>
Sir, How sad that brokers (S G Warburg excepted) did not receive until early
on the morning of Monday September 6 a copy of a letter to Thorn EMI's
shareholders from the company's chairman ('Surprise at Thorn disclosure',
September 7). They should count themselves lucky to have had access to a
copy available for inspection in the Stock Exchange on that day.
That letter, which has been largely responsible for a fall in the share
price, was allegedly posted on Friday September 3. By second class post. The
copy to a shareholder in this house arrived on September 9 with no postmark.
As far as the shareholder is concerned, until accounts of the matter were
available in newspapers on Tuesday, everybody else was indulging in insider
dealing.
The matter does warrant some sort of inquiry, and afterwards, some action.
Cynical shareholders will laugh up their sleeves at the thought of
uninformed brokers, while simultaneously demanding that individual
shareholders, as members of the company, deserve better than a second-class
letter that takes nearly a week to arrive.

<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Jackson missed the point about consumer electronics. Television
sets are not like cars or cornflakes or dishwashers. They don't do anything.
People are not bored with television sets; they are bored with the
programmes that come through them.
Nobody will spend hundreds of pounds on brilliantly clear, high-definition
TV sets that show the same old rubbish. They will spend only if the
brilliant new pictures offer brilliant new fun; new sorts of services;
shopping and banking; takeaway menus; two-way conversations; access to
airlines, medical help and advice. Red hot news and wonderful information,
amazing new shows.
I'd spend Pounds 1,000 on a new telly for all that.
Sony seems to be the only one to understand. It has invested in Hollywood.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTYN THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his analysis of the consumer electronics industry ('How to stand out
in a crowd', September 10), Tony Jackson does not mention the implications
of the growing role of software. The figures are startling: a top-line
television may contain 500,000 bytes (500kB) of software, and this may grow
to one million in the next three or four years. A vacuum cleaner currently
contains some 8kB - even an electric shaver contains some 4kB.
This software exists to add features and reduce costs, which makes it
central to competitiveness. If it contains errors, it may force a product
recall. The software is complex, and therefore difficult to get right in
every detail, yet some companies still do not treat software development as
a task requiring disciplined engineering management, mathematically sound
design methods, and specialised quality assurance.
The growth in the role of software has taken some managements by surprise.
In working with companies in the UK and overseas, we often find that
software engineering issues are not getting the management attention that
they need, with consequent risk to product development time scales and
budgets.
Software engineering is a hugely important profession. It is far from
mature, but modern engineering methods are reducing development costs and
risks. In the future battle for growth and survival in consumer electronics,
software competence may well play a grater part than 256M D-Ram chips.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Abbey's move into derivatives is
entirely logical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW STOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article on Abbey National ('Curious case of the Abbey's habits',
September 9), John Gapper expresses some surprise at the 'odd' behaviour of
Abbey at establishing a joint venture on derivatives products. This is not
untypical of commentators who have not yet grasped the fact that derivatives
are no longer the exclusive preserve of the large institutional customer but
have now become an integral part of the financial system.
Evidence of this is all around us, in the form of fixed-rate and capped
mortgages, unit trusts guaranteeing a minimum return, certificates of
deposit linked to the FT-SE index, to name a few products that are
manufactured and managed using derivatives. It is therefore entirely logical
that Abbey, as one of the UK's largest financial institutions, develops this
capability.
The argument that such a venture may have an adverse impact on shareholder
returns is also spurious. The experience of other banks suggests that this
activity, if managed well, can provide superior returns on capital.
The surprise, if there is one, is that Abbey should have waited so long to
develop this capability.

Sir, Just a small footnote to Julian Ozanne's article (''We're making

if one hails from Basildon and works for Barclays Bank one is a foreign
exchange (or Forex) dealer. However, if one does the same job, on perhaps a
smaller scale, in East Jerusalem one is a money changer. I do not think that
someone performing the same task in South Kensington or Oxford Street would
merit that quaint appellation. Spare us the vague Biblical references and
bogus Orientalism. That way, everyone may understand each other better,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY CLEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Christopher McCoy (Letters, September 10) commits the same error in
logic as Lord Lawson ('A paean of praise to capitalism', September 4/5).
That market societies have outlived centrally planned ones in Europe is
self-evident. But we should not let this blind us to the workings of our
economic system and trumpet its alleged moral superiority from the base of a
false premise.
I have argued that dynamic, economically efficient market societies are not
built on stable families but in fact cause their break-up. There is plenty
of evidence for that in North America and western Europe. To warn that free
markets undervalue long-term social relationships is not to recommend we
embrace the opposite, outdated extreme of socialism.
There is a wealth of mixed options between laisser-faire and central command
 -I would hope that we can evolve a mix that prizes and preserves cherished
social institutions.

FT  15 SEP 93 / It's better late . . .: Palestinian rejectionism was usually
justified, but always wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most powerful myths of antiquity is that of the Cumaean Sibyl.
She offered her nine books of prophecies to Tarquin the Proud, the last
(legendary) king of Rome. When he refused them, she burned three and offered
him the remaining six at the same price. Again he refused, so she burned
three more and offered him the remaining three still at the same price. This
time he bought them.
Why did Tarquin refuse the first and second bargains offered? Obviously
because the price asked was outrageous. Why did he accept the third one,
which was clearly even more outrageous? Because he realised that next time
there would be no books left to buy.
The Palestinians have been made a series of outrageous offers since 1917,
when the British government first took it upon itself to designate their
homeland as 'a national home for the Jewish people'. Each offer has been,
from their point of view, more outrageous than the last.
In 1923, for instance, they boycotted elections for a legislative council,
because Jewish delegates (then representing a small minority of the
population) were to have the casting vote whenever British government
appointees disagreed with the elected Arab members. It made sense to reject
this, since it would enable the UK to push through its 'national home'
policy, disregarding the wishes of the majority. But, with hindsight, if
they had accepted, the Arabs would surely have been better placed to resist
or at least limit that policy.
A much more famous rejection was that of the 1947 UN partition resolution,
dividing Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state, with Jerusalem as a
corpus separatum under UN control. The Arabs looked at the map and found
that even within the proposed Jewish state they would be (narrowly) the
majority. Like today's Bosnians, they saw no reason why 'the international
community' should impose on them a partition of their country on ethnic
lines. They fought to prevent it, arguing for a single democratic state in
which all citizens would be equal and all religions respected.
Like today's Bosnians, they were defeated, and many were driven from their
homes, taking refuge in neighbouring countries or in the two bits of
Palestine that remained under Arab rule: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Those two bits taken together were much smaller than the Arab state the UN
had proposed; and when the fighting stopped, in 1949, the Palestinians found
they no longer had the option of returning to their homes, even to live
under Israeli rule.
In 1965 President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, speaking in a Palestinian
refugee camp in Jericho, suggested that the time had come for the Arabs to
accept the 1947 partition. Palestinians indignantly rejected such defeatism,
knowing well that by then there was in any case no chance of Israel
withdrawing voluntarily to the frontiers the UN had proposed. They stuck to
the view that Israel was an illegitimate state, built on land stolen from
them. The rest of the Arab world supported them, at least verbally, and the
result was another war (in 1967) in which Israel overran the West Bank and
Gaza as well as parts of Egypt and Syria.
Moshe Dayan, Israel's defence minister at the time, suggested to
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza that they should set up their own
state there. They rejected the idea, while in Khartoum the Arab leaders
promulgated their three 'no's': no peace, no recognition, no negotiation.
Meanwhile Israel annexed east Jerusalem and began to plant settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza.
By 1973, when the next Arab-Israeli war broke out, the main Arab states had
accepted UN resolution 242, which they interpreted as meaning that Israel
should be left in peace if it withdrew to the 1949 armistice lines. The
Palestinians, now represented by the PLO, began to hint that, if their arms
were twisted, they might after all accept the offer General Dayan had made
in 1967. Said Hammami, then the PLO representative in London, was the most
explicit about this: he advocated mutual recognition and peaceful
co-existence between Israel and a Palestinian state.
But of course Dayan's offer was no longer on the table. At most, Israel was
willing to hand over part of the territory to Jordan.
And then, in 1977, Menachem Begin came to power, pledged not to give up any
part of 'the Land of Israel'. At Camp David in 1978 the presidents of Egypt
and the US persuaded Begin, with great difficulty, to agree to an interim
solution, giving the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza autonomy for five
years and leaving the ultimate solution to be negotiated later. The
Palestinians rejected this, pointing out (correctly) that it committed
Israel neither to withdrawal nor to acceptance of a Palestinian state.
In 1993 Israel is offering to allow a 'Palestinian entity', which in the
first instance will control only Gaza and a small area around Jericho. The
price is still the same: recognition of Israel, acceptance of its right to
live in peace, cessation of all armed struggle or terrorism against it. But
Yassir Arafat, like Tarquin, has decided to pay.
Many Palestinians think he is a fool or even a traitor, to accept so little
after struggling so long. He may well suffer the fate of Said Hammami,
murdered in 1978 by a Palestinian extremist in the pay of Saddam Hussein.
But he is surely right to realise, however belatedly, that mutual
recognition and peaceful coexistence are a commodity worth paying for, even
through the nose.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: Hair is wearing thin - First night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the dying of the age of Aquarius. Sad to say, the old 1968 musical
has failed the test of time. The revival of Hair at the Old Vic is a doleful
occasion.
True, not everyone will be entirely surprised. There were those of us who
did not think too highly of it in the first place.
This is the first time that I have seen it in England. At least in Germany
at the end of the 1960s it seemed to catch a mood in a country that was just
waking up. There had been student protests all over Europe. Vietnam was a
potent word. In London there was the end of censorship: nudity on stage and
more four letter words.
All that now looks old hat. The hippies have aged. Nudity is a commonplace,
swearing is a substitute for thought even the politics looks thin. The best
that Hair can do for a swipe at John Kennedy is to have the president
crossing the stage saying 'ask not what you can do for your country, but
what Marilyn can do for you.'
The production appears to think that it is shocking to use the word
'nigger'; actually it is (out of context), but today an audience is simply
embarrassed. There is also a remarkably anachronistic view of Lyndon Johnson
suppressing the blacks. References to earlier American history look puerile.
None of that might matter if the rest of the show stood up. It does not. The
nearest Hair comes to a joke is a girl saying 'why don't you call me?' to be
met with 'because you don't have a telephone.' The plot doesn't stand up
either because there isn't one.
So what? you might say. It's a musical, not a drama. Well, listen to the
songs and will find that they are not what you remember. The best remain the
opening 'Aquarius' and the concluding 'Let the Sun Shine In', but between
them nothing has dawned.
Who now cares a hoot for the song called 'Manchester, England'? The truth is
that Hair seemed a strong musical at the time because of the general mood.
Even the apparently innocent worship of drugs has now faded, let alone the
homage to indiscriminate sex. Too many people have died in the meantime.
What appears not to have died is the admiration for the hippies. Otherwise
there can be no conceivable reason for an expensive revival. Yet even there
I am not so sure. This was a first night audience, usually primed to applaud
every word, every song.
The Old Vic audience was often uncannily quiet. The moment when a woman
mounts the stage from the auditorium failed to come off; her male partner is
even more of a misfit.
Meanwhile, the hippies mooch around and occasionally dance. They worship the
sun, they worship the moon and they look like pixies at Stonehenge. What a
conservative, conformist, primitive, tribal lot they were] Even when they
undress they do it in unison.
Michael Bogdanov directs. All that one can say is that it was an interesting
experiment to try a revival. This production proves beyond doubt that not
everything in the 1960s is worth going back to, except as a curiosity. The
mood now is one of not being quite sure where to look. It was really an
extraordinary idea that people could be held together merely by having long
hair. The fashion has changed. Time to bring back Guys and Dolls.

Are we ready for 'the dark heart of the glory that was Rome'? It is offered
by BBC2's history series Timewatch which returns with an account of
activities in the Colosseum at the time of Julius Caesar. It seems these
included tightrope walking elephants, Christians used as human torches, and
women fighting gladiator dwarfs (8.00).
The Radio 4 series In Business reports on 'Europe Unchained'. It is a year
since the pound left the ERM, and in July the mechanism virtually broke
down. The question is: 'Can the rest of Europe imitate Britain and turn
monetary disaster into economic recovery?' Is that what we are experiencing?
Switch to Radio 3 and you will catch almost the whole of its programme on
the semi-finals in the Leeds International Piano Competition.
Inside Story (9.30 BBC1) tells how Battersea Park School, is being turned
into Battersea Technical College with Pounds 2.5m worth of science and
computer labs and a 'technology aptitude test'. Some condemn this but
parents respect a school where you have to pass a test to get in and already
applications outnumber places.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The documentary is not dead - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television's autumn season is bringing with it a veritable catalogue of new
factual series which, at first glance, may seem to give the lie to those of
us who predicted that Britain's new rules for television would produce a
fiercer ratings war than ever and a slide in quality. Over a period of some
years it has been argued in this column that the disastrous Tory legislation
on commercial broadcasting combined with an attitude of impatience bordering
on contempt towards the BBC, and the demand that all broadcasting become
more market oriented, would rob us of some, or even all, of the small
percentage of programmes which could be described as truly outstanding.
Such misgivings have been ridiculed by some within the industry who felt
that new brooms were needed to rid British broadcasting of what they saw as
its cosiness and snootiness and that more attention should be paid to the
ratings and less to the preferences of the chairman's wife. The effects of
such attitudes upon drama within commercial television are already becoming
clear. Not only does it now seem improbable that ITV will ever again produce
series such as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In The Crown but, more
ominously, those running ITV no longer aspire to such heights nor see any
point in doing so. The pinnacle of their ambition today is represented by
Frank Stubbs Promotes, a good, workmanlike series, pleasant enough to watch
but quickly forgettable - the Saumur of television drama. It seems that no
one in ITV is interested any longer in producing Champagne, let alone Krug.
Such ideas would be seen today as laughably elitist.
When I presented the final edition of This Week and wondered whether we
would see its like again, scoffing and head patting was the reaction from
some of ITV's new mandarins. What made me think, they asked, that the
programme replacing This Week would not be as good or even better? Why did I
not wait and see? On Thursday, having waited, we saw the first edition of
The Big Story which, we are assured, will be giving 'in-depth insight' into
'the week's top story'. And what did ITV consider last week's top story: the
Arab/Israeli peace plan? Bosnia? No. The most important question of ITV's
week was: Is Wacko Jacko a pervert, the very question that was obsessing the
tabloid newspapers. During the programme the presenter talked on the phone
to Michael Jackson's sister's agent. 'I mean the problem, to be serious on
this Dennis, is that we don't pay for interviews', he said. 'We're a current
affairs programme looking at this in a kind of serious fashion - ' at which
point the producer, who clearly had a sense of humour, inserted the noise of
a camera shutter and banged up a picture of Jackson's sister from her
Playboy photo spread.
Viewpoint, which has brought us such memorable documentaries as Adrian
Cowell's Decade Of Destruction from the Amazon jungle and Antony Thomas's
recent excellent expose of the 'Satanic abuse' industry, is about to follow
This Week down the ITV drain, as is First Tuesday. In their place ITV's new
central programme commissioners will give us The ITV Documentary, with
programmes from a wide variety of sources. It is hard to see how this ad hoc
system can possibly replace the protective enclave which Central Television
(and ATV before it) provided for some of Britain's best documentary makers
who received support, sometimes for years, as they brought Viewpoint
programmes to fruition. However, again we are told not to be so pessimistic,
to 'wait and see'. We cannot do anything else, of course.
What we are already seeing in the autumn season is that a lot of the more
interesting material is coming from the BBC. Inside Story on BBC1 began a
new series with a programme about prostitutes and pimps which looked at
first as though it might be in pretty much the same tabloid category as the
Wacko Jacko piece. But it turned out to be a grim revelation of the
desperate circumstances of many young (and no doubt not so young) girls who
are forced by blackmail, violence and, ironically, the need for a show of
affection, to work the streets and then hand over virtually all the money
they earn to some parasitical man.
Another BBC1 production, The Skipper, offers a six-part series on a subject
which lies at the heart of the British documentary tradition: fishermen.
Since we had such purist works as Deckie Learner and A Life Apart from Mike
Grigsby in the 1960s, and the first British documentary, Drifters, from John
Grierson, no less, in 1929 (a silent, and the only documentary that the
father of the genre ever actually directed on his own) it takes a certain
amount of chutzpa to launch into the subject again now. However, producer
Jeremy Mills has found one of those television naturals, not entirely unlike
steeplejack Fred Dibnah, in Cornish skipper Roger Nowell. He admits to lying
to his own brother if he finds a good shoal, and it seems clear that the
billing does not refer to him as a 'buccaneer' for nothing. This looks like
being not just an informative series, but entertaining.
Unfortunately the same can probably be said about Kenneth Baker's Memoirs
which began on BBC2 on Saturday. It is all very well to have Kenneth Clarke,
Chris Patten, Malcolm Rifkind and other old political chums (and
occasionally foes, as with Ken Livingstone) reminiscing about the days when
headmistress Maggie terrorised the corridors of power. However, we might
have hoped for something a little more informative than a lot of sniggering
and 'Do you remember how she used to . . .' exchanges.
The two most interesting new series are both concerned with movies and movie
makers: BBC2's Hollywood UK and Channel 4's DW Griffith: Father Of Film. In
both cases the fascination lies less in the process of film making and more
in the social implications, though in the case of Griffith one might wish
otherwise. Since it really is true, for once, to say that this was a man
whose work was seminally important, it would be interesting to have heard
from Kevin Brownlow and David Gill (the world's greatest champions of silent
cinema, here working as documentary producers) much more about precisely how
Griffith achieved some of his technical effects; after all, he was virtually
inventing them. Instead too much time has been devoted to his racism, which
nobody should deny, but which is about as important as, say, the slavery
practised by the 'democrats' of ancient Greece.
Birth Of A Nation is, unmistakeably, a racist movie, but does anybody
suppose for one moment that if Channel 4 was to screen a 1915 film about
tribal conflict in Africa or murderous feuding between Indian castes that it
would feel it necessary to wheel out a polytechnic lecturer at the start to
tell us what to think? That is what it did last week before their screening
of the superb Brownlow-Gill restored Birth Of A Nation.
As for Hollywood UK, its exploration of the moods and mores of the swinging
sixties is peculiarly compelling, partly because it all feels such an
amazingly long time ago. There are, of course, the films themselves - when
we talk about the English cinema boom of that period it is easy to forget
that it included not just Room At The Top and A Taste Of Honey but also the
Bond movies and works such as The Charge Off The Light Brigade. This series,
produced by Charles Chabot and Rosemary Wilton, goes into all that, but,
even more tellingly, it finds out from Richard Harris and Julie Christie,
Lindsay Anderson and Frederic Raphael, how they felt at the time and how
they feel now about that extraordinary outburst of creativity.
It is an excellent series, and no doubt there will be others this season.
Perhaps it is silly to object if it begins to appear that the BBC really
might one day dominate the high ground of broadcasting, as it has so often
asserted that it should, while ITV sticks more and more firmly to the
dictates of the market place. The trouble is, surely, that so far there has
been only the very beginnings of a much greater shift: we ain't seen nuthin
yet.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The James Moody Quartet - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something has happened to saxophonist James Moody, in residence at Ronnie
Scott's club all this week. Late in a long career the 68-year-old American
seems to have found a more acerbic edge to his sound and a less predictable
technique with both alto and tenor.
The quartet is the regular one: the sometimes detached sounding Marc Copland
at the piano; the appropriately named Todd Coolman on upright bass and Billy
Drummond in the traps. Out front Moody, hamming up the vocals in a quavering
falsetto, is clearly relishing the limelight. Having spent the summer on the
road with Lionel Hampton as one of his Golden Men (alongside trumpeter Clark
Terry and trombonist Al Grey), he is digging hard now into the quartet's
book of bluesy standards and pianist Copland's originals.
A tough reading of 'Birk's Works', a blast from the leader's past with Dizzy
Gillespie, follows a twisting blues original 'Mutt and Jeff', solos taken by
rote. The ballad 'I Can't Get Started' begins with some arty alto squealing,
where Moody seems to be only half joking about his new found interest in
harmolodics, eventually easing into more familiar territory. Pianist
Copland, an apparently cerebral character, picks up Moody's line
tentatively, the dislocated rhythm of the left hand driving a careful right.
Like Coolman, who might shorten the length of his quiet solos, Copland
struggles to be heard at times.
Moody is the focus of course and the comical, shouted stream of banter with
the audience, probably picked up during his sojourn with Las Vegas showbands
in the 1970s, silences the rowdiest table.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The Lowbury Piano Trio - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was the first time I have visited the Wigmore Hall since it has been so
delightfully renovated and expanded and I was gratified to note the
acoustical advantage that the hall still wonderfully lends to chamber
musicians. The Haydn E major trio (H. 28) with which the Lowburys opened
their programme came across with a clarity that was forceful without being
harmfully analytical.
This bold and concise three-movement late work of Haydn's went off
bustlingly well. The classical preamble was apt for the new (to London) trio
for the same instruments (piano, violin and cello) by Robert Simpson which
followed. Completed in 1989, this ambitious and lengthy (36 minutes), work
in four continuous movements is absolutely characteristic of its composer in
its determined attempt to re-inhabit classical form and re-invent classical
rhetoric. Nobody alive today pursues such aims with such gusto; and one
could not but be struck by the note-working skill and unmisgiving
neo-classical assurance with which Simpson marshalls his motifs, weaves his
sinewy counterpoints, and pushes through his formal stereotype to the bitter
end.
The textures are predominantly spare, and the opening leggerio exchanges
suggested a genially conversational tone or perhaps a musical version of
thinking out loud. Gradually, though, one began to suspect that the composer
was really striving after a Shostakovich-like searing bleakness of utterance
but adherence to classical propriety held him back. Though the Vivace second
movement had appealing bursts of chordal punchiness from the pianist
(Elizabeth Burley), and the Adagio semplice some searchingly fraught
descants for the first violin (Pauline Lowbury), the Allegro finale was
decidedly diffuse, and the overall impression was colourless.
Simpson's harmonic idiom is that of a no-man's land between tonality and
atonality; and in his devotion to classical form he has quite missed out on
content. Ravel's great A minor trio, with an account of which (alas, all too
barnstorming) the concert ended, was a reminder of the primacy of content.
If the Simpson work seemed to have drained music to a hospital pallor, here
all the art-form's colour and life-blood came surging back.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: 'She Loves Me' tunes in again on Broadway - Karen
Fricker admires Scott Ellis's new production at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a musical theatre buff what his favourite show is and the odds are he
will murmur mistily She Loves Me. When it first opened on Broadway in 1963,
that musical, with a book by Joe Masteroff and music and lyrics by the
Fiddler on the Roof team of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, won critical
acclaim and boosted the emerging careers of its producer/director, Harold
Prince, and its star, Barbara Cook. She Loves Me has gone on to countless
regional, stock and college productions - but why has it taken so long to
return to Broadway, where it has just opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre
in a beguiling production directed by Scott Ellis, first seen at the smaller
Roundabout Theatre in June.
For the answer one only need look to She Loves Me's Broadway neighbours, the
glitz-laden mega-musicals that are making it big of late. A little musical
about the romantic entanglements of perfume shop clerks in 1930's Hungary
seems wholly out of style. It has taken the enterprising Ellis to show
Broadway what it has been missing, in a production filled with all the
humanity, integrity, and charm those mega-musicals lack.
Masteroff adapted She Loves Me from a play by Miklos Laszlo, which was also
made into a film, The Shop around the Corner with James Stewart and Margaret
Sullivan. It is an unabashedly simple story, as delicate as the psyches of
its sensitive heroes, the hardworking parfumerie manager Georg Nowack (Boyd
Gaines) and the assiduous new shopgirl Amalia Balash (Judy Kuhn, who played
the role at the Roundabout, has been replaced by by Diane Fratantoni), who
clash on the job by day and send each other love letters by night, realising
only as the story unfolds that each is the other's lonely hearts pen pal.
None of Bock and Harnick's songs, save Amalia's second- act falling-in-love
number 'Vanilla Ice Cream,' has become a standard; it is the way they are
woven into what is happening on stage that makes the show musically
remarkable. There are a few big musical numbers (staged with rousing
cleverness by Rob Marshall), but, more often, song flows into scene or scene
into song with an almost uncanny naturalness. One need only scan the list of
song titles - 'Good Morning, Good Day,' 'Sounds While Selling,' 'Where's My
Shoe?' - to know that this is a world in which even life's little banalities
prompt a song.
Ellis directs with a rare confidence and intelligence, with finely observed
relationships between the shop's employees. His only gaffe - and it is a
serious one - is that he neglects to paint the broader picture in which this
lovely cameo is set. Times were tough in 1930s Budapest, and jobs hard to
come by, but we are given little clue of the greyness that lurks outside the
golden glow of Maraczek's Parfumerie. Without this context the musical's
darker events - betrayals, selfishness, and even a suicide attempt - make
little sense.
Ellis' wisest step was his most basic: excellent casting. None of his
company are stars, yet, but all are good actors as well as singers. Gaines
is just the right blend of dorky and dashing as Georg, and Kuhn made a
loveably gawky Amalia, although her final costume, a dowdy purple number,
does overstate the point a bit; otherwise the costumes by David Charles and
David Greenwood are well-done. Sally Mayes' chirpy-tough portrait of Ilona,
Amalia's not-so-dumb-blond co-worker, is a delight. Howard McGillin is given
less to work with as the one-sided rogue Kodaly, but finesses the job with
mustache-twirling glee, and Lee Wilkof makes an odd character - the plodding
salesman Sipos - oddly likable. Only Louis Zorich as shop owner Maraczek and
Brad Kane as the messenger boy Arpad fall prey to caricature.
The timing is just right for the re-introduction of She Loves Me to
Broadway. Arriving just after the rabble of the Tony Awards - it is
officially the first production of the 1993-94 season - it seems at once
answer and antidote to its techno-driven neighbours, and its freshness is
going down a treat.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Answers in the wind - A look
at a new World Energy Council report on renewable energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
What will happen when the world's oil and gas supplies run out? The need to
find answers to this question has been frequently postponed in recent
decades as further resources of oil and gas have been discovered.
But reserves will finally start to run dry by the middle of the next
century, according to the World Energy Council, a non-governmental
organisation representing more than 100 countries. Coal and nuclear power
are the most 'readily available' alternatives, it concludes in its latest
worldwide projections*, published this month.
That answer will leave many dissatisfied. Coal is a prime source of carbon
dioxide, implicated in the threat of global warming, environmentalists and
governments agreed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. There is
also mistrust of nuclear power among many people in industrialised
countries, while governments are increasingly wary of the expense of
building and then scrapping nuclear plants.
To solve the conundrum, parts of the 'green' movement have rested hope on
the potential of 'renewable energy' - wind, solar, wave power and the like.
But the issue has divided environmentalists - many object to the appearance
of these new energy forms and their impact on wildlife.
How seriously should the potential of 'renewables' be taken?
A new 320-page report by the World Energy Council sets out to answer that
question. It marks the council's first systematic attempt to bring
renewables into its models, and is the result of four years' work by a
specially formed committee.
Although the report's conclusions are incorporated into the council's
worldwide projections, the committee makes clear that its views do not
always coincide with the council's. The committee chides the WEC for having
given renewables 'secondary status as minor contributors to the overall
energy picture', and it adopts throughout a campaigning tone which will be
unfamiliar to regular WEC readers.
The committee's main conclusion is that the proportion of world energy
consumption supplied by renewables, currently 2 per cent, could double to 4
per cent by 2020. That would represent a trebling of the amount of energy
currently supplied by renewables.
It says this projection is based on 'current policies', but that it has
assumed that fossil fuels will become more expensive, while the prices of
renewables will fall. However, these assumptions are not spelled out.
The central claim of the report is that with special aid from governments
and international initiatives, the proportion of energy use contributed by
renewables could grow to 12 per cent. It calls this the 'ecologically driven
case'.
These projections include six types of energy: wind, solar, geothermal
(making use of the earth's underground heat), oceans, small-scale water
power and biomass - organic-based fuels made from sugar or waste.
However, one of the report's oddities is that it does not look at large
hydro-electric projects, one of the most well-established forms of renewable
energy, on the grounds that enough research is already available. Nor does
it consider in detail the role of what it calls 'traditional biomass' - wood
burning - by far the greatest source of energy in many developing countries.
By concentrating only on the newer forms, it understates the role that
renewable energy already has. The report does acknowledge that if
hydro-electric power and biomass are taken into account, total renewable
resources contribute about 18 per cent of world energy use today, or about
1,559m tonnes of oil-equivalent.
Even within its limited terms of reference, however, its projections contain
surprises.
It estimates that some three-quarters of energy from 'new renewables' comes
from 'modern biomass' - the burning of waste and sewage, and fuels made from
sugar and other organic matter. The popularity of 'modern biomass' in North
and Latin America means that it will still contribute nearly half of the
total in 2020, the report argues.
It clearly recognises that one of the biggest obstacles to renewables is
their expense. The report estimates that its 'ecologically driven'
projections would need cumulative investment of Dollars 2,400bn (Pounds
1,600bn) in renewables between now and 2020. That compares with some Dollars
930bn capital investment in fossil-based systems to produce the same amount
of energy. However, the report is correct that this handicap may diminish.
It is also right to warn of the danger of subsidising renewable energy:
'Experience has shown that too rapid a growth, through massive tax and other
incentives, encourages marginal companies and technologies into the market,'
which then fail to survive.
In many cases, it points out, the natural limitations of renewables limit
their spread. For example, many areas which are suitable for wave power have
other cheap energy - Australia has coal, New Zealand has hydro and
geothermal potential and Britain has coal and nuclear energy.
It will also find increasing support within governments of industrialised
countries for its view that the environmental costs of fossil fuels -
principally their atmospheric emissions - should be reflected in energy
policy. But the report leaves this question open - along with many others.
It expects solar and wind power to make considerable inroads after 2010, but
does not spell out the technological improvements and falls in price that
will bring that about. It includes few comparisons with the cost of nuclear
power, one of renewables' chief rivals for government subsidies.
Nor does it offer much comment on how to treat the initial high-capital
investment which renewables require when comparing them with fossil fuels,
where initial investment is low, but continuing costs are high.
This report provides too little analysis of the future costs of renewables
to show how those choices will be made.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Testing the waters - The
ecological management of Lake Baikal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lake Baikal, the deepest fresh water lake in the world, is often portrayed
as a symbol of how Soviet industrialisation policies rode rough-shod over
Russia's environment.
Today, it provides a litmus test of whether international co-operation can
help Russia tackle ecological problems as it attempts to build a democratic,
market-based society.
The size of Belgium and still basically unspoilt, Lake Baikal has a unique
ecosystem and contains 20 per cent of the world's reserves of fresh water.
The lake's most visible problem is an eyesore: a vast cellulose and paper
plant built in the 1960s which belches grey smoke through dozens of chimney
stacks and dumps waste water into the lake.
But the old Communist system which could erect this plant in such a location
also spared Lake Baikal from capitalist-style threats to the environment
such as mass tourism and property development.
The damage caused by the plant is limited to a relatively small area. But
with the switch to market principles, tourism and exploitation of timber and
agriculture can only increase, generating new challenges of sustainable
development.
As a result, the lake is threatened not so much by damage caused to it
already, but by what could happen to it unless market forces now being
unleashed in Russia are managed with care.
Although he desperately needs western funds and expertise to prevent further
harm, molecular biologist Mikhail Grachev, head of the Limnological
Institute which studies and makes policy recommendations on Lake Baikal, is
worried by some of the offers of assistance made so far.
His latest concern is the World Bank, which last month sent a first mission
to the area to identify possible projects.
'They are looking for alternative science,' says Grachev. 'They asked for
project ideas and said they would choose which ones they want to fund. Maybe
it is possible to behave this way somewhere else, where there are stone
caves, but in Russia this is impossible.
'If they want to decide which projects are good and which are bad, they must
decide together with established Russian institutions that have studied the
lake for decades.'
Grachev's complaints touch a raw nerve as the World Bank undergoes
soul-searching on what its role should be in the countries it is supposed to
assist. The debate is particularly relevant in the unchartered waters of
Russia, which despite its lack of capitalist experience, has rich scientific
potential, an active ecological movement and expertise on its own problems.
Potential for the abuse of aid and the tensions between the government in
Moscow and the regions are two further reasons for the World Bank to ally
its wealth and expertise with a reliable partner at local level.
'If they give money to someone, probably some people will buy computers,
cars and go to America 20 times. They will get only noise in return,' says
Grachev, of the World Bank's search for 'independent' Russian experts.
Although funded by the state, his institute has accumulated unrivalled
knowledge of the lake and has been at the forefront of efforts to protect
it.
By making more judicious use of local experts, he says, the World Bank could
make aid funds go further. Less money would be spent on consultants who fly
in and out of the country on expensive flights. It would avoid the
duplication of efforts which is plagueing most spheres of aid to Russia. It
would also support local people, including Russian scientists who face
severe cuts in funding by the state.
As an example of potential waste, Grachev said the World Bank had told him
it had a Dollars 600,000 (Pounds 387,000) Japanese grant for a feasibility
study on developing ecological tourism in the Lake Baikal area. Not only was
this a vast sum compared with the annual budget of his institute, but
Germany has already begun funding studies on the same subject.
Andrew Bond, a member of the World Bank mission, acknowledges that there is
a 'great deal' of information already available at local level. But, he
says, 'the transfer and collation of knowledge, and who the decision-makers
are is not quite clear'. He adds that the Russians need help in developing
environmental management skills to prevent a recurrence of problems such as
the cellulose and paper plant.
'Environmental management has been undervalued, not only by the general
public but by many environmentalists. This is because it is much easier to
latch on to a problem and feel comfortable with having solved that
particular problem.'
It is true that Grachev says one of his first priorities is for western
experts to survey the paper plant's assets and come up with suggestions on
how to convert it to alternative uses or close it down altogether. But apart
from money to restructure the plant, Grachev acknowledges the need for
intellectual help, particularly in the field of law and economics.
Legislation currently being piloted through parliament to protect Lake
Baikal is a pre-condition for the lake to be declared a world heritage site
by Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation. The law establishes a core zone where no construction can take
place, and requires local factories to present ecological passports.
Grachev is placing his hopes on the present generation of Russian law
students and says they would benefit from exposure to western practice of
environmental law.
In a modest example of successful co-operation so far, Helmut Lieth, a
retired professor of ecology at Osnabruck University, has brought groups of
German ecology students to Lake Baikal to pass their experience on to
Russian students. Thanks to his efforts, the local city of Irkutsk is being
twinned with Leipzig in eastern Germany to help it attract sponsors and
contacts to help its ecological and industrial problems.
Grachev is confident that even the World Bank will come to see things his
way. 'I am patient. They will come back with new ideas.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / Management: Plane sailing for the business traveller -
Health Check / Carol Cooper offers advice and remedies to help tackle the
symptoms of jet lag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW air travellers are lucky enough to escape jet lag. Its familiar symptoms
include fatigue, disorientation, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating,
headache, indigestion and loss of appetite. A variety of sometimes unusual
remedies have been used for the condition, but you do not need to go in for
aromatherapy or drinking your own urine to combat its effects.
Fairly obviously, jet lag is caused by a mismatch between the external time
and the circadian rhythm of your body clock.
The clock is regulated by hormones: by day, high levels of adrenalin,
cortisol and other hormones are produced. By night, melatonin is secreted by
the pineal, a small gland at the base of the brain, which Descartes took to
be the seat of the soul. In studies, melatonin capsules, taken at times when
the hormone 'should be' naturally released, have been shown to reduce jet
lag. However, more work is needed, and the treatment is not yet available
for general use.
Logic tells us that environmental cues such as light, meals and social
rituals have an important effect on circadian rhythms, and recently
physiologists have confirmed that this is so, although they prefer to use
the term zeitgebers (time givers) for these environmental factors.
Left to its own devices without any zeitgebers, the human body actually
prefers a daily period of 25 hours. This has practical implications. It is
easier to shift the body clock backward rather than forward, and jet lag is
usually worse when travelling eastward. If you are off to the Antipodes, try
gradually delaying, instead of advancing, your activities by 12 hours.
For recovery from travel, one should ideally allow a day for each time zone
crossed, but business travellers rarely have that kind of time. Fortunately
simple measures help. On the aircraft adjust your watch to the new time and
take plenty of rest, especially on eastbound flights - symptoms of jet lag
are exacerbated by sleep loss. If you have any short-acting sleeping
tablets, this could be a good time to take one.
Otherwise consider travel sickness pills, which usually have a sedative
effect and can be chosen according to the length of the journey. Kwells and
Joy-Rides work for four hours, while Dramamine and Stugeron last eight.
Alcohol dehydrates, so during the flight avoid the free champagne and try to
average at least one soft drink an hour.
Constipation may make abdominal symptoms worse; it is worth getting enough
fibre.
Once at your destination, zeitgebers become more important.
The minute he disembarked, one executive from the US was dragged by his
hosts to Battersea Park fun fair. He described it as horrible at the time,
but later reported that he was less affected by jet lag than on previous
trips.
Bright light is the most important time-giver of all.
Ordinary, indoor lighting can work, but strong, outdoor light is better and
may explain why those who spend more time outside adapt more quickly to
changes in time. The body clock can be advanced by bright light between 5am
and 11am, and delayed by light between 9pm and 3am. Exercise plays a part,
too, so if possible take a brisk walk outdoors in the sunshine first thing
in the morning. Bioclok is an electronic device to help synchronise
activities with time changes. It costs around Pounds 49.95 from Innovations
or from Medical Technology International (Tel 031 220 4568).
If you cannot adjust to local time, plan carefully. Try to schedule meetings
for the morning (local time) when flying to the US and for the late
afternoon or evening (local time) when in Japan. An important presentation
may work as a zeitgeber, but can be a business disaster.
There are other complications of air travel. Cabin pressure is only about
the same as pressure 6,000 feet above sea-level. The resulting slight lack
of oxygen can pose problems for passengers with heart disease, anaemia and
severe asthma. For most travellers, however, the only adverse effects are on
the sinuses and the middle ear. Ear ache or facial pain can last for days
and could ruin a trip. If you have had a recent cold, ear infection, or
sinus trouble, sucking a sweet during ascent and descent helps keep
Eustachian tubes patent. Those who have not packed sweets should indulge in
yawning.
Blood flow in the legs can get dangerously sluggish on long flights, with
thrombosis as the occasional result. Even in Club Class it is worth walking
around from time to time, keeping the feet moving and avoiding tight socks
and crossed legs.
Recent studies show that in-flight entertainment headsets can act as a
breeding ground for bacteria. It seems to be up to individual airlines to
decide whether to discard, sterilise or re-use headsets, and while no harm
has been known to come from headphones, this could be just a matter of time.
The effect of airport trolleys is in less doubt. First reported in the
British Medical Journal, airport assault syndrome is damage to the Achilles
tendon from the use of luggage trolleys as battering rams. Various tendon
injuries have been described, the exact disability depending on the design
of the trolley and the ferocity with which the other passenger approaches
with his suitcase - or possibly with yours.

FT  15 SEP 93 / People: Morrison makes tracks northward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The team which will operate ScotRail as a shadow franchise in the structure
of British Rail due to come into force from next April has gained a strong
addition with the appointment of Bill Morrison as its financial adviser.
Morrison, 55, takes up his ScotRail appointment on October 1 when he retires
as deputy UK senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick.
Last month Chris Green, one of British Rail's high flyers, was named
director designate of the ScotRail shadow franchise, one of the pilot
projects leading to the franchising of selected rail services. Green said
then that his management team would 'definitely be bidding for the franchise
when the director general of franchising puts it on offer' - within six
months to a year from the beginning of shadow operations. Green joins
Scot-Rail on April 1 next year when he gives up being managing director of
InterCity, which is to be broken up.
Morrison's appointment is the first of a financial adviser to a shadow
franchise. Born in Glasgow, he has been an accountant all his working life,
starting with Thomson McLintock which merged with Peat Marwick in 1987. He
has had a number of non-executive directorships and is to join the board of
Scottish Amicable. He is chairman of the auditing practices board of the UK
and Ireland, and is to be chairman of the executive committee of the joint
disciplinary scheme of the UK accounting profession.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Management: Escape from the ivory tower - A Treasury scheme
to allow high-flyers to stretch their wings in the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's mandarins will, if the Treasury has its way, get their hands
dirty at least once in their civil service careers.
Sir Terence Burns, the permanent secretary, has decreed that the best move a
Treasury high-flyer can make is not up, but out. After a decision taken at
the Treasury Management Board this summer, high-flyers between grades three
and seven are destined to leave the Whitehall cocoon, enter a private-sector
company and spend a couple of years learning about life at the sharp end of
economic policy.
After the spell outside, the Treasury expects its secondees to resist the
lure of better pay and return freshened enough to 'import ideas and
challenge the orthodoxies of internal management as well as its policies'.
The scheme could certainly help salvage the relationship between the
Treasury and business; the department acknowledges criticism that its
officers have rarely left the ivory towers of Whitehall to experience the
constraints and pressures of the wealth-creating sector.
But do managers feel their companies - who will, for a start, have to
reimburse the government for the salaries of the secondees - gain quite so
much from the scheme as the Treasury expects?
While Sir Terence's office has been bombarded with letters of interest since
the FT reported his decision, a minority are openly sceptical.
The reaction of Charles Drace-Francis, the government affairs director of
British Aerospace, is all the more surprising because he is enjoying an
extended secondment from the Foreign Office.
'What on earth makes the Treasury presume that in the middle of a recession,
after we've sacked 7,200 people and about to sack 2,000 more, that its
people are wanted?' he demands.
He is clear, however, about the benefits diplomats can bring business. 'We
know how to negotiate, and we know how to report. A production engineer
never writes anything down. If told to make a table, he would never question
whether it had to have four legs.'
John Emmins, of the Federation of Small Businesses, accepts that it is a
'step in the right direction if only because civil servants, government and
banks seem to know so little about business'.
Beyond that, he doubts the scheme will have the desired effect as civil
servants are too set in their preconceptions to learn much from the private
sector.
Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, the deputy chairman of Livingston Group, the
industrial mini-conglomerate, also has his doubts. 'It all depends on the
firm. Small and medium-sized businesses are pretty lean and would get very
little short-term benefit from installing a civil servant and training him
up to see what the company is all about,' he says.
Others see more mutual benefits - and are keen to grab a mandarin as soon as
possible. Michael Corrigan, the secretary of the Association of British
Insurers, says the ABI held an immediate board meeting to discuss how member
companies might secure civil servants. Since the Financial Services Act, he
points out, the Treasury regulates life assurance companies and they are,
naturally, keen to put their points to the regulators.
The Prudential confirms its approval of the scheme. 'We've always maintained
informal links with Whitehall but the secondments would definitely help us
learn a bit more about how the civil service operates,' it says.
On the whole, though, managers think that it is far more important for civil
servants to learn a bit more about them. John Parsons, founder of Time and
Data Systems, the security-card manufacturer in Dorset that employs 50 and
turns over Pounds 3m a year, supports the scheme. 'It's immensely valuable
for people to get inside information, particularly about small and
medium-sized businesses because they are overburdened with bureaucracy and
regulation,' he says.
Hugh Morgan Williams, the chairman of Canford Audio, the Tyne and Wear-based
manufacturer of professional audio equipment, says he would welcome a civil
servant - but would want a 'matchmaking service' to operate.
'I'd like someone involved in industry or economic planning - not the Health
Service or the Highland Development Board,' he says.
Most important to the company, with its annual turnover of Pounds 8m and
staff of 85, would be the chance to show the man from Whitehall the 'civil
service-related problems' it is currently dealing with - filing Intrastat
returns for the Central Statistical Office's trade figures; and interpreting
standards to comply with the EC's Byzantine Electromagnetic Compatibility
Directive.
It seems clear that industry, for its many reasons, is keen for the
Whitehall secondments to take root.
The Treasury's personnel department will be working overtime on a number of
complex aspects: negotiating with staff and companies about who should go
where and for how long; ensuring that departmental cover is adequate; but
also more delicate questions of civil service confidentiality.
Collective memory still rankles about the Treasury economist who left in the
1980s to become a gilts economist at a merchant bank, having been privy to
key information about how the government calculated the public-sector
borrowing requirement.
So the set of rules about releasing sensitive Treasury staff - which
dictates that a certain amount of time has to elapse before the officer
leaves to do comparable work outside - is likely to apply to secondments,
too. Companies keen to bend the right Whitehall ear are not likely to get it
on their books.

the sudden resignation of Roger Bevan, its managing director.
Bevan left at the end of last week following what is believed to have been a
difference in management approaches. He has been replaced by Christopher
Wiscarson, currently group finance director at Lloyds Abbey Life.
The company refused to comment on the resignation and Bevan could not be
contacted.

Richard Jewson is stepping down as chairman and chief executive of Meyer
International, the timber supplier which owns the Jewson chain of builders'
merchants.
The move, announced yesterday, follows the board's decision to split the
roles of chairman and chief executive in line with the Cadbury committee
recommendations and to seek a non-executive chairman.
Jewson, 49, who became chairman in 1991, will continue to act as chairman
until the end of December when he will leave the board in order to develop
his career 'in other areas'.
Yesterday he explained that while he did not disagree with his board's
decision to divide the two roles, he did not want to become a non-executive
chairman, having worked 'hands-on'; nor did he wish to go back to being
chief executive, his earlier post. He said he has 'some ideas' for what he
might do next, but added that he did not want to rush to any decisions.
He has been succeeded as chief executive by John Dobby who joined the group
in 1959, has served as a director since 1983 and was appointed managing
director in October 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Direct Marketing Association has a new chief executive, Colin Lloyd, 51.
Lloyd founded the highly successful direct marketing and sales promotion
public company KLP group, which he then sold in 1990 to the Paris-based
international advertising network RSCG for Pounds 34m. He stayed on for a
while as chairman of RSCG UK but in 1991 turned to serious golfing and
consultancy work.
That semi-retirement was not to his taste and he is delighted to return to
running the DMA, which has a role both for the industry and the consumer.
Lloyd's predecessor, Richard Genochio, stayed the course for just nine
months. Since he left at the start of this year, Juliet Williams has been
running the DMA.
Lloyd says he has two core missions: 'To ensure the DMA's educational
programme operates on the highest levels, and to make sure that the consumer
understands that companies belonging to the DMA really do adhere to our code
of practice. We are a vigilant authority and really do clamp down on
abuses.'
Lloyd has more than 25 years' experience of direct marketing and sales
promotion and wants to provide what he calls an 'ambassadorial role which
leads the industry forward'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Recruitment: Why established theory is now suspect -
Teenager's remarkable abilities raise possibility that the exception is the
same as the rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF readers get a spare minute for reflection in the next few days, the Jobs
column would appreciate your thoughts on a perplexing question.
After all, there have been several times these past two decades when you
have solved a problem that baffled the experts in the field. An example was
your coup in decoding the medieval spelling of a town's name, which had
defeated the French historian Professor Bartolome Bennassar.
Today's challenge surely ought to be easier because it calls for no
comparably specialised knowledge. Indeed, although the problem is central to
the cultural as well as monetary wealth of nations, its nub lies in
something you all achieve daily in your work. The question is: how do people
do skilled things?
True, despite its apparent simplicity, it is a question many august thinkers
have examined without finding a cogent answer. But that may be because they
are blinkered by their own theoretical presuppositions, and so looking for
it in the wrong place - or so I'm beginning to suspect, at least.
What awakened the suspicion was a report in the white Times newspaper last
Monday on an autistic 19-year-old. Since only a few of you are likely to
have seen the report, I'd better outline the case by adding that his name is
Stephen Wiltshire, and in his largely speechless lifetime he has rarely
shown an interest in the world around him, and still less any ability for
most of the things normally studied in schools. While specially trained
teachers eventually taught him to read and write, he never did either unless
his tutors sat prompting him by his side.
Then one day he surprised them by starting to portray them in wickedly
observant cartoons. Nor did his talent for drawing stop there, for it turned
out that after little more than a glance at complex architectural plans, he
could go away and reproduce them line for line.
That alone failed to strike the egg-head professions as world-shaking
because theory has long had a name for people with some singular capacity
like his. The name is idiot savants, defined as 'people of subnormal
intelligence who nonetheless show remarkable talent in a restricted field
such as memorising or rapid calculation.'
But the youngster has now chipped a crack in the egg-heads by doing
something which they evidently cannot account for. He has revealed another
impressive talent. After just listening to a piece of music, he can identify
the sequence of chords of which it is composed - and since that ability is
in an entirely different field from his talent for drawing, the experts do
not know how to explain it.
What I would like to know, on the other hand, is whether readers whose
skills are more practical than theoretical likewise find the phenomenon
inexplicable. If so, I beg to differ. Although it clashes with present
theory, it strikes me as readily comprehensible. The prime reason is that,
in themselves, the young man's talents are less than extraordinary let alone
unique.
Now, that is not to belittle him. As he has two of them to count on, his
high-level skills certainly outnumber mine. OK, I perhaps don't yet quite
fall under Lyndon Johnson's lampooning description of Gerald Ford as being
unable 'to fart and chew gum at the same time'. But there is only one thing
I can claim to do at a level anywhere near remarkable - or I hope so at any
rate - and that's communicating in written English.
Even so, while most of us can't do the things Stephen Wiltshire does, an
appreciable minority of people can. Besides, the abilities he exercises in
doing them are no more extraordinary than those required by numerous
practical activities, managing a workforce being a case in point.
Hence the stumbling block preventing the experts from explaining his
achievements would seem to lie in the theory, and especially in the first
part of the definition of an idiot savant - the bit that assumes him to be
'of subnormal intelligence'. And the justification for including him in the
said sad category is surely that he has not shown the sort of capacity which
established theory deems to be indicative of at least normal intelligence,
including an ability to learn the things which customarily make up the
school curriculum.
Indeed, so strong is the grip of the theory that if he had shown the
academic type of ability, it is unlikely that the experts would think
anything even needed to be explained. They would simply look on the boy as
much like themselves at his age: as a person of more than adequate general
intelligence, with one or two particularly pronounced skills. Moreover, most
other people who have succeeded in conventional education would probably
take the same view without pause for thought.
But the powerful hold of the theory doesn't make it right. On the contrary,
the apparent fact that it fails to explain young Stephen's skills is prima
facie evidence that the theory is wrong.
Nor is it the only reason for supposing that, far from being an exceptional
case, he may do what he does in essentially the same way as such things are
done by folk who succeeded in education. For, if readers reflect on how you
do your own work, I'd guess that most of you will be inclined to agree that
your decisive abilities, even though dependent on use of the mind, are often
of an intuitive kind rather than of the sort demanded by academic curricula.
If you don't, then I am keen to hear of it. But I hope that besides telling
me I'm daft, you'll spell out your grounds for saying so in as much detail
as you have time for. Should it turn out that my ideas on the matter are
wrong, I'll of course admit as much as soon as practicable.
In the meantime, however, I'm sticking to my hypothesis that it is mistaken
to believe that the capacity to succeed in scholarly exams is indispensable
to highly intelligent action, including the making of active judgments as
well as direct operations on the outside world such as motivating other
people. And what I see as the main flaw in that belief is the assumption,
which can be traced back at least 350 years to the philosopher Rene
Descartes, that the way people do mentally skilled things is necessarily by
first planning out intellectually how they are going to do them, then
putting the plan in their skull into effect as if they were following a
detailed blueprint.
No doubt there are some kinds of expert work which can be done by that
two-step method. But as I reported 10 weeks ago, my talks over the years
with hundreds of highly skilled people - including theoretical researchers -
suggest that the large majority operate differently. With few exceptions,
they rejected the idea that they first thought and then acted in
distinguishable stages. Their most decisive thinking was somehow embedded in
the doing, and could not be separated from it.
Accordingly, I feel it is high time the experts scrapped their theoretical
presupposition that the talents of people like Stephen Wiltshire are freak
deviations from the normal rule governing human expertise. It would be
better to concentrate on highly skilled operators who are deemed normal, and
identify how they actually do their work with a view to discovering whether
or not the established theory is a counter-productive, not to mention
enormously expensive, distortion of reality.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Performance pay plan for teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE-related pay is to be introduced for teachers under plans
announced by the government yesterday.
Fourteen schools are to test ways of relating pay to performance - judged,
for example, by appraisal interviews. The tests will be monitored by the
School Teachers' Review Body, the independent group which advises on pay,
and by the Department for Education.
The department said there were few teaching posts left unfilled and
recruitment to training courses was healthy. It said: 'The aim must now be
to ensure pay is used in the most effective way to raise standards. Schools
should now respond by identifying good performance in their teachers and
rewarding it.'
The National Union of Teachers is boycotting appraisal interviews where they
could be used for performance-related pay. The Professional Association of
Teachers said: 'We had been willing to consider performance-related pay in
principle, but see no evidence that its adoption in schools would benefit
either the profession or students.'
The 14 pioneer schools are: Ashton-on-Mersey School and Audenshaw High
School in Manchester; Blatchington Mills School, E Sussex; Campsmount
School, S Yorks; the Cecil Jones High School, Essex; The Chase High School,
Hereford &amp; Worcester; Crofton School, Stubbington, Hampshire; Deers Wood
School, Avon; Eight Ash Green C of E Primary School, Essex; Furze Platt
School, Berks; Hazelwich School, W Sussex; Lamphey County Primary School,
Dyfed; St Martin's School, Essex; and Westlands School, Kent.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Cook's tour keeps to tight industrial schedule: Michael
Cassell joins the shadow trade and industry secretary as he considers how
Labour might rebuild the manufacturing base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GET SOME breakfast while you can,' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
spokesman, warns his personal assistant as he spoons out the grapefruit.
It is 7.45am and breakfast is in the 700-year-old Maid's Head Hotel in
Norwich. To prepare for the 15-hour day ahead, Mr Cook has already ingested
endless facts and figures, but the outlook for food is very uncertain.
Labour's man - accompanied by Mrs Gaynor Reagan, his discreet Westminster
assistant, and Mr Daniel Zeichner, the chatty driver of a politically
incorrect, but immensely comfortable, BMW luxury saloon - is on the latest
leg of his mission.
The objective is to take national soundings on the party's efforts to build
a consensus between a future Labour government and industry which can
rebuild Britain's manufacturing base.
But hasn't Labour missed the boat? Everyone knows manufacturing industry is
again high on the political agenda. 'It's our bloody boat,' Mr Cook insists.
'We've been banging away since 1979, saying manufacturing matters.'
Mr Cook gives some credit to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, for recent changes at a department marginalised and demotivated
during the 1980s, but adds that the DTI budget ranks alongside that of
national heritage. 'I could inherit the DTI budget at precisely the point it
completely disappears,' he chuckles.
On this day, the Robin Cook roadshow is in Norwich and Cambridge. Behind him
lie Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Plymouth; ahead are Newcastle upon
Tyne and Sheffield.
Labour trade and industry spokesmen traditionally enjoy a miserable life,
lured into the boardrooms of British industry to be politely entertained and
peremptorily dismissed.
When Mr Gordon Brown did the job, one wholly unimpressed host later put his
guest's picture through the office shredder.
This time, the party has not waited for invitations. Mr Cook has arranged
his own meetings. He has also set his own agenda for discussion in the shape
of a consultative paper launched in April. The emerging industrial strategy
will go to next year's Labour conference.
The document painstakingly resists the urge to claim the government knows
best, but hints heavily that it is perfectly entitled to tilt the tiller.
It includes a shake-up of corporate governance involving two-tier boards
with worker directors. There are also carrot-and-stick fiscal policies to
replace decades of footloose corporate ownership with a commitment to
longer-term equity ownership.
Labour, tiptoeing into a minefield, also envisages a role for building
societies and pension funds in mobilising savings to help industry. Mr Cook
accepts that finding an acceptable way is 'a tough one'; he doesn't sound as
though he is anywhere near the answer.
There are plans for a network of regional development agencies - possibly
raising investment funds through bond issues - to devolve decision-making.
Labour also expects the financial community to decentralise in the same way.
Mr Cook's breakfast guests, drawn from the Norfolk and Waveney chamber of
commerce and industry, have read the document. The meeting starts well;
there is no dispute over the need to revive manufacturing.
Mr Phil Scott, a Norwich Union general manager, says short-termism among
funding institutions is the biggest headache for small companies. Labour
must help them. Mr Cook concedes that politicians, too, are short-term
creatures.
Mr Richard Holroyd, managing director of Colmans, the mustard maker, says
the real problem is not finance, but poor manufacturing performance.
'Our plant is not as efficient and our education and skills are poor. You
underestimate the problem.' Mr Cook mentions a levy to persuade reluctant
companies to invest in training. No one dissents. Old sores are exposed when
Mr Geoffrey Copeman, chairman of Eastern Counties Newspapers, warns Labour
not to undo trade union reforms: 'Life is different; life is better. Europe
may lean on the hands of the clock to turn it back.' Mr Cook is deeply
conciliatory: 'The best way ahead is to build co-operation.'
Mr Scott chips in again: 'As for two-tier boards, they simply mean more
democracy. Sorry, I mean more bureaucracy.' Everyone enjoys the Freudian
slip but Mr Cook appears to abandon a highly controversial proposal: 'I
don't think you will see a supervisory board policy adopted.'
But, he adds: 'There's no point in electing more non-executives if they just
enjoy the patronage of the executive directors.' His remarks go down like
lumpy porridge.
Breakfast over, next stop is the old Start-Rite shoe factory in the city,
spiced with the smell of German cow hide and occupied by lines of women
seated at ancient Singer sowing machines.
The tannoy plays Madonna where once it would have been Vera Lynn. In the
boardroom, the directors complain of unfair tariff barriers and call for a
level playing field as Mr Cook tucks into the oatmeal biscuits. Mrs Reagan,
his personal assistant, hungrily eyes the plate.
More capital allowances would also be welcome, though Mr Cook doubts their
value. How can he be sure the investment would not have taken place anyway?
Later, on the journey to the officers' mess at RAF Duxford, near Cambridge,
he says he favours a better-targeted grant system to encourage capital
investment.
There has been no time for lunch. To a backdrop of painted second world war
battle scenes, Mr Cook begins the afternoon with the Confederation of
British Industry's eastern region. Mrs Reagan has by now secured a Belgian
biscuit.
Mr Bruce Warman, regional chairman, warns Mr Cook not to model his
manufacturing strategy on the Germans: 'They are overpaid, underworked and
weighed down by social costs. I wouldn't swap our problems for Germany's'
Mr Harry Faure Walker, Barclays Bank regional director, tells Mr Cook that
the financial community is best placed to decide how to lend money. Outside
direction might lead to heavy losses.
Mr Cook grins and suggests Barclays may, indeed, need little outside help in
that direction. The CBI team, he reflects afterwards, is a mite too
complacent.
By now squeezed into a small Ford, the group moves on to St John's
Innovation Centre, a nursery for fledgling high-tech companies in Cambridge.
There is a good debate with 40 entrepreneurs on the small-business sector.
Newcastle next stop. The following day will begin at breakfast with the
local CBI and a trip to Nissan. Mrs Reagan hopes there will be a dining car
on the night train.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Labour starts review of education system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday launched what it called 'the biggest consultation of the
education profession since 1944'. Its education policy paper was intended to
lead to a 'national consensus'.
Mr John Smith, party leader, said the next Labour government would be an
'education government'. He added: 'Ministers, for the most part, do not use
the state system for their own children and therefore have no personal or
vested interest in its success.'
The party was keen to contrast its approach with the government's stance
which has led to confrontation with the teachers' unions over national
curriculum testing.
Labour's 'green paper' on education had been planned for several months. The
launch came after claims that the party had failed to capitalise on the
political difficulties of Mr John Patten, education secretary.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said detailed policies would
await further consultation, but that the main structure was in place. The
party intends to:
Reject the 'prescriptive national syllabus approach' - Labour will open
debate on the purpose as well as the content of the national curriculum.
Return grant-maintained schools to local education authority control.
Reject proposals to 'de-professionalise teaching' by allowing non-graduate
entry routes.
Abandon 'discredited and meaningless' league tables of schools' examination
results.
Abolish national tests which have the sole aim of producing 'simplistic
league tables'.
Mr Patten attacked the proposals as a 'so-called consultation paper that
actually gives the answers before the consultation has taken place'. He
said: 'It's back to the educational past for Labour.'
Teachers' unions welcomed the proposals, however. The Association of
Teachers and Lecturers, which is not affiliated to the TUC, said that it
would be 'delighted to be given a proper consultation over education
policy'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / A-levels 'past sell-by date' says headmasters' leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE A-LEVEL examination is 'past its sell-by date', the chairman of the
Headmasters' Conference, which represents the UK's leading independent boys'
schools, said yesterday.
Mr Robin Wilson, headmaster of Trinity School, Croydon, told the
conference's annual meeting in Oxford that the surge in post-16 education,
the expansion of national education targets and the pressures on higher
education 'all suggest that we are in the dying years of our present
system'.
His comments add to several recent calls to reform A-levels so that
sixth-formers can study a broader range of subjects. Sir Ron Dearing,
chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, is preparing a
report into 'the merits of a modified approach to the curriculum from 14 to
16, which retains a mandatory core but which provides a smoother transition
to study post-16 education, through a wide range of options'.
Mr Wilson gave strong support to those calling for the age of 14 to replace
16 as an educational watershed. He said: 'The national curriculum has been
designed for a system which is programmed until the age of 16. Evidence is
growing that such a timescale is out of date and unhelpful.'
He said that the framework of discussion was now the 14-19 age group, and
that A-levels demanded a commitment to a limited number 'and too often a
limited range' of subjects at an early age.
Mr Wilson described the divide between vocational and academic education as
'artificial', and said that it made pupils choose decisively at an
undeveloped age.
A-levels were also attacked yesterday by Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education
secretary, who described them as 'too restrictive, too narrow, and against
the interests of the pupils who take them'. She said that neither higher
education nor employers supported the A-level system.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday appointed the members of
the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority who will work under Sir Ron
and will have control of the national curriculum and its tests. Half are
teachers.
They include Mr Graham Mackenzie, group chief executive of UES Holdings, Mr
David Quarmby, joint managing director of J Sainsbury, and Mrs Shahwar
Sadeque, director of computer software company Art of Intelligence and a
governor of the BBC.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Barclays to sack 500 in staff cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK said yesterday that 500 staff in London and the south-east
were likely to lose their jobs in the first compulsory redundancies it has
ever made in its branch network.
It said that as many as 800 staff in the region were 'surplus' to its needs
and that much of the reduction it wanted could not be met through its
voluntary redundancy programme.
Mr John Cotton, Barclay's personnel director, said: 'This is something we
all sought to avoid but it is justified by the needs of the business and we
have to face up to it. We feel great regret but these jobs are lost
forever.'
He said there were no further plans for compulsory job losses in the region
or elsewhere for the rest of this year, but that he could not rule out more
redundancies next year.
Mr Cotton left open the possibility that not all of the losses would have to
be compulsory, saying he was open to suggestions about how else to reduce
staffing. Discussions on the reductions will take place in the next few
months.
He said Barclays believed 500 of the 800 redundancies would be compulsory,
with some of the remainder met by voluntary departures and other 'surplus'
staff retained in case of further economic recovery.
Barclays said most of the reductions were not related to the recession but
reflected longer-term restructuring which required fewer staff.
They were part of a plan to reduce staff by 18,000 over five years from the
start of 1991, with London and the south-east most affected.
Bifu, the Banking Insurance and Finance Union, condemned the losses
yesterday and said the announcement had 'come out of the blue'.
It said its Barclays representatives had been told by senior bank officials
last week that the voluntary redundancy programme had been working well and
volunteers were even being refused.
'We are totally opposed to compulsory redundancies on principle,' Bifu said.
'They are unnecessary. This announcement shows that nobody in Barclays is
safe in 1994.'
It said it was likely to launch a publicity campaign andadded that it had
not ruled out the possibility of industrial action.
Barclays has reduced the number of staff by 13,500 to 45,000 since the start
of 1991, of which 9,000 have been in the branch network and the rest in
headquarters and support functions.
About 4,000 have lost their jobs in London and south-east branches.
It has cut branches from 2,400 to 2,200 in the same period and plans a
reduction to 1,900 over the next two years.

THE government's Pounds 23bn roads programme will be disastrous for the
environment and goes against worldwide moves to combat pollution and
congestion, transport chiefs were told yesterday.
Shadow transport minister Ms Joan Walley told the British Road Federation's
public affairs committee in London: 'It is now apparent that the government
has blatantly ignored the challenge set last year at the Rio earth summit
for countries to look for long-term strategies to provide integrated and
sustainable transport systems.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / Speed curbs aim to cut child deaths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEED LIMITS are to be cut to 20mph on more residential roads after pilot
schemes led to a sharp fall in accidents, the government said yesterday.
Mr Robert Key, the roads minister, said at the launch of a road safety
campaign in London that there was evidence slowing down saved lives.
Officials monitoring 60 experimental schemes involving road calming and
20mph zones found child deaths had fallen by 80 per cent in accidents where
pedestrians and cyclists were hit by cars.
The overall number of casualties in traffic accidents was down 70 per cent,
statistics compiled by the Department of Transport's Traffic Research
Laboratory show.
Last year 44,186 children were involved in road accidents, however, and
Britain's child pedestrian death rate is still one of the highest in Europe.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Drinks makers face legal case soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the UK's leading manufacturers of baby foods are about to face legal
action over the sugar content of children's drinks in one of the largest
multi-party compensation claims filed in Britain, Tim Burt writes.
A High Court judge is expected to start considering the case against
SmithKline Beecham, Boots, Cow and Gate, Milupa and Robinsons soon,
following legal submissions by solicitors representing more than 700
families.
The claims allege that the products were defective and that the companies
acted negligently in failing to print labels warning of high sugar content
in drinks for babies.
Solicitors acting for the families say the drinks rotted children's teeth,
forcing many to undergo remedial surgery.
The drinks, they claim, were a factor in the increasing incidence of
'nursing bottle caries', a jawbone infection which makes teeth blacken and
decay as they emerge.
Potential damages could run into millions of pounds, according to solicitors
who warned that the number of family claimants could exceed 1,000 by the
time initial court hearings started.
The companies yesterday denied legal liability for infants' dental problems
and pledged to contest the action.

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's News International has suspended publication of its
Shoppers' Friend newspaper insert after only one issue.
Shoppers' Friend was a free-standing insert containing only discount coupons
for supermarket products. It was paid for by advertising.
Such coupon booklets are big business in the US, and News International
decided 18 months ago to introduce the concept into the UK. The company
yesterday blamed the recession and difficulties over redeeming the coupons.
Meanwhile in the US, Mr Murdoch's News America publishing subsidiary is
being sued by Sullivan Marketing, the coupon insert subsidiary of Sullivan
Communications.
The company alleges that News America and Valassis Communications, which is
49 per cent controlled by Consolidated Press Holdings of Australia, have
indulged in 'improper and anti-competitive business practices'.
Sullivan says News America and Valassis control more than 90 per cent of the
Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 842m) US coupon-insert market. News America declined
to comment yesterday on the anti-trust suit.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Usdaw voting boost for Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH yesterday won a potentially significant victory in his battle
to introduce one-member-one-vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary
candidates. The Labour leader's campaign is opposed by some of the biggest
unions affiliated to the party.
The executive of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union which is the sixth-largest
affiliate to the party, decided that the union's delegation to the party
conference at the end of the month should be free to back Mr Smith's reform
proposals.
Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary and a keen supporter of Mr
Smith, said that as the vote at the union's conference had not considered Mr
Smith's latest formula, the delegation should be free to back the leader.
The formula gives trade unionists who pay the political levy a cheap way to
become full party members.
The move will cause some ill-feeling in the union because its conference
voted against an earlier version of the Smith formula. But Mr Davies is
expected to get his own way.
Attention will now focus on whether leaders of Nupe, the public services
union, can make a similar shift.
Even if both Usdaw and Nupe do shift their votes, Mr Smith is not assured of
success. He will have to rely on either greater than expected support for
his reforms from constituency parties, or a stalemate in which no position
wins, allowing him to impose his wishes on the party.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Lib Dems switch to resources tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRUCTURAL switch from taxing people to taxing resources was proposed
yesterday by the Liberal Democrats in a document intended to address the
challenges of the next decade.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said that a shift towards taxing
pollution and the use of raw materials would help the UK economy to be more
efficient and to compete in the world econ-omy.
The party's advocacy of the European Community's plans for a carbon tax will
be seized on by the Tories, given the Liberal Democrats' high-profile
campaign against the government's imposition of value added tax on domestic
fuel.
Senior party figures, however, believe that the approach has the advantage
of helping to broaden the debate beyond the sole question of whether the
party favours high or low taxation.
The plans will be advanced today when the party publishes its detailed
proposals for environmental tax reform.
Yesterday's framework paper, Facing up to the Future, will be debated by the
party's conference next week. Its precursor was savaged by representatives
at last year's conference for being too rightwing. The current version is
noticeably different in tone. One example is its discussion of employment in
terms of the redistribution of jobs as well as their creation.
Mr Ashdown was at pains to emphasise, however, that the party still differed
from Labour in, for example, its commitment to promoting competition.
The party has also altered its tone on the EC, introducing a more explicit
note of criticism into the document.
The paper takes account of the mood of Euro-scepticism in the UK since the
debate on the Maastricht treaty, acknowledging that EC member states will
want to move forward at different speeds and that the Community must be
'relevant to ordinary people'.
The Liberal Democrats' image as the most pro-European of the main parties
has been seen by their opponents as a likely obstacle to their picking up a
protest vote against the Tories in next June's Euro-elections.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Redefined production alters the shape of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in manufacturing output towards the end of last year was not as
pronounced as previously reported and the rise in the first half of this
year was much shallower, redefined production figures showed yesterday.
The alteration to the shape of the recovery in manufacturing was the result
of a decision by the Central Statistical Office to reweight the components
of industrial production and to introduce an export-price deflator.
According to the rebased series, manufacturing output grew by 1.2 per cent
in the first quarter of this year compared with the fourth quarter of last
year, rather than by 2 per cent.
In the second quarter of this year growth was 0.6 per cent, rather than 1.4
per cent. In the three months to July, the latest available figure, output
was up by only 0.1 per cent compared with the previous three months.
The series also shows, however, that output in the final quarter of last
year was flat rather than fall-ing.
These revisions and the most recent figure appear alarming, but year-on-year
growth rates have barely altered and still show that manufacturing output is
growing at a faster rate than other areas of the economy. In the three
months to July output grew by 2.2 per cent compared with the same three
months a year ago.
The index has been reweighted to reflect more accurately the composition of
manufacturing and energy output in the UK.
The biggest change since 1985 - when the weightings were last altered - is
that the weighting given to oil and gas extraction has been reduced by more
than two-thirds because of the sharp fall in oil prices since 1986. The
weighting of coal mining has also been halved.
Manufacturing now accounts for 85 per cent of overall industrial output,
while mining, quarrying, electricity, gas and water supply - those parts not
classified as manufacturing - make up 15 per cent. This compares with 70 per
cent and 30 per cent under the 1985 weightings.
Meanwhile, the CSO has introduced a new definition of manufacturing which
takes in coke ovens, mineral oil processing and nuclear fuel production but
excludes mining and the quarrying of minerals.
The weaker growth in the first half of the year was not entirely because it
was being compared with a higher base. It was also due to the introduction
of an export-price deflator, used to estimate volumes
The new series takes into account the difference between domestic prices and
export prices in deflating the sales data used to construct the index of
production. Previously home prices were used to deflate all the figures
which could be misleading, since export prices often behave differently.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Clarke warns on EC monetary rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday warned European Community
countries against rushing to recreate the European monetary system as it
existed before the August currency crisis.
The chancellor called on the community to adopt economic and monetary
disciplines that were 'realistic and take account of the lessons from the
recent past'.
Delivering the Swiss Bank Corporation annual lecture in London, he said that
the EC's future economic discussions should be guided by three basic
principles:
Free markets and free trade, including the need to complete the single
market and the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Sound budgetary policies to keep real interest rates down to levels that
would make investment attractive.
Price stability, with monetary policies in each member state geared to
ensuring that the EC is a zone of low inflation.
These principles - clearly based on UK policy since the exit of sterling
from the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago - were, he said, the
right way to achieve greater convergence of economic policies while making
the community competitive with the outside world. 'Only when we have
achieved these objectives and only in the light of real experience, should
anyone think of going back to the question of monetary and exchange rate
policies,' the chancellor said.
Mr Clarke, who comes from the pro-European wing of the Conservative party,
was careful to provide some comfort for all sections of Tory opinion.
His opening words, which referred to European union instead of the EC, were
unlikely to endear him to Euro-sceptics. 'Britain,' he declared, 'will be a
member of the European union for the foreseeable future.'
But he depicted the Maastricht treaty as having broken the 'federal mould'
for the EC. The parts of the treaty that mattered 'are not the bureaucratic
and artificial timetable towards Emu' (economic and monetary union), but
subsidiarity, with its emphasis on limiting community action, and the
establishment of intergovernmental co-operation in foreign and security
policy and justice and home affairs.
These elements involved the EC 'in a totally different way'. Initiative
rested with the EC member states, rather than the commission. Voting, except
in very limited circumstances, was by unanimity. These elements were also
not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Delay to Cadbury measures agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING companies agreed with accounting standards setters yesterday on
delaying the implementation of parts of the Cadbury code of corporate
governance.
Directors have been concerned about the level of disclosure which they will
have to make under the code and said that they had been given insufficient
time to respond to the guidelines.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, who called
yesterday's meeting, was last night still trying to seek approval for a new
timetable from Sir Adrian Cadbury, who chaired the committee on the
financial aspects of corporate governance.
Details of the agreement, which are expected to be issued in a statement by
the council today, will suggest a new framework for companies when they
report compliance with the most important aspects of the Cadbury code. These
include provision of interim financial statements, commentaries on the state
of internal controls, and on whether a company is a going concern or
financially viable.
Guidelines for companies on how to comment on such corporate governance
issues in their annual reports are likely to be delayed until next year.
Those at yesterday's meeting included representatives from the 100 Group of
finance directors of leading quoted companies, the Accounting Standards
Board, the Auditing Practices Board and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales.
Sir Ron said yesterday that there would be regular co-ordination meetings
between companies and standards setters. There would be agreement on
timetables for the release of consultation documents, and on consultation
and implementation per-iods.
Quoted companies have been required by the Stock Exchange to provide a
statement of compliance with the code in their annual reports for financial
periods ending after June this year.
Yesterday's meeting solidified proposals initially discussed in July after
companies raised concerns that Cadbury and reporting requirements from other
organisations were over-burdening them with excessive demands.
The most public statements came from Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director
of life insurance group The Prudential and chairman of the 100. His views
reflected the discontent of a number of executives.
Disagreements on the drafting of the Cadbury guidelines have caused delays
to their launch, with the proposed statement on internal controls redrafted
at least 17 times.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Ministers 'fought arms trade rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH TRADE ministers were involved in an apparent attempt to persuade the
government to breach its own export regulations in the 1980s, a Foreign
Office official told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
Mr David Gore-Booth, Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said he had come
to that conclusion on the basis of interdepartmental correspondence he had
seen while serving between January 1989 and January this year as assistant
secretary of state at the Foreign Office, responsible for the Middle East.
He made his view clear in an internal Foreign Office memo which had been
made available to the inquiry.
Earlier Mr Gore-Booth told the inquiry that the Foreign Office had been
virtually powerless to prevent the export of British machine-tools to Iraq
in spite of receiving intelligence that they were contributing to a build-up
of the country's defence capability.
Under repeated questioning from Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss
Presiley Baxendale QC, Mr Gore-Booth suggested that part of the reason was
the inadequate way in which intelligence information was disseminated in
Whitehall.
He said: 'I don't myself feel that we lacked an assessment within the
Foreign Office of the risks we were running as a country. What I am by no
means clear about is to what extent the pieces of paper (intelligence) were
part of the decision-making process of other Whitehall departments.'
He said that if the intelligence made available to the Ministry of Defence
and other government officials had been shared more fully with the Foreign
Office it would have been more successful in restricting exports to Iraq.
'It is possible that if Mr (William) Waldegrave (then foreign office
minister) had waved a particular piece of paper it might have influenced
decisions another way,' he said.
Documents made available to the Scott inquiry show Mr Gore-Booth
unsuccessfully attempting to resist pressure from the Department of Trade
and Industry and the MoD to support defence-related exports to Iraq.
In 1989 Mr Waldegrave agreed with other ministers to award Matrix-Churchill,
the Midlands-based machine-tools company, licences for 'general engineering'
machines which were used to make fuses and missiles.
Mr Gore-Booth, who on Monday clashed with the inquiry officials over what he
claimed was their failure to understand the working of the Whitehall
machinery, was yesterday less hostile, suggesting that government might have
something to learn from the inquiry.
The hearing continues today.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Treasury's approach linked to recovery: Public-sector
workers will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to
maintain their standards of living, say pay analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent

<TEXT>
THE TREASURY yesterday linked its new limits on public-sector pay with the
effort to maintain the pace of recovery and ensure low inflation.
The plan for a near-freeze on public-sector wages in 1994-95 also fitted in
with the need to 'restore the public finances to better health', the
Treasury said.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, warned that wage-bargaining expectations
throughout the economy would have to change so that price pressures remain
subdued, thus giving industry a solid platform for expansion later in the
1990s. 'It will not be possible to achieve sustainable growth and steady
recovery without continued low inflation,' the Treasury said.
'What previously might have been regarded as restrained levels of pay
settlement are now in fact sensible and necessary and will remain so. We
must become accustomed to a pattern where significant real terms increases
in pay are not expected each year by professions and employees.'
The department said the government's goal of keeping underlying inflation -
as measured by the year-on-year change in the retail prices index, excluding
mortgage payments - under 4 per cent within the life of the present
parliament would be helped by 'continued moderation in pay increases' in
both the public and private sectors.
The strict limits on public-sector wages also appears designed to appease
rightwing Tories. In recent weeks, they have voiced concerns that tax rises,
rather than new spending limits, have been the preferred government option
in the battle to rein back the deficit.
Wages account for nearly half this year's spending of Pounds 244bn, as
measured by the Treasury's 'control total' which excludes social security
linked to the economic cycle and debt interest. Therefore strict pay limits
for next year and onwards should help Mr Clarke cut the gap between spending
and revenues from the expected Pounds 50bn this financial year.
Even so, the chancellor has refused to rule out tax increases in his
November 30 Budget. These would take effect from next April, and come on top
of the Pounds 16bn of tax rises already announced for the next two financial
years.

WILL THE government get away with a second year of severe downward pressure
on public-sector pay? And if it does, who will be the winners and losers in
the public sector?
Public-sector union leaders, and many of their members, were genuinely angry
yesterday, but one advantage of announcing the policy so far in advance is
that come the 1994-95 pay round the protest may have blown out.
Some union officials were careful to talk of a national day of action to
focus broader political discontent with the government rather than a return
to widespread industrial action which would hurt the public and might turn
opinion against the unions rather than the government.
Some analysts say that several groups might do quite well out of the new pay
policy, especially those which could improve productivity. At both British
Rail and the Post Office, for example, the employer is keen to reduce
staffing levels further and needs to keep a highly unionised workforce
compliant.
Similarly, the local government employers stressed yesterday that
firefighters - representing only 2 per cent of the local government pay bill
 -would return to their special pay formula in 1994-95.
Manual and white-collar local government employees are likely to get some
national-level pay rise, but that could be supplemented at local level by
private-sector-style productivity bargaining.
A bigger question mark hangs over relatively privileged groups such as
teachers and nurses who have done well in recent years from the pay review
bodies.
Many schools are likely to have no money for increasing salaries and it is
difficult to increase teacher productivity. The demand for nurses is also in
decline as the job is restructured and many hospitals will try to target
money on patients before staff. Both groups do have public sympathy,
however, and several teaching unions were yesterday threatening action.
The Civil Service is also likely to feel the squeeze, although the shedding
of jobs through market testing might allow for some quite big rises. Civil
Service unions yesterday complained that they were being denied access to to
this year's Whitehall productivity gains and so would be unable to bargain
in line with government strictures.
Mr Alan Johnson, leader of the UCW, the main post union, complained that as
pay was already linked to productivity improvements it might be in the
union's interest to pull out of the existing bargaining arrangements and go
for a big one-off pay rise. Mr Jimmy Knapp, head of the RMT rail union, said
that productivity improvements depended on investment.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Unions attack Dorrell inflation claim: Public-sector workers
will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain
their standards of living, say pay analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUGGESTION from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the
Treasury, that Britain has become an 'inflation-free' economy without the
need for annual pay rises was dismissed as premature yesterday by pay
bargainers representing both employers and employees.
Pay analysts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, say
that public-sector workers will need pay rises of at least 3 per cent in
1994-95 merely to maintain living standards, taking account of the expected
inflation rate, the increase in National Insurance and increases in VAT on
fuel.
But according to one senior Whitehall official Mr Dorrell and the government
are taking advantage of fortuitous circumstances to deliver another blow to
the inflationary expectations that still haunt Britain's pay bargaining
system.
The official said: 'What better time to turn the screw when you have a
recovering economy, low inflation, and cowed public-sector workers?'
The Confederation of British Industry, which for the second year running has
had an important influence on public pay policy, also stresses the
continuing downward pressure on pay in the private sector and the lack of
'catch-up' in those companies emerging from pay freezes.
The shorter-term objectives of a second year of pay control in the public
sector are twofold - to keep the tightest possible control on public
spending while escaping the straitjacket of this year's 1.5 per cent limit.
Two of the most telling criticisms of the 1.5 per cent limit for 1993-94
were that it would be difficult to come out of, and that it was holding up
the introduction of more flexible private-sector-style pay arrangements in
the public sector.
The shift to a policy of zero growth in pay bills, with pay rises coming
from productivity increases, allows that flexibility. Indeed Mr Jack Dromey,
the senior local government negotiator for the TGWU general union, said that
the government's 'hidden agenda' was to encourage a further break-up of
national bargaining in the public sector with very low - or zero - national
rises supplemented by local productivity deals.
However, there remain problems ahead for the new pay policy. Mr Charles
Nolda, head of negotiations at the Local Government Management Board, said
that any significant pay increase might have to be paid for by cuts in
services and therefore jobs. He pointed to the difficulty in imposing
restraint in the public sector without similar restraint in the private
sector.
Mr Alistair Hatchett, of Incomes Data Services, said many pay rises in the
private sector had been bought at the expense of high job-shedding. If the
same trend was to emerge in the public sector 'unemployment could soon be
back over 3m'.
There is also a looming conflict between the government's new policy and the
various independent mechanisms for setting pay in the public sector - in
particular the pay review bodies, which cover about 1.5m workers from judges
to nurses, and the indexing formulas covering not only special groups such
as firefighters and police but also civil servants.
It appears that the pay review bodies will continue to make recommendations
for 1994-95 - unlike for the current year's 1.5 per cent limit - but many
people sitting on the review bodies are already disgruntled and some may
resign if they feel that they are being overruled again.
A broader problem is the growing divergence between public- and
private-sector pay that a second year of restraint would produce, and the
effect that would have on the ability of the public sector to recruit and
retain the workers and managers it needs.
Average pay in the public sector is higher than the private sector because
there are more white-collar workers in the public sector. When comparing
similar jobs, pay in the private sector is usually higher than in the public
sector except for the low-paid and women workers.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France makes war on Hollywood
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as an
American attempt to use the Gatt world trade negotiations to swamp Europe
with Hollywood films.
Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Pounds 5.7m) in aid to encourage
film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also
warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a Gatt agreement were to cover
the cinema, the French government 'will not sign it'.
France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over
agriculture, and would probably allow itself to be outvoted on any
audiovisual deal.
But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into
its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture.
Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park were already taking too large a
slice of the French cinema market, the minister said Gatt's principle of
non-discrimination would make it impossible for France to keep its regular
FFr1.3bn a year subsidy for the making of French films and its requirement
that French broadcasters air 60 per cent EC-made films.
Paris argues that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by
claiming a total 'exception' for it. But the European Commission says that
by including audiovisual products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of
this sensitive cultural area, the EC would be better placed to defend
broadcasting legislation, as well as tougher national provisions, from
unilateral US attack in the future.
Lisa Bransten adds from Washington: Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in
charge of trade, said yesterday Europe and the US would lose all credibility
with other Gatt members if they could not reach agreement and conclude the
Uruguay Round by the December 15 deadline.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Demand outstripping health funds - A
survey by a group of world pharmaceutical companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the efforts of many countries to reform their healthcare systems,
the gap between demand for health services and the funds available to pay
for them will continue to grow, according to a new survey published today.
The survey, which covers the health services in 12 countries, has been
financed by 40 of the world's largest drug companies. They have formed a new
organisation, Pharmaceutical Partners for Better Healthcare, to lobby for
health reforms to meet the growing demand.
Next week, President Bill Clinton is due to announce his reform package for
the US health system, including compulsory membership of healthcare schemes
for all citizens. The survey, which has been seen by the task force
producing Mr Clinton's reforms, endorses many of the elements expected to be
in the package.
The survey says all countries are facing rising health costs. Figures from
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that
spending on health as a proportion of national income has more than doubled
for many countries in 30 years. The UK now spends three times as much in
real terms on healthcare per person as 30 years ago, the US and Germany four
times and France five times.
The two main causes of this growth are technological innovation, which has
led to new and more expensive types of treatment, and demographic change,
with growing numbers of elderly people who use more health services.
The growth is faster than many countries think they can afford, according to
the survey. Most of the 12 countries surveyed have launched reform
programmes, but these are often deeply unpopular.
In many cases, countries are resorting to short-term measures to curb the
growth in costs. But piecemeal measures are often counter-productive, the
survey says, since saving money in one sector often forces up costs
elsewhere. Introducing charges for consulting family doctors, for example,
will increase demand for hospital treatment if that remains free.
The survey argues that only structural reforms, which should aim to create
systems that provide incentives for doctors and patients to economise, will
work in the long run.
On present projections, demand for health services will outstrip funding by
between 2 per cent of GDP in the US and 9 per cent in the UK and the
Netherlands, calculates the National Economic Research Associates, the
economic consultants who carried out the survey.
The NERA survey identifies principles that should guide healthcare reform.
These include compulsory competitive insurance systems which guarantee a
basic package of health services.
None of the 12 countries provides a perfect model, according to NERA, though
the ideal prototype partly resembles reforms now being implemented in the
Netherlands.
In the US, with its private insurance system, universal access to basic
health services is the key to reform, the survey says. For European
countries with tax-funded health systems, such as Britain or Sweden, more
competition is required to provide incentives for greater efficiency.
Mr Richard Rapp of NERA says: 'There are many lessons to be learned from the
experiences of other countries. But don't look to any of the countries for
the answer.'
Patient choice is an essential element in increasing efficiency. If an
insurer fails to keep costs down, their members should be able to change to
other, cheaper insurers. But patients should also be expected to contribute
towards the cost of their healthcare to foster cost-conscious behaviour.
The role of governments is to set standards and define the range of services
to which everyone is entitled.
While governments should not have a dominant role in financing or monitoring
the system, they are the only bodies that can launch the legislative and
administrative changes needed for structural reform, the survey concludes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a
North American Free Trade Agreement.
'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of
the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good
paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The ceremony was for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge
side agreements. Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford all urged support
for the deal.
In Mexico City, however, President Carlos Salinas yesterday played down the
importance of Nafta, in apparent response to concerns that the treaty might
be rejected by the US Congress. He said neither the treaty nor the side
accords were a panacea.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Study sets out model scheme to close gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pharmaceutical companies' study sets out the features of a healthcare
system that could use competitive market forces to close the gap between
demand for health services and the funds available to pay for them.
They describe this model (see picture on left)as a prototype, which
countries seeking to reform their health systems could work towards. At its
heart is a basic package of health services, available to all regardless of
ability to pay.
Every citizen would be required to sign up for healthcare insurance from
competing insurers.
To stop insurers from selecting only the healthiest customers, they would
have to accept all applicants.
Each individual would pay a two-part health insurance premium. The first,
related to income, would go into a central 'risk adjustment' fund, and
redistributed to insurers, with more going to those with most unhealthy
members.
The other part would be paid directly to the insurer by the member, as a
sort of membership fee. Insurers would be allowed to set their own premium
rates for the basic package, so the more efficient would be able to undercut
their rivals.
The insurers would buy the services from competing healthcare providers such
as hospitals, doctors and pharmacists.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Victory for Glaxo on asthma drug in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical group, will continue not to face
generic competition in the US against its second best-selling drug,
Ventolin, following a meeting of two Food and Drug Administration advisory
committees yesterday.
The committees, covering pulmonary and oncology affairs, and generic
products, concluded they could not yet agree a way for generic companies to
produce versions of off-patent asthma treatments delivered through inhalers.
Although Ventolin is off-patent in the US, there is no method for generics
groups to manufacture a device that delivers the correct dosage into the
lungs.
The two bodies were concerned about both the safety and efficacy of generic
inhaled asthma products. They decided further work was required to create
the protocols for generic devices to be licensed.
The decision is positive for Glaxo, and Schering-Plough of the US, whose
drug Proventil was also being considered.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Old-style peasant rebellions - Alison
Maitland explains the tradition behind French farm protests, and the way
other countries' farmers make their feelings known
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr David Evans, director general of Britain's National Farmers' Union,
joined an international lobby organised by French farmers against the US-EC
farm trade deal in Strasbourg last December, he was wounded in the leg by a
rocket fired by a French protester.
It was symptomatic of a clash of tactics. While French farmers try to
blockade Paris today in the latest show of force against the Blair House
agreement, their counterparts in Britain and other EC countries, will be
trying to win the minds of their politicians.
The scenes from French television are familiar - burning tyres, blocked
railways, streets piled high with potatoes, truckloads of mud dumped outside
government offices, bloodied farmers clashing with riot police. In countries
such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the agricultural sector contributes
far more to GDP and employs a much larger percentage of the workforce - yet
it is French farmers who always steal the headlines with their high-profile
protests.
That is partly because France is the EC's main agricultural powerhouse and
the world's biggest farm exporter after the US, giving it the strength to
make or break the Uruguay Round.
But French farmers are able to pursue the tradition of jacquerie, or peasant
revolt, which goes back to the 14th century, because they have so much
domestic support. Today's planned demonstration is by Co-ordination Rurale,
a splinter group which broke with the main FNSEA union in 1991, saying it
was too moderate.
'There's a large amount of public sympathy for the rural interest, which you
don't get to the same extent in other EC countries,' says Mr Brian Gardner,
director of EPA Associates, a Brussels-based agricultural consultancy. 'The
French have a quasi-religious attitude to food and the rural sector. . .
there's still a tremendous tolerance of the poor, under-privileged peasant
as the urban majority sees him.'
The proportion of the workforce engaged in agriculture has fallen from 22.5
per cent in 1960 to just 6 per cent today, but that is still three times the
level of Britain. There are few French families who do not have a relative
working on the land or own a rural retreat.
French farmers take to the streets before important EC councils like the one
which will bring foreign and agriculture ministers together to discuss the
US-EC draft farm trade deal next Monday. 'It's part of the theatre, of
creating the right atmosphere to get what they want,' says Mr Gardner. 'They
have tacit support from the government because of the tenderness of the
political relationship.'
Most French farmers vote for the right, but there is a strong Communist
constituency in the south and the Socialists also have farming support in
areas such as Brittany. No party can afford to ignore them.
Yet the more peaceful lobbying tactics used by farmers in other leading EC
countries are arguably just as effective.
As in France, the farming vote is pivotal in Germany, whose government's
stance on French demands for a renegotiation of Blair House will be crucial.
The Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian partner in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's CDU-led coalition, has significant backing from farmers in its
southern German power-base and their demands must be taken into account.
The German farmers' union, which claims to represent more than 90 per cent
of farmers, occasionally launches street demonstrations. But like Britain's
NFU, it prefers negotiation.
Big protests win little public tolerance in Germany. On the other hand, many
smallholders in western Germany also have jobs in factories, increasing
support for farming interests in urban communities. Farmers account for 3-4
per cent of the workforce in western Germany, and some 38 per cent are
estimated to be part-timers.
The German farm lobby has been effective at getting a good deal out of the
CAP and the German government, says Prof Wyn Grant of Warwick University, an
expert on farming lobbies. 'They've relied on their links with the political
parties, particularly the CSU and the FDP, and with civil servants behind
the scenes.'
He points out that the EC's 'green money' system has until now worked in
their favour, preserving them from cuts in Ecu-based farm prices which would
normally have resulted from the strength of the D-Mark.
The NFU in Britain is one of the country's most powerful pressure groups.
Its president has constant access to the agriculture minister and ministry
officials studiously consult producers whenever new proposals are on the
table. British farmers traditionally vote Conservative and links with the
party are close, although support has been ebbing away to the Liberal
Democrats in the last couple of years.
The union prides itself that its style of lobbying forced changes to the CAP
reform proposals which would have put England's large farmers at a
particular disadvantage.
The NFU has rejected confrontation partly because it already has a struggle
maintaining a good public image. Farmers, for all their protests to the
contrary, are still popularly regarded as wealthy landowners. Improving
their public standing, for example by supporting a Gatt deal even though it
will cause farmers further pain, is seen as even more vital now that CAP
reforms are making the size of EC support payments more transparent.
Nonetheless, today's anti-Gatt demonstration around Paris will be watched
closely by farmers both in the EC and in the US.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Brittan in Uruguay Round plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, said yesterday Europe
and the US would lose all credibility with other Gatt members if they could
not reach agreement and conclude the Uruguay Round by the December 15
deadline.
'We have sufficient will and sufficient determination to proceed,' he said,
adding that the US had consulted widely with its trading partners before
fixing the deadline with Congress. This refuted a French suggestion that the
US had imposed the December 15 deadline on the rest of the world and must
therefore be held responsible if the round cannot be completed by that date.
Speaking at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast, On the Gatt, he suggested that
the US-EC Blair House deal could not be approved until there was agreement
on agricultural issues in the Uruguay Round as a whole.
Sir Leon brushed aside the question of whether French objections over the
US-EC Blair House deal on agriculture will be allowed to sink the Round well
before the final leg of the negotiations proceeds.
He said EC members could not formally agree to any part of Blair House until
they have a comprehensive package on agricultural issues through the Uruguay
Round. 'It is part of an ongoing process and at the end of the day nobody is
asked to take a position until a whole deal is available.
'In setting (the deadline) the US consulted widely with the international
community; we if anything argued for a slightly shorter deadline,' he said.
He warned Americans that the US offer of tariff reduction proposals on
apparel and clothing was insufficient. Japan and the newly industrialised
countries must also improve their offers on financial services and
agriculture and cut tariffs in sectors such as shoes and leather goods.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: New drugs lobby fights for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICAL Partners for Better Healthcare, the organisation that
commissioned the NERA survey, is a group of 40 of the largest pharmaceutical
companies from around the developed world.
They have come together to lobby for reform of national health systems
because of their fears that pressures on health budgets are undermining
their businesses.
In many countries, short-term measures to cut health spending have included
restrictions on prescribing branded pharmaceuticals and the use of new and
expensive treatments.
Helping countries with structural reform of their health services appears to
be the best way for the drugs companies to fight such restrictions and
ensure a healthy market for pharmaceuticals in the future.
As Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of Pharmaceutical Partners, puts it: 'We see our
customers in difficulty and we want to help them get into shape.'
Pharmaceutical Partners is anxious to avoid the charge that it is a
short-term response to developments such as President Bill Clinton's health
reforms and budget cuts in Germany. The NERA survey was commissioned in
April 1992, before Mr Clinton had won the presidential nomination.

But Mr Philippe Arnaud, a leader of the hardline Co-ordination Rurale which

to bolster, not thwart, government demands for a better deal for French
farming.
'We just want to show that there are some Robin Hoods determined to defend
their way of life,' he told Le Figaro newspaper.

FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Presidents join to sell Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of
bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts
about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a
North American Free Trade Agreement.
'We will make our case as hard and as well as we can,' he told supporters of
the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good
paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.'
The ceremony - for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge
side agreements - began with a spine-tingling entrance of Presidents
Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the
Chief.
Vice President Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series
of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta.
He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world
war, as 'how we won the cold war. . . how we promoted peace and
reconciliation in the Middle East.'
Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three
ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with
several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta
debate in a way that has been wholly lacking before as about whether
Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to
resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'.
Workers have become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is behind most of the
opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in a time of change,
the only way to recover your security is to broaden your horizons and to
adapt to the change. . .
'If we learned anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of
the governments of eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot
resist the winds of change,' he said.
Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Jimmy Carter to
take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a
demagogue. . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely
careless with the truth'.

FT  15 SEP 93 / US retail sales point to stronger growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy may be gathering momentum after a lacklustre first half,
figures released yesterday indicated.
The Commerce Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent between July
and August, the biggest increase since the spring. Wall Street analysts had
predicted an increase of 0.2 per cent or less. The annual rate of inflation
was unchanged at 2.8 per cent.
Separate data for retail sales pointed to stronger than expected consumer
spending. Officials said retail sales rose 0.2 per cent last month and by
6.3 per cent compared with August last year. Figures for July were revised
substantially to show a gain relative to June of 0.3 per cent against a
previous estimate of 0.1 per cent.
Analysts at Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, said the figures were
consistent with growth of real consumer spending at a robust annual rate of
3.5-4.0 per cent in the third quarter.
Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the figures implied the economy
was 'on track' to achieve the acceleration of growth predicted in the
Clinton administration's recent 'mid-session' economic forecast.
The economy grew at a disappointing annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the first
half. The White House and many private sector forecasters are predicting
growth at an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent in this half.
The strongest components of retail sales last month were sectors sensitive
to interest rates that have benefited from a sharp recent decline in
long-term rates to the lowest levels in a generation.
Sales of building materials, hardware and mobile homes rose 1.8 per cent
last month and 11.6 per cent in the year to August. Sales of motor vehicles
and parts rose 0.7 per cent and 14.3 per cent respectively.
Overall, sales of durable goods (items lasting several years) rose 0.6 per
cent last month and 12.1 per cent in the year to August. The figures are not
adjusted for inflation.

The US Senate approved a Dollars 261bn (Pounds 169.4bn) defence bill

the military, Reuter reports from Washington.
The Senate passed the bill by 92-7. The House of Representatives expects to
complete its version of the bill next week.
The Senate voted last week to ask the president to get Congress's approval
by November 15 for keeping troops in Somalia. It made the request in a
non-binding resolution, added to the defence bill, that also urged Mr
Clinton to tell Congress by October 15 his objectives in Somalia.

<TEXT>
BRITISH and US transport negotiators said yesterday they had made good
progress towards a further liberalisation of trans-Atlantic air travel after
talks in Washington.
Further progress will depend, however, on how the Clinton administration
responds to a recent report from a US airline commission recommending that
foreign airlines be allowed more leeway to acquire holdings in US companies.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said after four hours of talks
with his US counterpart, Mr Federico Pena, that the discussions represented
'a very important step forward'. The talks are aimed at giving airlines more
freedom in deciding fares and routes. The UK government is also keen for
British Airways to be allowed to complete the purchase of a 49 per cent
stake in USAir. British Airways' holding has been blocked at under 25 per
cent.
Further talks are due in October. The two sides hope to reach agreement by
April.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco yesterday looked further isolated from his
main political supporters, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement
(PMDB), after the resignation of another PMDB minister from the government,
and the threatened departure of two more.
Mr Coutinho Jorge, environment minister, resigned on Monday night as part of
the dispute over whether the PMDB should have a greater role in formulating
policy. His departure followed the ending on Sunday of the PMDB's
conference, which provided a focus for discontent within the party.
Two other ministers, as well as the government leader in the senate, offered
to resign. But they were persuaded by the president to stay, at least until
next week when the PMDB, the largest party in Congress, is due to decide
whether to formally split with the government.
The PMBD's main argument is with President Itamar Franco, who has made a
number of senior appointments without consulting the party.
The row overshadowed a press conference yesterday by Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the finance minster, designed to assess the first three months of
his 'plan of immediate action', launched in June.
Mr Cardoso outlined progress made in areas like agreements on state debts
and greater transparency of central bank and treasury accounts. He repeated
earlier pledges that there could be 'no magic plans' to reduce inflation,
running at nearly 2,000 per cent.
Mr Cardoso had planned a higher profile address on television but had to
cancel the arrangements because of speculation he was about to launch a
'shock' plan to tackle inflation.
Mr Cardoso said private research suggested Brazil would grow 5 per cent this
year, its best performance since 1986.
Tax revenues in the first half of the year were 31 per cent higher than the
same period last year, and the government has signed agreements with 11
states on rolling over debts. A further six are due to sign agreements
today, he said.

<TEXT>
SENATOR Donald Riegle, chairman of the US Senate banking committee,
yesterday said he planned to start work in November on legislation extending
the right of banks to open branches across state boundaries, George Graham
writes from Washington.
This follows a comprehensive endorsement by Mr Eugene Ludwig, who as
Comptroller of the Currency is the principal bank regulator in the federal
government, of the need for banks to be allowed to open branches in other
states. Mr Ludwig also argued for banks to be allowed to sell insurance and
other financial services.
The US has a complicated patchwork of banking laws which broadly prohibit
the setting up of nationwide branch networks.

FT  15 SEP 93 / IMF lends less to members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund promised much reduced financial support for
member countries last year in spite of a massive increase in its resources.
In its annual report, the IMF disclosed yesterday that the Fund made
financial commitments to members with economic problems of 3.2bn Special
Drawing Rights (Dollars 4.54bn/Pounds 2.94bn) in the year to the end of
April, down from SDR8.1bn in 1991-1992. The IMF's members increased their
quotas, or capital backing the Fund's operations, to SDR144.6bn at the end
of April from SDR91.2bn the year before.
The Fund said the drop in commitments mainly reflected improved economic
performance in many developing countries, particularly in Latin America. At
the same time, demand for IMF resources from new members in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union was less than expected.
Although the IMF has been expecting a surge in demand for its resources for
some time, the total outstanding credit that it provided increased only
moderately to SDR28.5bn in the past financial year from SDR26.74bn in
1991-1992. It was therefore well below the recent peak of nearly SDR40bn
recorded in 1984-1985.
Support for former Communist countries made up most of the SDR2bn promised
by the IMF under its usual stand-by facilities last year: the remaining
SDR1.2bn committed was longer-term financing to Peru, Jamaica and Zimbabwe.
The flow of IMF funds to former Soviet countries and eastern Europe is set
to gather pace, however. In the Fund's current financial year, Kyrgyzstan
and Russia have made drawings of nearly SDR1.1bn on a new, temporary
'systemic transformation facility' (STF) set up in April to help former
communist countries adapt to market-based economic systems.
According to IMF officials, a loan for Moldova is pending under the
facility, and Kyrgyzstan is expected to qualify for a second loan. Others
interested in STF assistance include Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Slovak
Republic and Russia.
The IMF has a very strong liquidity position to deal with these rising
demands. The report disclosed an increase in the IMF's usable liquid
resources to SDR52.2bn in 1992-93 from SDR20.9bn the year before. The ratio
of liquid liabilities to usable liquid resources - the liquidity ratio -
increased to 155 per cent from 81.6 per cent.
The IMF also reported a decline, for the first time in a decade, in the
members' arrears, from SDR3.5bn to SDR3bn. Peru successfully eliminated its
arrears to the IMF in the past financial year.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Hopes for facility to aid reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund will seek approval for two measures to
support developing and former communist economies at its annual meeting this
month. But it is likely to move forward on only one.
The IMF hopes progress will be made towards agreeing the financing of a new
'structural adjustment' facility to help low-income developing countries
carry out market-oriented economic reform programmes.
But Fund plans for a modest allocation to members of its own reserve asset,
the Special Drawing Right, are expected to fall foul of a US veto and
opposition from other leading industrial countries, including Germany and
possibly Britain.
The IMF wants a SDR36bn (Dollars 51bn/Pounds 33bn) allocation that would
bolster the international reserves of developing and former communist
nations. Officials argue that it would stimulate world trade, restore the
share of the SDR in global reserves to the 5.3 per cent average of the years
between 1971 and 1991 and remove an inequity: 38 members have joined the
Fund since the last allocation of SDRs and so never benefited from such a
boost to their financial resources.
Both matters are due to be discussed at a meeting of the IMF's policy-making
Interim Committee on September 26, ahead of the formal three-day meeting of
the IMF and World Bank that begins in Washington two days later.
In its annual report, published yesterday, the IMF said its board of
directors reached broad agreement that a new structural adjustment facility
worth SDR6bn should be provided to replace the existing Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) which expires at the end of November.
The ESAF, which has provided funds at subsidised interest rates of 0.5 per
cent to 19 poor developing nations, was judged to have been a success.
However, with virtually all industrialised countries experiencing budgetary
constraint, differences exist on how to finance a successor to the ESAF.
A suggestion, put forward by Britain's former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont,
that the IMF should sell some of its gold holdings to finance a new ESAF
appears to have been dropped.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Knesset vote hangs on judgment of Rabbi
Yosef - The battle shaping in parliament over the peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Israel's historic peace agreement with Palestinians could rest
on the decisions of a shadowy 73-year-old ultra-orthodox rabbi who has
emerged as a powerbroker during the last five years.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, was due back home last night to face a
considerable challenge in mustering the parliamentary votes he considers
necessary to pass the peace accord. He could be forced into calling a
national referendum.
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the country's leading ultra-orthodox oriental clergyman,
is unelected but he controls the Shas party which has six critical
parliamentary seats. Last week it quit the Labour-led government over
charges of corruption levelled against leaders.
How Shas votes in next week's Knesset debate on the peace agreement will
decide whether Mr Rabin is forced into holding a referendum. The
Baghdad-born rabbi has been keeping his cards close to his chest, saying he
will decide how Shas will vote only after the Jewish New Year, which ends on
Sunday. But Mr Arye Deri, the parliamentary leader of Shas and former
interior minister, said yesterday he had recommended the rabbi should
'demand and insist' on a referendum to be held together with local elections
due in early November.
Mr Deri also said he had instructed the interior ministry, before he
formally left the building yesterday, to prepare the 'infrastructure, law
proposals and all the technical means for holding a referendum'.
Although the prime minister has a 61-59 majority for the peace agreement in
the Knesset he has consistently said he would not allow a peace agreement to
be passed if it depended for passage on the five Arab parliamentarians.
'If we will have 61 votes for the agreement and 59 against we will go to a
referendum,' Mr Eli Dayan, head of Labour's parliamentary faction, said
yesterday. 'But if Shas and others abstain we will have to reconsider what
to do.' Mr Ran Cohen, an MP of the left-wing Meretz bloc which is a part of
the coalition, said his party would fight a referendum.
Labour party officials said Mr Rabin would mount a lobbying campaign to
convince Rabbi Yosef to support the agreement or, at the very least,
instruct Shas to abstain in next Wednesday's vote. Mr Rabin is also hoping
to win support from the three Knesset members of Agudat Yisrael, a faction
within the orthodox United Judaism Torah Party.
At least one right-wing dissident - Mr Ronni Milo, a senior MP of the
opposition Likud party who is running for mayor of Tel Aviv - may also
abstain or vote for the agreement. If Mr Rabin could win all nine floating
Knesset votes he would have a 70-50 majority and would not be forced to call
a referendum.
Much will depend on how Rabbi Yosef, who rarely gives interviews, interprets
Jewish law. In 1989 the cleric returned from a visit to Egypt and issued a
'halachic' rabbinical ruling declaring that giving up part of the biblical
land of Israel was less important than the greater religious obligation of
saving human life.
A year later he brought down a national unity government led by Likud after
it rejected talks with Palestinians. 'This might have led us, heaven forbid,
to war,' he said at the time.
Agudat Yisrael is also considering its position in the light of rabbinical
teaching and is likely to be influenced by Rabbi Yosef's decision.
Mr Deri has said the prime minister has so far failed to convince Rabbi
Yosef that his ruling of 'giving away territories to save lives applies to
the present agreement. There is a great danger to the lives of the settlers.
There are great pressures on Rabbi Yosef to vote against the agreement. We
have no obligation to vote for it - we are completely free.'
Clouding the issue is whether Shas will remain in coalition. Mr Deri has
alleged that charges prepared against him of fraud, breach of public trust
and misallocation of government funds to Shas-supported religious schools
and institutions are part of a wider campaign of discrimination against
Sephardic or oriental Jews originating from North Africa, Spain and the
Middle East by the larger and more dominant Ashkenazi or European Jews. Shas
is wary of quitting the government for fear of losing the power to deliver
funds and benefits to its supporters.
If Mr Rabin is forced to call a referendum, political experts say he stands
a good chance of gaining majority public support for the peace agreement.
Latest public opinion polls show a 65 per cent majority among Israeli Jews
for the agreement. A referendum would also include the votes of 800,000
Israeli Arabs who would support the accord.
However, polls have shown that among those Jews who support the agreement a
large percentage have security fears and could be influenced by a right-wing
campaign for a No vote.

THE meeting in Rabat yesterday between King Hassan of Morocco and Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was less surprising than it might seem. In
July 1986, when most of the Arab world would not acknowledge Israel's right
to exist, King Hassan received Mr Shimon Peres, then Israeli premier, whom
he had met more discreetly on a number of occasions.
Mr Rabin said he had paid a secret visit to Morocco in October 1976, while
Mr Peres had paid two secret visits to the king in 1978 and March 1981,
before paying him a public visit, as Israeli prime minister, in 1986. 'We
consulted with the king on how to help the atmosphere in the Arab world and
the many problems which lie ahead,' Mr Rabin said.
Before that, Israeli officials slipped into Morocco repeatedly to prepare
for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977.
The protection given Jewish subjects runs deep in Morocco and King Hassan
has more than once reminded his Arab peers that no law forbids a man to talk
to his enemies.
When asked when Morocco would recognise Israel officially, Mr Rabin said
that 'the very kindness, warmness of the king's reception and his readiness
to assist speak for themselves.' The king enjoys good relations with most
Middle East leaders, including Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. Over the
past decade the monarch has successfully steered his country towards
economic reform and has sought to tie it more closely to Europe. When the
king applied for Moroccan membership of the EC in 1987 his request prompted
incredulity and scorn.
But last winter the EC agreed to a Moroccan request to negotiate what
promises to be one of the closest partnership treaties covering free trade
and political co-operation between the Community and a non-EC country.
Yesterday the EC bureau in Rabat said the Community had allocated Ecu80m
(Pounds 61.28m) to Morocco to finance state education and health projects
for the poor.
The king has long argued that talks between the PLO and Israel are crucial
to lasting peace in the Middle East. If the peace drive gains momentum and
Morocco's negotiations with the EC bear fruit, King Hassan will have
provided a bridge between east and west.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: End to isolation beckons as taboo fades
on Israel ties - The economic dividends of a likely 'domino effect' of
recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'DOMINO EFFECT' of Arab and Islamic states announcing recognition of
Israel was predicted yesterday by Israeli officials after Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, paid a surprise visit to Morocco.
Israelis said an expected tumbling of the diplomatic and trade wall which
has surrounded the Jewish state since its creation in 1948 could fuel a boom
in trade, investment and tourism. This could help to consolidate Israeli
public support for the peace agreements reached this week with Palestinians
and with Jordan.
'There's no doubt that this is an opening of the door for many other
countries,' said Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, who said steps
towards diplomatic relations with Morocco would be a 'formalisation of
existing relations' in tourism, economic co-operation and trade.
Mr Avi Beker, director of the Israel Council on Foreign relations, said:
'There is a domino effect. It is no longer a taboo to talk with Israel and
have relations and the major psychological barriers have now been
demolished.'
Experts say that recognition by Morocco would lead quickly to ties with
moderate countries among the 50 Islamic and Arab countries that currently
boycott Israel.
Zimbabwe's announcement that it was considering recognition of Israel
yesterday is also expected to have a knock-on effect on developing countries
and members of the non-aligned movement.
Early candidates for recognition include Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia. In remarks published in yesterday's respected
Hebrew daily Ha'aretz, Mr Mahathir Mohamed, Malaysian prime minister, said:
'As the Israelis have changed their position we should consider the
possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with them, especially after
the Palestinians recognised Israel.'
Mr Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Omani foreign minister, began a tour of
Arab states yesterday to discuss 'new realities'.
'This can change the whole reality of Israel within the Middle East,' said
Mr Beker. ' Before Israel was completely isolated and surrounded by enemies
who were against its existence and looked for allies on the periphery like
Turkey and Ethiopia. Now Israel is moving towards its geographic place with
its neighbours like Jordan and Egypt which is quite revolutionary.'
Israelis are split about the economic impact of the expected change in their
status. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, has spoken optimistically about a
Middle Eastern common market, regional integration projects and joint
ventures. A study carried out by the Tel Aviv University economic department
has predicted that Israel could boost its exports by Dollars 2.2bn, a 22 per
cent increase, to five Arab countries when trade barriers come down.
In a sign of the link between diplomatic and trade relations, an economic
delegation including Mr Jacob Frenkel, Israel's central bank governor, and
Mr Amiram Sivan, head of bank Hapoalim, is expected in Morocco soon to sign
economic and aviation agreements and to discuss the possibility of a joint
bank with the kingdom. The optimists will be buoyed by statements made by
international fund managers about investing in Israel.
However, other Israelis are less optimistic about the economic dividends,
pointing to the fact that 14 years of 'cold peace' with Egypt has not
yielded significant benefits.
'I think Israel will face major opportunities in economic co-operation but
mainly in terms of export markets and import of natural resources but
nothing as far reaching as a Middle East common market as envisioned by the
optimists,' said Mr Beker.
Israel still faces an uphill struggle in striking a peace with its other two
neighbours - Syria and Lebanon. Furthermore Israel will continue to face
hostility from Arab and Islamic states such as Iran, Iraq and Libya which
continue to influence developments and could pose a military threat to the
Jewish state either directly or through proxy forces.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Arafat put to the test over declaration,
says Rabin - How the PLO leader must balance himself between Israel's
demands and his constituents' expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOMBRE note struck on Monday evening by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, following the signing of the declaration of principles with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, underlines just how much negotiating work
has to be done before either side can feel confident about the intentions of
the other.
While acknowledging the commitments made by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, in agreeing the document, Mr Rabin said he would believe that a
real breakthrough had been made only if the PLO fulfilled its pledges. 'We
have decided to take a chance, to put him to the test,' said Mr Rabin.
Much of Mr Rabin's caution inevitably stems from the long and bloody history
of Israel-PLO relations. But the publication of the declaration of
principles signed at the White House also reveals the extent to which Mr
Arafat appears to have compromised on the declared aims of the Palestinian
negotiating team during the previous rounds of talks in Washington.
Whether those compromises are primarily a tactical shift by Mr Arafat to win
Israeli recognition for the PLO and reassert his weakening hold on the
organisation, or represent a more fundamental reappraisal of what the
Palestinians can realistically hope to achieve, should slowly emerge as the
negotiators seek to put flesh on the broad principles that have been agreed.
The two critical areas will be security, which is likely to be Mr Rabin's
personal touchstone in judging the performance of the PLO, and on the extent
to which the Palestinians will accept far more limited powers for the
interim self-governing authority than they had previously demanded.
Mr Arafat has accepted that the Palestinian Interim Self-Governing
Authority, which will administer 'West Bank and Gaza strip territory' for a
five-year period, will not touch on such issues as the status of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements, refugees, security arrangements and relations with
neighbouring countries. Instead it will administer areas such as education,
health, welfare and tourism, while also building up a local police force, a
role previously rejected by the Palestinian negotiating team as being akin
to acting as the administrators for the occupation force.
They had said repeatedly that such a deal would not be acceptable to the
majority of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Instead they demanded an
elected authority with important legislative functions, which would also
have some competence on highly contentious issues such as the ownership of
land and the utilisation of water resources.
The ambition of the Palestinian team at the earlier rounds of Washington
talks had clearly been to acquire as many of the attributes of a future
independent state as possible, while Israel was equally determined to resist
making such concessions.
If, as seems possible, Mr Arafat has in large part abandoned that aim, the
negotiations over the powers assigned to the interim self-governing
authority could proceed relatively smoothly.
But if the PLO leader finds it increasingly difficult to build and sustain a
Palestinian consensus once the initial euphoria of international recognition
subsides, then the issues which blocked progress at the Washington
negotiations could quickly resurface.
The challenge of reconciliation among the Palestinians in the occupied
territories will bear even more heavily on the issue of security. Within
three months Israel and the PLO are due to have concluded an agreement
providing for the redeployment of Israel military forces from the Gaza Strip
and Jericho area and the phased introduction of a Palestinian police force.
Until very recently, Mr Rabin's premiership had been notable primarily for
its vigorous response to security issues. The ejection of over 400
Palestinians from the occupied territories last December, the subsequent
travel ban on Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza into Israel, and the
week-long bombardment of Lebanon all confirmed that for Mr Rabin the safety
of Israelis came before building confidence that might promote peace.
While Mr Rabin might now fairly reflect that his toughness paid off, it
would be unwise of Mr Arafat to assume that the Washington agreement will
soften the Israeli response to further outbreaks of Palestinian violence.
In addition, the declaration of principles commits the the new Palestinian
police force to co-operate with Israeli security forces in combating Hamas
and other radical Islamic groups in the territories which remain committed
to the armed struggle.
And even after the redeployment of the Israeli army, Mr Arafat has agreed
that Israelis, military and civilian, may continue to use roads freely
within the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
All this leaves the PLO leader with a huge, and probably contradictory, list
of requirements to fulfil. Balancing himself between the demands of Mr Rabin
and the expectations of his constituents could well prove the greatest test
yet for Mr Arafat's formidable powers of survival.

THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank expects 'steady, sustainable non-inflationary
growth' of more than 2.5 per cent over the next two years, it said
yesterday.
Its six-monthly economic forecast was issued shortly before Mr Jim Bolger,
the prime minister, called a general election for November 6.
An opinion poll last night showed the National Party government with an
eight point lead in popularity over the opposition Labour party. Mr Bolger
said the Reserve Bank's report was proof the economy was in good health.
In New Zealand, the bank's six monthly statements are considered as
important as the budget, given its independence from political interference
in setting monetary policy with the goal of low inflation.
The statement was welcomed in the financial markets with sharp falls in
interest rates and a further rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar.
Mr Grant Spencer, the bank's chief economist, said it would remain wary
about inflation 'which always has upside potential when an economy is in
recovery mode.'
Gross domestic product is expected to grow 2.6 per cent in the year to next
March, and 3 per cent in the 12 months to March 1995. Underlying inflation

FT  15 SEP 93 / Investors rush to pour money into China

THE LURE of China's large and fast-expanding domestic market has made it the
biggest recipient of overseas investment among developing nations, according
to figures published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development yesterday.
It has also turned China into one of the leading recipients of foreign
investment worldwide. In the first six months of 1993, foreign direct
investment in China totalled Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 6.1bn), a 180 per cent
rise on the same period in 1992.
Investment last year rose by 40 per cent to Dollars 11bn, but the number of
approved foreign investment projects almost trebled to 49,000; and the
planned investment of more than Dollars 58bn was nearly four times higher
than in 1991.
The figures, given to an Unctad-sponsored conference in Beijing by Ms Wu Yi,
China's foreign trade minister, show that by mid-1993 some 135,000 Chinese
enterprises had overseas participation, with projected foreign investment of
nearly Dollars 170bn and actual investment of some Dollars 44bn. Enterprises
with foreign participation produced about 6 per cent of China's total
industrial output in 1992.
More than 100 countries and territories are now investing in China, the most
important being Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Japan, Singapore, Germany,
Britain, Thailand, France and Canada.
Ms Wu said the government was encouraging foreign direct investment outside
the coastal economic zones and noted that a fifth of such investment last
year was in inland provinces.
Foreign capital was now going into enterprises in the service sector, in
areas such as finance, property, insurance, retailing and consultancy.
The Beijing conference, attended by representatives of about 40
multinational companies, urged the Chinese government to improve conditions
for foreign investment.
Among the recommendations were further liberalisation of the service sector,
easier labour mobility for Chinese employees, reduced bureaucracy, increased
access to foreign exchange and more effective protection for intellectual
property.

MORE THAN 1,000 people are dying every day in Angola's protracted civil war
or from its effects, the highest death toll in any current conflict in the
world, the United Nations reported last night, writes Michael LIttlejohns,
UN Correspondent, in New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, said intensified
fighting had dramatically worsened already dire humanitarian problems. Some
three million Angolans, mostly women, children and the elderly, were victims
of what he termed a 'catastrophic' tragedy.
In a report to the Security Council, which was expected to act on it today,
Mr Boutros Ghali called for new measures to deliver international aid to the
needy. Saying a lasting peace could not be achieved through force, he urged
the government and Unita insurgents led by Dr Jonas Savimbi, to resume
ceasefire talks.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Namibia steps boldly along the path to statehood: New
currency could help cement country's political independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE and a half years after achieving its independence, Namibia yesterday
took a further step towards full statehood with the launch of its own
national currency, the Namibian dollar.
Although the move is mainly of symbolic importance - the South African rand
will for now remain legal tender in Namibia, with the currencies being used
in parallel at equal value - banks were yesterday expecting a clamour today
for the new notes.
At yesterday's launch ceremony at the Tintenpalast government buildings in
Windhoek, President Sam Nujoma insisted that the new currency would ensure
'that Namibia is not only politically independent, but financially as well.'
For some months the Bank of Namibia, the central bank, has been running a
publicity campaign with the slogan 'The Namibia dollar. Our money. Our
pride.' About Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of notes will be issued in the
first few days. They depict a famous fighter for independence, Captain
Hendrik Witbooi, on the front.
The launch of the dollar follows another important event this month - an
accord in principle with Pretoria that the port of Walvis Bay would be
handed over to Namibia next February.
In spite of a recession, business is generally happy with the way things
have gone since independence. Mr Abel Gower, executive director of CDM, the
De Beers diamonds subsidiary, comments that life for the company is
'certainly no more difficult than it was in the past'. He adds: 'If Namibia
is to be a model for South Africa, it is very encouraging.'
However, unemployment is high, probably over 30 per cent, crime has risen
and there are concerns about inefficiency and corruption in government.
When a top agriculture official was alleged to have appropriated funds to
help develop a private farm, he was dismissed, but no attempt was made to
prosecute him or recover any money.
But as Mr Gower notes, the problems of Namibia 'are very different from
problems in Africa which have mostly arisen from the pursuit of misguided
economic policies'. The government is operating within a market economy, and
the nationalisation contained in earlier rhetoric of the governing Swapo
party is a distant memory.
Instead, the worries are that the government simply lacks expertise
necessary to run an economy even of its modest proportions - with a
population of 1.4m, gross domestic product is R7bn (Pounds 1.36bn), about 40
per cent of the size of Zimbabwe's economy and two-thirds that of Botswana.
Mr John Kirkpatrick, chairman of Rossing Uranium and former central bank
board member, says: 'There is gross inefficiency in government. There are a
few well-run ministries, but most are disasters.'
A more worrying long-term trend is the deterioration in government finances.
Mr Gert Hanekom, finance minister, has had a difficult task. His tenure has
coincided with a commodity price downturn, crimping tax contributions from
the two main producers, Rossing and CDM, while South Africa, Namibia's main
trading partner, has been deeply mired in recession. Also, the new
government has been under pressure to address the apartheid legacy,
especially in social services.
Mr Hanekom says he shares the concern about the deficit, but believes 'we're
on the verge of reversing this trend'. He says initial projections for the
1994-95 and 1995-96 financial years show the deficit at below 5 per cent.
Such targets are met with scepticism in the business community where Mr
Hanekom is criticised for lack of consultation.
According to Mr Hanekom, the deficit will be contained by keeping
expenditure growth below inflation and improving revenues without lifting
tax rates. He believes an economic upturn will help close the deficit gap,
predicting that emergence from recession may bring GDP growth of 7 per cent
in 1994, moderating to 5-6 per cent in the two following years.
Perhaps the biggest threat to government finances is the size of the civil
service which now employs 63,000, compared with pre-independence levels of
54,000. Businessmen doubt whether the cabinet has the political will to
address the problem.

MITSUBISHI Motors and Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house which is
part of the same industrial group, are setting up a joint venture in Vietnam
to manufacture vehicles, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The Japanese companies have agreed to link up with Vietranscimex, a
Vietnamese national shipping and trading company, and Proton, the Malaysian
national car company, to assemble and sell vehicles in Vietnam.
The four companies, which will each hold a 25 per cent stake in the new
company, plan to begin assembling minibuses from mid-1994, on receiving
Hanoi's approval. The minibus will be modelled on Mitsubishi Motors' Delica.
Mitsubishi will be the second Japanese car company to invest in making cars
in Vietnam. Vietnam Motors, which is 70 per cent owned by foreign
shareholders including Nissan Diesel and Nichimen, the Japanese trading
house, already makes trucks and cars.
Car ownership in Vietnam was an estimated 210,000 in 1991, Mitsubishi says.
But the companies expectthe market could expand to 300,000 vehicles by 1995
and 430,000 by the year 2000.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Dismay over US stance on Hanoi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Vietnamese government and US companies expressed disappointment
yesterday at President Bill Clinton's decision to maintain US sanctions
against Hanoi.
The White House announced late on Monday a softening of the embargo, ruling
that US companies could participate in projects funded by international
organisations such as the World Bank but would not be permitted to conduct
other business. The US administration deemed Hanoi's efforts to solve cases
of American servicemen missing in the Vietnam war insufficient.
US executives in Hanoi are more frustrated by the decision than the
Vietnamese, who are already struggling to absorb more than Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) of promised investment from Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean,
French, British and Australian companies.
The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry described Mr Clinton's decision as
regrettable, but added: 'The US embargo does not hinder the economic renewal
of Vietnam and the ever-broadening relations in all fields between Vietnam
and other countries.
'It merely ties the hands of the American business community and deprives
them of the opportunity to compete on an equal footing in Vietnam.'
The Vietnamese do, however, want closer ties with the US in the long run to
counterbalance the regional influence of China and Japan and to ensure
Vietnam has access to US markets, technology and investment capital. None of
these is regarded as critical at this stage of Vietnam's economic
development - annual gross national product is not much more than Dollars
200 per head - but the communist government is eager to hold open projects
for future US involvement. Officials, for example, have made no secret of
their desire to have Mobil take part in the development of offshore
oilfields.
US executives in Hanoi, while hoping Mr Clinton will fully lift the embargo
before the end of the year, say the Vietnamese cannot be expected to keep
the door open for US companies much longer.
'We're sanctioning ourselves,' said Mr Greig Craft, who heads American
Service Co, a consultancy with an office in Hanoi. 'I would have said 12
months ago that the return of the US was critical to the successful
renovation of the Vietnamese economy. Now I don't think that's the case.
Vietnam has done a brilliant job of lobbying the rest of the world.'
The decision to allow US companies to bid for internationally-funded
projects may seem a reasonable compromise in Washington, US companies say,
but it has no immediate benefit.
It was only in July that Mr Clinton ended US opposition to multilateral
assistance for Vietnam, and the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
are still preparing projects in which US companies will be allowed to
participate. A donors' conference is to be held in Paris in November.
US companies poised to do business in Vietnam are also irritated because
many of the products and services they are forbidden to sell are widely
available in spite of the embargo.
Coca-Cola has signed two contracts worth Dollars 44m to produce soft drinks,
but is forbidden to execute them until the embargo is lifted.
Boeing may not sell aircraft, but a leased Boeing 737 from Switzerland is
used by Vietnam Airlines. Pirated US computer software is also widely
available.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Japanese price probe into cosmetics maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission has launched an investigation into alleged
price-fixing by subsidiaries of Shiseido, a leading cosmetics maker.
The anti-monopoly watchdog has been increasing the number of probes under
the new administration of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who has been calling for an
increase in consumer benefits. The commission's move is expected to
accelerate the unravelling of Japan's rigid retail and distribution systems,
which have helped maintain high retail prices.
FTC investigators raided distribution subsidiaries of Shiseido yesterday,
following claims by Kawachiya, a Tokyo-based discount retailer, that the
company had refused to sell it cosmetics.
Japan's leading cosmetics makers have maintained a tight grip on retail
pricing through affiliated wholesalers and retail networks. Although resale
price maintenance on cosmetics products was reduced to 24 items last year,
retailers continue to sell products at the manufacturers' suggested prices
due to the fear of shipment cancellations.
The investigation could affect prices of imported cosmetics, which have also
been sold at higher prices because of the overall price level of Japan's
cosmetics market. The sharp appreciation of the yen is increasing pressure
for import brands to be sold at lower prices.
The prolonged downturn in the economy has forced a growing number of
Japanese consumers to turn to discount retailers. Manufacturers, on the
other hand, are growing increasingly wary that excessive discounting could
damage their products' image and change consumer perceptions about
'acceptable' retail prices.
Shiseido denies trying to prevent Kawachiya from selling its products at a
discount price, and alleges the retailer was wholesaling cosmetics rather
than selling to retail customers.
The FTC is expected to make similar investigations at Kanebo and Kao,
cosmetics makers which Kawachiya also claims had cut shipments.

<TEXT>
THE BOARDS of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its
four refining and distribution subsidiaries have been dissolved, removing
the majority non-executive directors, the political appointees of
ex-President Ibrahim Babangida.
The decision is a sign that Nigeria's interim government, in its third week
in office, intends to be more than a caretaker until next March and is
trying to tackle some of the economy's most pressing problems.
'This is the beginning of new developments under the interim government,' an
oil ministry official said. 'The direction is to more efficiency, especially
in getting petroleum products to the people.'
The interim government of Mr Ernest Shonekan has inherited an oil-producing
industry unable to meet its cash commitments to foreign partners and a
refining and distribution sector unable to supply enough fuel to the
population.
Nigeria has the largest oil reserves in Africa, the source of 90 per cent of
its foreign earnings, and the biggest refining capacity in its region. Yet,
since the aborted introduction this year of a new grade of petrol at 10
times the previous heavily subsidised cost, and a national oil workers'
strike which paralysed the south of Nigeria until a week ago, long petrol
queues have become common in Lagos.
The marketing subsidiary PPMC sells petrol at about 2 US cents a litre, an
estimated loss of revenue of Dollars 23.45 a barrel, or enough to cover last
year's budget deficit. The refinery subsidiaries operated at around half
their 400,000 barrels-a-day capacity. Smuggling to other African countries
is estimated at more than 10,000 b/d.
NNPC is about three months in arrears on cash calls for production and
exploration, owing its joint venture partners about Dollars 450m (Pounds
292.2m), according to local estimates. In July NNPC sold a 5 per cent stake
in its largest oil field, which produces about half the national output of
1.8m b/d, to Elf Aquitaine for around Dollars 500m to replace missing funds
for a proposed liquefied natural gas project industry analysts doubt will
ever take off.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Chinese 'smash records' on dog stew and turtle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEIJING'S credibility as the host city for the Olympic Games in the year
2000 seemed undermined yesterday as much of the world athletics community
cast doubt on the validity of a series of astonishing results by female
Chinese athletes.
Said one senior British athletic official: 'The Chinese may think this sort
of result supports their claim to host the games. But the scale of the
improvement is so good it arouses suspicions they are not observing the
Olympic ethos.'
Long-distance athletes have broken world records for 1,500m, 3,000m and
10,000m at the Chinese national games in the last week. The 10,000m record
was slashed by 42 seconds.
The results, achieved in front of 12 visiting members of the International
Olympic Committee, came after Chinese women made a clean sweep of the medals
last month at the world championships in Stuttgart.
The committee makes its decision on September 23.
Mr Alan Storey, general manager of the NutraSweet London Marathon, who
coached in China during the 1980s, said: 'The Chinese must have been pleased
by Stuttgart, but the recent world records detract from the bid because
nobody believes they were achieved legally.'
No evidence existed that the records were drug-assisted.
Ma Junren, the athletes' trainer, dismisses accusations the results were
helped by banned substances. He claims that high-altitude training and a
special diet help the athletes prepare.
Some are running 170 miles a week, equal to more than seven marathons in
seven days. The diet includes caterpillar fungus tonic, dog stew, chicken
soup, a paste made from berries, and soft-shell turtle. He also bases the
women's running action on those of ostriches and deer.
Dr Peter Radford, professor of sports medicine at the University of Glasgow,
and chairman of the British Athletic Association, said: 'None of us know
anything about the athletes, their histories or their training. And I don't
have the foggiest about the diet'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRO-EUROPEAN sentiment in Germany could be put at risk if the European
Community persists in treating the integration of the former GDR as a purely
German problem, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank.
'Unfortunately, it is virtually taken for granted in Europe that the federal
republic must deal with the economic integration of eastern Germany alone,'
Mr Sarrazin said.
'But there is an inconsistency here: why, for example, should southern
Italy, parts of Greece and Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as
European problems, while eastern Germany remains a purely German affair?'
the bank chief asked.
Such questions had to be taken into account in the move towards European
economic and monetary union, Mr Sarrazin told a Frankfurt journalists' club.
He was responding to past criticism that Germany maintained high interest
rates to the detriment of its recession-hit partners.
He acknowledged the link between German unification and tensions in the
European monetary system, which culminated in last month's widening of the
fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism. Redeveloping
eastern Germany required additional capital which could only be attracted
with high interest rates, Mr Sarrazin said.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Christian Democratic Union yesterday closed ranks behind its
virtually unknown candidate for the presidency, angrily rejecting criticism
that he is a non-entity whose only qualification is that he is east German.
Mr Steffen Heitmann, the 49-year-old justice minister from the eastern state
of Saxony, was given a rousing ovation at the end of the CDU party
conference in Berlin, as delegates sought to counter the impression that
they are only half-hearted about his candidacy for the highest office in the
federal republic.
It was a demonstration of party solidarity in the face of opposition
attacks, and of the obvious need to forge a stronger union between east and
west, urged on by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, his heir
apparent and party leader in the German parliament.
The unresolved strains of unification, and the need to forge a greater sense
of national identity and patriotism to overcome them, were the underlying
themes of the conference, as the CDU struggles to counter political apathy -
above all in east Germany - before an election marathon next year.
Membership of all the main political parties is languishing in the eastern
states, and both the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD)
have problems in providing a full slate of candidates in some areas.
According to the latest opinion poll, CDU support is only 28 per cent in the
five states which constituted the former German Democratic Republic, all
with elections in 1994.
Mr Heitmann's candidacy for the presidency is seen as part of Mr Kohl's
attempt to win back some eastern support, although he is barely known in the
east, let alone in the west of the country. He was a Lutheran lay preacher
before unification, and his greatest asset, in the eyes of CDU party
leaders, is that he had a blameless reputation during the communist years -
unlike many other eastern politicians.
Yesterday he was persuaded to speak fleetingly to the conference - not
enough to demonstrate his political inexperience, but long enough to win
sympathy and support from the floor. He spoke emotionally about the
'wonderful experience' of German unification, and said: 'The walls in our
heads and in our hearts will not grow higher, if we simply want it.' His
nomination by the CDU and its sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union, is not yet assured. Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the CSU, showed
his sympathy, but insisted that he still wanted to get to know him better.
The SPD on Monday formally nominated Mr Johannes Rau, premier of North
Rhine-Westphalia, as its presidential candidate, which means the election
will almost certainly split on party lines. The new president must be chosen
next May by an electoral college, to succeed Mr Richard von Weizsacker, who
has completed the maximum two terms in office.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Moscow to finance deficit with gold sales
</HEADLINE>

THE Russian government plans to sell Rbs1,000bn (Pounds 600m) worth of gold
to Russian commercial banks as part of the Finance Ministry's battle to
bring the gaping budget deficit under control, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy
finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Alexashenko, who is responsible for budget policy, said in an interview
that the government was arranging to sell to banks certificates - at prices
based on the international gold futures market - guaranteeing to deliver the
gold in a year's time.
He also said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, had threatened to
resign unless the government implements emergency tax increases as part of a
strategy to save Russia from Ukrainian-style hyper-inflation resulting from
the unlimited use of printing presses to finance the budget deficit.
The budget is at the centre of the conflict between President Boris Yeltsin
and the parliament.
The parliament wants to increase the government's deficit by far more than
that foreseen by the Yeltsin-backed budget it has rejected.
Because of conservative ministers' support for parliament's free-spending
instincts, the budget has also become a crucial test of Mr Yeltsin's own
commitment to financial stabilisation policies he himself launched and which
are a condition for further IMF assistance.
Crowning the Finance Ministry's strategy is a plan to introduce a uniform
tax system from next January, applicable to all of Russia's 89 republics and
regions.
The aim is to do away with the present system, which is threatening Russia
with disintegration, of individual bargaining for each region and republic
on how much tax revenue they can keep for themselves.

A GERMAN Airbus A320 airliner crashed in bad weather at Warsaw's Okecie
airport yesterday, injuring at least 40 people and, according to late
reports, killing two of them.
The twin-engine Lufthansa aircraft, carrying 70 passengers and crew on a
flight from Frankfurt to the Polish capital, caught fire after running off
the runway seconds after it touched down.
It is the fourth crash involving an Airbus A320 since the airliner entered
service in 1988.
Airport director Maciej Kalita said late last night: 'I can officially
confirm that there were two fatalities - one of the pilots and a second
person who is currently being identified.'
Lufthansa sources in Warsaw said they had been informed by Polish officials
that two people had been killed but they were still checking the report.
A Lufthansa spokesman in Frankfurt said earlier that the airline was having
to delay issuing a casualty list as injured passengers had been dispersed to
hospitals throughout the Warsaw area.
One survivor told Polish radio: 'After landing, the plane started speeding
up again rather than braking. It tried to start but the tarmac ran out and
the plane broke into pieces.'
Airbus last night said it was still too early to say what caused the crash.
But first indications suggested a possible cause was aquaplaning.
Heavy rain and a water-logged runway appear to have made the aircraft skid
on landing and overshoot the runway before bursting into flames.
Although the A320's sophisticated computer systems have regularly been the
subject of controversy, the 150-seater aircraft has now logged nearly 2m
flight hours since its introduction and 1.3m take-offs. There are currently
a total of 409 A320s in airline service throughout the world.
In all three previous A320 crashes (two in France, one in India), the
aircraft were cleared by accident investigators of any malfunction.
Lufthansa has one of the best safety records in the airline industry and was
preparing to celebrate the opening of its new Warsaw offices before the
crash occurred.
Mr Hans-Willi Blum, Lufthansa's manager for Eastern Europe in Warsaw for the
opening ceremony, said last night: 'We do not know if the pilot tried to
take off again; we do not know if it was a brake failure or pilot error; or
the rain and the bad weather. We will have to investigate carefully'.
Lufthansa had sent a special team of crash investigators from Frankfurt who
would be working with Polish accident investigators, he added.
Crash investigators were still trying to recover the 'black box' cockpit
recorder to identify the cause of the accident.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Russia may lose credit for banking revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stern red granite former German embassy in St Petersburg this week
opened its doors to the public as home to the first foreign bank in Russia
since the Bolshevik revolution.
But when Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris held an official
opening of their joint subsidiary with champagne - and talk by the mayor of
an historic occasion - there was little cause for celebration. Despite
security provided by an ex-KGB officer against gangsters, the bank is under
threat from other quarters.
On Friday, the Russian parliament will decide whether to ban foreign-owned
banks from taking deposits from Russian customers. Such customers would
include joint ventures with foreign companies that account for most of the
foreign investment in Russia so far.
Parliament's proposed ban, which would come into effect next January and
last until 1996, is the fruit of lobbying by some of the increasingly
powerful Russian commercial banks which say they are not ready for foreign
competition.
Their main fear is that they will lose their prized hard currency deposits
to western banks which, by virtue of being well established and foreign, may
inspire more trust among Russian customers.
The government, central bank, and even parliament's own sub-committee for
banking are mobilising efforts to get deputies to change their minds in
behind-the-scenes lobbying this week. On Monday, the central bank issued
licences to two more foreign banks, Credit Suisse and the Netherlands' ING
Bank, as part of its efforts to present parliament with a fait accompli.
Full banking licences have already been given to France's Credit Lyonnais
and Societe Generale, as as Bank of China. 'Competition would be good for
our banks. They would learn how to work better,' explained Mr Nikolai
Medvedvev, chairman of the banking sub-committee.
But there is no guarantee that these efforts, together with private warnings
by German authorities that loans to Russia might be reviewed in retaliation,
will succeed.
Asked why they had pressed ahead despite the risks, Mr Jacques Henri Wahl,
BNP's chief operating officer, said the two western banks, which enjoy a
global alliance, wanted to be in a position to take advantage of
opportunities which would arise when the economy got going again.
'If the law restricts our activities, we will comply with it in the hope it
will be modified in a relatively short time,' he said. 'I just hope that
political wisdom will prevail.' Privately, western bankers say they want to
get a foot in the door while it is still open. In a more moderate plan to
protect its fledgling banks, the central bank has already said it plans to
limit the share of foreign banks to 12 per cent of banking capital in
Russia.
But the consequences of the ban envisaged by parliament would harm not just
the banks, but would further dent western business confidence.
It would also deprive the authorities, which lack supervisory skills and
credibility, of a badly needed tool for improving the performance of their
own banks and for encouraging foreign investment.
Rather than compete for rouble customers and lending opportunities, the most
successful and independent Russian banks hold hard currency on short-term
deposit, channel it in and out of the country for trading operations, and
play the foreign exchange market. BNP-Dresdner Bank (Rossija) itself does
not initially plan to take rouble deposits or do very much in the way of
project lending. Banks as a whole are unlikely to switch to productive
lending on any significant scale unless the economy is stabilised.
The banking sector itself is badly in need of restructuring, a process which
will be speeded up only if there is financial discipline for the economy at
large. Russia has nearly 2,000 banks, with about 100 accounting for
two-thirds of the banking system.

PRO-EUROPEAN sentiment in Germany could be put at risk if the European
Community persists in treating the integration of the former GDR as a purely
German problem, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank.
'Unfortunately, it is virtually taken for granted in Europe that the federal
republic must deal with the economic integration of eastern Germany alone,'
Mr Sarrazin said in a rare meeting with the press.
'But there is an inconsistency here: why, for example, should southern
Italy, parts of Greece and Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as
European problems, while eastern Germany remains a purely German affair?'
the bank chief asked.
Such questions had to be taken into account in the move towards European
economic and monetary union, Mr Sarrazin told a Frankfurt journalists' club.
He was responding to past criticism that Germany maintained high interest
rates to the detriment of its recession-hit partners.
They had been unable to lower rates because of the constraints of the
European exchange rate mechanism in which the D-Mark played the role of
anchor.
He acknowledged the link between unification and tensions in the European
monetary system, which culminated in last month's widening of the
fluctuation bands in the ERM. Redeveloping eastern Germany required
additional capital which could only be attracted with high rates, Mr
Sarrazin said.
The ERM adjustments were a compromise between the 'impracticable' extremes
of a French franc devaluation or German interest rate cut to relieve
pressure on the French currency. In the end a solution was found 'at the
cost of the EMS'.
The new arrangements, and the 'disturbing' de facto revaluation of the
D-Mark, reduced export opportunities for German goods and could also 'cause
a dangerous uncoupling of the D-Mark', Mr Sarrazin claimed.
Pro-European feelings among the German population and in all the relevant
political parties should not be put lightly at risk in Brussels, for
example, with proposals that the costs of unification should be wholly
concentrated on Germany through a unilateral D-Mark float.
This was one of the suggestions put forward at the ERM crisis meeting which
led to the mechanism's effective suspension in early August.
'It is not feasible on the one hand to seek to bind Germany firmly within
Europe, and then leave it alone with its eastern problem,' Mr Sarrazin
maintained.

MR TOMMASO Padoa Schioppa, deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, has
been appointed chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision.
Mr Schioppa replaces Mr Gerald Corrigan, who stepped down after leaving his
post as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The announcement was made late on Monday night by the Bank for International
Settlements at Basle, where central bankers from the G10 countries were
meeting.
Mr Schioppa, the third most senior official at the Bank of Italy, has been
deputy governor since 1984 and spent time at the European Commission in
Brussels dealing with monetary affairs.
He had been considered as a possible contender for the post of governor, but
the job was given to Mr Antonio Fazio in May.
Also at the G10 meeting yesterday, the Basle committee said a recent review
confirmed that by the end of 1992 all internationally-active G10 banks had
capital ratios exceeding 8 per cent, as defined by the Basle capital accord
The committee, which conducted the review of the effects of the accord
agreed in 1988, said this showed that the banks had met the minimum capital
requirement laid down in the agreement.
Average ratios for each national category of bank ranged between 8.8 per
cent and 11 per cent.

But the Commission conceded yesterday that progress of the EC's overall

agreement from ministers in November. The Commission has set strict

<TEXT>
ONLY four out of Poland's multiplicity of political parties are assured of
gaining the 5 per cent of votes at Sunday's election needed to enter the
next parliament. Three out of the four have their roots in the former
communist party or the left wing of the Solidarity movement.
This is the main finding of the last pre-election public opinion poll based
on a sample of 1,100 voters nationwide.
A clutch of smaller parties, including the free-market Liberal Democratic
Congress (KLD), the right-wing nationalist Confederation for an Independent
Poland (KPN), the Christian Democrats and President Walesa's non-party BBWR
movement, are struggling to gain enough support to cross the 5 per cent
barrier.
The poll, financed by the Polish government, shows that the four leading
parties - the governing Democratic Union (UD), the former-communist Left
Democratic Alliance (SLD), the former communist-linked Polish Peasants Party
(PSL) and the Labour Union (UP) led by radical left-wing members of the
former Solidarity alliance, are likely to receive between 11 and 15 per cent
of the vote each.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Shevardnadze wins over crowds in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign
minister, last night appeared to have pulled back from the brink of
resignation, which he had announced earlier in the day after parliament
refused to grant him sweeping powers to tackle ethnic conflicts.
At an emotional public meeting in the centre of the capital Tbilisi, where
huge crowds chanted his name and Georgia's Orthodox Christian leader pleaded
with him to stay on, Mr Shevardnadze set two conditions for continuing as
head of the former Soviet republic.
He first demanded that parliament should convene today and declare emergency
measures and then stated that if he were to remain as head of state
parliament would have to go into recess for three months.
Deputies immediately met Mr Shevardnadze's first condition by unanimously
approving a state of emergency throughout the country for two months from
September 20.
They were due to meet again today to consider his second demand, aimed at
freeing his hand to take tough crisis measures without interference from the
hostile legislature.
The drama of the public meeting appeared to confirm the view of Georgian
political commentators that Mr Shevardnadze's earlier walk-out was a shock
tactic to bring parliament to its senses.
With the crowds in Tbilisi refusing to disperse until they had word of the
president's future, the head of the Orthodox church in Georgia, Ilya II,
took the podium and gave Mr Shevardnadze his blessing to continue as leader.
'Shevardnadze remains at his post of head of state,' the churchman told the
crowd. Although Mr Shevardnadze did not confirm his words, it appeared
unlikely the Georgian leader could resign after such a strong endorsement.
The episode brought back memories of Mr Shevardnadze's dramatic exit from
the Soviet political stage in December 1990, when he caused consternation by
resigning as Soviet foreign minister and issuing dire warnings of an
impending coup. His recent problems in Georgia have included attempts by Mr
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the former nationalist president, to fight his way back
to power with military force, separatism in Abkhazia and a collapsing
economy.
Unlike the present leader of neighbouring Azerbaijan, Mr Geidar Aliyev,
another former communist who returned to power by overthrowing an
inexperienced nationalist, Mr Shevardnadze prides himself on being a genuine
convert to democracy. 'When they slander me by saying I want to work with
communist methods and by the laws of the communist regime, I will not bear
it,' he said yesterday.

THE BOSNIAN and Croatian leaders yesterday took a small step towards the
resumption of Bosnian peace talks by agreeing to an immediate halt to
fighting between mainly Moslem government troops and Croat forces in central
and south-west Bosnia.
The Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, said after talks in Geneva with
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian leader, that they had signed a ceasefire
accord, apparently to come into effect by noon on Saturday.
Most ceasefires to date have been ignored by the commanders on the ground.
But Mr Tudjman claimed the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, who was not
in Geneva yesterday, would respect the agreement, which also calls for the
closure of all detention camps and free passage for humanitarian convoys.
However, the leaders made no announcement about when the peace talks might
reconvene, although they said that working parties would be established to
discuss points of contention.
Earlier, Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Tudjman discussed between themselves and with
the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
vexed issue of access to the sea for the Moslem republic, a key obstacle to
a resumption of the Bosnian peace talks, which broke up two weeks ago.
Meanwhile, amid mounting pressure on the Moslems to return to the
negotiations, Lord Owen told a separate meeting of the 29-nation steering
committee of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia that Mr
Izetbegovic's demand for a port at Neum was 'second-best' to access to Ploce
on Croatia's Dalmatian coast, which the Croats have already offered.
Lord Owen added that, in the mediators' view, the Moslems could not expect
more than 30 per cent of Bosnian territory.
In another reflection of the attempts to recapture the momentum in the peace
process, Nato military planners are due to present to a Nato council meeting
in Brussels today documents for the deployment of Nato peacekeepers in
Bosnia.
In Croatia, UN officials were yesterday attempting to secure a ceasefire
after rebel Serb forces shot down a Croatian aircraft on a bombing raid. The
Croatian government confirmed a Mig-21 had been hit after conducting bombing
raids in Krajina.

KNOCK-OUT against the EC, proclaimed the tabloid headline yesterday
alongside a picture of Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of Norway's
triumphant Centre party, her hand held high like a victorious boxer.
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour party may have 'won' Monday's
election by upping its vote and reinforcing its hold on power as a minority
government. But there was no doubt in Oslo yesterday that the advance made
by the Centre party, surging to become the second largest group in the
Storting (parliament) on the back of its vehement opposition to Norway
joining the EC, was the most dramatic feature of the electoral race and one
which poses considerable problems for the government.
Labour was under no illusion before the election that winning a referendum
on EC membership sometime during the term of the new parliament would be an
easy feat. Now that task has been made more difficult, with anti-EC forces,
even within Labour's ranks, strengthened in parliament.
The result will also have sent a shudder through the right-centre
governments in Sweden and Finland. Not only will opponents to the EC in
those countries take heart from the Norwegian election result, but prime
ministers Carl Bildt and Esko Aho will have been dismayed by the dismal
performance of their ideological allies in Norway, the Conservative party.
Under Mrs Kaci Kullman-Five, the Conservatives, the strongest advocates of
Norwegian EC membership, suffered their worst defeat in 30 years,
surrendering their traditional position as the second largest party. The
Conservatives will have just 29 seats in the 165-member parliament, while
the Centre party will have 31, almost three times its representation in the
previous Storting. The other right-of-centre forces, the Progress party and
the Christian Democrats, also lost heavily.
Before the election the Centre party was a marginal force, ranking sixth
among the seven parliamentary parties. Formed in 1920 to represent farmers,
whose proportion of the workforce has now fallen to less than 5 per cent,
its previous highest share of the vote was 11.6 per cent in 1973, following
the 1972 referendum rejecting EC membership.
On Monday it won 18.5 per cent of the vote as it cashed in on widespread
support for its defence of Norway's independence and system of high
subsidies to the country's remote rural communities.
The party's popularity was boosted by the down-to-earth charm of the
youthful Ms Lahnstein, who hammered home a relentless message that the EC
must be rejected, earning the nickname 'The No Queen'.
Ms Lahnstein, party leader since 1991, will now use the election result as a
springboard to defeat Labour's pro-EC strategy. Ominously for the
government, the party has suggested it may use its new-found strength to
block ratification of membership even if a Yes vote is secured in a
referendum. Anti-EC strength in the Storting is now sufficient to block the
three-fourths majority required for ratification, regardless of a
referendum's outcome.
In the face of the Centre party's advance, Labour did well to increase its
Storting strength from 63 to 67 seats, winning support particularly from the
anti-EC Socialist Left party through a combination of an ambivalent campaign
stance on the EC and an improving economic outlook.
Its task now is to secure an EC accession agreement in negotiations with
Brussels, which it could then sell to the electorate as a good deal on the
key issues of oil, fish, agriculture and regional policy. With opinion polls
showing 58 per cent of voters against membership, Labour leaders say they
will not risk a referendum unless they win concessions from the EC.
Although most of the Labour leadership is committed to Norway joining the
Community, they are determined not to commit political suicide over the
issue. Mrs Brundtland has left no doubt that she would withdraw Norway's
application if she did not win the negotiating result sought.
Indeed, Labour leaders talk of the 'fallback' position for Oslo provided by
the European Economic Area trade pact, which Oslo has approved and which
should come into force by next year. It would give Norway many of the
economic benefits of full membership, albeit without the influence to shape
policy. But they believe it is still possible to change opinion, just as
they transformed poll ratings as low as 25 per cent for Labour during the
summer into an election victory.
'When we have a negotiating result, we will start the EC campaign,' said Mr
Jens Stoltenberg, Labour's deputy leader. 'So far it has been a one-sided
war. The No camp has had a walk-over up until now. 'At least this election
shows the Labour party is able to campaign and is able to change the minds
of voters.'

FT  15 SEP 93 / Poland's smaller parties on the block
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY four out of Poland's multiplicity of political parties are assured of
gaining the 5 per cent of votes at Sunday's election needed to enter the
next parliament. Three out of the four have their roots in the former
communist party or the left wing of the Solidarity movement.
This is the main finding of the last pre-election public opinion poll based
on a sample of 1,100 voters nation-wide.
A clutch of smaller parties, including the free-market Liberal Democratic
Congress (KLD), the right wing nationalist Confederation for an Independent
Poland (KPN), the Christian Democrats and President Walesa's non-party BBWR
movement, are struggling to gain enough support to cross the 5 per cent
barrier.
The poll, financed by the Polish government, shows that the four leading
parties - the governing Democratic Union (UD), the former-communist Left
Democratic Alliance (SLD), the former communist-linked Polish Peasants Party
(PSL) and the Labour Union (UP) led by radical left wing members of the
former Solidarity alliance, are likely to receive between 11 and 15 per cent
of the vote each.
An incomplete private poll managed by former high-ranking Polish communists,
gives the SLD a commanding lead with around 25 per cent of the vote.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Shevardnadze risks all for more powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign
minister, yesterday took the last big political gamble of his career by
announcing he was resigning as Georgia's head of state.
His decision, announced after a former ally accused him of dictatorial
ambitions for seeking emergency powers to save Georgia from civil war, was
rejected unanimously by parliament.
Although Mr Shevardnadze responded by telling parliament his decision was
final, the move appeared to be a high-risk gamble to clear obstacles to his
policies. He later told a rally of supporters he would return if parliament
was suspended for three months and he was given the emergency powers he
wanted. If his gamble fails, Georgia could be plunged into even greater
chaos.
'Indeed, it would seem that no emergency situation can save Georgia, if
every time you want to disarm some kind of illegal bandit formation, you
found it has powerful protectors,' he said, in a possible reference to Mr
Jaba Joseliani, who made the accusations against him.
It was Mr Joseliani, one of Georgia's freelance warlords, who helped him
return to power after overthrowing the former president, Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
The silver-haired Mr Shevardnadze, 65, also appeared to seize on the
opportunity to shake off once and for all his mantle as a former communist
party boss. Since his return, he has gradually consolidated power in his own
hands, becoming prime minister as well as head of state and parliamentary
speaker.
With even impartial observers suggesting that he was returning to the ways
he was used to in running Georgia as communist chief, Mr Shevardnadze has
said that the crisis facing the newly-independent republic required
emergency measures.
The problems have included attempts by Mr Gamsakhurdia, to fight his way
back to power with military force, separatism in Abhazia and a collapsing
economy.
For unlike the present leader of neighbouring Azerbaijan, Mr Geidar Aliyev,
another former communist who returned to power by overthrowing an
inexperienced nationalist, Mr Shevardnadze prides himself on being a genuine
convert to democracy. 'When they slander me by saying I want to work with
communist methods and by the laws of the communist regime, I will not bear
it,' he said.
Yesterday's announcement was as emotional as his resignation as President
Mikhail Gorbachev's foreign minister in December 1990.
Then he caused widespread consternation with a warning of impending
dictatorship in Moscow.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Spending cuts urged on Finns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND needs to make further spending cuts and create a more flexible
labour market if it is to build on the export-led recovery which is starting
to emerge, says the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development
in its latest report.
The OECD predicts flat economic growth this year, after a 10 per cent
decline in real output in 1991 and 1992. In 1994 it forecasts a 2.1 per cent
increase in gross domestic product following the strong revival in exports
which has accompanied the depreciation of the markka.
The OECD says Finland's ability to reduce interest rates further is being
constrained by a need to prevent a weakening of the markka to keep inflation
under control. It says further spending cuts are 'clearly needed' to curb a
rising budget deficit.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay stance: Clarke says
salary bill will be frozen at 1992-93 levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent and DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Britain's 5m public sector workers threatened widespread
industrial action yesterday after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
announced a virtual freeze on pay and warned that job losses would follow
'excessive' settlements.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, the biggest union, said the government
'should be in no doubt that it faces enormous industrial chaos and unrest'.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called an
emergency meeting of public sector unions to co-ordinate protests. The TUC
also demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Clarke.
In a statement to the pay review bodies, which make pay recommendations for
1.4m public sector workers, the chancellor said 1994-95 pay increases must
be funded by productivity improvements.
He said the government salary bill would be frozen at 1992-93 levels to
force departments to set pay 'at levels no higher than necessary' to
recruit, retain and motivate staff.
'We have to break the inflation psychology that in the past has led to
expectations of pay increases every year unrelated to efficiency improvement
or the ability of the employer to pay,' he said.
Mr Clarke also warned the pay review bodies that the government would refuse
to dip into its contingency reserve to finance pay settlements regarded as
excessive.
'Higher pay costs not funded by efficiency savings would therefore lead to
reduced spending on services or reduced employment in the services and
professions concerned,' he said.
The announcement places a question mark over the future of the pay review
bodies, which were set up 12 years ago to distance the government from
sensitive sectors such as nursing and the armed services.
It also means the government is prepared to face the political impact of
cash limits, believing the unions will be blamed for job losses which result
from excessive pay increases.
The government's aim is to prevent a round of 'catch up' pay settlements
after the end of its successful 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector pay in
1993-94.
The announcement is also intended to mollify rightwingers angered by Mr
Clarke's insistence that tax increases remain an option for the November
Budget. Rightwing MPs reacted favourably. Mr John Townend, chairman of the
Conservative backbench finance committee, said the announcement would be
'welcomed by private industry'.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was 'wholly unfair of the
government to seek to penalise teachers, nurses, fire-fighters and others in
the public sector to pay for their own economic mismanagement'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said he supported a measure
of public sector pay restraint, but added: 'I see no reason why the public
sector should be picked out as a scapegoat by the government in order to
appease its right wing.'
Mr Clarke's announcement is broadly in line with calls for pay restraint
from the Confederation of British Industry. However, the Local Government
Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of councils, said it was likely
to lead to big job losses.
The TUC emergency meeting, likely to take place next week, is expected to
announce a day of action. However, cautious officials warned that militant
public sector union action could revive anti-union feelings, in spite of the
government's unpopularity.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Lonrho head in venture to develop key City site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 35-year struggle by Lord Palumbo to build on one of the City of London's
most prominent sites - One Poultry, opposite the Mansion House - seems
destined for success.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German
financier who is joint chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday announced a
joint venture to develop the site, which is near the Bank of England and is
occupied by listed buildings including the Mappin &amp; Webb building.
The deal marks the start of a new phase of speculative development in the
City, which is stabilising after one of the fiercest downturns of any
property market in the country. Lord Palumbo said: 'The recession has turned
the corner.'
Construction of the building, which will have 125,000 sq ft of offices and
25,000 sq ft of retail space, is expected to start next April or May and to
be completed in 1996.
The plans for the site have been opposed by conservationists, including
Prince Charles, who described the design by the late Sir James Stirling as a
'1930s wireless set'.
Mr Bock has acquired 50 per cent of the site. Advanta, the Frankfurt-based
property company 80 per cent controlled by Mr Bock, will provide the funding
and undertake the building's project management.
Lord Palumbo said he and Mr Bock had an 'immediate rapport' after being
introduced at the start of the year by a mutual friend who knew of their
passion for architecture and the arts.
They decided to go into partnership but delayed their announcement until
after they received the support of the City Corporation, which in the past
opposed development plans. 'They took the view that it would be absurd to
keep challenging the development,' Lord Palumbo said.
Mr Bock said he was delighted all the legal hurdles had been surmounted. But
Lord Palumbo was more circumspect: 'It's as if you are leading 1-0, but you
cannot afford to relax in the last two minutes of the game.'
The developers expect an international financial services company to occupy
the building. Tenants will not be sought for at least a year.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Florida cancels tourism campaign after murder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLORIDA'S state tourism office yesterday cancelled its domestic and
international advertising campaigns in the wake of the killing of a British
tourist - the ninth foreign visitor to be murdered in the state in the past
year.
Florida police said Mr Gary Colley, aged 34, was killed and his friend Ms
Margaret Jagger wounded when they were attacked in a lay-by near
Tallahassee, the state capital, in the early hours. Ms Jagger was later
released from hospital.
Governor Lawton Chiles announced a Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,500) reward for
information leading to Mr Colley's killers, and he asked the federal
government for help in the effort to crack down on crime. He also announced
plans to enlist up to 500 game wardens, agriculture inspectors and marine
officers to strengthen patrols on major roads.
Mr Colley's death follows the killing last week of Mr Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand,
a German tourist, in a highway shooting in Miami.
Holidaymakers are cancelling trips to Florida because of the attacks. Mr
Greg Farmer, the Florida state secretary of commerce, said cancellations at
hotels and resorts were running at around 20 per cent after Mr Rakebrand's
killing, and the latest attack would probably inflict more damage on the
state's Dollars 31bn a year tourism industry.
'It is going to be just catastrophic. This is going to have a very, very
negative impact,' Mr Farmer said.
Mr Ken Fortune, the county sheriff, said he believed the couple had been
chosen at random, and not targeted as foreigners.
The British and German governments already issue warnings to tourists about
the dangers of travelling in Florida, but travel agents in Europe have
generally distinguished Miami from the rest of the state, and advised their
customers to pick destinations such as Orlando or St Petersburg.
Six of the foreign visitors who have fallen victim to Florida's violence in
the past year were attacked in the Miami area, but yesterday's shooting took
place in the state's quieter northern panhandle. Tallahassee is a quiet town
festooned in Spanish moss, more akin to neighbouring Georgia or Alabama than
to the brasher Miami coast.
Florida's murder rate of 10.7 per 100,000 population, however, is lower than
Georgia's and well below the rate in states such as Louisiana, New York and
Texas.
Mr Colley and Ms Jagger, from Wilsden, near Bradford, in West Yorkshire,
were sleeping in their car in a rest area about 25 miles from Tallahassee
when two teenagers approached their car and banged on the windows. The two
assailants opened fire when the pair tried to drive away.
An attendant at the rest area gave police a description of the attackers.
About 40m tourists visit Florida every year, and some 17 per cent are
foreigners, including an estimated 800,000 from the UK.

FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and Jordan move closer to full peace treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN yesterday initialled an outline peace agreement with Israel, becoming
the first Arab state to reach an understanding with the Jewish state since
Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979.
In a sign of the growing momentum for peace in the Middle East, Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday visited Morocco for talks with
King Hassan. Later Mr Rabin said: 'I don't believe that it will take too
long before additional Arab countries will recognise Israel.'
In Rabat, a spokesman for Mr Rabin said: 'It is the first time an Israeli
prime minister has met an Arab leader out in public, other than the Egyptian
leaders.'
The developments came only a day after Israel signed its outline agreement
with the Palestinians. In Washington, where the ceremony took place, Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Senate
leaders before travelling on to the United Nations in New York.
During an hour's meeting with about 20 senators, Mr Arafat requested a
review and repeal of laws that impeded or prevented economic or other
relationships between the US and the PLO and repeated his strong commitment
to peace.
Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said the general reaction
among senators was to be helpful and that laws should be changed where
necessary.
In Israel last night the government said it would seal off the occupied Gaza
Strip during the Jewish new year which begins today, in a move intended to
allay mounting fears among Israelis about an increase in violence following
the signing of the peace agreement. Two Palestinians died in further
violence in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, including a suicide bomber
who blew himself up in a police station in an apparent protest at the peace
deal.
In sharp contrast to Monday's ceremonials on the White House lawn, the
Jordan agreement was initialled by Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the
Israeli delegation to the peace talks, and Mr Fayez Tarawneh, his Jordanian
counterpart in the small Thomas Jefferson room in the State Department. The
accord was described as an 'agenda' framing future negotiations towards an
eventual peace treaty.
After a modest affair of just over 10 minutes, the two signatories shook
hands without hesitation or embarrassment.
A draft text covering the outstanding issues between the two sides has been
virtually ready to sign since last year. Jordan, however, delayed a final
signing until progress had been made on the Palestinian-Israel negotiations.
The document contains undertakings from both sides to refrain from threats
to each other's security and sets out the main areas for future discussion -
notably on water rights, minor border issues and the status of refugees. 'We
hope this is just a first step, which will follow into an agreement based on
comprehensive peace,' said Mr Tarawneh.
The document calls for 'steps to arrive at a state of peace based on
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338' - which demand an Israeli
withdrawal from the territories occupied since the 1967 war - indicating
that Jordan is not likely to sign a full peace deal with Israel until the
Jewish state has done so with others.
In Israel there were increasing signs yesterday that Mr Rabin would face an
uphill struggle to win the parliamentary votes he says he needs to pass the
peace agreement.
Mr Arye Deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which has effectively
quit the Labour-led coalition, said he had recommended the party's spiritual
mentor to demand a referendum be held on the same day as local elections due
on November 3.
Mr Deri also said he had told the interior ministry, which he headed until
yesterday, to prepare for a November referendum. So far there has been no
government decision on a referendum.

police station in an apparent protest at the peace deal.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, welcomed the outline deal
between Jordan and Israel as a 'signpost of the progress we hope and expect
will soon come' in peace talks involving Syria and Lebanon.

<TEXT>
ANSALDO, Italy's largest electrical engineering concern, is to establish two
new facilities in Hungary to take its total planned investment in the
country to Dollars 130m.
The state-owned Italian group, a subsidiary of the IRI holding company, is
forming a joint venture with Dunaferr, Hungary's leading steel producer, to
make electrical motors at Dunaujvaros, south of Budapest.
Ansaldo is providing equity of Ft1.08bn (Dollars 11.6m) to take a 76 per
cent stake in the new entity, to be called Temm, while the Hungarian partner
will contribute the site and control 24 per cent.
The larger part of the new investment will involve Temm constructing a new
plant for Ganz Ansaldo, the Italian group's Hungarian joint venture
producing electric motors, generators, transformers and traction stations.
'An electromechanical group must have a base in one of the countries of
eastern Europe,' said Dr Bruno Musso, Ansaldo chairman, whose rivals have
invested heavily in Poland and the Czech Republic.
Ganz Ansaldo's losses including interest payments reached Ft1.3bn (Dollars
14m) in 1992 and Ansaldo does not expect its Hungarian operations to break
even until 1996.

FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Unitas turnround cuts losses to
FM1.01bn

<TEXT>
UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday announced reduced
losses for the first eight months in what it describes as a 'decisive
turnround' in its performance.
The group's pre-tax loss amounted to FM1.01bn (Dollars 179m), compared with
a FM1.31bn deficit in the same period in 1992. Its consolidated income
climbed 45 per cent to FM2.68bn and operating profit before credit losses
rose fivefold to FM881m.
Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland,
attributed the upturn to lower interest rates, a rising stockmarket and
greater efficiency. It noted that its loss in the second four months was
FM498m, FM552m less than in the same 1992 period.
However, the improvement was marred by evidence that the rising trend in
credit losses and non-performing loans remains unbroken. Credit losses rose
to FM1.68bn from FM1.29bn. Non-performing loans at the end of August
totalled FM8.62bn, against FM8.57bn at the end of April.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.1 per cent, unchanged from the
year end. It is now more confident that it can survive Finland's banking
crisis without further state help. It received a FM1.7bn preference capital
injection from the government and is likely to use a government guarantee
for an issue in the international capital market.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Wall St talks of rival bid for Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIACOM International, which made an Dollars 8.2bn agreed bid on Sunday for
Paramount Communications, yesterday brushed aside speculation that the deal
might flush out a rival bid for Paramount from companies associated with Mr
John Malone, one of the most powerful figures in the US cable television
industry.
Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, said: 'You may be anticipating a war
that doesn't exist.'
Viacom, a fast-growing cable television company best known for its MTV pop
music video channel, agreed to pay Dollars 69.14 a share in cash and stock
for each share in Paramount, the film production and publishing company,
based on Friday night's stock market closing quotes.
The offer consists of Dollars 9.10 in cash, 0.1 of a share of class A Viacom
voting stock and 0.9 of a share of class B non-voting stock.
Viacom's A shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/4 in morning trading
yesterday and its B shares were down Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 56 5/8,
reducing the offer to Dollars 66.53 dollars a share and the value of the bid
to Dollars 7.9bn. Paramount rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8.
There has been speculation on Wall Street that the deal could prompt a rival
bid from Mr Malone, who heads both Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the
largest US cable TV service company, and Liberty Media, which has a large
interest in QVC Network, the home shopping cable channel.
QVC is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a highly regarded film industry figure,
who has ambitious expansion plans.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said he had not received, and did
not anticipate, any offers from QVC. Mr Redstone said he doubted Mr Malone
would consider going to war. 'I respect him but I do not fear him,' he said.
Both men praised their deal as a 'marriage made in heaven'. Mr Redstone said
that 'a few dollars (from a rival bid) could never match the potential
rewards in the future of this combination'.
He also praised Mr Robert Greenhill, president of investment banking group
Smith Barney Shearson, who advised Viacom and played an important role in
bringing the two sides together. Paramount was advised by Lazard Freres.
The deal is a coup for Mr Greenhill, who after being pushed out earlier this
year as president of investment bank Morgan Stanley, joined Smith Barney
Shearson with a mandate to build up its deal-making business.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Claude Trichet, a supporter of a strong franc and tough
anti-inflationary policies, was yesterday appointed governor of the Bank of
France. He succeeds Mr Jacques de Larosiere, who was elected last month as
head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr Trichet, currently head of the French Treasury, the most powerful
financial position in the civil service, will be the first governor of an
independent French central bank. Under legislation expected to be
implemented later this year after the final ratification of the Maastricht
treaty on European union, the Bank of France is granted autonomy in the
formulation of monetary policy.
The new governor, who will take up his post on Thursday, will also face the
challenge of determining French monetary policy in the wake of the recent
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. The crisis broke the close
link between the French franc and the D-Mark, a central element of French
monetary policy in recent years.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said that Mr Trichet was 'the right
man for the job' because of his experience of public and monetary affairs.
Mr Trichet has had a long career in the French finance ministry and is head
of the EC's monetary committee. Since 1985 he has been chairman of the Paris
Club of western creditor nations.
Bankers and economists in Paris said that Mr Trichet's appointment had been
expected. They expected that the stability of the French franc, the
maintenance of low inflation and the gradual reduction of interest rates
would remain the objective of the central bank and the government.
Mr Trichet's departure from the head of the Treasury, has prompted a
reshuffle at the top of France's financial administration. His post is to be
taken by Mr Christian Noyer, the director of Mr Alphandery's private office.
Mr Noyer, 42, has a similar background to Mr Trichet, who is 50. Both are
graduates of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground
for many top government officials and both have spent most of their careers
in the financial administration. Mr Trichet also served as the head of the
private office of Mr Balladur, the current prime minister, when he was
economy minister in 1986.
Mr Noyer will be replaced in the private office of Mr Alphandery by Mr
Patrice Vial. Mr Vial, previously chief forecaster in the economics
ministry, is director general of Banque Pallas-Stern, the French merchant
bank.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH membership of Nato will necessitate growth in defence spending,
according to a deputy defence minister.
Mr Przemyslaw Grudzinski said yesterday that costs of re-arming Polish
forces to match Nato's equipment would need an increase in defence spending
to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, against a defence budget of 2 per
cent of GDP at present.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato's secretary-general, said last week that the defence
alliance was 'not a closed shop' and that the time had come 'to open a more
concrete perspective to those countries of central and eastern Europe which
want to join Nato and which we may consider eligible for future membership'.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, made similar comments.
Poland, along with Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, is pressing for
a clear statement of intent on membership at the January Nato summit in
Brussels.
However, Mr Grudzinski warned any debate on the issue ahead of Polish
elections on September 19 would hurt the country's chances of joining as it
would signal a lack of resolve. 'The decision to press for Polish membership
of Nato has already been taken and there is no alternative,' he said.
Poland's defence budget stood at about 35 per cent of 1986 spending levels
when Poland had an army of 450,000, Mr Grudzinski said. The armed forces now
numbered 230,000.
A mere 10 per cent of spending was going on new equipment, against about 36
per cent under the Warsaw Pact, he added.
A spending increase in preparation for Nato membership would be a blessing
to the country's hard-pressed defence industry. It would also mean access to
western technology and companies.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Directors of Seat to discuss debt plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, will meet today in
Barcelona to discuss its financial situation, a company spokesman said.
He confirmed that Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, and Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, the production director, would attend the meeting, but
would give no further details.
The meeting is expected to discuss contingency plans to reduce debts and
operating costs, including the possible transfer of Seat's Landaben plant in
Pamplona to VW and reductions in the 23,000 payroll.
Mr Piech is believed to have commissioned a special audit after receiving
reports of a looming deficit at Seat this year of DM800m (Dollars 493.8m) or
more, and requests for an urgent DM1bn cash injection to save the company
from collapse.
The subsidiary, which was taken over in 1986 and operates some of the most
modern and low-cost manufacturing sites in the group, lost DM180m last year
on sales of DM10bn.
The need for an investigation adds to the burdens of Mr Piech, who is
already weighed down by a clash with General Motors of the US over
allegations of industrial espionage.
He is also battling to restore his personal credibility, having had to back
away from earlier promises that the struggling VW automotive group would
return to profit this year.
Whatever the findings of the audit, VW appears to have little alternative
but to step in with a salvage operation.
VW lost DM1.6bn in the first half.
However the supervisory board has said it expected a positive result in the
third quarter for the German parent and the group as a whole.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Fears as Serb rebels shell Croat town
</HEADLINE>

REBEL Serb forces in Croatia yesterday launched heavy artillery attacks on
the Croat town of Karlovac, fuelling fears that fighting could escalate in
the Serb-controlled Krajina region of Croatia.
The rocket and artillery attacks, 50km south west of the Croat capital,
Zagreb, came as rebel Serb forces threatened to launch an all-out assault in
response to a Croat offensive in Krajina last week.
UN officials in Zagreb yesterday confirmed that heavy artillery attacks were
continuing by both sides across Krajina, leaving the area more tense than at
any time since the ceasefire agreed by the rebel Serbs and Croat at the
beginning of 1992.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, UN special envoy in Yugoslavia, yesterday strongly
condemned the attacks and appealed to both sides to show restraint.
Some 6,000 rocket and artillery strikes on Croatian territory had been
recorded since the latest outbreak of fighting in Krajina - a figure which
is far heavier than the current level of fighting in Bosnia, UN officials
said.
Meanwhile, in another sign of the pressures now mounting on the Croat
leadership, the Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, is to meet his
Bosnian counterpart, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, today in Geneva to discuss access
to the sea for the Moslem republic proposed in the three-way division of
Bosnia.
The Bosnian Croats' refusal to concede Mr Izetbegovic's demand for territory
extending to the Adriatic sea was a prime cause of the breakdown of the
Bosnian peace talks a fortnight ago.
The meeting comes as the 30-strong steering committee for the international
conference on former Yugoslavia holds its own discussions in Geneva on the
state of the Bosnian negotiations, and separate mediation efforts between
the Croatian government and rebel Serbs in Croatia.
Although hopes remain that the negotiations will resume by the end of the
month, before the momentum in the peace plan has been lost, so far
negotiators have appeared to have made little headway in their attempts to
encourage the three sides to return to talks.
In recent days Mr Tudjman has come under strong international pressure to
make more concessions to the Bosnian government, although diplomats fear
that the latest fighting in Croatia will leave the Croat leadership in no
mood to cede extra land in Bosnia.
Diplomats in Geneva said Mr Tudjman, who exercises strong influence on the
Bosnian Croats, had the port issue 'more or less in his gift'.
The Croatian president has strongly opposed suggestions that the Moslems be
given land around or near the small fishing port of Neum, part of the
proposed Croat republic within Bosnia, to develop as a commercial port.
The present draft plan for Bosnia gives the Moslem republic guaranteed
access to the Croatian ports of Rijeka and Ploce.
In another development, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister,
yesterday announced that a joint German and French mission would travel to
Neum to discuss the feasibility of building a port for the Bosnian
government in the region.
Although the Bosnians have demanded that Neum should be their port,
officials admit that the site is ill-suited to provide deep water access for
vessels.
French officials yesterday said that the project, which had been agreed last
week, was intended to provide greater momentum to the peace process.
The International Court of Justice in the Hague yesterday ordered Serbia and
Bosnia to stop acts of genocide in Bosnia, reaffirming an earlier ruling.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (16): The cutting edge
 -Case Study / Bomford Turner / Paul Cheeseright charts a productivity drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Bomford Turner's yard the stack of stillages is going higher and wider.
Pat's mountain, it is called: a pile of metal cages mounted on pallets. The
stillages used to ferry material and parts around the factory. Now they are
no longer wanted.
Pat's mountain, named after Mr Pat McLaughlin, the company's manufacturing
director, shows how the manufacturing system at this factory of grass- and
scrub-cutting equipment has been simplified and speeded up in the search for
higher productivity.
It is a common tale. UK engineering companies have since the 1980s recession
been in the throes of profound change and the process has speeded with the
recession of the 1990s.
Most of the changes in the manufacturing process at Bomford Turner occurred
last year, so the full effects are not yet apparent. What is clear is that
its plant, set appropriately enough for a company making grass-cutting
equipment near Evesham, Worcestershire, is very different from the plant of
1990.
That year, Mr Andrew Hall became managing director. 'The company had lived
off the past and like a lot of engineering companies it didn't really
develop,' he says.
In the trade, says Mr Hall, Bomford Turner had a decent reputation. It had a
parent - it is part of the Elswick group - ready to invest. But there was a
downside. The business lacked focus and it was operating in a declining
market.
Its main customers were in agriculture and the public sector, both subject
to financial pressure. Survival and future prosperity depended on winning a
larger share of a shrinking market. That forced the new management to
reorganise the business and expand the product range.
The product range had the first attention. It was decided to concentrate on
the UK, French and US markets. Customers were making it clear that they
wanted delivery at their convenience, not that of Bomford Turner which had
met orders out of stock or, if that was not possible, offered delivery times
of 10 weeks.
New products were out on the market, resulting in an immediate increase in
French sales and the return to profit of the group's plants in the US. New
flexibility towards customers became apparent. Like many other UK groups,
Bomford Turner was rediscovering the notion of service.
But flexibility to meet sudden and changing demands could not be obtained
from a manufacturing system which relied on making equipment in batches and
holding heavy stocks of work in progress. Nor, financially, could the
company tolerate the high level of stocks it was obliged to hold.
'The objective was to find a way to reduce the lead time from 10 weeks to
five days for volume products,' says Mr Hall. 'It was brought about not with
investment in new plant, but with detailed attention being paid to improving
the effectiveness of the existing resources of both plant and people,'
recalls Mr Paul Simon, a consultant on the project.
The chosen technique was not new. It was to establish manufacturing cells
concentrating on processes or products, each with a team of machine
operators. The effect was to shorten the chain of production, thus reducing
the material and parts held in the plant at any particular time.
Inventory has been halved by about Pounds 2m and sales per employee have
increased by 25 per cent. But, like other companies seeking higher
productivity, the payroll has been cut. In 2 1/2 years, the number employed
has fallen to 190 from 300. 'Most of the redundancies have come from the
overhead base. People who used to move materials around are not there
because the material is not there,' says Mr Hall.
The change in working methods was accompanied by changes in working
conditions, at least partly to reflect the uneven production flows: demand
for grass-cutting equipment is greatest when the grass is growing. Bomford
Turner introduced annual hours - that is employees are contracted to work a
given number of hours a year but on a flexible basis so that they receive a
constant weekly wage regardless of the hours worked in a particular week.
Overtime was suppressed. Terms and conditions of employment are uniform
throughout the company; only the method of payment varies.
For Mr Hall the past two years have shown that 'the major lesson in the
management of change is the handling of people - that is the key.' Deciding
where to place machines and the physical changes on the factory floor are
easy by comparison, simple textbook stuff.
Just as in the automotive and aerospace industries, Bomford Turner is now
urging change on its suppliers: if its own production is to be flexible,
then the production and deliveries of the suppliers have to be more closely
attuned. 'The suppliers are a harder nut to crack,' confesses Mr Hall.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (15): Taking the lead
in Europe - Britain's engineering institutions / John Dunn on the advantages
of selling to the profession in its international language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN DUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the outside, Britain's professional engineering institutions are not
the obvious places to seek advice on how to compete in the bright new dawn
of the single European market. Yet behind some of their fusty marble and
stone facades, there throbs a commercial instinct as thrusting and as sharp
as any multinational's.
The truth is that many of Britain's engineering institutions have been doing
good business in Europe for half a century or more. Some have sizeable
numbers of members - and sales - in almost every corner of the globe. For a
number of institutions, the advent of the single market has merely served to
hasten existing ambitions to take the lead in Europe - and the world - in
their discipline.
The Institution of Electrical Engineers is perhaps the most internationally
minded and commercially successful of all. Of its 132,000 members, 27,000
live overseas, with 3,000 in Europe. Worldwide sales of its books, journals,
proceedings and on-line database top Pounds 15m a year. Commercially, it
outsells its only real rival, the IEEE of America, which has over  1/4 m
members and with which it collaborates closely.
The institution organises the two-yearly International Broadcasting
Convention, which attracts up to 3,000 delegates, and is the publisher of
possibly the world's fastest reference journal, Electronic Letters.
In June the IEE opened a regional centre in the Czech capital of Prague and
announced plans for a further nine in the former eastern bloc over the
coming year. It already has 10 regional centres in western Europe. Next
month the IEE will inaugurate its first Chinese centre in Beijing.
Dr John Williams, its secretary, says that over the next five years the IEE
plans to play a leading role in the development of the electrical
engineering societies of Europe. 'The aim is to give the best possible
service throughout Europe and to be seen in Brussels as the first place to
turn to for advice.'
Electronic Letters is published every two weeks, and over 90 per cent of its
content consists of overseas contributions. Submitted papers are in print
within a record six weeks, says Dr Williams proudly. Later this year it goes
on-line - 'It will be our first electronic journal.'
Mr Gordon Rawlins, his deputy, believes the IEE 'has a duty' to take the
lead in Europe. 'We are much stronger than other electrical engineering
societies in Europe. Also, we have an international dimension that European
societies don't have. But the idea is to lead, not dominate.'
There are good reasons why Britain's engineering institutions should have
such a strong international following, says Mr Peter Thomas, who heads the
automotive division of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. 'For a
start, English is the international language of science and engineering.
Also, there is a lot of admiration for our learned society role. People like
the fact that institutions such as the IMechE archive all their meetings and
publish proceedings. They can always get back issues or copies of papers.
Engineers are just like doctors and scientists - success is all about
getting your work published]'
The leading British institutions, such as the IEE, the IMechE and
Institution of Chemical Engineers are much larger and have much more active
memberships than their European counterparts. This stems from the unique
role that British engineering institutions have as qualifying bodies. It is
virtually obligatory to be a member of an institution in Britain in order to
qualify as a professional engineer. In the rest of Europe no such
restrictions apply.
Nevertheless, the role of institutions as qualifying bodies is much in
demand at the moment as former eastern bloc countries attempt to
re-establish their own national engineering courses. The IEE, for instance,
has been asked by the Hungarian government to set up a national electrical
engineering accreditation scheme. In the early 1950s, the IChemE, helped
along by Unilever and Anglo-Dutch Shell, provided a qualifying route for
Dutch chemical engineers who took the IChemE exams.
As a result, says Dr Trevor Evans, the secretary, the IChemE has a European
branch in the Netherlands. It also accredits chemical engineering courses
for the universities of Amsterdam and Keszprem in Hungary and Nancy,
Toulouse and Compiegne in France. Those who pass are eligible for membership
of the IChemE.
At the moment, says Dr Williams, it is an open question whether the
institution will expand into Europe by developing individual membership or
whether globalisation of the institution is the way forward. 'We have a very
high proportion of overseas membership - up to 35 per cent  - and we are
seeing a number of other UK institutions gaining significant growth overseas
as people prefer to join a single discipline society, especially since
English is the lingua franca of engineering.
'We will gather more and more membership in Europe, that is clear. But
eventually I believe that we will try to globalise through co-operation with
other European chemical engineering societies.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (14): Costs in a new
light - Case Study / Osram / Andrew Baxter on a switch to save energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMING TO the UK has been an eye-opener for Mr Robert Caban, who took over
in April as managing director of the Wembley-based Osram UK lighting
business after 12 years as finance director at its Italian sister company.
'I was surprised at how many old-fashioned light fittings there were in the
house I moved to,' he says. 'People are much more aware of the cost factor
here. In Germany the emphasis is on energy saving. In Italy saving energy is
important but consumers also want innovation and a high image product. I
think that wouldn't work in Great Britain.'
But Mr Caban is determined to try to make it work in the UK. Osram is
already having some success in getting its message across. Part of the
Siemens group, Osram UK is, with General Electric of the US and Philips of
the Netherlands, one of three companies that dominate the UK lighting
market.
With overcapacity in the European market for standard lightbulbs, the
companies use innovation as a way to differentiate their products in the
customer's mind. The aim is to supply better, more appealing lighting and/or
lighting that may cost more but lasts much longer, and uses less electricity
too.
The classic example is Osram's DULUX EL energy-saving lamp which replaces
the standard lightbulb and will pay for itself in 18 months in an average
household. A user with hundred of lamps to light could save thousands of
pounds a year.
Then there are the new generation of compact, economical fluorescent lamps
for commercial lighting. 'In offices, there is a massive replacement market
in fluorescent tubes alone,' says Mr Mike Swaddling, Osram's marketing
communications manager.
The challenge is to convince hard-pressed customers - whether companies or
individuals - to see the productivity benefits from buying better lighting.
There is a wider argument too: Osram calculates that if each of the UK's 22m
households used one 20W DULUX EL to replace one 100W incandescent lamp, the
electricity saved would be equivalent to two average-sized power stations.
The quest for innovation means that 40 per cent of Osram UK's turnover comes
from products introduced in the past five years. General lighting  -
standard light bulbs - is down to 20 per cent of turnover. Mr Caban predicts
that, in value terms, Osram's sales of energy-saving light bulbs will catch
up with general lighting in two to three years, but in unit terms this will
take at least a decade.
However in the lighting industry it is difficult for any one producer to
steal a march on its rivals technologically - if they do, competitors catch
up relatively quickly - so the battle for profits cannot rely on innovation
alone.
Manufacturing efficiency is a key weapon, and here there has been a
transformation at Osram UK in the three years since it took full control of
the former GEC lighting business.
In response to the overcapacity in lighting production, and to Osram's
policy of having one European production plant for each product range, it
closed the Wembley factory in 1991, turning it into a warehouse and shedding
270 jobs.
Its factory at Shaw, Oldham, has also ceased producing general lighting, and
has become Osram's worldwide centre for producing high- and low-pressure
sodium streetlamps and related products.
But Osram has had a battle on its hands turning it into a plant that can
hold its own for competitiveness, productivity and product quality with any
of the company's European plants.
A painful 18-month slimming down process to cut costs by reducing the
full-time workforce from 750 to 530, moving from two buildings into one,
ending inefficient production and introducing more flexible working was
completed six months ago.
The process was controversial, and it has taken Osram a long time to rebuild
morale and a sense of trust among the remaining workforce. But, says Mr
Georg Marsen, Osram's technical and product director, Shaw has been in the
black for the past six months. 'Material wastage has declined dramatically,
product quality has improved because the whole site is healthy and the
morale is there,' he says.
After Pounds 7m of investment at Shaw since the takeover, and all the
changes, it will now soon be producing the same volumes as with the much
bigger 1990 workforce.
Not only is Shaw's future assured, but the turnround has also been a factor
in the improvement in Osram's results, which recovered from a 1991 loss of
Pounds 17.2m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 176,000 last year. Profits will
be higher in the current year ending this month, says Mr Caban.
Now the Oldham factory has a chance to reap the reward of its transformation
as Osram discusses shifting some manufacturing to the UK  - to take
advantage of internal changes at the factory and the cost benefits of
manufacturing in post-devaluation UK.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (13): Long-term goals
show commitment - Atlas Hydraulic Loaders / Thanks to its German parent, the
Scottish subsidiary of Atlas is still able to invest on upgrading its plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE corner of the Atlas Hydraulic Loaders factory in Blackwood,
Lanarkshire is a group of elderly machine tools painted in the dull green
that seemed to be obligatory for such production equipment in the 1960s and
1970s.
The equipment is due to be replaced soon, says Mr James Hanshaw, managing
director, as part of a remarkable Pounds 10m investment programme at AHL's
two Scottish plants - the other is 10 minutes away at Hamilton.
Remarkable because the UK construction industry has been going through its
worst-ever recession over the past three years, and is only now showing
signs of recovery.
AHL has not escaped the effects of the recession - it lost money in 1989,
1990 and 1991 - but it is in the fortunate position of being a subsidiary of
a family-owned German company, Atlas Weyhausen.
'The German objectives are different. So for us it is different from being
part of a publicly-owned company,' says Mr Hanshaw. Profits are important,
naturally, but long-term objectives are not hampered by short-term
fluctuations in financial performance or by excessively restrictive targets
for return on investment.
The Scottish plants are the German company's only foreign manufacturing
units and AHL is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. It began
producing excavators, but from 1970 to 1990 concentrated on truck-mounted
cranes - it is one of two companies that dominate the UK market.
From 1990 it began producing all Atlas' mini-excavators as well. 'The parent
company did not have to locate its mini-excavator production here,' says Mr
Hanshaw. 'It was a sign of their commitment to us.'
But there had been little significant investment at AHL's plants during the
1980s and production methods had slipped behind the standards in Atlas'
German plants.
With AHL's sales rising - from just Pounds 5m in 1980 to nearly Pounds 27m
last year - and the company becoming an increasingly important part of its
parent's manufacturing strategy, it was decided in 1991 that the two plants
needed upgrading, and that top management needed to be revitalised.
Mr Hanshaw joined the company in late 1991 and since then has developed the
investment programme, the major parts of which will be completed by the
middle of next year. 'It's not unusual for Atlas to use a recession as a
breathing space to implement this kind of investment,' he says.
Mr Hanshaw and Mr Mark Spielvogel, AHL's production manager, have turned
things upside down at the two plants. AHL had been building truck-mounted
cranes at both sites, but is now concentrating all the basic metal cutting
and welding at Blackwood.
Hamilton has become an assembly plant for the cranes and the mini-excavators
and AHL has also purchased 25,000 sq ft of extra space adjoining the plant
for potential expansion.
Both factories are being refurbished and re-equipped. At Blackwood, there is
a new paint shop for handling the water-based paints that are becoming
increasingly important in Europe because of environmental legislation.
New machine tools including a large Dutch-made machining centre have either
been introduced or are on the way. Welding equipment has been modernised and
robot welding may be introduced in a later part of the plan.
Mr Hanshaw say the aim of the investment programme is not so much to
increase efficiency as to improve quality - and hence raise sales and
profits in an industry whose customers are increasingly quality-conscious.
The investment programme, for example, includes a Pounds
160,000shot-blasting machine, which cleans and smoothes welded and
pre-welded parts before painting. AHL, unlike many competitors, did not have
a shot-blasting machine previously - although some parts were sent out for
shotblasting - and the new equipment will help produce a much better paint
finish and cut down on welding rework.
The financial effects of the investment programme are hard to separate from
AHL's overall performance because of the change in the company's
circumstances over the past three years. The UK may have been in a
recession, but the reunification of Germany has enabled the parent company
to double in size to annual sales of DM820m, sucking in equipment from the
Scottish plants.
The Hamilton plant will be producing 1,000 mini-excavators this year, up
from 400 last year, and AHL's overall pre-tax profit will exceed Pounds 1m
this year on some Pounds 35m of sales, more than double the Pounds 500,000
profit for 1992, says Mr Hanshaw.
But the investment programme is clearly very important in safeguarding AHL's
future, and that of its 320 employees, as a real manufacturing company -
'this is no screwdriver operation,' says Mr Hanshaw - and in enabling it to
handle new products such as an extra mini-excavator model later this year.
In the current climate, very few similarly-sized British engineering
companies could have financed such a programme virtually entirely out of
their own resources. But AHL does not pay dividends to its German parent, so
is able to plough money back into the company. The pay-back on the programme
will average three years, a relatively relaxed timetable by UK standards.
And Mr Hanshaw is keen to point out that not all the investment spending
went on foreign equipment. AHL will buy British where it can, he says, -
such as a new CNC tube-bending machine from Preston-based Addison Tube
Forming - - but that is not always possible. 'We are looking for a big CNC
shearing machine,' he says. 'But we can't find that here.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (12): Ignore this
technology at your peril - Rapid prototyping systems / A new idea that could
cost Pounds 400,000 is bound to meet some resistance. But what are the
advantages? Could it pay for itself in only a few months and cut
time-to-market?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUSTIFYING almost any kind of capital investment has been more than usually
difficult for British managers in the recession, and even an investment that
can pay for itself in a few months is questioned closely by the board.
It is a problem of which manufacturers of rapid prototyping (RP) systems are
acutely aware. Not only do they want manufacturers to say yes to what could
be a Pounds 400,000-plus investment, they are also trying to sell a new
idea, and thus come up against a natural tendency towards conservatism.
However, the advantage for RP suppliers is that their product fits perfectly
with industry's current concerns to reduce time-to-market and cut down
development costs in the interests of greater competitiveness.
After all, if it is possible to reduce the time taken to develop a prototype
by 80 per cent, then that really is engineering for profit. Time is money.
Fortunately, the evidence suggests UK industry is becoming increasingly
aware of the benefits of RP after a slow start. Virtually every engineering
company worthy of the name has a computer aided design (Cad) system, the
starting point for RP, and if it cannot afford an RP system itself, there
are RP bureaux ready to offer the service.
The aim of RP is to bypass the time-consuming pattern-making or soft tooling
that forms the traditional method of making a prototype. A 3D Cad file of a
part is converted by software into a series of layers, and then a variety of
methods is used to build up a prototype.
The market leader, 3D Systems of the US, uses a system called stereography
that applies ultraviolet light onto a vat of resin, building a part layer by
layer. Another system, from the Israeli-US company Cubital, uses a more
complex process called instant slice-curing.
Some of the associated technology may be complex, but the idea is easy to
understand and 'sexy', says Dr Peter Davies, director of the Advanced
Technology Centre, part of the Warwick Manufacturing Group.
Whatever the individual merits of different systems, the key point is that
building a prototype from as much as 1,500 slices can save weeks, months and
thousands of pounds or dollars on the conventional methods. According to 3D,
aerospace companies frequently spend Dollars 25,000 or more plus six to nine
months to develop a master of a single complex part. A division of a major
car manufacturer, it says, may produce thousands of detailed prototypes a
year for its car and parts designs.
In the UK, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first industrial user of RP was
British Aerospace/Rover. Early last year, when most British manufacturers
had still not even heard of RP, Rover was able to exhibit prototypes such as
manifolds made by RP.
At Lucas Aerospace engine systems division, which makes fuel pumps and fuel
metering units for military and civil aircraft, RP is part of a major
concurrent engineering initiative.
The production of full-size stereographic models has resulted in faster
'time to market' and 'right first time' products. The 3D solid model data
from the company's computer-aided engineering system, supplied by Structural
Dynamics Research Corporation, is turned into a fully detailed replica of
the casting.
Design review teams, castings suppliers, assembly engineers and the customer
use the acrylic model as an invaluable focus for discussions and
decision-making, says Lucas.
In the US, healthcare companies are using RP to produce models of new
products such as medical implants, where up to 80 per cent of the
manufacturing costs are incurred in the design phase.
Intriguingly, one of the problems encountered by RP suppliers has been that
the paybacks often seem too good to be true. Mr Richard Fedchenko, a senior
executive at 3D, recalls one instance when company managers found they could
achieve a payback on their investment in seven weeks. Realising that the
board would never believe this, they said the RP machine would pay for
itself in nine months.
The other problem for suppliers is that clients know that this is a young
industry with fast-changing technology - 3D has only been selling its
systems since 1987. So there is a tendency to hang fire and wait for the
next technological obstacle to be surmounted - or just for prices to come
down, as they have in real terms.
Proponents of RP counter that it should not matter to major manufacturers if
the RP technology they purchase is superseded within a year or two, because
the equipment will already have paid for itself - not only in pure financial
terms but in the contribution made to compressed product development times,
and hence competitiveness. Still, in the current climate one can hardly
blame UK manufacturers for letting others shoulder the burden of investment
in the technology. Hence the rise in bureaux offering companies an RP
service - there are now about 10 such bureaux in the UK.
Rover's advanced rapid prototyping department, located at the Canley site
near Coventry, offers a service to outside customers based on the UK's
largest operational stereolithography machine.
This forms one of the services of a rapid prototyping and tooling consortium
formed in March by Rover and the University of Warwick's advanced technology
centre. The consortium operates a club to advise members on best RP and
rapid tooling practice, and acts as a focal point for research and
development.
The consortium is helping companies in a broad range of industries from
aerospace to consumer goods, and this summer the ATC placed an order for a
Helisys LOM 2030 machine, using another RP process called laminated object
manufacturing, to further its researches.
As vendors and users build up experience of RP and examples of its savings
in time and money, the overriding message is that RP is a development that
manufacturers ignore at their peril.
But Dr Davies believes this is not just because of the benefits of the
process for making prototypes. The next step, using the same kind of
processes to develop rapid tooling that can be used for an entire production
run, is of potentially far greater significance, he says.
Virtually every manufactured product needs tooling, but this can often cause
the longest delays in the product development process, he says. The
combination of rapid prototyping and tooling could reduce the entire time to
marketby 70 per cent.
The centre at Warwick has already produced tooling for small vehicle panels
in two weeks rather than the normal three months, says Dr Davies. But it is
also looking at producing rapid tooling for making smaller plastic parts on
injection moulding machines.
Small wonder, therefore, that the Warwick club includes among its members
not only end-users but tooling companies - which can benefit from rapid
tooling developments as well as feel threatened by them.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (11): The wheel at its
heart - Case Study / Munters / A factory blaze in Sweden proved a blessing
in disguise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN April 1991 fire destroyed virtually all the equipment at a factory in
Tobo, Sweden, where Munters, part of the Incentive industrial group, makes
rotor wheels for its dehumidifiers and related equipment.
The blaze proved a blessing in disguise, says Mr Robin Howe, European
regional president of Munters. The company's move from a labour-intensive
manual method of making rotor wheels to a semi-automated process had gone
badly wrong.
The unique manufacturing process meant the whole production system had to be
built from scratch. But, says Mr Howe: 'We moved too fast, and had a lot of
technical problems with specialist equipment that we had to design
ourselves.'
Over five months, Munters rebuilt its factory production line, incorporating
all the design change ideas that the previous year's experience had taught
it.
The system is now working, but Mr Howe is not yet satisfied. A new
programme, Prod 93, has been introduced to address the perception that the
factory still suffers from four problems: low product quality, high
manufacturing costs and overheads, unreliable delivery service, and lack of
customer orientation.
The project covers everything from block optimisation - getting the most out
of the rectangular blocks from which the wheels are cut - to personnel
development but the objectives are clear:
All products shall have perfect quality as specified beforehand and agreed
by their customers - which more often than not are other Munters companies.
Delivery precision will be 100 per cent, as defined by customers' demands.
Accompanying these improvements will be a major reduction in raw materials,
work in progress and in finished goods.
The rotor wheel is the heart of Munters' dehumidifiers. Its honeycomb
structure of tiny corrugations makes it possible to pack an enormous surface
area into a relatively small volume, giving the wheel its high capacity for
adsorbing moisture from the passing air stream.
Consequently, understanding the need to get manufacturing of the rotor wheel
right, by improving productivity and profit at Tobo, goes right to the top
at Munters.
'The wheel is the key,' says Mr Anders Jagraeus, the company's hard-driving
president. 'Our ambition is to drive the cost of the wheel down and to be
the leader in wheel development.'
Munters is world leader in dehumidification equipment, which accounts for
about 70 per cent of its SKr1.25bn in annual revenues. But in the late 1980s
it was in a fix: sales were rising but margins were being squeezed. The
product range lacked coherence. 'We had a lot to learn,' says Mr Jagraeus,
who took over in 1991.
After a study last year by consultants from McKinsey, Munters has been
reorganised to focus on the growth opportunities in dehumidification
equipment and services, its two big markets. 'Our most important tasks were
to standardise our products and reduce our costs,' says Mr Jagraeus.
'Gradually, we have grown more market-oriented and we are much more
aggressive in the market place.'
The refocusing has already begun to pay off. Heavy write-offs in 1991
produced substantial losses but last year Munters rebounded into profit.
But continuous improvement is needed to offset the impact of recession. The
Prod (for productivity) 93 plan at Tobo will build on what Mr Howe has
already achieved since he took charge of the fragmented and disorganised
dehumidification business area three years ago.
Internal efficiency to reduce costs has combined with targeted marketing to
boost sales. Manufacturing, which formerly took place in an unco-ordinated
way at several sites in Europe, has been concentrated at two plants, with
everything monitored from Huntingdon in the UK.
Over the past two years, Tobo has reduced operating overheads by SKr5m. Lead
times have been cut from 15-16 weeks under the old handmade process for
rotor wheels to between three and four weeks.
But Mr Howe's growth strategy for Europe will call for twice as much rotor
wheel material in five years, from roughly the same manufacturing
infrastructure as today - a few more people but no more equipment. This
means a further halving of lead times.
Working with the management team at Tobo-based Munters Component, Mr Howe
set targets for improvements in four critical areas: quality, block
optimisation, productivity and logistics.
The aim is to double operating profits for rotor wheel manufacturing from
this year to SKr10m by 1995. With only 22 people directly employed in rotor
manufacture, - and that will fall to 18 or 19 - the key to the successful
implementation of such targets is individual and team commitment.
The target for block usage, for example, is already being exceeded because
of one employee's dedication. Yield from each block has been increased from
65 to 78 per cent this year.
Management meets employees every week to discuss the Prod 93 programme and
its implementation, and a timetable for reaching the targets is checked
every month. 'We've been a little too ambitious for this year,' says Mr
Howe, but it was necessary to give the project a strong start. The last
thing Mr Howe wants is to have to employ a third shift.
Delivery precision has been 100 per cent for the last 16 weeks and purchased
raw material prices have been reduced by 8 per cent since January due to
more active procurement practices.
The situation which the Tobo team envisages at the end of the process may
seem a little Utopian - inventory and finished products, for example, will
in principle not exist. Lead times will be so short and throughput so rapid
that work in progress and finished goods stock will, in effect, be
eliminated.
It is early days yet, but the changes are crucial to the European growth
strategy. Mr Howe sees much of the increase in rotor output going to new
markets and applications. Throughout the factory improving quality, cost
effectiveness and 'listening to the customer' must prevail.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (10): A line that
suits tumble dryers - Case Study / Crosslee / The leading manufacturer in
Europe is based in Halifax, Yorkshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING, like the clothes on our backs, goes through fashions.
Team working, flexibility and Just in Time are all flavour of the moment.
But, as Crosslee, Europe's biggest tumble dryer manufacturer, shows, there
is no single way of achieving these ends.
Some companies have adopted cell-based manufacturing in the search for
greater efficiency and flexibility, but Crosslee has moved in the last year
in precisely the reverse direction, introducing a production line to meet
high volume demand from big customers.
While many suppliers are adapting to the notion, championed by Nissan, of
locking themselves in with their major customers, Crosslee, says Mr Peter
Kerrison, its manufacturing director, believes that when it buys components
'competition is more important than partnership'.
Crosslee was created in 1986 when Mr David Ross and Mr Derek Clee, two
former Philips managers, bought Philips' clothes washer and tumble dryer
factory in Halifax, West Yorkshire, to focus on clothes dryer production.
They inherited a modular manufacturing cell concept in which different
models were assigned to cells manned mostly by eight-strong teams. The
cells, with the ability to do short runs, were very flexible, but they
proved less suited to volume production which the fast-growing company - now
producing 500,000 tumble dryers annually and exporting 70 per cent of
production to 55 countries - also required.
Crosslee's founders decided that, with sales growing by 25 per cent a year,
a mixture of cells and production line would be more appropriate to the
output levels of their company, which now has a 17.5 per cent share of the
European dryer market.
So in August 1992, in the space previously occupied by three cells, Crosslee
installed a production line, to be staffed by a crew of 32 or 64, depending
on output level and model required.
The line, says Mr Kerrison, has meant significant advantages in materials
handling, by reducing the number of supply points and the amount of
materials movement, and has more than doubled productivity per unit area of
floor space.
It can make 160 dryers in the same time the three cells which it replaced
would have made 75. On an eight or nine-hour long shift the line, manned by
a crew of 32, typically assembles 777 dryers.
The production line has raised weekly total dryer production by 2,000 to
3,000 - an increase of around 20 per cent. At peak times, the plant can now
produce a dryer every 12.5 seconds. The productivity gain is partly due to
human factors; production line tasks taking 20-40 seconds each are much
easier for new employees to master than the complex range of tasks, taking
about three minutes, in a cell.
This is important for Crosslee since it recruits all shop floor staff as
temporary employees. The 30 per cent who make the grade and work at the
required speed - Crosslee's founders readily admit their people work very
hard - become permanent staff after about a year.
The dual approach of production line and cells creates a career path for
employees; operators can graduate to the cells, which are better suited to
production of the more complex models, like the microprocessor-controlled
version.
Mr Kerrison, drawing on 22 years in manufacturing, does not, however support
the theory that cell-based operations yield better quality than line
production. 'I don't think there's any statistical evidence to suggest
quality standards are dissimilar,' he says. 'Sometimes you can be on a
consultant-driven bandwagon.'
Crosslee's audit section checks a sample of finished dryers to monitor
quality. But the company has abolished inward inspection of suppliers'
components; shop floor operatives are primed to spot defects and the cost of
substandard items is deducted from suppliers' bills.
The production line is a step towards more automation, scheduled for next
year. But Crosslee is pragmatic; it uses robots for welding, but also manual
labour where it is cost-effective. 'Diversity means sometimes you need the
unique flexibility of a human resource,' says Mr Kerrison.
The proof that Crosslee's systems are delivering the required JIT
performance lies in customers' response, he says; customers have shortened
the company's peak season by three weeks because they are confident orders
will be rapidly met.
When Mr Ross and Mr Clee took over the plant, they immediately halved the
number of indirect to direct workers. After their latest, just completed,
recruitment drive, they have 550 on the payroll. All but 80 are production
workers.
One of their earliest and most effective changes was to introduce flexible
working, based on annualised hours. As cyclical tumble dryer demand peaks in
the winter months and falls away in summer, production staff work a
four-day, 32-hour week in the summer and a five-day, 43-hour week from late
August to Easter. This averages out over a year at 38.5 hours per week.
'It's very cost-effective,' says Mr Kerrison.
Crosslee also makes domestic gas fires and condensing gas boilers at a North
Wales factory acquired two years ago. And it has just launched a range of
gas and charcoal barbecues - another seasonal niche market where it aims to
become the dominant European producer.
Pre-tax profits in the year to July 31 1992 reached Pounds 2.96m, on
turnover of Pounds 39.26m. The rewards for the founders were substantial: Mr
Clee and Mr Ross paid themselves nearly Pounds 1.2m each. Turnover in the
year just ended will be some Pounds 43m and pre-tax profits about Pounds 3m.
Mr Clee and Mr Ross hold 70 per cent of Crosslee's share capital; members of
staff, present and past, hold the rest. The shares are a valuable asset;
deputy AEEU shop steward Mrs June Kay, who retires this month, expects the
sale of 20,000 of her 81,000 shares to fetch about Pounds 16,000.
The AEEU says conditions for shop floor workers, paid Pounds 4.80 an hour,
are good for the area. Crosslee has a reputation as a factory offering
secure employment for those who can take the pace.
After years in a multinational, joint managing directors Mr Ross and Mr Clee
take pleasure in running a lean organisation. 'We know what's going on; we
don't need memos or reports,' says Mr Clee.
The production line concept was devised in-house and implemented in five
months; product redesign, also done at the plant, can be achieved within
three months.
Plastic components are at present bought in, but Crosslee is investing
57,000 in moulding tool machinery to produce small plastic parts itself. All
other parts are fabricated in-house. From last month, the toolroom is
expected to bid for Crosslee work against outside quotes.
Opening up export markets is the responsibility of Mr Ross and Mr Clee who
spend six months a year abroad, assessing established and potential markets
for their own-brand White Knight products, which accounts for 25 per cent of
output, and their customers, including Whirlpool, Bosch-Siemens and
Electrolux.
To travel together might seem wasteful, but it means they thrash out policy
and maintain their enthusiasm and drive. It also keeps them in touch with
the marketplace. 'Unless you talk to the customer you can come unstuck',
says Mr Ross.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (9): 'Keep at it' is
Parnaby's prescription - Profile of an industry guru / Paul Cheeseright
learns about competitiveness from a leading figure at Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN PARNABY is a patient man. His job has demanded that. Now managing
director of the applied technology sector at Lucas Industries, he joined the
engineering group in 1983 with the brief of making its manufacturing systems
competitive. For that he has needed an eye for detail without losing the
shape of the big picture.
He has long believed that for British industry to be competitive, companies
require a new manufacturing strategy which opens the way towards flexible
production, the rapid introduction of new products and the maintenance of
exact quality. This is as much a matter of organising people as introducing
new technology, although the first may lead to the second.
He is accepted as an industry guru as well as a practical manager. He
embodies the drive towards the introduction of Japanese manufacturing
organisation in UK companies, not because it is Japanese particularly but
because it has worked.
In 1989, just as the first signs of recession appeared, Dr Parnaby thought
that Lucas, in its search for competitiveness, was about '40 per cent
there'. Now, he suggests, 'we are just more than 50 per cent there because
'there' has moved.'
This is not only because of the recession but also because customers are
making increasingly heavy demands, such as a 30 per cent cut in prices over
three years or a demand that component makers like Lucas shoulder more
front-end research spending. 'It all adds up to the fact that we've just got
to keep at it.'
It is the inability to keep at it, to apply the detail with regard to the
large picture, that Dr Parnaby believes is a weakness of British
manufacturing. Beating the competition can only be done systematically and
it can take a long time: 'the classical British approach is doing some of
the things some of the time but not all of the things all of the time.'
The length of the recession and pressure from customers have shown
manufacturing companies that quick cuts here and there, an attack on
development spending or an embargo on capital spending do not ensure future
prosperity. Rather, they jeopardise it. 'You can't do a piecemeal job,'
warns Dr Parnaby. 'You've got to put in place structured programmes.'
He divides UK companies into three. 'There are some good companies which are
making good progress; there are others which don't understand the problem;
and there's a group in the middle which is having a go but hasn't quite got
its act together.'
This state of affairs leads him to conclude that is 'why we need an
industrial strategy', by which he does not mean the government telling
companies what to make, setting the price and so on but, rather, 'the
government should be looking for what elements of infrastructure they should
put in.' It should be 'helping people to find out what to do and getting
them to do it.'
He cites enviously the policies of Germany, Japan and Singapore and looks
admiringly at the networks of technological universities surrounded by
technical institutes where small companies can get work done cheaply.
The reference to the importance of universities and research institutes is
not surprising. Throughout his career, Dr Parnaby has moved between industry
and academia. Indeed, he became an apprentice before he became a student.
Over the years he has published a series of learned papers about
manufacturing organisation and taken a leading role in the technical bodies
of the engineering profession. Even now, he retains a visiting professorship
in manufacturing systems engineering at Birmingham University.
A key influence on his thinking was when he spent lengthy periods in Japan,
trying to arrange for manufacturing under licence of the textile machinery
made by the company he then worked for. He appreciated that the Japanese
success in creating and sustaining competitive manufacturing companies
springs from 'a systematic attention to detail - handling the strategy and
detail together.'
The problem for British managers is not finding out about the management and
organisational techniques but the application of them within a company. The
Lucas system, adds Dr Parnaby, has been strongly influenced by Toyota, the
Japanese carmaker, with whose production system he began to come to terms in
the 1970s.
Although, in general, he believes that Japanese companies collectively have
been the best in the world at systems manufacturing, judged in terms of
measurements like output per employee, he notes that the recession is
causing them problems.
The market in the high volume consumer products which are the speciality of
Japanese manufacturers seems to be saturated. Frequently these products
trade on low margins and it does not take a large fall in market demand for
problems to appear, says Dr Parnaby. 'But they are underpinned by the team
structure and a culture based on training,' and they will respond quickly.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (8): Why there's magic
in hydraulics - Case Study / UCC International / Andrew Baxter looks at a
company that has made a profit every month since it was founded more than 30
years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most common criticisms of the UK engineering industry is that it
is good - sometimes exceptionally good - at developing new products but
rather less successful at commercially exploiting them.
Justified or not, it is a charge that hundreds of engineering companies are
trying to disprove - often in the face of obstacles such as financing
problems and the need to keep shareholders happy.
One company that does not have to worry about the City or the banks is UCC
International, based in Thetford. The company was started more than 30 years
ago by the ebullient Mr David Button, who is managing director and owns 92
per cent of the shares.
Starting from modest premises in south London, Mr Button has ploughed some
highly profitable furrows for UCC, building the company into a leading
supplier of filters, suction elements and other more or less mundane parts
used in hydraulics.
Ten years ago, though, UCC branched out into system or condition monitoring,
selling meters that measure fluid pressure and flow rate. Now, it has gone a
step further by moving into contamination monitoring  - a step that brings
unprecedented challenges and yet, if correctly handled, could transform the
company.
Mr Button and his team are trying to plug a gap in the market that will be
familiar to any user of hydraulics, in everything from construction
equipment and machine tools to aircraft.
According to UCC, more than 80 per cent of machine breakdowns are caused by
fluid power system failure, and 70 per cent of these are attributable to the
presence of dirt. Contamination in hydraulic oil can range from being time-
and money-consuming in an environment such as mining or construction to
catastrophic in aerospace or funfair rides.
Traditionally, contamination is tested by drawing off a sample and sending
it to a laboratory for analysis, but UCC has come up with a sophisticated
portable monitor that does the job on site in four minutes compared with a
few days for laboratory testing.
The implications for the variety of producers and end-users of hydraulic
equipment could be enormous. Oil filters are often replaced before they need
to be because the traditional testing is laborious. So an on-site test could
save users thousands of pounds. Regular contamination checks with the new
machine could also reduce downtime and lost production.
UCC, says Mr Button, has a two-year advantage over its rivals in portable
contamination monitoring, and now has to exploit its lead.
The company has a number of things going for it. Mr Button notes proudly
that UCC has made a profit every month since he founded the company.
First, unlike many UK engineering companies UCC has no hang-ups about
manufacturing. Product design is done in-house, but beyond that, says Mr
Button, 'we're an assembly operation.'
And UCC can break some of the accepted modern rules of manufacture. It has
increased its stock levels in the current recession to ensure it can offer a
faster response time to customers.
Secondly, technology is kept in its place. The CM20 is a clever product
which uses the light source to 'count' the contaminant particles as the oil
flows through a small window.
But the technology is never seen as an end in itself and always as a means
to an end - creating a product that fulfils customers' needs at the right
price.
As a private company, UCC is also able to plough money into new product
development at the rate that it sees fit - nearly 10 per cent of turnover
which is very high for an engineering company. The CM20 took six years to
develop and cost Pounds 1.1m, but UCC was able to stick with it, undeterred
by technical hitches in development.
Above all, perhaps, UCC has an enthusiasm and thirst for success that starts
with Mr Button and permeates through the company of 140 employees. 'Magic'
is Mr Button's favourite adjective and this is a company which has not
forgotten that engineering can be fun.
Recent developments at UCC give a clear clue as to why many UK companies
fail to make a commercial success of a new product. Before the CM20, which
cost Pounds 7,000, its most expensive product was Pounds 400 and its
cheapest is Pounds 3.
According to Mr Mark Batting, marketing director, UCC soon realised that it
would have to establish contact with far more senior people than before to
make a sale of this type. 'Typically, the managing director signs off for
it,' he said.
About 60 per cent of the distributors it used for its other products were
not suitable for handling CM20, says Mr Button.
But UCC has also had to spend heavily - in time and money - on educating the
market about its new product, establishing its own credibility in
contamination monitoring, and finding 'champions' for the product among
potential customers.
All this requires patience - a rare commodity in British manufacturing. The
CM20 was launched three years ago and some customers have taken almost that
long to reach a decision.
The market for CM20 could eventually run into thousands, but Mr Button is
not letting the success change his basic philosophies even if contamination
monitoring doubles the size of the company. UCC will stay debt-free, and
would enter into manufacturing and licensing deals if its Thetford plant was
unable to keep up with demand.
Mr Button is also determined not to sit on his laurels or become too
dependent on one product. UCC's bread-and-butter products are not being
neglected, and new versions of the CM20 are in the pipeline. Coming soon
will be new products testing water in oil and viscosity.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (7): Pair of pumps
take recession in their stride - Weir and Sulzer / Two differing companies
in the same sector have both had to restructure and reorganise to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR MOST of British manufacturing industry, 1981 will be remembered as the
low point of the last recession. But the year has a special significance for
two of the UK's largest pump makers.
It was the year when the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering
concern which is the parent of Weir Pumps, nearly went under - only to be
rescued by its bankers. A couple of hundred miles further south at Leeds,
Swiss-owned Sulzer was moving into its new Pounds 15m pump factory.
The two pump factories, Weir Pumps at Cathcart and Sulzer (UK) Pumps at
Leeds, belong to two very different companies, but share some things in
common. Both make big, heavily engineered pumps in small batches rather than
mass producing standard items - which can be done virtually anywhere in the
world. And both have had to pump pretty hard themselves over the past 12
years to stay competitive and profitable.
Now, after considerable upheaval at both factories, there is a much greater
sense of confidence about the long-term future of the factories. 'We're
quite happy to take on the Germans, French and Japanese,' says Mr John Frew,
Weir Pumps' production director. 'We can match them blow-for-blow on what we
are doing on the shopfloor.'
At Leeds, Mr Martyn Thomas, managing director of Sulzer (UK) Pumps and a
regional director for the Swiss company's European pumps business, runs
through an impressive list of changes at the factory and its business
strategy, underpinned by the UK's status as 'a tremendous base' for Sulzer's
brand of highly-skilled specialist manufacturing.
The current improved outlook comes after 12 years which have not been
without periods of crisis for both companies. At Weir, the near-collapse in
1981 was a watershed for the company, says Mr Frew, as years of having grown
'fat and happy' gave way to an efficiency and productivity drive.
As a group, Weir has become one of the City's favourite engineering
companies and Mr Ron Garrick, its no-nonsense chief executive, is admired as
the archetypal hands-on boss.
The basic philosophy combines, on the one hand, strong control from the top
and a global strategic view which drives Weir Pumps' policies for
investment, cost reduction and operating performance; and on the other hand,
an exact attention to detail.
Every Monday, says Mr Frew, a meeting is held to review progress of each
contract worth more than Pounds 50,000. And the costs involved in every job
are looked at once a month.
As a group, Weir is known as one of the more acquisitive UK engineering
companies, having spent Pounds 123m on 24 takeovers in the last six years.
In pumps, however, the big deal came in 1987 with the takeover of the
Manchester-based Mather and Platt Machinery. In spite of the takeover,
employment at Weir Pumps has fallen from about 4,669 in 1980 to 2,169. This
includes a dramatic reduction from 3,131 to 1,225 employees at Cathcart, and
very heavy cuts at Weir Pumps' Alloa foundry.
Sales and profits are not given, but it is estimated in the City that Weir
Pumps' turnover has risen from Pounds 70m in 1989 to about Pounds 150m last
year, on which profits would have been about Pounds 12m.
At Sulzer, which has had a presence in Leeds for 55 years, the 12 years in
its new factory fall into two halves. In the first half of the decade, the
company performed reasonably while sticking steadfastly to its two main pump
markets, power generation and water supply, and maintaining some of the more
traditional customs of its old plant - three levels of dining room and
lovingly tended flower beds.
Mr Thomas joined in late 1986 with a remit to grow the business - sales in
real terms had stuck at about Pounds 15m for several years. Because of
changes in the UK market the company became 'export-led by design and
necessity,' he says, and also launched a major onslaught on the offshore oil
market that it had previously ignored.
Now, the oil industry accounts for 35-40 per cent of the factory's new pumps
business, compared with about 10 per cent in 1986. Total sales have trebled
from Pounds 15m in 1986 to around Pounds 45-46m this year, while employment
at Leeds has fallen from 470 to 420 over the same period (although overall
employment in the UK has risen to 502, which includes 80 people in Sulzer's
new pump service companies.) There is one dining room and horticulture has
been heavily pruned.
The crisis for the Leeds factory came in 1990. That year, the Leeds-based
business plunged to a Pounds 1.38m loss when it failed to keep the right
balance between profits and sales, becoming cash negative when interest
rates were high and thus becoming unable to support its growth.
It has since bounced back into profit - Pounds 43,000 in 1991 and Pounds
1.96m last year - as the benefits of a number of internal and external
initiatives moves finally paid off.
While the stories of the factories at Cathcart and Leeds have been very
different, there is considerable common ground in the changes on the
shopfloor to improve productivity and quality, as would be expected for
companies that compete head-to-head on products.
In a nutshell, both have recognised that producing large, specialist pumps
requires a careful combination of manpower and machinery. Worker skills and
flexibility are as important as new machine tools and production equipment -
each depends on the other for success.
At Weir, a Pounds 2.5m German machining centre introduced last year has
exceeded expectations, says Mr Frew. Designed to machine the biggest pump
components, it is reducing machining costs by 60-70 per cent, compared with
the 40 per cent envisaged, and is being used for a wider range of
components. Now Mr Frew is considering buying another one.
But over the last year the machine shop has also been reorganised with the
aim of having one operator controlling two machines simultaneously. 'If we
can achieve that, we've halved the costs again,' says Mr Frew.
Sulzer, meanwhile, has invested more than Pounds 4m in machine tools and
information systems over the past four years with the aim of increasing its
flexibility, but Mr Thomas lays particular stress on training and
organisation issues.
The company structure has been modified, ending the old worker/staff split
and creating a single status site by 1991, a year earlier than planned. 'I
have no doubt there have been benefits in terms of the stability of the
workforce and our ability to take people on,' says Mr Thomas.
Training has also been stepped up. 'Year-on-year, we have increased our
training budget, and training is now much more widespread,' says Mr Thomas.
A company-wide continuous improvement programme has been introduced.
Mr Bob Jukes, operations director at Leeds, says: 'We've optimised our
returns on the effective use of manpower and in treating manpower properly.'
For Sulzer and Weir, producing large or specialised pumps in batches as
small as one means that the flow of work through the factory is never even.
Flexibility is the key.
Both companies used to have a real problem in this area, and with overall
attitudes on the shopfloor. But now, with multi-skilled workers, machinists
can switch to fitting if the machine shop is quiet, or fitters can do some
painting. 'The change on the shopfloor has been phenomenal,' says Mr Frew at
Weir. 'Flexibility is unlimited and if a guy is capable of doing the job, he
will do it.'
Interestingly, both companies have to some extent swum against the tide by
increasing the amount of components that are made in-house. The Weir Group
sold its big foundry at Catton in Leeds in the mid-1980s but the Mather &amp;
Platt acquisition two years later brought with it a foundry at Manchester to
add to the existing Alloa foundry. These are separate profit centres, but
are now key suppliers under Weir Pumps' control, which enables lead times to
be reduced, says Mr Frew.
Mather &amp; Platt also made the electric motors to power the pumps, which Weir
now uses, although not exclusively. Again, overall lead times are reduced,
says Mr Frew, which can be crucial to winning large orders at short notice.
At Sulzer, Mr Jukes is buying in a little less as part of a programme of
adding further value to the manufacturing process, thus improving the
response to the marketplace. Up to a point, he says, this makes sense for
highly-engineered products. Sulzer now makes more larger fabrications at
Leeds and recently introduced a CNC (computer-numerically controlled)
machine tool to make sophisticated fastenings, gaining control over supply.
Handled properly, the decision to make rather than buy can be more
profitable for specialist engineering companies, but is also important as a
contribution to reducing lead times, where both companies have made
important advances over recent years.
With all the changes made in the manufacturing process, Weir Pumps has
halved its lead times over the past 10 years, says Mr Frew. At Sulzer, lead
times on a typical pump for the oil industry, which works on tighter
schedules than other, more infrastructure-related pump markets, have been
reduced by around a third over the past four years.
Overall, the changes at Weir and Sulzer have helped to put a traditional UK
manufacturing industry on a much more competitive footing, but neither
company is prepared to rest on its laurels. For example, both rely heavily
on the traditional skills of pattern-making for their castings and both are
looking carefully at the possible benefits from rapid prototyping to speed
up the product development process.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (6): The details that
let the British down - Interview / Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya / Warwick
Manufacturing's founder talks to Andrew Baxter about the UK's need to let
young people use their talents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be easy to get the impression from listening to Professor Kumar
Bhattacharyya that the British engineering industry is suffering from
terminal decline.
The professor, who founded the influential Warwick Manufacturing Group in
1980, pinpoints a number of ills besetting manufacturing industry: a weak
intellectual base, lack of attention to detail in product development, too
many decision makers, managers who can cut but do not know how to grow
companies  .. the list seems endless.
But Prof Bhattacharyya acknowledges the good points too - such as the
tremendous improvements made in reducing variable costs like wages, and the
ability to develop products with less resources than competitors.
Over the past 13 years Prof Bhattacharyya has turned Warwick into one of the
largest groups of its kind in Europe, charged with the role of working with
companies, mainly in engineering, to develop the people and technology to
increase competitiveness.
In the process he has become one of the most influential observers of the
manufacturing scene, and is highly regarded by the government. The group's
direct involvement in manufacturing industry both in Europe and in
south-east Asia gives the professor a first-hand view of manufacturing
trends and the ability to make comparisons.
Looking back over the past 15 years or so, Prof Bhattacharyya says enormous
improvements have been made in UK manufacturing's variable costs - wages,
energy costs and raw materials. The shakeout has been helped by the
Employment Act and the disappearance of government subsidies, which forced
big companies to improve their variable costs and had a consequential effect
on the whole supply chain.
'This created a lot of following wind, so we ought to be more competitive
than we are,' says the professor. There are a number of linked reasons why
this has not happened, he believes.
First, he says, manufacturing industry's fixed costs have not been reduced
compared with most competitor nations. 'It has only been in the last
recession and this one that people started tackling that, because they could
not reduce variable costs any further.'
By fixed costs, Prof Bhattacharyya is not referring to tangible assets like
buildings but to the decision-makers in management who are not adding value
to the company.
One of the problems, he says, is that managers are judged by their ability
to cut costs so that they can meet budgets, rather than on how they can grow
the business. Executives restructure a company but never stay long enough to
sustain growth.
'When you want to grow, you don't know how to do it, and that's where the
problem has been,' he says. 'Companies have only been getting high profits
through restructuring, they have not had the vision to both grow and
diversify.'
But the problem goes deeper than that, he says. In the all important area of
product development, there is a 'fuzziness' in decision-making, caused by an
over-bureaucratic, class-ridden command structure where there are either too
many decision-makers or people are scared of making a decision.
With some exceptions, Prof Bhattacharyya says, the intellectual base of
companies in the engineering sector is 'pretty weak'. This can lead to a
slap-happy decision-making process in technology or other areas.
The professor draws a comparison with the 'robustness' of the
decision-making process in German and Japanese companies. 'When a German
product comes out, it is technically robust because their decision-making
process is very rigorous. In the UK we have the technology, it's better than
most of our competitors. But our products are always late and come out with
problems.'
The professor believes this is because, while the UK is very good at the
conceptual side of product development, it is in the detail where conversion
to a real product takes place. 'We have great problems with details and
controlling them. This is not a question of a company's intellectual
horsepower, but one where you need teamwork.
'You get a technological edge from a combination of fuzzy things brought
together - no single technology gives you an edge. The Japanese are able to
bring these fuzzy things together quite easily. Their system is much more
disciplined because of the attention to detail.'
Prof Bhattacharyya says the education system as a whole should not be blamed
for this deficiency - the UK's education system is not inferior to that of
the Japanese, even if the German system has much more robustness in
technology.
But he does lament the disappearance of the old technical colleges. 'They
used to teach all about detail, so the products came out pretty robust.
That's gone, because everyone now wants to be a manager with a degree.'
However, he does not believe the UK should be training thousands more
engineers to solve these problems. The solution is for companies to exploit
good people better, a task that Warwick Manufacturing Group has seen as one
of its key roles - seeding companies with large numbers of talented young
people.
'You've got to give people their head, let them use their talents in a very
flexible way to contribute to the company,' he says. 'That is gaining ground
in a lot of companies, but in a lot of others they just don't know how to
utilise such people. You can't give them lousy jobs, they'll up and go.'
And hiring - and exploiting - good people is the key to reducing the fixed
cost base, because, as the professor puts it: 'One good chap can replace 10
chaps quite easily.'
Prof Bhattacharyya's advice to British engineering companies is that they
should exploit the advantages of their lower cost base as fully as possible
over the next three to five years, as one can never be sure how long an
advantage like low wage costs will last.
'Look at Mercedes, Volkswagen and Dasa (Deutsche Aerospace). Even now when
you go there you are amazed by their robustness. What they need to do is get
a little bit broader and say: 'That's a good product, how can we make it
cheaper than our competitors?'
'The only thing they have to improve is their cost base. That's relatively
easy - we did it.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (5): Catalysts in the
boardroom - Consultants / John Dunn, deputy editor of The Engineer, says
that companies are now restructuring their whole business processes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'WHEN I started in consultancy, I was doing feasibility studies on flexible
manufacturing systems like shelling peas. Now I can't remember the last one
I did.'
'Manufacturing technology is not an issue any more. Most companies have now
got their factories about right. We've done all the easy things.'
ENGINEERING consultancy has changed. The old adage, that companies could
afford to use consultants in the good times and couldn't afford not to in
the bad times, died with the end of the Thatcher boom years in 1989. In a
recession, consultancy is a discretionary spend.
But industry's demand for engineering consultancy and the issues facing
clients have also changed markedly over the past four or five years.
Companies now have a much clearer strategic view of what they want to
achieve and are beginning to examine their whole business, not just their
production operations or shopfloor technology. Also, the catalyst for change
is now coming from within companies themselves - directly from the boardroom
 -not from some consultant's report.
As a result, the consultant's role has changed. In the 1980s consultants
would recommend and then implement change for their clients. Today,
consultants are facilitators, not front-seat drivers. They are being hired
to help companies manage change themselves, to hold their clients' hands, to
give them 'ownership' of the changes.
Mr Colin Leisk of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton says engineering firms are 'a hell
of a lot wiser' about what they want from themselves and from consultants.
'They don't want 'how to' manuals and they don't want us to do the work for
them. They want training and help on how to do it themselves. More and more,
it is not us doing the work, but the client, with us providing the framework
and inspiration.'
Mr Tom Cuttill, partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand responsible for its
manufacturing business, agrees. 'Engineering consultancy today is about the
transfer of skills and knowledge to the client. Our business has changed
significantly. Five years ago we would have been very pragmatic, very
analytical, making recommendations on how to reduce the cost base. The
business was very consultant driven.'
But today, says Mr Cuttill, clients call him in to help them understand more
about the way their whole business operates and to reduce non-value
activities. 'Technology is no longer an issue. Nor is labour reduction. All
the easy things have been done.'
Clients are also much better users of consultants, says Mr Tony Roberts,
head of manufacturing practice at PA Consulting. 'In the boom market of the
1980s almost everyone used a consultant and they got to know how to get the
best out of them. Now they want consultants to work with them, not simply to
recommend a solution. They know the solution, the problem is how to achieve
it.'
Mr James Bentley at KPMG Peat Marwick reckons the UK is the most
well-developed consultancy market in the world - and the most demanding.
'The profession itself has grown up. The typical consultancy has been at it
for some years and has built up a stable track record. As a result, clients
have a vast choice. They know who to ring up to get a competent job done.'
In some respects, he suggests, the UK may now be over-consulted.
The result of all this, argues Mr John Crampton of Ingersoll Engineers, is
that industry has become much more competent at the 'easy' jobs such as
investment planning - new factories, new machines, new technology. 'I can't
remember the last manufacturing investment programme I did for a client,'
says Mr Crampton. 'Most people have got their factories about right now.'
Thus life has become very challenging for consultancies as the issues facing
clients have become softer, more subtle and more complex.
The big issue at the moment is business process re-engineering. There is a
growing realisation that the way a company does its business - the
information flow through the company - has a very real effect on the success
of that business. And the more successful companies are now turning their
attention towards restructuring or 're-engineering' their whole business
processes. They realise that every product or service they produce is the
output of a process - a series of operations and functions. And in order to
improve a product, it is necessary to look at the complete process,
examining each step in detail and improving it.
'In the old days you would look at your factory vertically and sort it out
function by function - purchasing, design, manufacturing and so on,' says Mr
Bentley at Peat Marwick. 'But today, you have to take a much more horizontal
approach. And companies can find that very difficult to do since it crosses
so many key internal boundaries.'
Mr Mike Tremouth, marketing director for the Peter Chadwick consultancy,
says the aim is to simplify the process and make it more capable of
delivering the right products by reducing 'the opportunities for defect' -
the chances of something going wrong. Typically, he says, this means looking
at a company's whole value chain all the way from the supplier, through
design, manufacture and distribution, to customer service.
'If you can reduce the opportunities for defect and can compress the time
taken along the value chain, you get real benefits.' It is a similar concept
to simultaneous engineering or parallel engineering, he says, to get
suppliers hooked into your business. 'Ideally, you should manage them so
that they become part of your business,' Mr Tremouth argues.
But it is not just the clients who are beginning to re-examine the way they
do business. The consultancies are at it too. Mr Bentley at Peat Marwick
believes that in future consultancy will come down to a matter of
individuals and their relationship with clients. 'Clients will only buy the
people with a track record. The problem for us is how to retain our
experienced people. There aren't that many new, clever things we can keep
coming up with to keep them happy. So, yes, we call in outside people to
help us look at ourselves. The future for consultancy is all change.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (4): Design tool that
too many ignore - Guest column / Ivor Owen, director-general of the Design
Council, says the industry must realise that the key to survival is to make
more high value added products that the world wishes to buy
</HEADLINE>

THERE has been a substantial improvement in cost competitiveness of
manufactured goods since sterling left the ERM last September. Yet the trade
deficit in engineering products is likely to widen during 1993, the
Engineering Employers Federation has forecast.
This shows that simply reducing product prices will not do much to reduce
the deficit or to protect jobs. To do this, more companies must learn that
the key to their own survival and to the health of the economy is to make
innovative, high added value products that the world aspires to buy.
Design is the key to this. It is the design process that controls the
transfer of technology to the final product. It determines the quality,
cost, manufacturing resources and time to market.
Design has a vital role in establishing the commercial success of a product,
yet the actual monetary expenditure involved in the design process is small
in comparison to the overall project cost.
In practice, the costs incurred are mainly those of brain power and labour
in preparing designs and developing prototypes. These costs amount to no
more than 20 per cent of the total. But it is at the design stage that over
80 per cent of the eventual product costs are determined. Companies have to
get the design right first time to avoid those costly reworkings which erode
added value.
The Design Council has recently carried out a survey of the engineering
sector, in conjunction with the manufacturing consultancy, EDS-Scicon, using
700 senior readers of the Council's publication, Engineering magazine.
This benchmarking survey revealed that 50 per cent of all products were late
to market and that this was fairly consistent across all sectors. The
average lateness to market was 27 per cent.
As a result, engineering companies are continuously losing substantial
profit potential.
The survey found that more than two-thirds of these companies overran the
development budgets of more than half of their products. The average overrun
was 19 per cent.
While this is nothing to rejoice about, the impact of this cost overrun is
far less serious than failing to introduce the product on time.
Concurrent or simultaneous engineering (CE) is now widely recognised as a
method by which companies can improve their performance, particularly in
terms of cost and time to market.
In truth, there is nothing new in CE. Fifty years ago, progressive
managements recognised the need for cross-functional communication and
simultaneous tasking between design, development, production and marketing
departments to reduce overall product development time and to design
products which more closely matched customer requirements. In essence, this
is what CE is about.
However, evidence suggests that British industry falls short in its
understanding of CE as a design management tool and how attention to design
and management of the design process determine a company's competitive and
commercial position.
The Design Council survey found that only 16 per cent of engineering
companies claim to have adopted CE as the normal way of conducting product
development, while 34 per cent had little or no understanding of CE.
Companies that do use CE report shorter development times, lower costs and
improved quality.
The take-up of CE is worst in small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs). Of
those companies with turnovers of under Pounds 50m less than 10 per cent
practise CE, countering the popular view that smaller firms are more
flexible and innovative in their approach to new product development.
This situation reflects upon the relatively poor value added performance of
UK SMEs. In the UK, only about a quarter of the total added value of
manufacturing is produced by companies with fewer than 500 employees,
compared with 35 per cent in West Germany, 41 per cent in France and 57 per
cent in Italy.
These shortfalls in performance are inflicting substantial losses on their
balance sheets. Yet getting the design process right is entirely within the
control of a company's management, unlike external national and
international factors, which are not.
One of the major impediments to the wider adoption of concurrent engineering
is the cultural shift that it demands. People who have not worked together
previously now have to do so on a day-to-day basis. They have to understand
the functions of other people and how they affect company performance.
The survey found that one oft-cited reason for not implementing CE within a
company was difficulty in getting people from different areas to work
together as a team. As the global marketplace becomes more competitive, the
key to survival will be to integrate internal functions, together with
suppliers, into a concurrent engineering operation.
Successful implementation of the CE approach to product development docs not
come easily. Managements must be prepared to persist, learn from their own
mistakes and take a long-term view. The survey found that senior executive's
pre-occupation with short-term 'fire-fighting' issues was the single most
important factor hindering the effective implementation of CE.
One UK defence equipment supplier initiated a pilot CE project about two
years ago. After only six months, the team was disbanded because of the need
to put more effort into winning immediate business with the current ageing
products.
At the time the team was disbanded, it had already identified Pounds 450,000
of annual savings through introducing better design for manufacture. At the
same time, the team was in the process of laying down the foundations for a
new and superior product which would have taken advantage of the latest
electronics. The know-how, the revitalised product, the investment in
competitiveness, were all lost.
But it is not all bad news. An example of good practice is one of the
winners of this year's Design Council British Design Awards, a microwave
test set designed and manufactured by Marconi Instruments in the UK.
Traditionally, up to four different instruments have been required to make
measurements and determine a fault on microwave and radar systems: a scalar
analyser, sweep generator, power meter and frequency counter.
The challenge facing Marconi was to combine the functions of all four into a
single compact device. Developments in broadband microwave technology made
this possible and enabled a reduction in both the number and complexity of
components. Combining the test functions of four instruments into one was
not the only challenge facing the design team: the man-machine interface and
control software for the transputer also had to be redesigned.
Using concurrent engineering techniques, the software and hardware were
developed side by side. From product specification to trial batch, the
development process took only half the time expected with such a
sophisticated piece of microwave hardware.
Although the approach required a substantial managerial input, nevertheless
it enabled faults and problems to be identified and corrected early on in
the development process.
Advances such as this will not produce long-term benefits unless they are
repeated on every new product development exercise. Generally, however,
continued attention to issues of short-term survival has left UK companies
vulnerable in the longer term. Discussions suggest that the product
development areas of many companies have been cut to the bone in order to
respond primarily to current market pressures.
When the market picks up, they will not have the capacity to compete.
While south-east Asian companies have invested in understanding how to
leverage competitive advantage from product development, some UK companies
have viewed this as a distraction from their main business.
So successful have many Japanese companies become in reducing the time to
market of their products that domestic consumers are starting to complain;
they are being overloaded with too many choices and products now have so
many functions that they are too complicated to operate.
What a nice problem to have to face] Taking these factors together indicates
that, unless the UK improves its performance, many products will not break
even during their projected life cycle. And this, it must be remembered, has
little or nothing whatever to do with the external economy; it is under the
control of the company's management team.
The engineering sector must recognise that the development of products which
are commercially viable and economic to manufacture is dependent on using
the design process to determine the collective issues of price, product
quality, customer appeal and service. Experience shows that the more that
companies practise this, the more added value they generate and the less
costly the process becomes.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (3): It's a shame
there aren't any trains - Spotlight on Waterloo International Terminal /
Andrew Taylor on London's latest railway station, built on time and to
budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY NOW, up to 5,500 Channel tunnel passengers an hour should be entering and
leaving London's newest railway station.
Right on time, and on budget, Waterloo International station opened on
Monday, May 17 1993. Unfortunately, although the new ticket offices were
ready for business, the trains and the Channel tunnel were not.
The 50km tunnel, which has been plagued by disagreements over payments to
contractors, is not now due to open until March next year, 10 months later
than originally planned.
Delays in providing engines and rolling stock mean that the first
international passenger trains linking London and Paris and Brussels are not
expected to start running until next summer.
Then, passengers will be able to take the three-hour journey from the centre
of London to the Gare du Nord in the heart of Paris, providing competition
to the airlines.
Construction of the new Waterloo station has been a remarkable success,
proving that large-scale, complex engineering projects can be completed in
Britain to time and within budget.
The main factor has been the close co-operation between the client, in this
case a state-owned railway, and private sector designers, contractors and
engineering consultants.
This has enabled the project team to overcome unexpected problems and
accommodate late-breaking design changes without triggering large numbers of
claims for extra payments.
John Brown, the engineering arm of Trafalgar House, which together with
British Rail, managed the project, says that the level of claims has been
half that it would normally expect 'on an inter- national job of this scale
and complexity'.
It has been no easy task to build a modern international station, astride
crumbling 100-year-old Victorian brick arches in the middle of one of
Europe's busiest capitals, without disrupting traffic at the domestic
Waterloo mainline station next door, handling up to 10,000 commuters an hour
at peak travel times. At one stage concrete lorries were arriving every two
minutes, 12 hours a day, say the project managers.
The roof of the terminal alone is composed of two acres of glass and 1,000
tonnes of steelwork. The construction team spent Pounds 250,000 erecting and
dismantling a 50 metres by 25 metres section of the roof at a test site in
Yorkshire before giving the go-ahead for assembly to start.
'The roof was a critical part of construction,' says John Brown. 'It was a
difficult shaped site and the roof required glass panels to over-lap, like
scales of a fish. We needed to ensure that everything would work and that
sub-contractors could cope before beginning work. It was some of the best
money we spent on the project.'
A lot of the credit for its success belongs to architects Nicholas Grimshaw
which designed the station which snakes along the top of the old railway
arches for 400 metres, tapering at one end to satisfy the tight confines of
the site.
Adding to the problems of contractors was the fact that they were excavating
part of the site within 12ft of the roof of the Bakerloo line. There was a
danger that the underground track would float upwards, distorting and
cracking the walls of the tunnel as layers of heavy sticky London clay were
removed from above.
Sir Alexander Gibb, which prepared the design brief for the civil
engineering works, calculated that only small sections of clay should be
excavated at any one time. These holes were filled with the concrete
foundations and the base of the terminal's car park before moving on to
construct the next section.
The work was so successful that the diameter of the tube line increased by
only 7mm on one 10-metre section during the excavation, well within the
tolerances calculated by the international engineering consultants.
Another problem was to prevent damage to the brick arches caused by the
lateral force of 400-metre-long express trains braking as they arrived at
the station. The solution was to install concrete cross braces, about 15
metres high and 10 metres broad under the track bed.
Constructing the terminal alongside the existing domestic station created
another tricky engineering problems. One end of the century-old wrought iron
roof had to be dismantled to allow the construction of the glass and
stainless steel roof of the adjoining international terminal.
The old roof was beautifully constructed, says Gibb, incorporating large
numbers expansion joints to accommodate movement caused by heat and wind.
'We had to be extremely carefully how we braced this structure to prevent it
collapsing once part of the roof had been been removed.'
The station had originally been expected to handle 7m passengers a year with
immigration and customs controls, similar to those at airports, incorporated
within the complex.
By the time it was completed the station was capable of taking 15m
passengers a year, double the capacity of Terminal Four at Heathrow Airport,
London, though that is several times larger than than the railway station.
It has also been decided that passport checks will be conducted on trains
rather than at Waterloo to avoid delays.
Contractors, engineering consultants and architects have had to be flexible
to accommodate the changing brief of the project.
The project team gave a lot of credit to Bovis which organised the placing
of the construction contracts with sub-contractors so as to minimise
problems which might have been caused by changes to the design of the
building.
Regular scheduled meetings at director level were held between all the
senior members of the project team to ensure that any problems were solved
quickly and did not have a knock-on effect on other works.
John Brown says the management team established a command structure and
lines of communication similar to those used on successful North Sea oil and
gas projects.
This created a tight-knit team and ensured that information about design
changes flowed quickly to those who needed to know so that construction
schedules could be reorganised accordingly.
The project team, therefore, was able to respond quickly when it was decided
late in the project that full meals for first class passengers would be
provided on trains after all. The change in policy meant that the station
design had to be altered to accommodate catering facilities for loading
meals.
The result is a modern, international passenger terminal, gleaming in glass
and steel, that has been built to time and budget with a minimum of fuss and
disruption next door to one of London's busiest railway stations. It is just
a shame that the trains are not ready yet.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (1): The wealth
creators - Keynote / Andrew Baxter says that a shift in official attitudes
has been matched by the perception that companies can do more for themselves
</HEADLINE>

WHAT MAKES a successful engineering company? And why are their successes
important, not just to their workers and shareholders, but to the health and
prosperity of national economies and individuals?
For a UK economy emerging tentatively from recession these are vital
questions, which are now demanding answers after a decade in which they were
often barely asked. For European economies heading the other way, the
confidence that they found the answers long ago is being shaken by a
downturn of unprecedented severity.
The past year has seen a dramatic shift in official attitudes towards
engineering and manufacturing in the UK. The mid-1980s philosophy of
reliance on service industries for economic growth is now almost universally
discredited, and in combination with two severe recessions has produced a
depleted and often demoralised manufacturing sector.
As fears grow that the 'critical mass' of the UK's manufacturing industry -
and its engineering sector in particular - is not big enough to sustain a
recovery, the lobbying for a new attitude from the government towards
industry, for enhancing the status of engineers, and for improving education
and training has been given fresh impetus.
This pressure is important, and is clearly being received and understood -
at the Department of Trade and Industry if not the Treasury. But engineering
companies are waking up to the fact that the future lies in their hands too,
with new products, manufacturing techniques and organisation, and better
marketing.
Mr Frank Turner, managing director of Lucas Industries' aerospace business
and former director of the Rolls-Royce civil engines business, emphasised
this point in last year's Sir Alfred Herbert lecture.
Much has been written, he said, about the state of manufacturing industry in
Britain, with the blame being placed on the government, managements, unions,
the UK's culture and a variety of other factors.
'Few have addressed what we within manufacturing industry could do, should
do and perhaps in some cases are already doing to ensure the future success
of British manufacturing.'
To make a 'real' contribution to the British economy, he said, profits must
come from 'real' wealth creation. 'This is a role engineers can uniquely
perform as compared to the many who concentrate on wealth manipulation.'
Mr Turner saw two major options for UK engineering. It could achieve a
higher profit through product differentiation, which comes from technical
superiority, product integrity and short time to market, and/or through
lower costs in manufacturing, sales and support.
The message, therefore, is that however strong the case might be for a
government role in industry - at the very least in helping to spread the
message about 'world class' techniques and skills - there is so much that
companies can do themselves to improve their performance at the grassroots.
There is, after all, plenty of help available. The Confederation of British
Industry's national manufacturing council is seen externally as being in the
lobbying business, but internally sees its most important role as spreading
the word about best practice throughout manufacturing industry.
Apart from employer associations such as the CBI and the Engineering
Employers Federation, there are the engineering professional institutions,
manufacturing consultancies and the Engineering Council - which has made
considerable headway in promoting engineering as an interesting and
attractive career. All these have a role to play, directly or indirectly, in
ensuring that engineering companies have the right inputs - people and ideas
 -to be successful.
Ultimately, however, engineering companies have a responsibility for
ensuring that they give themselves the best possible chance to make a profit
 -whatever the external business conditions.
In this, the large UK companies which have taken on board all or most of the
features of modern manufacturing - concurrent engineering, continuous
product development, leaner production and more market-conscious management
 -have a particular duty.
These same features need to be instilled in subcontractors, and in their
suppliers too, to ensure a much better spread of manufacturing excellence
throughout the engineering industry.
Mr Turner, likening the situation to a 'food chain', took the airline
industry as an example: there are seven groups in the chain: the ultimate
customer or fare-paying passenger, the airline, the aircraft manufacturer,
the aero-engine manufacturer, the supplier, the forger or foundry, and the
raw material supplier.
'The efficiency and profitability of any one of these seven groups will have
an effect on, or depend on the profitability of, the others,' he says.
The message about having the right ingredients to succeed goes well beyond
the UK. In European countries, many engineering companies are not subjected
to the same kind of rate-of-return constraints as in the UK, and operate in
a different, largely more favourable, engineering culture.
But now - and especially in Germany - they are missing one of the vital
ingredients for making a profit, the ability to manage in a crisis. 'What we
need is some of your UK managers, you have so much experience of this,' said
a German engineering executive recently.
Within Europe, therefore, different countries and cultures can learn from
each other about how to engineer for profit. The aim must be to create a
virtuous circle of innovation, profit and investment.
'There is a real need to generate more profit from manufacturing companies
to sustain investment in new plant and new products on which all our future
prospects depend,' said Mr Ron Garrick, Weir Group's chief executive, in
last year's Engineering Manufacturing Forum lecture.
Weir is one of a number of companies of differing sizes and nationalities
featured in this survey which have learnt, often through adversity, how to
use their ingenuity to engineer for a profit.
For individual companies, innovation and fresh thinking bolster the bottom
line, but are also important in a broader context: the success of
engineering companies contributes to economic growth and prosperity, and
emphasises a message that people in manufacturing should shout from the
rooftops - engineering matters.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (2): From profligacy
to investment - Foreword by the director-general of the Engineering
Employers' Federation / Neil Johnson argues there is not enough productive
capacity in the UK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
I AM delighted that the Financial Times is giving such a high profile to
engineering, the largest of the UK's manufacturing industries. By showing
readers the vital contribution that engineering makes to national
prosperity, what engineers actually do and what is happening in the industry
in other countries, the Financial Times is helping to correct the
anti-industrial bias which still exists in Britain. This survey is a bold
and imaginative step which will help to keep engineering firmly on the
national agenda.
Engineering is important. It employs 1.7m people, contributes some 8 per
cent of the nation's gross domestic product and provides 36 per cent of the
UK's total exports of all goods and services - an essential and
irreplaceable part of our international trade. Engineering products provide
the main technological basis for growth of productivity and living standards
throughout the economy.
However, we cannot take engineering for granted. If the UK is to remain an
advanced and prosperous nation, it must recognise fully the vital importance
of its engineering industry - as do the world's most successful economies in
Europe, America and Asia.
That means building a bigger industry for there is simply not enough
productive capacity in UK engineering. We have expectations for living
standards which the economy will be unable to deliver in the immediate
future. It will be unable to deliver them at all unless we rebuild our
industry.
Investment is the key to economic recovery. For over 20 years we have
gradually increased the proportion of national output we consume, increased
our borrowings from overseas and reduced the proportion we reinvest. Today,
we spend more than we earn and consume more than we can afford.
Our profligacy has caught up with us. To recover from recession, we must
have a massive increase in investment, reversing the trend of the last 20
years. There was a surge of investment in the late 1980s, but much of that
was misdirected into financial services and over-expansion of office and
retail property which was not actually needed.
Even including the property boom, net new investment as a proportion of
national output did not reach the levels that were normal in the 1960s and
early 1970s.
Almost all investment goods are provided by just two sectors of the economy
 -the engineering manufacturing sector and the construction sector. But
neither they nor other sectors of the economy are encouraged to undertake
long-term investment.
The government is now showing signs of recognising the importance of
engineering and manufacturing, but the acid test will be the measures the
chancellor takes in his November budget. To secure rising living standards
in the later 1990s, we must rebalance our spending today. Putting more of
our national output into investment now will mean spending less of it on
consumption. That will mean at best slow growth of living standards and
could well mean a standstill for several years. That will be difficult for
politicians to accept, but it is a reality which cannot be avoided for much
longer.

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large placing of shares by the directors of Airtours weakened the stock,
although a bullish trading statement accompanying the announcement limited
the fall. Hoare Govett, the company's newly appointed broker, placed 5.1m
shares with institutional clients at 403p. The move takes directors' total
holdings in the company from around 47 per cent to 42.4. Airtours said the
sale was designed to widen the shareholder base of the company and improve
liquidity. The shares lost 6 to 409p.
Airtours said its full year results 'will not disappoint the market',
indicating that it is likely to beat current forecasts. Bookings for summer
1993 are 20 per cent ahead of the previous year, the company added. Hoare
Govett yesterday upgraded its profits forecast by some 5 per cent to Pounds
43m for the current year.
But few other brokers followed suit. One leisure analyst said Airtours was
currently trading at the top of its market rating - which, in line with
other holiday companies, is at a substantial discount to the market - and
was unlikely to attract further upward revisions in market forecasts. He
added that Airtours' positive trading performance had been largely
discounted in the share price.
A mixed performance by Whitbread shares provided the focus of interest in a
drinks sector largely overshadowed by tough UK trading conditions reported
by Foster's, the large Australian brewer.
Whitbread responded to further speculation that the non-voting 'B' shares
would be enfranchised, with the news annnounced with the group's results,
due in November. The 'B' shares jumped 125 to 1325p, while the 'A' stock,
which would be diluted should Whitbread restructure, slipped 11 to 538p.
Grand Metropolitan was one of the few bright spots, where continued
expectations of the sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer group of restaurants and
public houses were being felt. The shares put on 5 at 430p. Guinness dipped
5 to 473p following Inchcape's report of a poor Japanese market.
Disappointment with the results sent Dalgety down to 480p, but the stock
recovered on consideration of continuing yield attractions, finishing only a
penny off at 490p.
Nervousness ahead of Thursday's results left United Biscuits 7 cheaper at
359p.
Thorn EMI recovered from last week's profits warning, with Hoare Govett also
recommending the stock. The shares moved up 12 to 983p.
Press reports of an unprecedented demand for Mercury One-2-One handsets,
launched in a blaze of publicity last week, hurt Vodafone, the company's
cellular rival. Vodafone retreated 9 to 484p.
Water and electricity issues were again in demand on yield considerations,
with UBS also said to be strongly recommending selected stocks. Among those
gaining ground in the Recs, Midlands rose 11 to 580p and Yorkshire the same
amount to 585p. In waters, North West added 4 at 530p.
Shares in Kwik-Fit were wanted ahead of figures on Thursday and they firmed
6 to 169p. The day's biggest turnover - 24.3m shares - was recorded in
engineering group Babcock International, which fell sharply last week
following a profits warning. Bargain hunters were out in force yesterday and
the shares bounced 4 to 33 3/4 p.
Last week's poor results from P&amp;O continued to exact a toll and the stock
gave up a further 14 to 597p as 2m shares were traded.
International trading group Lonrho hardened  1/2 to 119 1/2 p on reports,
confirmed after the market close, that it and the Ghanaian government are to
seek a listing on the Ghanaian and London markets for Ashanti Goldfields
Corporation, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake.
Shell Transport, the UK arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, rose 10 1/2 to
664p as investors switched into the stock for the dividend benefits. The
Dutch arm, Royal Dutch Petroleum, went ex-dividend yesterday and income
buyers were selling the shares to buy Shell Transport, which trades xd from
Monday.
International conference organiser Blenheim fell 30 at one stage on highly
critical comment in the press. However, 300p tends to provide a floor for
the share price and once it hit that level it recovered to close 10 off at
318p.
Invesco, the fund manager which managed a proportion of Mirror Group
pensions, fell 14 to 164p on weekend comment that there might be more legal
claims in the offing from the trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers
pension scheme. The fund said yesterday it was 'surprised and outraged' to
read reports of the possibility of further claims.
Reuters Holdings was up on the eve of its seminar to New York analysts and a
reiterated 'buy' from SG Warburg. The shares gained 11 at 1566p.
Big internationally traded stocks offering a solid yield continued to
outperform, with Hanson closing firmer at 252 1/4 p in active trade of 9.1m
and ICI rising 11 1/2 to 728p. Other statistics, Page 27

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Inchcape tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International trading group Inchcape tumbled 27 to 538p to register the
day's biggest drop in the FT-SE 100 after it reported interim results at the
bottom end of market expectations, leaving analysts to downgrade full year
forecasts.
Profits rose from Pounds 117.1m to Pounds 130.9m, but as well as being less
than hoped for by the market, were accompanied by a statement saying market
conditions remained tough. Investors were also disappointed by the slight
improvement in the dividend and analysts moved to downgrade annual figures.
The list of reductions included that from BZW, where Mr Nyran Scott - Malden
cut his full year estimate by Pounds 11m to Pounds 277m excluding
exceptionals. However, he remains positive about the company and said: 'The
results were disappointing but the fundamentals remain intact.'

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ferranti drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Troubled Ferranti suffered a drop of 3 3/4 to 8 1/2 p, or nearly 30 per
cent, in hefty trade of 22m after the board of the electronics company said
the value of net assets had fallen to less than half the share capital. The
company has convened an egm for next month to discuss the crisis.
Analysts said a break-up of the group was now highly likely, with GEC being
touted as an obvious candidate to take on some of its contracts, which
include a lucrative deal with the United Arab Emirates. Ferranti's sonar
technology oper-ations would also be of particular interest, an analyst
said. A full takeover is considered unlikely because of Ferranti's debt
obligations. The market is forecasting losses of around Pounds 28m for the
current year.

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for drug sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUG SECTOR stocks were held back by a US press article giving an outline of
the proposed Clinton health reforms.
The draft document outlines plans to halve the planned growth in health
spending by the end of the decade, according to a report in the Wall Street
Journal. Most of the reductions are expected to come from market competition
rather than from government imposed price cuts.
Share prices of the big UK pharmaceutical companies operating in the US
jumped a few weeks ago when it appeared that President Clinton's
administration would not impose drug price cuts. Yesterday, analysts were
reminded that the US climate for pharmaceuticals companies had changed and
costs will be brought down.
Glaxo, largest of the UK health multinationals, faced additional pressure
ahead of a meeting by the US Food and Drug Administration to discuss ways of
licensing asthma inhalers. Glaxo, which makes and sells the Ventalin
treatment, fell 26 at one stage and closed 17 off at 623p.
SmithKline Beecham, which faces problems with over-the-counter licensing in
the US for a version of Tagamet, its anti-ulcer product, slipped 13 to 404p
and Wellcome weakened 9 to 723p.
Medeva, which has applied to market a generic asthma product, closed
marginally up at 112p.

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL trading in the derivatives sector ahead of Friday's expiry of both
the September Footsie future and the index options brought a sharp decline
in the former, sending it to close at a discount to cash, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Traders in the September contract on the FT-SE had indicated at the outset
that 'stop loss' orders were to be the dominant factor this week. Having
opened strongly at 3,047, on the back of Friday's strong Wall Street,
September briefly advanced to 3,052 before it succumbed to a selling which
saw it fall to 3,028.
The downward trend continued throughout the session on fears that
arbitrageurs holding large cash positions might dump stock playing a part in
depressing sentiment. September not only pulled the cash market lower but
was soon trading at a discount to cash.
It recovered from the day's low of 3,016 to end the session at 3,020, at a
slight discount to the underlying cash market. The rolling forward of
positions from September to the December contract once again boosted volume.
Some 11,437 lots were traded in the near month contract and December saw
business of 5,051 lots.
Volume in the traded options recovered from Friday's poor level reaching
30,012 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option accounted for half of the day's
business with a total of 15,479 lots traded. Lonrho was the the busiest
stock option at 1,700 contracts.

FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices hit by renewed selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON stock market looking increasingly unhappy with the peak levels
achieved at the end of last month continued to focus on its own worries
yesterday, paying no heed to firmness on other European bourses or to the
signing in Washington of the Middle East peace settlement. UK equities
appeared nervous regarding prospects for Friday's expiry in the stock index
sector.
An attempt to respond positively to Wall Street's sharp rise on Friday night
was tripped up by a heavy trading programme in equities - reportedly worth
around Pounds 600m - which was believed to be the first of a likely series
of manoeuverings by securities firms ahead of Friday's expiry of the
September dated futures contract on the FT-SE Index.
The UK equity market rose by nearly 8 per cent over the three month period
of the September contract to reach its trading peak of 3.115, with the
leading trading firms often arbitraging between futures and underlying
equities. Shares have now fallen by about 3 per cent from that peak, leaving
some large trading positions open ahead of Friday's expiry. The futures
expiry has in the past produced erratic price movements.
Early optimism in equities was also undermined by renewed falls in the
pharmaceutical stocks following reports that drafts of President Clinton's
healthcare reform plans imply a halving of projected growth in US medical
spending in this decade.
Heavy falls in Glaxo and the other drug industry stocks were quickly joined
by wider ranging losses as the two way trading programme got under way. It
was believed that the programme originated with SG Warburg, the London-based
investment house which is known to be cautious on the market outlook, with a
year-end Footsie prediction still held at 2,900 despite the market's advance
over the past month.
At worst, the FT-SE Index dipped by 19.3 to 3,017.7 yesterday but a rally
then set in, encouraged when Wall Street came in on the bull tack again,
adding 12.58 Dow points in UK hours.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,024.8 for a net loss on the
day of 12.2 points. Traders said that the late rally reflected technical
buying from professional dealers seeking stock to meet earlier selling
commitments, rather than any significant buying pressure. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, down 4.8 at 3,471.5, followed the direction of the blue chips.
The stock market made no response to statistics on domestic producer prices,
showing little change, but was poised for futher important economic data
this week; tomorrow will bring the August Retail Price Index, and Thursday
the latest wages and unemployment figures.
The corporate results flow was also slower yesterday, although Inchcape fell
sharply after an interim statement which revived stock market concern over
the trend of the company reporting season now unrolling.
Retail, or genuine customer business in UK equities, which has remained high
as the market has turned back from its peak, totalled Pounds 1.37bn on
Friday. Seaq-reported volume fell from 596m shares on Friday to 585.3m
shares yesterday, with non-Footsie business increasing its contibution to
about 67 per cent of the total.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Upward momentum for Dow slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS saw their upward momentum that they had regained at the end of
last week mainly slow to a halt yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average registering only a modest advance ahead of today's reports on
consumer prices and retail sales, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow was 12.58 higher at 3,634.21. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained just 0.34 at 462.06. Secondary markets closed
on a soft note, the American SE composite losing 1.76 at 454.30 and the
Nasdaq composite shedding 3.99 to 740.32. Trading volume on the New York SE
was 245m shares.
With no significant economic news to digest, investors were looking forward
to the release today of the consumer price index for August. The figures are
expected to show that inflation at the retail level remains very low,
reinforcing the impression left by August's producer price index, released
on Friday.
At the end of last week, sentiment was jolted out of the doldrums when the
government reported that wholesale prices had declined by a surprising 0.6
per cent last month.
The upbeat mood carried over to yesterday's opening. Once again equities
took their cue from the bond market, where the price of the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year issue continued to firm in early trade before ending the
day on a flat note. Share prices, following a similar pattern, slipped to
mixed levels in late trading. But investors did not appear to be unduly
troubled by what is expected to be a slight decline in retail sales for
August.
Paramount Communications was one of the most actively traded stocks,
following an agreement by Viacom to acquire the entertainment company for
Dollars 69.14 a share. On the NYSE, Paramount rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars
64 1/2 with 3.2m shares traded. On the Amex, Viacom 'A' voting stock was
down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 64 1/8 and the 'B' non-voting lost Dollars 2
5/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 .
Car issues were given a lift by news that Ford Motor had made progress in
union contract negotiations which will set a pattern for the industry. Ford
advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55, General Motors Dollars 1/2 to Dollars
47 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 1/2.
In the health care sector, share prices edged lower on the release of
further details of President Bill Clinton's reform plans. Warner-Lambert
shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 66 5/8 , Pfizer lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 60
3/8 , Merck was down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 31 3/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson
slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Schering-Plough receded Dollars 1
to Dollars 60.
Canada
TORONTO finished lower in fairly heavy trading due to a continued slide in
gold stocks.
The TSE 300 index fell 29.9 to 3,971.8 and declines outscored advances by
461 to 273. Volume rose to 64.4m shares from Friday's 55.8m but trading
value declined to CDollars 430m from CDollars 590m.
The gold shares index plunged 5.38 per cent as the bullion price dropped a
further USDollars 7.45 an ounce in New York.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual themes influence
continental trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL markets went their own ways yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was dominated by technical trading as the DAX index rose 11.13 to
1,872.57 in turnover of DM4bn.
Reviewing the equity market in its latest briefing Nikko Europe commented
that last week's GDP data was taken by some as evidence that the economy had
bottomed-out.
But, as Nikko noted, 'the main cause of the rise was an increase in
inventories as German industry restocks ahead of the upturn. When it fails
to materialise there will be an unpleasant unwinding of the inventory
position'.
The brokers anticipate that the economy will dip in the second half and for
equities to weaken.
In the market Volkswagen rose DM6.30 to DM360.80 and Daimler, which is due
to release first half figures on Friday, DM7 to DM717.
There was disappointment in PARIS that the authorities had once again made
no movement on lowering the intervention rate; but after falling initially
to a day's low of 2,098 the CAC-40 index finally closed 10.69 higher at
2,115.07.
Turnover was low at FFr2.5bn.
Speculation over the future of UAP's chairman Mr Jean Peyrelevade, rumoured
to be moving to head Credit Lyonnais, a report denied by the insurer,
boosted activity, and UAP's shares closed FFr5 higher at FFr610.
Further takeover speculation surrounding Cap Gemini Sogetti lifted the
shares FFr5.20 to FFr215.70, while Lafarge Coppee was FFr1.90 higher at
FFr414.00 ahead of today's announcement of details of a capital increase.
STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading, supported by Ericsson, which closed at
an all time high, up SKr15 to SKr409, as the Affarsvarlden general index
rose 10.7 to 1,285.6. Interest in the telecommunications group was reported
to have largely come from overseas, and particularly from US investors.
Turnover was SKr1.5bn from Friday's SKr1.2bn.
AMSTERDAM fell slightly, with the CBS Tendency index off 0.2 at 124.3. Royal
Dutch closed unchanged at Fl 183.50, but ex a dividend of Fl 3.70. KLM
slipped 40 cents to Fl 35.50 on reports that merger talks with other
partners of the planned new European aviation group were being delayed.
MILAN picked up after an easier start as the lira strengthened against the
dollar and the Comit index finished little change, 0.04 higher at 597.55.
Rinascente rose L242 or 3.7 to L9,427 amid renewed speculation that it will
be sold as part of Fiat's planned disposals in the retail and insurance
sectors.
Ferruzzi again fell L44.80 or 10 per cent to L403.20 amid renewed
speculative activity ahead of the restructuring programme which is due to be
announced by creditor banks later this month.
ZURICH was closed for a local public holiday but shares continued their
recent consolidation in thin Basle and Geneva trading and the SMI index
finished 2.0 higher at 2,365.6.
MADRID was depressed by profit-taking and the general index shed 3.32 to
285.15.
Argentaria, the state-controlled bank, fell Pta270 or 4.8 per cent to
Pta5,380 after the cabinet authorised the sale of a further 25 per cent
stake. Banesto shed Pta65 or 2.6 per cent to Pta2,465.
BRUSSELS was led higher by some late basket buying just before the close of
a restrained day's trading and the Bel-20 index finished 3.52 higher at
1,324.17.
COPENHAGEN was dragged lower amid uncertainty about the current strength of
the krone and the KFX index eased 0.4 to 97.82. Among actively traded
issues, GN Store Nord, a leading telecommunications group, edged DKr1 lower
at DKr524 in heavy turnover of DKr16m.
OSLO picked up as electors went to the polls. The All-share index rose 8.3
to 559.25 with the return of the Labour party widely expected to be
announced late last night.
VIENNA saw a strong recovery in the price of OMV, the oil group, on a
broker's rerating. The shares lifted Sch24 to Sch764 as the ATX index gained
12.53 to 988.3.
ATHENS saw the general index shed 4.84 to 791.38 as a measure of stability
returned to the market after the gyrations at the end of last week, and as
the general election campaign got under way.
ISTANBUL was pushed higher on satisfaction over the election at the weekend
of a new leader of the Social Democrat populist party which is a junior
member of the coalition. According to Carnegie International analysts in
London the lection of Mr Murat Karayalchin 'might be expected to cement the
place of the party in the government and help remove residual opposition to
privatisation'. The composite index advanced 606.1 or 4.7 per cent to
13,555.

FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average surges to
a new high for the year

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average surged to a new high for the year on hopes of a cut in
the official discount rate this week, and additional fiscal measures to
support the economy, to be announced on Thursday, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 330.13, or 1.6 per cent, at 21,148.11, its
first rise for six trading days. The index opened at the day's low of
20,850.09 and rose to the session's high of 21,164.12 in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 270m shares from Friday's 569m, which was largely due to
trading linked to September futures and options settlements. Advances
outnumbered declines by 773 to 259, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks advanced 17.01 to 1,694.51, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.13 firmer at 1,300.20.
Weekend reports that Y5,000bn worth of measures to boost the economy would
be implemented, including tax cuts for housing reform, helped to lift
investor confidence.
Investment trusts and tokkin funds were seen buying after the Nikkei reached
the 21,000 level, while dealers also bought for their own accounts. Foreign
investors were purchasers of large-capital issues.
Steel shares, which had fallen back last week on announcements of downward
earnings revisions, were bought. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue,
rose Y14 to Y347, NKK Y7 to Y289 and Kobe Steel Y14 to Y304.
Housing-related issues were supported by the reports of the economic
stimulus package. Daiwa House climbed Y30 to Y1,800, while Takara Standard,
a kitchen and bathroom facilities maker, rose Y30 to Y1,470.
High-technology stocks were firm, Hitachi adding Y16 at Y885 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial Y10 at Y1,470. However, Pioneer Electronic fell Y110 to
Y2,750 on reports that a leading karaoke machine retailer had decided to
switch to Sony machines from Pioneer karaoke equipment.
Sanyo Securities, which was suspended last Friday on reports that the
company had sought financial assistance from its main creditors, declined by
its daily limit of Y100 to Y575. Sanyo and Ministry of Finance officials
last week denied the reports, but investors remained pessimistic over
Sanyo's financial position.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y3,000 to Y919,000 as investors who had
bought the issue on margin in April liquidated positions. Some market
participants were also discouraged by the absence of public
telecommunication infrastructure investments in the government's emergency
package, as had been hoped.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 217.56 up at 22,998.55 in volume of 53.9m
shares.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark down on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK yesterday lost some of the ground it had made against the dollar
and European currencies in recent days, as dealers took profits, writes
James Blitz.
The German currency's move down yesterday was sharp. It lost nearly 1 1/2
pfennigs against the dollar to close at DM1.6110. Against the French franc
it fell about 3 centimes to FFr3.482.
However, few analysts believe there has been any significant change to the
market's view that the D-Mark is set on the path of short term appreciation.
Yesterday's move against the dollar was accompanied by no new data in the
US. Instead, several dealers said they had taken profits after the recent
powerful D-Mark moves in currency markets.
'These moves do not in any way change our short term views about a strong
D-Mark,' said Mr Marc Hendriks, head of international interest rate research
at Swiss Banking Corporation in London. 'There is some substantial economic
data coming up this week, and traders have just been clearing out their
positions before that.'
The D-Mark's weakness was felt across the board in Europe. The Danish krone
strengthened to close at around DKr4.10 to the D-Mark, while the peseta
broke through the Pta80 level, closing at Pta79.28 from a previous Pta80.89.
Most striking of all were the appreciations in the Belgian franc and
Portuguese escudo, both of whose central banks cut interest rates. The
Belgian franc finished at BFr21.23 from a previous BFr21.47 and the Escudo
at Es101.58 from a previous Es102.38.
Sterling was one of the few currencies to lose more ground against the
D-Mark, in spite of data showing that the prices of finished manufactured
goods in the UK had nudged only marginally higher in August.
Dealers suggested that sterling may have suffered from the continuing need
of European central banks to acquire D-Marks for pounds so that they can pay
the Bundesbank for recent intervention. Sterling closed at DM2.4750, down
1/4 pfennig on the day.
Yesterday's move in the dollar/D-Mark rate was echoed by another strong
performance from the dollar against the yen. The US currency closed at
Y106.25, up from Y104.75. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6077 and
Y106.25.
Dealers continue to think that the yen will be the focal point of this
week's trading. Today brings the Japanese trade data for August. This should
show a modest fall in the size of the surplus from the previous month: with
a consensus forecast of a Dollars 7.0bn surplus from a previous Dollars
11.8bn. If the surplus is even smaller it could add to downward pressure on
the yen.
All eyes are also focused on the economic stimulus package due to be
unveiled in Japan on Thursday. A significant stimulus appears to have been
well priced in by dealers, as has some easing in rates.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Money Markets: France holds firm
</HEADLINE>

EXPECTATIONS of further cuts in French interest rates were slightly dampened
yesterday after the Bank of France decided not to reduce either of its main
interest rates in its weekly money market oper-ations, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's 50 basis-point lowering of its discount rate last week had
been seen as a reason for the French authorities to ease policy yesterday.
So, too, had the franc's strong performance against the D-Mark on the
currency markets yesterday morning.
However, the intervention rate was left unchanged at 6.75 per cent and the
five to 10-day lending rate at 7.75 per cent.
Mr Adrian James, international economist at NatWest Markets in London, said
the French authorities may still be concerned by the very low level of
foreign exchange reserves shown up by the Bank of France's weekly report
last week.
The December French franc interest rate contract fell sharply on the news
that rates were unaltered. It closed at 93.89, some 11 basis points down
from its opening level.
The story in Belgium was different, following the Belgian authorities' cut
in their end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12 per cent. The
December Belgian franc contract jumped 30 basis points to finish at 93.05.
The Portuguese authorities also eased rates, reducing their emergency
lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent.
In German money markets, conditions continued to be tight, partly because
the Bundesbank did not help to bring call money down by providing section 17
funds.
The cost of overnight lending continued to be high, hovering around the new
Lombard rate level of 7.25 per cent. This partly reflected the fact that
there has been heavy lending at the Lombard rate level in the last two
trading days, amounting to some DM6bn. Dealers expected the Bundesbank to
add liquidity in its weekly money market operations on Wednesday.
Conditions in the sterling market were fairly easy after most of the Pounds
1.55bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in the early
round. The overnight rate of lending fell as low as 4 per cent at around
lunchtime. Three-month money closed at 5 7/8 per cent with a spread of  1/16
percentage point. The December sterling contract ended at 94.35 from 94.38.

FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian aluminium faces cost
blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AN ENERGY price increase the Russian government is attempting to impose
would drive the operating costs of the republic's aluminium smelters up to
an average of Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above the present international
market price, Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing at VAW,
the German group, said yesterday.
Already the domestic price for aluminium to Russia's consuming industries
had risen to a level that was forcing some mills to consider importing metal
from London Metal Exchange stocks, he said.
Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the Russian government
was trying to lift energy costs to the world level in stages. Mr Peters said
the government was unlikely to make the aluminium smelters pay all the
latest price increase.
The two big Siberian smelters, Bratsk and Irkutz, had already refused to
accept the increase on the grounds that their power plant was dedicated to
supplying them and was too far away from any other potential customers.
However, he suggested at Metal Bulletin magazine's annual aluminium
conference, that there would be some energy price increase, if not as large
as the government contemplated. Those smelters that could not cover their
costs would quickly have to close because they would not be able to pay for
raw materials.
Mr Peters' comments highlighted the complex background to the dispute
between the European Commission and the aluminium producers in the CIS that
resulted in restrictions being imposed on CIS aluminium imports into the EC
until the end of November.
Negotiations have re-started after the European holiday season and in talks
last week the commission representatives made it clear that the EC was
offering help to modernise the CIS industry and to revitalise domestic
aluminium demand in the CIS in return for export restraint.
According to Mr Peters, aluminium consumption in Russia dropped between 1988
and 1992 from 2.6m tonnes a year to 1.8m tonnes.
