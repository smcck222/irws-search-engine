FT  09 SEP 93 / Directors' pay shoots ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL earnings of top company directors rose by an average of 12 per cent in
1992-93, nearly three times the average increase gained by the workforce
generally, say figures published yesterday by Income Data Services, the
employment research organisation.
The analysis of directors' renumeration is drawn from annual reports from FT
 -SE 100 companies covering trading years ending between September 1992 and
March 31 1993. The average increase for the workforce to June, according to
government figures, was 3.5 per cent.
IDS also gave the median increase of 8 per cent for top directors, which it
said may perhaps more accurately reflect the situation because average
figures were heavily influenced by large increases. There was an enormous
range of increases and decreases around the levels, IDS said.
The highest increase was at Carlton Communications, the media group, where
the chairman's total emoluments jumped by 84.2 per cent to more than Pounds
530,000 - made up of a 42.5 per cent salary rise and a performance-related
bonus of Pounds 120,000 from a newly established scheme.
IDS said: 'In a spirit of greater openness the annual report outlines the
rationale for the rise.'
Carlton yesterday pointed to a special remuneration committee's report. It
concluded that the chairman's salary 'did not recognise his contribution to
the company or its progress over the last year, nor did it reflect the
market level for such a position.'
At the other end of the spectrum total earnings of the food group Argyll's
top director dropped by 43.9 per cent. IDS said this reflected the fact that
a long - term bonus was paid in the preceding year and such bonuses were
awarded only every three years. Excluding bonuses, base salary for the top
director at Argyll was increased by 7.7 per cent.
No identifiable link between company performance and pay increase was seen
in its analysis, IDS said. In five companies the highest-paid director's
bonus increased despite a fall in both profits and earnings per share.
In only three companies, Kwik Save, Rentokil and British Telecommunications,
did the rise in bonus levels closely match the increase in profits and
earnings per share.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Japanese-style working practices win support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE-STYLE working practices should no longer be seen as 'alien' by UK
workers, the TUC agreed yesterday, as it backed union agreements with motor
companies Nissan and Toyota.
Two years ago a motion passed by the annual congress describing Japanese
methods, including the use of teamworking and quality circles, as 'alien'
angered inward investors and caused embarrassment to senior TUC officials.
Yesterday's motion noted that 'unions have created the conditions in which
British manufacturing is able to compete with foreign-based companies. In
particular, union agreements such as those with Nissan and Toyota are no
longer seen as 'alien' working practices and have been emulated by companies
such as Rover.'
Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU craft union general secretary, said workers at Nissan
and Toyota had excellent pension rights, first-class training opportunities,
above-inflation pay rises and maternity and paternity leave entitlements
better than other car companies.
Mr Laird said: 'We have not had one redundancy since these companies came to
this country.
'British workers in partnership with forward-thinking companies like Toyota,
Komatsu . . . and Nissan have all delivered unprecedented levels of success
 -achieved in spite of, rather than because of, our government.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Smith launches into dangerous waters at Brighton: Kevin
Brown asks if Labour's leader could have reopened wounds within his party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Smith, the Labour leader, left Brighton yesterday leaving behind a
lot more friends than seemed likely when he arrived on Tuesday.
His robustly pro-union speech to the TUC conference was warmly welcomed by
delegates tired of being treated like dinosaurs by Labour leaders.
But Mr Smith is playing a dangerous game. He may have succeeded in rescuing
the unions from the graveyard, but the price could be high.
At best, he risks giving fresh impetus to Conservative sneers about union
influence over Labour's leadership. At worst, he could reignite the
fratricidal battle between the party's modernist and traditional wings.
Mr Smith's aim was to establish his credentials with the union leaders who
will determine the fate of his plans to democratise the selection of Labour
parliamentary candidates.
His plan, already watered down to overcome union resistance, is for
candidates to be elected by constituency members on the basis of
one-member-one-vote.
The unions would lose their right to influence selection, but union members
would be able to vote as individuals by paying a reduced party membership
fee in the constituency where they live.
As Mr Gavin Laird, right-wing leader of the engineering workers' union, put
it, the unions are being offered a trade-off: sympathetic treatment by a
Labour government in return for a reduction in their influence in party
affairs.
At the last count, the plan looked like being defeated by the combined block
votes of the GMB and TGWU general unions, backed by a host of similarly
inclined small unions.
However, several critical unions, including Usdaw, the shopworkers' union,
and Unison, the public-sector union, have shown signs of switching sides.
Others are prepared to accept one-member-one-vote if trade union members of
the Labour party exercise their votes through the union structure.
But the outcome remains highly uncertain. Usdaw, for example, will not
decide until next week how to cast its conference votes.
One possibility being canvassed is that both Mr Smith's proposals and a
series of amendments by critics will fail to attract a majority vote,
leaving a messy impasse.
If that happens, the proposals would probably be implemented by Labour's
national executive committee, which gave its approval earlier this year.
Such a scenario would allow Mr Smith to claim a victory of sorts, but it
would undermine his leadership by suggesting that he is unable to exercise
effective control.
It would also raise questions about Mr Smith's judgment, first in making
one-member-one-vote a touchstone of his leadership abilities, and then in
refusing to back down in the face of overwhelming odds.
This line of argument has already been aired by Mr Alan Tuffin, leader of
the UCW postal workers' union, who observed dryly that 'the public are not
lying awake at night worrying about how Labour selects candidates'.
However, whatever happens on the conference floor, the debate has given
renewed impetus to attempts by Labour's traditionalist wing to undermine the
modernisers who surround Mr Smith.
Leftwing MPs were already saying yesterday that Mr Smith's comments on
economic policy, in which he committed the party to full employment, wider
employee rights and a minimum wage, spelt the end of the modernist grip on
policy development.
Mr Smith's friends said that there was no intention to signal a break with
Mr Gordon Brown, the modernist shadow chancellor, who has effectively dumped
Labour's 1992 'tax and spend' manifesto.
It was also being pointed out that the modernists remain in firm control of
the NEC and the parliamentary party, while the traditionalists have been
marginalised by repeated electoral defeat.
Nevertheless, the tone of Mr Smith's remarks sounded closer to
traditionalists such as Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow cabinet member,
and Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, who have argued strongly
for a radical manifesto at the next election.
That will hearten traditionalist campaigners like Mr Gould, who has
threatened to mount a potentially divisive campaign for the deputy
leadership next year unless the party adopts a more radical tone.
Mr Smith's view is that one-member-one-vote is an essential first step in
the process of making Labour acceptable to middle-class voters, whose
support is essential if the party is to win a general election.
But his proposals leave intact the unions' conference block votes on the
leadership and policy issues, leaving the party open to continued
Conservative claims that it remains in thrall to the unions.
Mr Gerry Malone, the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, was quick to
revive this line of attack yesterday, suggesting that the union link will be
a prime target for the government at the next election.
Mr Smith's advisers say he draws comfort from the warm response to his
speech from union leaders, and he remains convinced that 'people will come
round'.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Fears on resale of council houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS environment committee has urged the government to investigate
the likely consequences for the housing market if increasing numbers of
former council properties bought by tenants cannot be re-sold, Ivor Owen
writes.
In a report published yesterday the committee highlights anecdotal evidence
that building societies are not prepared to fund mortgages when some
properties acquired by tenants under the government's 'right-to-buy' policy,
particularly high-rise flats, are placed on the market.
The cross-party committee expresses concern about the possibility of growing
numbers of 'unsaleable right-to-buy properties' and the consequent effect on
the value of surrounding homes.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Holiday price war set for ceasefire: Travel agents say
profits have fallen too far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHORT-LIVED holiday price war will end on Saturday when the two largest
travel agents' chains are expected to terminate their offer of a 10 per cent
discount on all bookings.
Thomas Cook, which sparked the price war just over three weeks ago, ended
its 10 per cent offer last Saturday.
Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain, says that it will end the
discount this weekend, although it will continue to offer some reductions.
The second-biggest retail group, made up of Pickfords Travel and Hogg
Robinson, says that it is also likely to call off the 10 per cent campaign.
The chains say that although the discounts on summer 1994 holidays have
resulted in the highest-ever level of early bookings, the 10 per cent
reduction deprived them of almost all their profits.
'We were effectively giving away the standard retailer's margin,' one travel
agent said.
The decision by the travel retailers to end hostilities comes in a week in
which companies in several sectors have attempted to gain an edge on
competitors by cutting prices.
The Times newspaper this week reduced its price from 45p to 30p; Mercury,
the telecommunications company, offered free evening and weekend local calls
in the London area on its new cellular network; and Save &amp; Prosper, the
investment group, launched a Visa card with an interest rate at least 7
percentage points lower than most rivals.
The decision by the travel retailers to call off their discounting campaign
indicates that, in the holiday industry at least, there are limits to how
long steep price reductions can be maintained without damaging business.
Travel agents usually demand a 10 per cent commission from tour operators,
but some small operators say they have been asked for more.
Tour operators already operate on tiny margins. Civil Aviation Authority
figures show that the top 30 tour operators last year had average profit
margins of only 2.8 per cent. This is still far better than the late 1980s,
when price competition was at its most intense. In 1987, the top 30
operators had an average margin of minus 0.9 per cent. In 1988 the average
profit margin was 0.5 per cent; in 1989 it was zero.
Few in the industry want to return to damaging competition. All the large
retailers are now part of integrated travel groups which, while striving to
increase market share, do not want to endanger their profitability.
Lunn Poly is part of the Thomson group, Pickfords and Hogg Robinson are
owned by Airtours, and Thomas Cook has financial links with Owners Abroad.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Lib Dems react with joy as Tories 'panic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrat leaders yesterday greeted joyfully the government's
decision to concentrate its resources on fighting the Liberals in the south
of England.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government was
'panicking' in the face of a surge of support for his party.
He was speaking as Mr John Major, the prime minister, began a short visit to
the West Country in an attempt to revive party workers' morale.
Several other ministers and Conservative officials have visited the area
recently, including Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, who has
identified the Liberal Democrats as the prime threat to the government at
the next election.
Mr Ashdown said the government was 'quite right' to switch its attention
away from Labour, which was now 'non-existent' in much of the south-west.
'It is an indication of the extent of the government's panic,' he said.
Mr Ashdown said he would ignore the personal tone of recent Conservative
attacks on the trustworthiness of Liberal Democrats in general and leading
members in particular.
'I think most people will treat that with the disdain that it deserves. If
the Tories believe they are going to change people's votes by engaging in
that kind of rhetoric they are making a cataclysmic error,' he said.
The change of tack by the Conservatives follows the government's crushing
defeat in the Christchurch by-election this year, when the Liberal Democrat
candidate overturned a 30,000 majority.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat MP in charge of campaigning policy,
said the party had signed up 5,100 new members in August - its highest
monthly total.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Government clash over hazardous waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is heading for another clash over European environment policy
after it yesterday defended its methods of disposing of hazardous waste,
Bronwen Maddox writes.
If Britain loses its battle over the form of a proposed European Commission
directive, it might have to incinerate waste now disposed of in landfills or
rubbish dumps, adding significantly to costs.
It argued that the practice of mixing industrial and household waste on the
same site - co-disposal - is safe.
Co-disposal is used for 70 per cent of 'difficult' industrial waste - 2.8m
tonnes a year.

FT  09 SEP 93 / High-flyer at Lloyd's loses high-risk game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S decision by Mr Stephen Merrett to resign his position as deputy
chairman of the Lloyd's council following intense pressure from senior
figures in the insurance market completes an unhappy few months for one of
Lloyd's of London's most controversial underwriters.
Mr Merrett joined the business built up by his father, Roy, in 1963, and
became chairman of Merrett Group in 1976. Under his leadership the group
grew quickly, specialising in a range of high-risk insurances ranging from
satellites and oil rigs to war risks and US legal awards. By the late 1980s
the group's main syndicate, 418, was one of the biggest at Lloyd's, and a
leader in US liability business.
Mr Merrett, now 53, won recognition as one of the most intellectually
impressive of Lloyd's underwriters and played an important part in the
Rowland taskforce report whose ideas for reforming the market are now being
put into effect.
But the past 12 months have seen his success unravel. Mr Merrett's election
as deputy chairman last autumn was widely criticised by Names, the
individuals whose assets support the market, because of what Mr Roger
Pascall, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, describes as
'an evident conflict of interest'.
Names said that Mr Merrett would be unable to combine his role as deputy
chairman with his involvement as an underwriter for errors and omissions
(E&amp;O) insurance policies, which insure agents against damages paid in legal
actions for negligence.
The council will play an important part in negotiating any out-of-court
settlements that could lead to claims on E&amp;O policies.
More recently Mr Merrett has been attacked on other fronts. Early this year
Names on syndicate 418, the biggest Merrett syndicate, launched legal action
to seek compensation for heavy losses from the 1985 year.
The management of the Merrett Group has also faced mounting criticism from
members' agents which channel Names onto their syndicates.
'There is a huge lack of confidence,' said Mr David Robson, a former
colleague of Mr Merrett, who now leads the Anton members' agency. He says
syndicate 418's losses in 1990, Lloyd's last reported year, more than offset
the profits made in the previous three years.
Mr Merrett has also been seen by Names to lack concern about their losses.
'In the eyes of many Names there has never been any acknowledgement of the
grief and pain he has caused,' says Mr Robson.
Over the past six weeks, two other incidents increased pressure on Mr
Merrett. At the end of July he publicly criticised a Lloyd's report into
losses at one of his own syndicates, alleging that the report was expensive
in both 'time and money'.
Matters came to a head after a meeting on August 31 when members' agents
told Mr Merrett that Names could supply only about Pounds 50m to syndicate
418, compared with Pounds 151m in 1993.
Such a sharp fall in capacity has forced Mr Merrett to seek capital from a
reinsurance company set up earlier this year to provide reinsurance for the
Merrett syndicates. At present Lloyd's rules do not allow new corporate
Names to provide more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity. It emerged
last week that Merrett would ask Lloyd's to make an exception, making his
position increasingly vulnerable. 'This was the final straw,' says one
senior figure. 'One of the rulemakers was asking for the rules to be bent.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Rivers authority hit by falling grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Rivers Authority, the pollution watchdog, is to peg its
spending for the next three years.
Presenting the watchdog's annual accounts, Lord Crickhowell, chairman, said
the squeeze would not affect its efforts. The watchdog said 'savings need to
be made' and that staff numbers need to be cut by 300.
In the year to March 1993 it spent Pounds 437.4m, nearly Pounds 8m less than
the previous year. Half of the spending was on flood defence, and more than
a third on improving water quality.
A quarter of the watchdog's income - Pounds 462m last year - comes from
government grants. Mr Edward Gallagher, chief executive, said that the
government had made it clear that grants would steadily fall.
The watchdog has also decided to rein back charges to local authorities and
companies. The charges, some of which rose by 20 per cent last year, will
rise at the rate of inflation or below it.
But new legislation would be needed in order for the authority to charge
polluters in line with the amount they pollute, Mr Gallagher said. Last year
saw fines totalling just over Pounds 1m, the same as the previous year.
However the number of successful prosecutions of the most serious category
on incident fell from 115 to 99.
Coal mines are threatening to contaminate water supplies, the NRA warned
yesterday.
Potential 'hotspots' are the Easington and Vane Tempest pits in the Durham
coalfield, and the Parkside colliery at Warrington, Cheshire, said Lord
Crickhowell.
Consultants are now investigating how to protect water supplies from the
mines.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Clarke snubs spending-cut calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday moved to stamp his authority on
the Budget-making process, which has been under pressure during the summer
from the cabinet's rightwing minority.
Interviewed in The Daily Telegraph - his first interview since returning
from holiday - Mr Clarke disdainfully brushes off rightwing calls for
spending cuts rather than tax increases in the November Budget.
In a passage which will enrage the right, he flatly rejects the possibility
of reopening next year's agreed public spending total of Pounds 254bn.
The chancellor's constant refrain is that he remains committed to low direct
taxation, but that all revenue-raising options remain open.
'You cannot have simplistic self-denying ordinances that at no stage do you
ever put taxation up,' he says.
'But the thing about being a Conservative chancellor is that, on the whole,
you very strongly do not wish to do so.'
Mr Clarke says that 'one of the big political victories' won by the
Conservatives in the 1980s was the reduction in the rate of direct taxation.
'I find it hilarious to hear John Smith (the Labour leader) and the shadow
chancellor (Mr Gordon Brown) saying how strongly they feel that we should
not overtax the wage earner. We have got them standing on their heads by
having won a key economic argument, which I don't wish to go back on.'
However, the chancellor offers a clear hint that he favours higher indirect
taxes if increases are necessary.
Outlining the need for a 'broad' tax base, he describes VAT on heating fuel
as 'perfectly fair,' and says it was 'extraordinary' that the fuel was
exempted until Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, imposed a two-stage
extension in the last Budget.
Mr Clarke also speaks of 'the joys of VAT,' which he describes as
'reasonably straighforward'.
He says there is no truth in speculation that the Pounds 50bn borrowing
forecast for next year has been revised downwards.
An 'as yet unknown proportion' of the deficit will be eliminated by faster
growth, but it is 'sensible for me to be prudent', he says. 'If I take a too
Micawberish view - sitting around waiting for something to turn up - and it
goes badly wrong, then I'm in real difficulties.'
Mr Clarke also rules out an early cut in interest rates and says he is not
convinced by the arguments put by some commentators for an independent Bank
of England.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Chambers warn of fragile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Chambers of Commerce last night warned that recovery of domestic
demand was fragile, and could easily be stalled by premature fiscal action.
The association urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to give priority to
cuts in public spending over increased taxation in his November 30 Budget.
The group, which claims to represent 214,000 businesses, said 'urgent
consideration' should be given to lowering interest rates further from the
present level of 6 per cent. The chambers also advocated a 'competitive'
exchange rate for sterling to nurture recovery.
In their proposals for the Budget, the chambers also said that:
Britain should not return to the European exchange rate mechanism until
community member states had achieved a much greater degree of economic
convergence.
Serious consideration should be given to independence for the Bank of
England.
They also called for help for small businesses.

UNIONS representing Swan Hunter employees yesterday launched an attempt at
an industrial tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne to obtain compensation which
could exceed Pounds 1m in total for 420 workers made redundant from the
Tyneside shipbuilder by receivers Price Waterhouse.
The unions, who are claiming the receivers breached section 188 of the
Trades Union Labour Relations (Consolidations) Act 1992 by not observing a
90-day consultative period, are seeking the maximum possible compensation of
90 days' pay.
Price Waterhouse did not contest the claim, and Mr David Reed, tribunal

FT  09 SEP 93 / Cut-price Times holds sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMES newspaper appears to be maintaining an increase in sales of about
30 per cent three days into its cut-price experiment, according to research
at 600 newsagents.
The independent research suggests that overall broadsheet sales have
increased by nearly 3 per cent since The Times cut its cover price by 15p to
30p during the week and to 40p on Saturdays.
According to the research the Financial Times has been unaffected, while
both The Guardian and The Independent have increased their sales. The Daily
Telegraph has lost an estimated 4 per cent.
In Scotland, sales of The Herald and The Scotsman have been hit. Mid-market
papers such as The Daily Mail and the Daily Express do not appear to have
been noticeably affected.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Watchdog backs capital standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for
retail financial services, yesterday agreed to the controversial proposal
that anyone giving financial advice be required to have a minimum of Pounds
10,000 in capital, Norma Cohen writes.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, the chief
City watchdog, has said he will insist on minimum capital standards.
The PIA board is discussing what sort of resources may be said to constitute
capital. Minimum capital standards have been opposed.
All parts of the retail financial services industry must vote to approve the
PIA, to be formed by merging the memberships of existing regulatory
organisations, and some have threatened to boycott it if its rules are too
tough.
Mr Bill Barron, acting chief executive of PIA, said it will not
automatically accept all members of other self-regulatory organisations.
Among those who may be barred are those whose disciplinary record is poor
although not sufficiently poor to have resulted in barring them.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Weak inflation spurs Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION expectations continued to fall last month, with headline and
underlying retail price inflation subdued and labour costs and wage
settlements at very low levels, the Treasury said yesterday.
In its monthly monetary report, the Treasury remained bullish about
prospects for growth, saying that recent figures pointed to 'very
encouraging trends' even though some indicators weakened last month.
On inflation, the report points out that world commodity prices are
sluggish.
Oil prices have fallen by 1 per cent since the last report while non-oil
commodity prices have fallen by 1.9 per cent.
However, the price of food worldwide has risen 15.7 per cent since last
year, and in the UK food made the biggest contribution to the increase in
the RPI in July.
In that month prices rose by 1.4 per cent compared with a year ago.
Seasonal food prices fell by significantly less between June and July than
between the same months last year. Non-seasonal food prices rose.
The Treasury said that in spite of recent strong growth in M0 - mainly notes
and coins in circulation - there was no underlying acceleration in narrow
money.
'Narrow money's growth reflects some continuing adjustment to earlier cuts
in interest rates as well as the upward trend in retail sales,' said the
report.
The Treasury said that the latest average of independent forecasts of
underlying inflation in the fourth quarter was 3.4 per cent, down from 3.7
per cent, which was the forecast a month ago.
Consumers are becoming more confident that house prices will rise, a survey
showed yesterday.
The latest Gallup Housing Market confidence report, was based on 2,000
interviews among the general public in August.
It reveals that four times as many home owners expect house prices to rise
than to fall in the next six months.
However, lingering concerns about the state of the housing market means that
one-third of those interviewed cautioned against buying again.
According to Gallup, the main obstacles to a faster recovery in the housing
market are affordability, lack of savings and fear of redundancy.
In the south-east negative equity continues to dog the market.
About a third of owner-occupiers aged over 35 say that their home is worth
less than the size of the outstanding mortgage.

FT  09 SEP 93 / S&amp;P wins little credit from card rivals: Save &amp; Prosper's
rate cut has not been followed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT CARD issuers have refused to follow the surprise move on Tuesday by
Save &amp; Prosper, the investment house, to launch a Visa card at interest
rates substantially below the industry average.
What is at issue is whether S&amp;P's move is sustainable in the long term and
can be followed by its competitors and whether this suggests that the
industry is currently charging too much.
The credit card norm is an annualised rate of interest of about 23 per cent.
Yet S&amp;P says it will charge only 14.6 per cent per year. Base rates are
currently 6 per cent.
Card issuers have been criticised by consumer groups for failing to bring
down their interest charges in line with base rates. When base rates were 12
per cent in August 1988, the interest rate on credit cards rose to an
annualised percentage rate (APR) of between 25.3 and 26.8 per cent,
according to the Credit Card Research Group. Base rates have since halved
but credit card APRs are between 21.6 and 29.8 per cent. Store cards are
even more expensive.
Last month Labour accused store groups of charging extortionate interest
rates. It said the average margin over base rate charged on store cards had
risen from 18 per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent and that some stores charged
as much as 34.4 per cent.
Credit card issuers say that base rates are only one of several factors
determining their rates. 'When someone buys a car, they don't say metal
costs such and such, so why does the car cost so much,' said Mr Roger Elwell
of National Westminster Bank, which has 4m cards in issue. 'We have the cost
of processing payments, paying staff, and building in a risk element because
of bad debts and the cost of fraud.'
But issuers have cut their costs by introducing annual fees and by charging
interest from the date of the transaction rather than the statement date for
those customers who do not settle their monthly bills in full.
S&amp;P openly accuses the main issuers of overcharging. Mr Ian Lindsey, the S&amp;P
director responsible for banking services, said: 'We believe the high street
banks are overcharging their credit card customers in order to compensate
for the losses they are making on personal current accounts.'
NatWest and Girobank yesterday denied cross-subsidisation and said interest
rates are determined by the total cost of running the credit card operation.
Barclays, the largest issuer with 8.8m cards, said that a mass-market
operator could not sustain the operation at S&amp;P's rates. It also said its
own card provides a wider range of associated benefits than the new S&amp;P
card. In common with several other banks, it expressed scepticism that S&amp;P
will be able to maintain its interest rate differential with the leading
providers.
Mr Lindsey denied that S&amp;P's rate of interest had been pitched low to
attract new customers and would be increased in the future. 'If the general
level of interest rates remains unchanged for the next decade, then our rate
will not change; that's a cast-iron guarantee,' he said.
S&amp;P says it will break even on the new card within a year with 25,000
customers, although its target is to attract 100,000 new cardholders.
The new card seems unlikely to push other issuers to reduce their rates. It
has just 100,000 cards in issue at present, against 20m cardholders in the
UK. Even doubling its total will hardly pose a threat to the large issuers.
It will also be more discriminating than the large issuers in the selection
of customers, which should mean a proportionately smaller bad-debt bill than
the larger issuers. Cardholders must own their home, be resident in the UK,
have a regular income and a clean credit record. Those earning less than
Pounds 10,000 a year are unlikely to be admitted.
It also says just 30 per cent of its customers pay no interest on their
cards, against an industry average of at least 50 per cent. That suggests it
can afford to offer lower rates since it will generate interest charges from
a higher proportion of its cardholder base.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Bank challenged over regulatory powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is facing the first full-scale challenge to its
authority as a regulator to supervise and recommend the closure of banks in
the UK.
The Lord Chancellor's department has this week convened a banking appeals
tribunal under the 1987 Banking Act, in what is believed to be the first
instance of an institution successfully triggering a formal appeal.
Bank of England officials are submitting evidence to defend their plea to a
High Court judge in October last year requesting the provisional liquidation
of Mount Banking, a small Asian-owned bank. The tribunal was sought by the
principal shareholders in Mount, Mr N. Shah and Mr SBR Shah.
Details of the tribunal are being kept secret, but the Lord Chancellor's
office confirmed yesterday that a three-person tribunal had been convened
this week chaired by Mr Jonathan Mance QC. The two other members are a
banker and an accountant appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The office said that there had been seven or eight previous attempts at an
appeal in the past 18 months, but all had been rejected at preliminary
hearings attended by Mr Mance. Most were withdrawn voluntarily.
The grounds for closure were doubt about whether the management of Mount was
'fit and proper' and not that it might be insolvent. Unaudited figures for
the bank at March 31 this year show assets of Pounds 188.6m against
liabilities of Pounds 163.4m. There are also additional provisions
conservatively estimated at Pounds 10m.
The members of the tribunal will have to determine whether the action taken
by the Bank was justified and what measures should still be taken  - which
could fall short of withdrawing its banking license.
Documents circulated last month by accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick, Mount's
administrators, show that Standard Chartered, the international banking
group, may make a 'significant claim' against Mount believed to run to many
tens of millions of dollars.
Mr Andrew Milne, a solicitor with Zaiwalla &amp; Co, which is acting for Mount's
owners, said the Bank of England had petitioned for closure as a result of
the Standard Chartered allegations, which he claimed were 'proved completely
false'.
He alleged that investigators had conducted a 'fishing expedition' to
justify the closure on other grounds after they found no evidence supporting
the claims.
Two weeks after its provisional liquidation, Mount Banking was placed in
administration. Last month creditors approved a voluntary arrangement
permitting a number of options for the bank's future, subject to
ratification this week.
Mount Banking has 3,000 depositors, who are mainly Asians resident in India
and East Africa, with just a few who live in the UK.

FT  09 SEP 93 / BNF accounts delayed by Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' annual report and accounts, which had been expected
last week, may not be published until the end of January because of
uncertainty about the future of its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant.
BNF said last night: 'We are hanging on as long as possible until we get a
clear picture on Thorp'.
The state-owned company is obliged to produce accounts by the end of
January, 10 months after the end of its financial year.
Testing of the Thorp equipment began again early yesterday after a leak of
nitrogen dioxide gas on Tuesday afternoon. BNF said yesterday that the cause
of the leak was the testing equipment, not Thorp.
Mr John Kane, secretary of the Sellafield unions' campaign committee, which
is pressing for Thorp's operational go-ahead, said the unions did not intend
to change their pro-Thorp campaign because of the incident, although they
conceded that its timing was unfortunate. 'It was just during testing; the
idea of testing is to find out if there's anything wrong,' he said.
The government has already said that it is 'minded' to give approval for the
plant. It will make a final decision after the current public consultation,
due to end on October 4.
BNF said that the uncertainty 'affects all kinds of figures, not least how
to write off the costs of building Thorp if we do not get authorisation'.
The company has warned that profit for the year will be less than Pounds
100m - a drop of Pounds 60m on last year - because of the delay. BNF, which
expected a licence to start operation at the start of the year, says it has
been losing some Pounds 2m a week while waiting.

FT  09 SEP 93 / End of S Africa sanctions era in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE breakthrough made this week by South Africa's constitutional negotiators
towards establishing a multiracial government promises significant relief to
an economy that is short of good news, writes Philip Gawith.
Agreement on a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), after many false dawns,
has at last brought the end of the sanctions era in view.
Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, has said the ANC
will probably call for the lifting of remaining financial sanctions - most
notably the embargo on International Monetary Fund/World Bank financing - by
the end of the month.
It is likely also to mark the start of an era of considerably increased
international development assistance. As Chief Emeka Anyaoku,
secretary-general of the Commonwealth, made clear during a recent visit:
'The international community wants to help and to help substantially once
the next step has been taken towards representative government.' The US and
European Community have expressed similar intentions.
Although white South Africans have for years with bravado dismissed
sanctions as ineffective there will be no disguising the joy when they
finally go. While a minority found succour in the romance of the besieged
volk in its laager, most longed to be rid of the burden of being an
international pariah.
It could not come at a better time. Economists believe South Africa's net
reserves have fallen as low as one month's import cover, while capital
outflows and the lower gold price have driven the rand to a record low
against the dollar.
Top of the list will be re-establishment of links with the IMF. Since
declaring a moratorium on the repayment of part of its external debt in 1985
South Africa has been forced to run a current account surplus to finance
more than Dollars 1bn a year in debt repayments. This has seriously hampered
growth. Renewed access to the IMF will allow South Africa to run a deficit
and growth prospects will be improved. Banks will also be much happier to do
business in South Africa when it enjoys the financial backing of the IMF.
The IMF has made no secret in recent months of its willingness to lend to
South Africa again, most recently in July when President FW de Klerk held
talks in Washington with Mr Michael Camdessus, its managing director. The
World Bank has also made clear it is ready to lend large sums, most for
infrastructure and human resource development.
Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the central bank, believes
that the TEC agreement will be seen by the IMF and World Bank as the signal
that the time is ripe to re-engage formally with South Africa.
He said yesterday that in terms of the IMF's compensatory and contingency
financing facility (CFF), South Africa is eligible for about Dollars 800m in
assistance arising from balance of payments shortfalls related to the severe
drought in 1992. The technical groundwork for the loan has already been
done, but he stressed that an application would have to come from the
finance sub-committee of the TEC.
Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, the Cape-based life office,
argues that when the world economy starts growing again, South Africa's
current account will benefit more directly than in the past when its trade
was hampered by such factors as having to accept a political discount on
goods and incur the cost of routing trade through a third party.
Although nobody is expecting big capital inflows to the country, the
normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations should help
stop the haemorrhage on the capital account. In the year to June, the total
net outflow of capital not related to reserves amounted to R9.8bn (Pounds
1.4bn). Mr Stals argues that this 'is not a sign of economic weakness, but
of the difficult political situation in which we find ourselves'.
He believes that the removal of sanctions will allow investors to assess
South Africa more in terms of conventional risk criteria, without
'extraneous' political distractions. There remain of course, as he is quick
to recognise, ample reasons for believing that investors are likely to hold
back until well after an election. At the very least, uncertainty about
political stability, the shape of future economic policies, and the
economy's seeming inability to emerge from a prolonged slump give
considerable cause for caution.
From the point of view of the US investor there are other obstacles too. At
the last count, 26 states, 90 local authorities and 24 counties still had
sanctions in place. The effect of these has been to prevent US bank lending
to South Africa and US pension fund investment in companies with South
African ties.
The fact that some sanctions still remain in place against Namibia, which
received its independence in March 1990, is a reminder of the obstacles that
lie ahead.

GUNMEN shot dead 25 blacks in three attacks around Johannesburg yesterday,
one day after South African political leaders agreed a watershed deal on the
transition to majority rule, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Police said about 10 gunmen killed 19 people and wounded 22 when they opened
fire on a mini-bus taxi rank in the Wadeville industrial area east of
Johannesburg at about 6pm.
Two hours later two people were killed in an ambush on a mini-bus taxi 6km
away. Earlier in the day four people were killed in a shoot-out at a taxi
association meeting in Soweto township.
Mr Hernus Kriel, the law and order minister, described the Wadeville
massacre as 'a horrific atrocity'. He said: 'It is the prevailing culture of
violence. . . which provides the seedbed for outrages such as these.' He
urged the country's two main black rival groups, Inkatha and the African
National Congress, to settle their differences.
Feuding between the two groups has been blamed on much of the recent
political killing.
An ANC spokesman said the Wadeville raid followed a pattern in which
political breakthroughs were followed by outbreaks of violence.
'I don't think it's a coincidence at all that this happened the day after
agreement was reached on a transitional executive council (TEC),' he said.
A majority of the 23 groups negotiating an end to white rule agreed on
Tuesday on a draft bill setting up a TEC which will for the first time bring
blacks into central government.
The TEC is supported by the ANC and the government of President FW de Klerk
but rejected by Inkatha.
The Wadeville killing, carried out with AK-47 combat rifles, took place near
the site of a massacre in which 12 blacks were shot dead at an iron and
steel works on August 22.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World reviews Pretoria policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS yesterday began re-examining their policies on South African
sanctions after the agreement reached on Tuesday night to form a
multi-racial transitional executive council.
The US said the stage was set for the return to South Africa of foreign
investors who would ultimately play a role in helping a democratically
elected government deal with the legacies of apartheid. A State Department
spokesman said Washington would take steps to remove its ban on support for
IMF lending to Pretoria once the council was established. Remaining federal
sanctions - relating to the sale and import of arms - are based on UN
resolutions. 'It will be up to the UN to take action to rescind those
resolutions,' he said.
Australian and New Zealand officials were quoted as saying that Commonwealth
nations were likely to move quickly, with one report saying an announcement
on lifting remaining financial sanctions could come within 24 hours.
Once the transitional council is in place, international financial
institutions are expected to move quickly to bring their resources to bear.
Mr Edward Jaycox, World Bank vice-president in charge of Africa, said
recently his organisation had identified projects totalling about Dollars
1bn (Pounds 648m) aimed at redressing the imbalance in the supply of basic
services.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is considering a fresh public spending package and
cuts in income tax to help retrieve the economy from the brink of recession.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said tax reforms and extra
spending were among the options being considered for the economic stimulus
plans to be announced later this month. Proposed business regulation cuts,
announced last week, would not be enough, he said.
The package is likely to include loans for housebuilding and job creation,
and spending on research institutes and telecommunications.
If agreed, this will be the third pump-priming plan in the past year, after
a total of nearly Y24,000bn (Pounds 150bn) - in August 1992 Y10,700bn was
allocated and another Y13,200bn came in this April.
Economic analysts believe their impact has so far been disappointing because
government agencies have been slow to spend the cash on infrastructure.
Resistance to another spending package can be expected from the finance
ministry, which will try to reduce its size, as in the previous two
packages, on the grounds that the tax revenues to finance such spending are
declining.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is expected to unveil the deregulation,
spending and tax plans some time before he visits the US on September 25 for
his first meeting with President Bill Clinton.
Washington's expectations are almost as high as those of the Japanese
public, as it seeks evidence the government can live up to pledges to
stimulate import demand so as to curb a record trade surplus.
Sanyo Investment Research has predicted that profits at Japan's top
industrial companies will fall by over 23 per cent in the year to next
March.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Coalition likely to cut subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government is to scale back plans for public subsidies for
political parties by half, to heal a potentially embarrassing rift with its
largest coalition member.
The seven coalition groups expect today to agree draft proposals for a
Y300bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year public political subsidy, said officials. This
would replace corporate donations and is equivalent to Y250 per taxpayer
each year.
Last month, the coalition partners provisionally agreed a Y600bn annual
subsidy, only to be embarrassed when the defeated LDP counter-proposed
Y300bn. This jeopardised the popular new government's image as the bringer
of a change in political style from the LDP, whose downfall came partly due
to public disgust at its dependence on large corporate donations.
Ministers hurriedly explained that the Y600bn figure was only tentative,
after objections from the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition
member, whose chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana, happens to be minister for
political reform.
The subsidy is part of a package of political reforms, including a new
single-seat constituency electoral system.

Ministers hurriedly explained that the Y600bn figure was only tentative,
after objections from the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition
member, whose chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana, happens to be minister for
political reform.
The subsidy is part of a package of political reforms, including a new
single-seat constituency electoral system, for debate at a special
parliamentary session starting on September 17.
Public subsidies would fill some of the gap left by corporate donations, to
be phased out after three to five years, according to early drafts of the
package. The aim is for parties to compete with equal financial backing,
instead of on their ability to wring cash from companies in return for
favours.
In spite of the inevitable internal coalition wrangling to have emerged in
the month since coming to power, public confidence in the government appears
hardly shaken.
Three opinion polls yesterday showed that the administration's popularity
remains high, as do public expectations. A Kyodo news agency poll gave Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa's administration a 79 per cent popularity rating, a
post-war high for any Japanese government, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper
gave it 71 per cent. The Mainichi Daily News recorded a 10 percentage point
drop in the government's popularity over the past month, to a still high 65
per cent.
However, the real test of confidence in the the government will come when
the public sees final details of the electoral reform plans as well as a
hotly waited economic stimulus package.

<TEXT>
A FORMER senior Iraqi intelligence officer and one time chairman of Matrix
Churchill, UK machine tool company, has become Iraq's new oil minister,
writes Richard Donkin.
Dr Safa al Habobi's appointment was announced on Sunday by Baghdad.
Dr Habobi, 47, had been senior deputy director of the Military
Industrialisation Commission for the past year. Iraqi exile sources said
Habobi's prior job had been that of deputy to Hussein Kamel, Saddam
Hussein's cousin, who was named ministry of industry and minerals in the new
Iraqi cabinet. Mr Kamel had been in charge of Iraq's weapons programme.
Dr Habobi was named in documents submitted to the inquiry by Lord Justice
Scott into Britain's arms exports to Iraq, as a senior Iraqi intelligence
official whose procurement activities were being monitored by MI6.
He became chairman of Matrix Churchill after the Coventry company was
acquired by a company in Baghdad in 1987. He has been charged in the US in
connection with the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.24bn) of illegal loans for Iraq's
military build-up issued by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro.
Matrix Churchill was bought from its Iraqi owners by Automation Investments,
a Midlands company, after the invasion of Kuwait and was later placed into
receivership and broken up.

SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North
Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with
Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks over inspection of
its nuclear facilities, but later added preconditions for the meeting it had
proposed for tomorrow.
It demanded Seoul stop its support for international efforts to force
nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to
its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. South Korea rejected
the conditions.
The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if it did not
make progress in nuclear inspection negotiations.

FT  09 SEP 93 / 'Arafat bond' to target expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY of the Arafat bond may be nigh. Mr Yassir Arafat's embryonic
Palestinian authority in the West Bank and Gaza could tap wealthy expatriate
Palestinian businessmen for financial support, and may finance public sector
investment through a Palestinian bond, according to a confidential World
Bank report.
The report, being drafted by World Bank economists in consultation with the
Israeli government and potential donor countries, says a Palestinian
government - to be established under the proposed Israeli-PLO peace deal -
will need external financing of Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 1.75bn in the five
years of interim self-rule.
It expects at least Dollars 750m more in private capital inflows from
Palestinian expatriates.
The money will be needed, the bank says, to fund public-sector
infrastructure investments worth about Dollars 1.35bn over five years,
predominantly on water supply, sewerage, waste disposal, roads, electricity,
education and health.
In the longer term, the report adds, the 'Palestinian entity' - code for
what most observers expect to be a state - will have to invest a further
Dollars 1.65bn in power generation (preferably as part of a regional power
grid), expansion of road, health and education systems, and construction of
airport facilities.
The report is intended as a framework for the international aid effort to
underpin the expected peace agreement. Its recommendations will be discussed
at a meeting at World Bank headquarters in Washington later this month.
The Bank also expects Palestinians to finance public sector development
through external borrowing - which would be sustainable since unlike most
developing countries, the Palestinian entity will not inherit a crushing
external debt.
It estimates there are about 200,000 Palestinian workers and businessmen
living in the Gulf states and industrial countries. They include some of the
largest engineering and construction magnates in the Arab world, many of
whom have close affiliations with the PLO.
'Given the strong community ties among the Palestinians, it is likely that,
in the wake of a peace agreement, a good fraction of these businessmen and
professionals would wish to strengthen their links with the occupied
territories through increased remittances, as well as direct investment in
productive ventures,' the report says.
The bank adds that the entity will benefit from their high-quality workforce
 -Gaza and the West Bank have the highest proportion of graduates of any
Arab country - and from tourism to the area.
But it warns the future government against economic mistakes and issues some
policy prescriptions, including suggestions it establish a free-trade area
with Israel and liberal trading links with other Arab countries. It also
recommends harnessing the energies of private entrepreneurs rather than
relying excessively on the public sector.
'Political settlement and peace is a necessary, but not a sufficient,
condition for economic development in the occupied territories,' it says.
'Much will also depend on the quality of economic management in the
post-peace period.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Long-term energy supplies 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE in industrial countries and growing demand in the developing world
pose a long-term threat to energy supplies, says the World Energy Council, a
non-governmental body representing more than 100 countries.
Although world supplies are still abundant, it says governments should take
early action to secure supplies. Growing environmental pressures also
require a drive towards greater energy efficiency.
A study of the long-term prospects for world energy, published in London
today by the council, says present consumption trends could lead to a more
than doubling of energy use by the year 2020. But if strong energy
efficiency measures are instituted, growth could be contained to about 28
per cent over that period, despite a more than 50 per cent increase in world
population.
According to the report, known oil reserves are currently large enough to
last over 40 years, and natural gas over 65 years. Coal reserves are large
enough to last 250 years. But the report doubts that fossil fuels will last
beyond the next century because, as oil and gas run out, the use of coal may
be accelerated sharply.

strongest long-term prospects. Energy for tomorrow's world. World Energy

FT  09 SEP 93 / Resignation threatens Rabin peace drive: Minister quits over
long-running corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS, JULIAN OZANNE and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Middle East peace drive by Israel's coalition government was threatened
last night when Mr Arye Deri, the interior minister, resigned as a
long-simmering corruption scandal came to a head.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said the resignation of Mr Deri, who leads
the ultra-orthodox Shas party, could harm the chance for peace.
The threat to the Labour-led coalition came as the prime minister sent a
message of encouragement to Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, who last night began a crucial meeting with his
executive committee in Tunis to vote on the peace agreement and mutual
recognition with Israel.
According to a Palestinian source PLO and Israeli negotiators last night
agreed on the wording of statements of mutual recognition, seen as one of
the remaining obstacles to the deal.
Mr Rabin said: 'We are ready to recognise them (the PLO) under certain
conditions' - the first public confirmation by the prime minister that
Israel would recognise its former enemy.
The PLO wants to exchange statements on recognition before signing the peace
agreement on Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Deri's resignation came after a panel of high court judges ordered Mr
Rabin to sack him, along with Mr Rafael Pinhasi, a fellow Shas politician
who is deputy minister for religious affairs. Shas has six seats in the
Knesset (parliament) and has been a vital centre-right coalition partner.
Shas has not spelled out how it would respond to the resignation of Mr Deri,
who is facing charges of fraud, misallocation of public funds, breach of
public trust and diversion of Interior Ministry money to institutions run by
his religious movement. The party could either replace the ministers or
could quit government.
If it left, Mr Rabin would be forced to reconstitute his coalition with
other right-wing religious parties as he has pledged not to strike a peace
deal at the head of a government relying solely on left-wing and Arab
support. Other parties could demand concessions in domestic policy and in
further peace negotiations.
Political analysts say it is unlikely Shas would quit the government and
surrender the benefits they can deliver to the ultra-orthodox Jewish
community they represent. If they did leave the coalition they would
probably support the peace agreement from the back benches.
Once an agreement with the PLO is signed, Mr Rabin is expected to submit it
to a free Knesset vote where, even without Shas, he has a 61-59 majority.
With Shas and more votes from defectors the agreement is expected to win a
substantial majority. Israel and Jordan have agreed tentatively on the
framework for a peace treaty to settle borders and establish joint water,
energy and environmental projects but progress in talks with Syria has
slowed, Agencies report from Washington.
Jordanian Ambassador Fayez Tarawneh said yesterday he hoped the deal could
be finalised and announced after Israel and the PLO conclude their accord.
'It doesn't need any signature or any ceremonies,' he said.
Visions of a grand Middle East signing ceremony, including an Israeli pact
with Syria seemed to fade yesterday when a US official said simultaneous
deals could be difficult and Syrian and Israeli negotiators gave gloomy
reports of their talks, each blaming the other.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Report warns of long-term threat to energy supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE in industrial countries and growing demand in the developing world
pose a long-term threat to energy supplies, says the World Energy Council, a
non-governmental body representing more than 100 countries.
Although world supplies are still abundant, it says governments should take
early action to secure supplies. Growing environmental pressures also
require a drive towards greater energy efficiency.
A study of the long-term prospects for world energy, published in London
today by the council, says present consumption trends could lead to a more
than doubling of energy use by the year 2020. But if strong energy
efficiency measures are instituted, growth could be contained to about 28
per cent over that period, despite a more than 50 per cent increase in world
population.
According to the report, known oil reserves are currently large enough to
last over 40 years, and natural gas over 65 years. Coal reserves are large
enough to last 250 years. But the report doubts that fossil fuels will last
beyond the next century because, as oil and gas run out, the use of coal may
be accelerated sharply.
The WEC believes coal and nuclear power are the two energy sources with
strongest long-term prospects, provided the environmental problems
associated with each can be resolved. But the report urges more rapid
development of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal.
The report warns that large sums of money will have to be invested in energy
development. The report believes pollution reduction timetables set by
international agreements, for example on carbon dioxide, are unrealistically
tight. Not until the latter part of the next century does it foresee the
level of atmospheric pollution declining.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Anti-US protest in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CROWD of over 2,000 women, chanting Islamic and anti-US slogans, delivered
a protest note yesterday to the American embassy in Khartoum over US
accusations of Sudanese sponsorship of terrorism, Agencies report from
Khartoum.
The embassy has cut the size of its staff and evacuated family members.
Sudan's hardline military leadership has responded angrily to the
accusations. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said on Tuesday that Washington
had failed to produce any proof his country had allowed terrorist training
camps on its territory. Lt-Gen al-Bashir, speaking in the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa after a regional summit, also denied he was supporting Somali
gunmen linked to Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, in their
increasingly bloody battle with UN forces in Mogadishu.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Seoul warns Pyongyang over nuclear weapons

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North
Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with
Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks concerning the
inspection of its nuclear facilities, but it later added preconditions for
the meeting it had proposed for tomorrow.
It demanded that Seoul stop its support of international efforts to force
nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to
its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. Mr Hwang In-sung,
South Korean prime minister, in rejecting the conditions told Mr Kang
Song-san, the North Korean premier, that Pyongyang's demand 'makes it
doubtful if your side has a genuine intention of reopening dialogue'.
North Korea suspended regular contacts with Seoul at the beginning of the
year in protest against the holding of the Team Spirit exercise. It failed
to appear at a meeting yesterday to discuss procedural matters for the talks
tomorrow.
If North Korea boycotts that meeting, it could lead to the end of hopes for
an quick resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.
The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if Pyongyang
does not make progress in nuclear inspection talks with both the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Seoul by the end of month.
North Korea last week held inconclusive talks with the IAEA on allowing its
inspectors to examine two nuclear waste sites that are at the heart of the
dispute.
The IAEA, which has heard no response yet from Pyongyang for a proposed new
round of talks in Vienna, will discuss the issue at its next governors'
meeting on September 21.
The IAEA wants to inspect North Korea's facilities to determine whether
Pyongyang is producing more plutonium than it has reported to the agency.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Delhi acts to ease share market upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN finance ministry yesterday acted to end uncertainty in the
country's stock markets caused by an income tax investigation into the
affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of last year's Bombay
securities scandal.
Officials held meetings with representatives of the income tax office and of
the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the securities watchdog
which is concerned that the tax probe should not disrupt normal market
operations.
Reports that the ministry had urged tax inspectors to conduct their
investigation in a way which did not hurt investors' interests brought some
relief to investors and brokers on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
The index of leading stocks, which had fallen 130 points since the start of
the week, dropped a further 41.44 yesterday to close at 2,580.24. But
brokers took comfort that the index finished 23 points above its opening
level when sentiment was at its gloomiest.
They said confidence grew during the day as reports from Delhi, where the
finance ministry meetings were being held, indicated that officials were
taking investors' interests into consideration.
Last night the ministry made clear seizures of shareholdings by the tax
department were limited to identified shares of a few companies held in the
names of specified persons.
A statement said that 'transfers relating to genuine transactions by all
genuine investors including institutional investors in respect of shares
lodged for transfer with the companies covered by the provisional attachment
orders will be freed from the existing curbs after the necessary formalities
are completed.'
The release said there was 'no reason for any apprehension in the minds of
genuine investors or the broker community in this regard.'
The income tax investigation began last year after Mr Mehta was arrested for
his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn (Pounds 875m) scandal which rocked the
Bombay securities market last year. Mr Mehta and other brokers were accused
of trading illegally in the interbank securities market, often in collusion
with bank employees, in order to syphon funds into the stock market.
The tax probe disrupted the market this week when it emerged that the income
tax authorities had frozen dealings in large blocks of stock, which they
claimed were being held by 134 different individuals and companies on Mr
Mehta's behalf. The affected stocks are shares in nine leading companies
including ACC, a top cement producer, and Reliance Industries, a chemicals
and textiles group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S constitutional court has temporarily reinstated Mr Jose Lobo
Dubon as president of Congress after he was ousted in a rebellion against
his authority by a group of deputies on Sunday.
The court's decision, made on Tuesday night, reinstates Mr Lobo pending a
definitive ruling expected within two weeks. The move does not appear to
have reduced tension between the two rival groups in Congress squabbling
over how they should purge the institution of corrupt members. Congress's
limited credibility with the public has plummeted since the crisis began.
Pressure to purge Congress came after President Ramiro de Leon Carpio last
month called for the resignation of all 116 members in an effort to rid the
country's institutions of corruption.
Opponents of Mr Lobo, a Christian Democrat, have said they will sue him
after a congressmen was allegedly hit with a pistol butt on Monday night in
a scuffle with his security guards. Mr Lobo says he will sue Mr Arturo Soto,
promoted by the rebel deputies as president in his stead.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Clinton's peace corps also help themselves: National service
that pays back in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTRUISM might be back in fashion with America's youth, but the generation
President Bill Clinton is calling upon to serve is very different from the
one that volunteered for President John Kennedy's Peace corps 30 years ago.
Mr Kennedy stirred thousands to give up affluent lifestyles to teach in
Africa, farm in Asia and build trenches in Latin America. In trying to
capture the same idealism, Mr Clinton, who often harks back to the idealism
of 'Camelot', must appeal to good-hearted but hard-headed young people who
want to help others - and themselves.
Mr Clinton's National Service Act, which had already passed the House, was
last night approved by the Senate and is expected to be signed by the
president next week. It would put young people to work on repairing the
environment, teaching, refurbishing houses and performing other community
service in return for a small wage and an education allowance.
'Young people today are very different than they were when I was in my young
20s,' says 50-year-old Mr Eli Segal, who as director of the White House's
Office of National Service has given substance to the plan. 'I think they're
far more practical, far more sophisticated about how things work, far less
confrontational.' It is also a generation that faces what Mr Segal termed an
'educational crisis' as the cost of tuition has soared beyond the reach of
most.
Mr Clinton's plan is aimed at helping young people to serve and cover their
tertiary tuition costs. Participants would provide a year of community
service in exchange for the minimum wage of Dollars 4.25 an hour and an
education allowance.
Congress scaled back the plan, cutting allowances from Dollars 10,000 for
two years of service to Dollars 9,450 and limiting spending on the whole
scheme to Dollars 1.5bn for the first three years. The White House estimates
that about 20,000 students will participate in the first year.
It is a small start for a president who attracted support on the campaign
trail from students and their parents saying that anyone who wanted a
college education ought to be able to afford one. Proponents say the plan
will fulfil another, more important, goal: bringing groups of people from
diverse backgrounds to work together.
Framers of national service hope to attract a more diverse group of
Americans than participated in previous service programmes. Peace Corps
officials concede that, until the 1980s, volunteers were mostly white and
middle- to upper-middle class. In 1982 only about 5 per cent of volunteers
were minorities.
Ms Erin Moran, a 17-year-old from a middle-class area of Baltimore was
stunned by what she was learning while helping refurbish a recreation centre
in a rundown part of her home town.
'I was really naive about what went on in the inner city,' she said.
'Yesterday we met with other teenagers and we were talking about teenage
pregnancy and they saw nothing wrong with it because there was always
welfare and they saw nothing wrong with AIDS because they figured they
wouldn't survive in the city very long anyway.'
Mr Phillip Harris, aged 18, who grew up in one of Baltimore's toughest
neighbourhoods, said it was important for people like Ms Moran to understand
that improvements come gradually.
'We have a person in our group who felt like, 'I'm coming in to help people
and in eight weeks we've got to make them change'. We sat her down and said,
'You can't change people so quickly'. Now she's dealing in reality,' he
said.
After a youth spent selling drugs and carrying weapons - and a month-long
stay at a juvenile detention centre - Mr Harris is realistic about how much
can be done, but he also wants to show youngsters in his neighbourhood that
change is possible.
'By selling drugs and committing a lot of crimes I took a lot away from the
community,' he says. 'A lot of the young people who are selling drugs now
used to look up to me. Now I am trying to reverse things - make them look up
to me in a positive light.'
While Mr Harris wants to help his community, he is also studying for a
business degree at a local community college and the Dollars 1,000 he
receives for his work will help. After finding government programmes did
little to help his family or their neighbours, Mr Harris puts his faith with
the business community because, he says, they seem to understand their
customers better than any bureaucracy.
The loudest critics of national service believe it would cost too much.
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, tried to reduce the cost for
the first three years from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 800m and voted against
the measure when the White House rejected her plan. Others in Congress
proposed giving educational benefits only to those in need and making the
money contingent on other scholarship programmes being fully funded.
Leading proponents of the measure such as Representative Dave McCurdy say
the bill is not about education, but about service. 'If you are only
concerned about a college education then this is not the concept,' the
Oklahoma Democrat said. 'The concept is changing the ethic in America from
grants and loans to service.'
Mr Jason Scott, a 24-year-old who started Youth for National Service to
lobby for the plan, said it was up to his generation to heal the nation's
ills.
'The country is getting more diverse, not less diverse and we know that we
are the ones who are going to have to deal with that,' he said. 'We believe
(national service) has the potential to engage a new generation of young
people in service, young people who might not otherwise have the means or
the opportunity to serve their country.'

TENSE negotiations behind closed doors in the Argentine Senate continued
yesterday afternoon after President Carlos Menem's attempt to amend
Argentina's constitution faltered on Tuesday writes John Barham from Buenos
Aires.
Mr Menem wants to scrap the 1853 constitution's ban on successive
presidential terms and run for re-election when his six-year term ends in
July 1995. To do so he must first win a two-thirds majority in both houses
of Congress.
But on Tuesday, the first day of debate in the Senate, two members of the
ruling Peronist party denied Mr Menem the majority by refusing to back the
amendment. The president later cut short an official visit to Brazil.
Senator Jose Bordon, who has already declared he will seek the Peronist
presidential nomination, said on Tuesday he would only support the amendment
if the government established a consensus with the opposition Radical party.
Senator Antonio Cafiero, who lost the Peronist presidential nomination to Mr
Menem in 1988, also rebelled for the same reason.
The Peronists hold 30 of the Senate's 48 seats and had enlisted the support
of two independent senators to reach the required 32 votes. Even if the
government wins the Senate vote, achieving a two-thirds majority in the
Chamber of Deputies will be more difficult.

Even if the government wins the Senate vote, achieving a two-thirds majority

in mid-term elections on October 3.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Campbell kicks off campaign: Canadian Tories pledge overhaul
of social security programmes
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, kicked off a seven-week election
campaign yesterday by pledging an era of less government intervention, an
overhaul of social security programmes and a tougher justice system.
She was speaking in Ottawa after asking the governor-general to dissolve
parliament and call an election for October 25. Ms Campbell and Mr Jean
Chretien, leader of the opposition Liberal party, immediately set off on
their chartered buses for what is likely to be a gruelling and close-fought
campaign.
Both headed first for the province of Ontario which, together with Quebec,
contains more than half the country's 295 constituencies and will be the
focus of the big parties' drive for votes.
The Conservatives hold 153 seats in the House of Commons, followed by the
Liberals with 79 and the left-of-centre New Democrats with 43.
The Liberals are the present front-runners, thanks partly to a collapse in
support for the NDP and to the strength of the separatist Bloc Quebecois in
Quebec.
The Conservatives were able to rely on strong backing from Quebec
nationalists for their back-to-back election victories in 1984 and 1988.
But observers also agree that the coming election is one of the most fluid
and unpredictable in many years. Support for the traditional big three
parties will be fragmented by the Bloc Quebecois and, in western Canada, by
the populist Reform party.
Ms Campbell indicated yesterday that she would portray herself as a fresh
face for the 1990s, compared to the 60-year old Mr Chretien, who has been in
politics for over 30 years, including many years as a cabinet minister under
Mr Pierre Trudeau.
The main thrust of the Liberals' campaign will be to portray Ms Campbell as
a clone of her unpopular predecessor, Mr Brian Mulroney. The Liberals are
due to release their detailed policy platform within the next week or so.
Ms Campbell was cautious yesterday to avoid the extravagant promises which
marked the 1984 and 1988 campaigns. She said that 'we live in tough times
and Canadians have some tough questions for governments.'
She pledged 'a new leadership that respects the bottom line, and the basic
needs of Canadians.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Lopez preaches gospel of third industrial
revolution - Kevin Done in Frankfurt sees why so much fuss has been made of
VW's charismatic production director
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE gospel of the third industrial revolution was presented in Frankfurt
yesterday by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's beleaguered
but charismatic production and purchasing director.
His preaching has changed little since joining Volkswagen in Germany in
March from his post as global purchasing director of General Motors in the
US. Those that fail to grasp that the third industrial revolution is under
way are condemned to fall by the wayside as surely as those that ignored the
first two, namely the introduction of the steam-powered loom in Britain in
1750 and the production of cars on a moving assembly line in the US in 1913.
The only changes in the text of the sermon from GM to VW - the stumbling
giants of the car industry in North America and Europe respectively -
concern the location of the congregation.
In the US, when Inaki, as he is popularly known to colleagues old and new,
preached to the citizens of Saginaw or Flint in the heartland of the US
Midwest, it was America and the Americans that were in danger of becoming 'a
second-class economy and second class citizens,' if they did not heed the
message.
Now it is the citizens of Wolfsburg and Lower Saxony that could go the same
way. For America read Europe.
Mr Lopez was introduced to the Financial Times Motor Industry conference in
Frankfurt as 'the warrior from Volkswagen' by Professor Daniel Jones. Prof
Jones has also made a strong line in the past three years out of the gospel
of 'lean production,' a term he helped to coin in the book The Machine That
Changed The World.
But this was Mr Lopez's day - a day to show his audience of component
makers, rival car producers, bankers and financial analysts just why so much
fuss has been made about him and why both GM and VW were prepared to offer
contracts with telephone number salaries to secure his services.
The Lopez sermon calls for a few quick jumps through history from 1750 to
1913, and then to a breathless pause in 1964. That year is significant
because the Japanese industry produced only 600,000 cars then, Europe 7.28m
and North America 8.37m. Car exports were virtually nil. Leap 28 years and
what do we see? North America producing 7.46m cars with negligible exports,
Europe making 12.77m but selling most at home, Japan producing 9.38m and

Now we are in the midst of the third industrial revolution, says the prophet
Inaki, but it is more difficult to grasp than the first two.
It is a revolution of ideas, principles and values.
Continuous improvement - kaizen to the Japanese - is yesterday's text, today
it is the message of 'quantum leap' improvements to generate value for the
customers. Improvements of 5, 6 or 7 per cent are not enough, 'it is 30 to
40 to 50 per cent type improvements that must be made,' says Inaki with his
heavily accented English racing to keep up with the flow of ideas.
The complete value-added chain from raw materials to the customer must be
brought together and waste eliminated.
In the old world of dominant downwards values, manufacturers started with
costs, added a profit margin and arrived at a price. Now in the brave new
world of ascendant values, the customer dictates. You start with a market
price, work backwards to add in a profit and you are left with what can be
the cost. Now you must develop functions that can achieve that cost, says an
enraptured Inaki.
'Not to do this is like making clothes by hand or cars one by one. You will
not survive.' There are only two ways to go. Look for intelligent excuses -
and lose. Or put creativity into action - and win.
To questions from members of the audience he insists that more than 90 per
cent of German suppliers are behind him. The response from the German unions
has been 'fantastic'.
To those worrying about growing unemployment from his cost-cutting, he
replies: 'Improvements in productivity generate more working places. All
those that don't improve productivity will lose 100 per cent of their
workplaces.'
He doesn't like the term 'killing' jobs. 'Only those that don't realise they
are in a revolution will disappear.' The vision seems undented by the
investigations of public prosecutors and allegations of industrial espionage
by his former employers. But it is still to be seen whether the prophet has
reached the promised land or just another wilderness.

KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, construction and shipbuilding group, is
in dispute with Norske Shell, the Norwegian subsidiary of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, over final settlement of a North Sea oil platform
contract.
Kvaerner Rosenberg, a unit of Kvaerner, is seeking NKr483m (Pounds 45m) in
compensation for extra work it claims the oil company demanded outside the
original scope of the contract. Shell, in turn, is seeking NKr1.2bn from
Rosenberg for alleged 'wilful misconduct' over the contract.
Kvaerner said that during construction of the Draugen platform deck, at the
Rosenberg yard in Stavanger, Shell approved substantial changed orders and
additional work. The contract was originally valued at NKr834m.
'During its (the contract's) execution, Shell issued instructions and paid
for supplementary work worth almost NKr1.2bn. This brings the value of the
contract - excluding Kvaerner Rosenberg's disputed claim - to NKr2bn,'
Kvaerner said.
The contractor said three-quarters of more than 25,000 construction
documents supplied by Shell to Rosenberg were received too late for it to
meet the stipulated delivery schedule. 'In addition the company received
almost 30,000 change orders.' Kvaerner said that despite much extra work,
Rosenberg achieved 98.4 per cent completion of the deck when it was ready
for delivery in mid-January.
Shell, however, requested Aker, Kvaerner's main Norwegian competitor, to
undertake final completion and commissioning of the platform.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Costs dispute with Prague sours Skoda deal
 -Profitability drive by Volkswagen could damage prospects in Czech Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech government and Volkswagen, the German carmaker, are locked in
dispute over prices and suppliers which threatens to sour their relationship
and damage VW's prospects in the Czech Republic.
The dispute erupted when Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer in which VW has a
31 per cent stake, announced in August it was increasing its car prices by
an average of 8 per cent, and hinted it would seek some supplies from
western Europe because of rising costs in the Czech Republic.
VW plans to raise its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent by 1996 and invest up to
DM9bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in the venture over 10 years.
Only yesterday Lucas, the UK motor components group, said it had won an
'historic' contract to supply Skoda with components via a Czech-based joint
venture. Lucas Autobrzdy, set up in March and in which Lucas has a minority
interest, is to supply Skoda's Czech plant with rear axle assemblies in a
deal worth Pounds 15m a year.
The Skoda announcement on price rises in August stems from the Volkswagen
group's drive to improve profitability and cut production costs worldwide.
Suggestions early this summer that Skoda, which is expected to help develop
a large network of suppliers in the Czech Republic, was considering
switching some of its supplies from Czech to German and UK producers,
angered the government. 'If Volkswagen is changing its view, then we can
also change our view,' said a government official privately.
The increase in the price of the Skodas was the latest in a series that has
brought the price of a basic model to about CzK170,000 (Pounds 3,860). That
is almost twice the cost of a similar Skoda model three years ago, an
increase well above price rises generally.
The move surprised the government which wants to curb an inflation rate
expected to be about 17 per cent this year. Mr Stanislav Belehradek,
minister for economic competition, responded by threatening to reduce the
tariff on imported cars from 15 per cent for European Community-produced
cars and from 19 per cent for other cars, to 10 per cent.
The threat aimed at increasing competition from other manufacturers fell
flat however when it became known that in 1991, the Czech government had
promised VW it would maintain high tariffs on imported cars for four years,
as an incentive for the German company's investment in Skoda.
Prime minister Vaclav Klaus, who at the time was finance minister of the now
defunct Czechoslovak federation, said he had rejected VW's request for
tariff protection. He said the promise was made without his knowledge in a
letter by Mr Petr Pithart, the then Czech prime minister. The suggestion is
that as the letter was not formally approved by the cabinet it may not be
binding.
This provoked a furious debate within the government, with senior officials
warning that going back on the promise would damage the country's
reputation. The problem for the government is that it cannot back down
without losing face.
The price increases have provoked angry letters of complaint from customers.
Autoklub, the Czech motoring association, accused Skoda of taking advantage
of its effective monopoly on Czech low-priced cars.
Skoda rejects the accusations saying its market share had fallen to around
35 per cent with the biggest market share going to second-hand imports.
'We have to raise prices because we have large costs to improve the cars,
marketing, establishing a network of suppliers, and we are investing in the
development of a new car. People have to understand they have to pay for our
investment in new products,' Mr Milan Smutny, Skoda spokesman said.
He also rejected suggestions VW had lost interest in local suppliers. 'We
want to continue with the input of Czech and Slovak producers. Our policy is
that the majority of our supplies should be made here, but we need low
(supply) prices. We can't continue co-operation with suppliers who cannot
adapt when we can get 30-40 per cent lower prices from Germany,' he said.
The joint venture plant at Mlada Boleslav, 40 miles north of Prague, was
established in 1991. It produces more than 200,000 cars annually, more than
half of which were exported last year, and plans are to raise production to
450,000 cars. But tough restructuring measures launched this year by Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, had created 'big pressure to cut cost and
raise profits' throughout the group, said Mr Smutny.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Sutherland firm on farm accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE CAN be no reneg-otiation of the farm trade agreement made last year
between the US and the European Community, Mr Peter Sutherland, director
general of the Gatt world trade organisation, warned Mr Edouard Balladur,
French prime minister, yesterday.
After talks between the two in Paris, Mr Sutherland said 'a significant
number' of the 108 countries negotiating in Gatt did not want the draft
agreement to be reopened, which meant 'there could not be a renegotiation'.
France, under pressure from the militant French farmers' lobby, has demanded
changes to the accord, which foresees cuts in EC agricultural export
subsidies. Both EC and Gatt officials have warned France that reopening the
deal would scupper prospects for an agreement in the Uruguay Round of Gatt
talks being reached by a December 15 deadline.
There was 'only one opportunity left' to finish the Gatt negotiations, Mr
Sutherland told the French prime minister, and that was to conclude them by
December 15. The deadline, he added, 'has been set by the negotiating
parties, not by me'.
But Mr Balladur indicated that legally the Blair House transatlantic farm
accord had never been properly concluded. He insisted - and Mr Sutherland
conceded the point in remarks after his meeting - that 'there is no European
position until the EC Council of Ministers decides'.
Mr Balladur, according to French officials, characterised the December 15
deadline as 'an American date', inserted for US political convenience. But
he went on to assure the Gatt director: 'Be sure that I want a Gatt
agreement, but I ask that all should make an effort, not just the French'.
The Blair House accord will be discussed by EC foreign ministers this
weekend and by farm and foreign ministers at a special session on September
20.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: ABB gas turbines to challenge rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering company, yesterday threw
down a challenge to its rivals in the fast-growing Dollars 12bn (Pounds
7.9bn) market for combined-cycle power stations by launching a range of
advanced gas turbines which it claims are the most efficient yet.
The announcement could have a big impact on the sector, where companies such
as General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom
and Siemens of Germany are ABB's main competitors. All the big players in
the power equipment industry have spent heavily on increasing thermal
efficiency of gas turbines, which produce 'combined cycle' power when a
steam turbine is attached to run from the gas turbine's exhaust gases.
ABB is claiming efficiencies of 58-58.5 per cent for its two new turbines;
for the 50-cycle (Hz) networks of Europe and most of Asia and for the 60 Hz
market in the US and elsewhere. The company says these efficiencies are 2
percentage points higher than values currently being quoted and 3 percentage
points higher than others have achieved in combined cycle operations.
ABB has received one order for its new turbine - from Jersey Central Power
and Light in the US.
Mr Fritz Gautschi, senior vice-president and general manager for ABB's gas
turbine division, said the increased efficiency could save a utility as much
as Dollars 40m in costs over the 15 years of a typical power station's use,
depending on the price of fuel.
ABB said it hoped to capture a 'sizeable' share of the 13,000MW market for
large gas turbines. The company has lacked a truly large gas turbine to
compete with machines from GE, considered to have the technological edge.
Mr Gautschi said ABB's new 50 Hz machine would pump out 365MW of power with
a steam turbine attached, 35-40MW higher than its rivals.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: VW is accused of paying lip service to
probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN should start to co-operate fully with the investigation by public
prosecutors of the alleged theft of secret documents from General Motors and
not just 'pay lip service' to co-operation, Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM
Europe, said at the Frankfurt motor show yesterday.
'I wish that the Volkswagen group, instead of saying they would fully
co-operate with the public prosecutors, would actually do so. It is lip
service. It is not endorsed by action.' If charges were made, it would be 'a
case of industrial espionage of unbelievable proportions,' Mr Hughes said.
'An industrial version of Watergate.'
VW said yesterday it was co-operating fully with the state prosecutors and
that Mr Hughes' remarks were 'unjust'. It was in VW's interest that the
matter be cleared up as quickly as possible, said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs,
VW spokesman.
The prosecutors have been investigating for more than four months the
alleged theft of thousands of confidential documents from General Motors,
the US carmaker and from Opel, its German subsidiary, in connection with the
defection to Volkswagen in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's
former global purchasing director, along with several of his former GM
colleagues.
Mr Lopez is now the VW group's production and purchasing director. The
prosecutors raided VW's head office in Wolfsburg and several other locations
late last month.
The alleged theft concerns the disappearance of highly sensitive GM
documents which the US group says are vital to its competitive standing,
including the prices it pays suppliers for components, lists of its
components suppliers, and confidential details of its future product
programmes stretching through the 1990s.
'It would be good if Mr Piech (VW chief executive) and Mr (Klaus) Liesen
(chairman of the VW supervisory board) would send a letter to VW employees
saying that, without any danger to their job security or their relationship
with their supervisors, they should say what they know of this case.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: China faces steep EC duties on bikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is poised to impose heavy duties on imports of
bicycles from China, in spite of claims that retail prices will rise as a
result.
One Chinese diplomat in Brussels yesterday described the duties as unfair,
and a leading exporter of Chinese bicycles warned that EC producers might
try to increase prices of popular models as supplies were squeezed.
But the European Commission said the duties would protect the long-term
health of the EC industry by stopping the Chinese from 'dumping' bicycles on
the market.
The Commission, which examines dumping complaints, has calculated that EC
producers' share of the market fell from 37.8 per cent in 1989 to 30.2 per
cent in 1991, while Chinese market share rose from 4.6 per cent to 10.5 per
cent, or 2.1m bikes.
About 20m bicycles are sold on the EC market annually, but the Commission
says sales have stagnated since 1991.
Chinese officials will pay a final visit to the Commission today in an
attempt to defer the action, which is the latest in a series of dumping
inquiries to have gone against Beijing. Definitive duties, which will
increase the price of incoming Chinese bicycles by 30.6 per cent, should be
imposed today or tomorrow, following approval by member states. A
provisional duty of 34.4 per cent was imposed in March.
Chinese bicycles are not necessarily a cheap alternative to the popular
mountain and city bikes which have dominated the EC market over the last few
years. Many Chinese-made bicycles are imported into the EC and resold under
well-known brand names. Such models can cost between Pounds 200 and more
than Pounds 1,000 in department stores.
Mr Stephen Codron, a director of China Bicycles Company, believes importers
will switch to other Asian suppliers - leaving the EC industry in the same
predicament - while EC producers will take the opportunity to increase
prices.

THE agreement between the European Commission and the Japanese government on
the level of Japanese car sales in Europe, and Japanese carmakers'
interpretation of the deal, was 'unacceptable and suicidal for the European
car industry,' Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot Citroen, said
yesterday at the Frankfurt motor show.
Mr Calvet called for a 'comprehensive renegotiation' of the agreement,
reached in 1991 and put into force at the beginning of this year, or for a
freeze on Japanese market share in the EC.
The so-called Elements of Consensus agreement should be renegotiated 'in
such a way as to provide true commercial and social reciprocity,' Mr Calvet
said. Alternatively, Japanese penetration of the EC car market should be
frozen at last year's level until west European car sales returned to
volumes implicitly called for in the original agreement.
Excess sales made by Japanese carmakers during such a freeze should be
carried over and applied to future years.
The 1991 agreement calls for the liberalisation of the European car market
from the end of 1999, but Mr Calvet urged an extension of controls on
Japanese vehicle imports beyond 1999 to allow EC carmakers to achieve the
sales base 'guaranteed' by the original deal.
EC carmakers fears about the operation of the EC monitoring system for
Japanese vehicle imports have grown in the face of the steep 17 per cent
decline in new car sales this year,
At the weekend the Commission and Tokyo reached agreement on cutting
Japanese shipments of cars and light commercial vehicles to the EC by 17.6
per cent, to 980,000 this year. But the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association claims that with rising Japanese car output in the EC, the
Japanese share of the market would still rise to 12.5 percent, from 11.3 per
cent last year.
Mr Calvet claimed yesterday that 2m-2.5m fewer cars would be sold in western
Europe this year than in each of the previous three years, equivalent to the
entire production of one of the big six volume carmakers in Europe.
The slump was structural and not cyclical, Mr Calvet said. West Europe would
experience this year the worst global economic recession and a sharper
contraction in the car market than after the first energy crisis in the
early 1970s.

FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz hopes for a profit next year

MERCEDES-BENZ will start making an operating profit again next year even
though no significant recovery in the car market can be expected, Mr Helmut
Werner, its chairman said yesterday.
For the current year he expects sales of the company's luxury cars, buses
and trucks to bring in DM65bn (Pounds 26bn), compared with DM66.5bn in 1992.
Mr Werner, who has already forecast an operating deficit for this year, is
looking for pro-ductivity improvements of 15 per cent in 1994 to assist
recovery.
Sales of the new C-class car model, launched in June, are expected to reach
100,000, compared with earlier production forecasts of 120,000.
Mr Werner claimed that the new entry-level model had attracted many new
buyers. About 40 per cent of deliveries so far have gone to people whose
previous car was not a Mercedes.
The top-of-the range S-class, however, had not sold as well as expected.
Even so, orders were stable and the cars had a 27 per cent share of its
market segment.
AP adds: Mercedes-Benz will announce the location of its plant in the US on
October 1. The decision will end months of high-powered jockeying by several
states eager to have the new factory.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of the Mercedes passenger car division, said the
decision would be announced on that day somewhere in the US.
The company has been studying dozens of American sites since early this
year. It plans to invest Dollars 300m (Pounds 199m) in its first US
passenger car plant, where it will build a four-wheel-drive, sport
utility-type vehicle.
The plant will employ about 1,500 workers and begin production in 1997.
Priced at Dollars 20,000-30,000, the new utility vehicle will be the lowest
priced Mercedes-Benz vehicle, even less than the company's C-class compact
models.
BMW, Mercedes-Benz's German rival in the luxury car sector, broke ground in
June for a plant near Spartanburg, South Carolina.
Speculation on a Mercedes plant site had focused on North Carolina and South
Carolina because Freightliner, a subsidiary of Mercedes, has three plants in
North Carolina.

MR Aurelian Dochia, head of Romania's privatisation agency, has resigned,
becoming the third well-known reformer to leave the government in the past
two weeks.
Western businessmen and diplomats in Bucharest said his resignation added to
uncertainty over the commitment of the left-wing minority government to
reform and rapid privatisation.
Mr Dochia's departure follows the resignation of Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy
prime minister responsible for economic reform, and the dismissal of Mr
Emilian Ijdelea, president of the Romanian Development Agency, the
government's foreign investment arm, last month.
Both Mr Dochia and Mr Ijdelea reported to Mr Negritoiu, an independent, who
was considered the cabinet's most important reformer. Mr Dochia said the
state had so far sold only 1 per cent of the equity of the 6,280 state
companies earmarked for privatisation, even though the 1991 privatisation
law stipulated that 10 per cent should be sold each year.
He said the best solution would be to bring the State Ownership Fund, the 70
per cent owner of the commercial companies, under government control.
Before his resignation, Mr Negritoiu had begun to make the SOF, conceived as
an independent body, more accountable to government but had run into
political opposition.
The SOF's board has been dominated by members of the ruling Social Democracy
party since it won last September's general elections.
The party, which includes many senior former communists, has encouraged SOF
to give priority to privatisation through management or employee buy-outs.
The board has allowed the SOF to invest the proceeds in other state firms
with the aim of giving them a better chance of survival once privatised.
Opposition parties say this is not permitted under the 1991 law. The SOF
should make efforts to attract foreign investors and sell off state
companies as quickly as possible, they say.

<TEXT>
MR Yuri Skokov, a former head of Russia's Security Council yesterday
presented himself as the effective leader of a new political grouping which
calls for an end to political wrangling. Mr Skokov, a figure often tipped as
a future saviour of his country, is counting on support from the majority of
people presumed to be sick of politics and politicians.
With the support of Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party and
Mr Oleg Poptsov, chairman of Russian Television, Mr Skokov said yesterday
the group, called Agreement for the Motherland, would organise a gathering
of 'the peoples and citizens of Russia' next month.
He said the intellectual potential of the country must be harnessed to find
a way through the political deadlock gripping Russia, which is preventing
either reforms or reaction.
Mr Skokov's group, which won immediate support from Mr Yevgenny Kozhokin,
head of the parliament's Security and Intelligence Committee and from Mr
Ramazan Abdulatipov, chairman of the House of Nationalities in the Russian
Parliament, stands for 'an evolutionary path to a federal, democratic and
law-governed state'.
'People are tired of conflict,' he said. 'What we offer is
self-preservation, survival.'
The group, which has caused a stir in the capital because of Mr Skokov's
reputation as a shadowy figure of the corridors of power, is one of several
competing and mobile alliances now manoeuvring for popular and financial
support before elections which are expected to be called this autumn or,
more likely, next spring.
Leading figures such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr
Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president (currently suspended), Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky, the leading economist, and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime
minister, are criss-crossing the country addressing meetings and giving
interviews.
With the exception of Mr Gaidar, whose 'Russia's Choice' bloc is proposing
free market policies, and the neo-nationalists and neo-communists who have
formed a delicate alliance, most of the groups are vying for the centre
ground.
Mr Skokov's base is in the regions, where he is assumed to command a good
deal of support. He has said that his group is being funded by donations
from 20 regional councils.
As a man so far untouched by scandal or allegations of corruption, and with
strong links to the Soviet period which is now seen in a positive light by
many, he could become a rallying figure for those disenchanted with the
democrats who support Mr Yeltsin but find the nationalist/communist alliance
too strong a dish, even in today's chaotic society.

MR Haydar Aliyev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan, yesterday offered
immediate talks with Armenian leaders. His move raised hopes for an end to
the five-year struggle between the two newly-independent former Soviet
states for control of the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno Karabakh,
which is within the borders of Azerbaijan.
Mr Aliyev, speaking at a press conference after two days of talks with
Russian leaders in Moscow, said: 'I have stood and now stand for a peaceful
settlement of this situation. . . it will not be settled by military means.'
He refused to be drawn on whether he would trade the independent status of
Nagorno Karabakh for return of the 20 per cent of Azerbaijan which has now
been occupied by Nagorno Karabakh forces.
Previously Azerbaijan has refused to contemplate a change of status for
Nagorno Karabakh.
The Russian official news agency Itar Tass quoted Mr Levan Ter-Petrossian,
the Armenian president, as saying he would be willing to meet Mr Aliyev.
Mr Aliyev, who is to be confirmed as president next month, was formerly
first secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist party - and showed yesterday
that he retains his aura of authority and appetite for power.
Though he has clamped down on the opposition by jailing leading members of
the Popular Front, supporters of the ousted president Mr Abulfaz Elchibey,
he presents himself as a man committed to peace and uninterested in the
fierce nationalism espoused by Mr Elchibey.
Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister who is in Moscow with a
top-level Turkish delegation, said yesterday that the issue had become an
international one - and likened Armenia's capture of Azerbaijani land to the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
He warned that an Armenian attack on Nakhichevan - the Azerbaijani enclave
within Armenia with which Turkey has a small common border and whose
security it protects through a 70-year-old treaty - would mean that 'the
problem may get out of hand'.
Mr Cetin disclosed that Iranian forces had crossed a kilometre or two into
Azerbaijan - but said it was not a threatening move and was designed only to
regulate the flow of refugees from Azerbaijan into Iran.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Bosnia's Moslems ask for US backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Moslem president Alia Izetbegovic yesterday prepared to take his
case directly to the White House, in another desperate attempt to muster
international support.
In spite of their accusation that the west has abandoned them, the Bosnians
yesterday did little to conceal their belief that the US remains their best
hope to pressure the Croats and Serbs into more concessions.
It is a belief that the US seems reluctant to quash. Last week, Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated that the Serbs and Croats
should be blamed for the breakdown of the peace talks. Shortly after,
President Bill Clinton made fresh threats of air strikes against the Serbs
and Croats. Next week Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, is due to visit
Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, suspicions remain in some diplomatic quarters that comments from
American officials at the Geneva talks last week might have encouraged the
Moslems to stall the talks. American and Bosnian officials deny this.
However Mr Clinton's decision to receive Mr Izetbegovic as Bosnian president
at all is nevertheless seen as a significant gesture of support, though a US
administration official pointed that Bosnia was a state recognised by the US
and that Mr Izetbegovic had met Mr Clinton before.
Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a member of the Bosnian government's Geneva
delegation, yesterday said: 'We know that the Americans have been opposed to
the division of Bosnia and still are. And so we have hopes.'
Nevertheless, the message to Mr Izetbegovic from President Clinton last
night remains ambiguous. Amid continued divisions among the allies - and
within the US government itself - over what can be done in the Balkans, Mr
Clinton seems neither ready to demand that the Bosnians accept the peace
plan, nor prepared to impose any alternatives.
The indecision reflects the dilemma which Mr Clinton now finds himself in.
As American officials well know, if he fails to act over Bosnia, he is
liable to face fresh charges of foreign policy weakness. But if he attempts
to act unilaterally, he risks further straining the transatlantic alliance,
and possibly weakening his position at home, given limited domestic support
for the deployment of US troops in the Balkans.
Faced with this uncertainty, the most that Mr Izetbegovic could
realistically hope for from yesterday's meeting would be a better guarantee
that the US will contribute to peacekeeping troops. Indeed, such a guarantee
would do much to encourage the Moslems to return to negotiations -
tentatively scheduled to start again in 12 days time - in spite of their
insistence that they would rather fight on than accept the current peace
proposals.
Although military officials in Washington have indicated in recent days that
America would be prepared to provide a large part of a peace-keeping force -
perhaps up to 30,000 troops - uncertainties remain. Senior military
officials are known to remain opposed to placing American troops under a UN
command.
The option that Mr Izetbegovic himself clearly hopes for - American-led air
strikes in Bosnia - appears increasingly problematic, in light of the
complexity of the situation on the ground.
As an American official recently admitted: 'Persuading the rest of Nato to
consider air strikes against the Serbs was hard enough. Persuading them to
do them against the Croats or Croats and Serbs together will be much harder
 -particularly with UN troops up on (Mount) Igman.'

FT  09 SEP 93 / Progress on EC steel capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESTRUCTURING of the recession-torn European steel industry took a step
forward yesterday when the European Commission agreed a loan scheme to help
producers make capacity cuts.
The scheme is a key element in the European Community's efforts to enable
the industry to shed 30m tonnes in excess crude steel capacity.
But steel industry observers warned last night that the much-needed
restructuring of the industry - most of which is losing money heavily in
spite of recent price increases - still faces big obstacles before it can be
implemented.
The Commission said it would provide loans to companies, grouped along three
product lines, which agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts made by
the end of next year.
The loans would be paid back by the companies which did not cut capacity.
Officials said the fund would earmark about Ecu1bn (Dollars 1.17bn) to cover
capacity cuts of 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip, 2m tonnes of plates
and 2.5m tonnes of heavy section.
In February, the Commission gave steelmakers until September 30 to present
closure programmes to qualify for its rescue plan. However, the original
timetable has slipped because of the deadlock in the summer in the
Commission's negotiations over state subsidies.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Flynn rejects job creation at any cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SOLUTION to the European Community's jobs crisis can not be obtained at
the price of dismantling EC social provisions or driving down wages, Mr
Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs and employment commissioner, said
yesterday.
As opinion among his Commission colleagues and the 12 member states is
leaning in favour of labour market deregulation and reducing labour costs,
Mr Flynn insisted that focusing too exclusively on wage costs was a blind
alley.
'The social dimension has to be kept on board,' the commissioner told
journalists. 'We're not talking about dismantling workers' rights.'
Mr Flynn said the Commission's White Paper on EC competitiveness, growth and
employment - ordered by June's Copenhagen summit for the December summit of
EC leaders in Brussels - may recommend that specific countries alter labour
market and taxation policies.
These are areas in which the EC has very limited jurisdiction, and the step
would be all the more controversial given the new Community orthodoxy of
subsidiarity, limiting EC action to those areas where national or regional
government cannot act as effectively.
Mr Flynn underlined that there was as yet no consensus on the content or
form of the White Paper inside the Commission. But he said that 'with the
crisis deepening, and the credibility of the Community on the line, I think
we have to go that step further.'
'If you can establish that the taxation system (in a given member state)
keeps people out of jobs, then you should do something about it,' he said.
'I think it's going to have to be said.'
On wage and non-wage costs, the Irish commissioner insisted that the real
issue was productivity and unit labour costs, singling out the UK, which he
described as the most deregulated labour market in the EC.
'Half the population &lt;in the UK&gt; now lives on one quarter of national
income,' he said. 'Ten years ago the same number lived on a third of
national income; and they've still got 3m unemployed.'
Mr Flynn made the comparison with Belgium, pointing out that British wages
were 30 per cent below Belgian wages, but that the UK 'has exactly 70 per
cent of Belgium's productivity.'
The thrust of Mr Flynn's department's analysis remains that solutions must
be found through making working time more flexible by upgrading skills
through education and training. Part of the burden of non-wage costs, like
social security, could be shifted from employment to other areas, for
example through eco-taxes on scarce resources.
Unemployment in the EC dipped to 10.6 per cent in July from a revised 10.7
per cent in June, but the fall is not a sign of economic recovery, the EC's
statistical office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'The slight fall does not reflect an upturn. It is largely due to an 0.5
percentage point decrease between June and July in the unemployment rate in
Spain where many students who graduated in June found a job in July,'
Eurostat said.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Brussels tightens aid curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday reinforced its increasingly tough line on
state aid in Italy when it attached strict conditions, applicable to all
Italian state holdings, to its authorisation of payments to creditors of
Efim, the liquidated state industrial holding.
Yesterday's decision follows a preliminary deal reached in July between Mr
Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition, and Mr Beniamino
Andreatta, Italian foreign minister, which allowed for repayment of half the
bank loans. Efim was put into liquidation in July 1992 with debts of nearly
L18,000bn (Pounds 7.49bn).
Financial institutions were owed L9.3bn of this, including more than
L3,500bn to foreign banks. The loans were guaranteed by the state under
Italian law, and Rome argued it was obliged to honour what amounted to
sovereign debt.
The Commission accepted this argument, but in effect held up the deal as
part of a wider effort to bring Italian state aid under control. At the time
of the July understanding between Brussels and Rome, the Italian government
withdrew its plan to write off debts worth Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.08bn) run up by
Ilva, the steel group.
The two sides are still negotiating the size of the write-off against
Commission demands for steel capacity cuts. As part of the agreement on
Efim, to be monitored by the Commission, Rome will have to:
Impose a freeze on debt at state-owned companies by the end of 1993;
Reduce debt to levels in equivalent private sector companies by the end of
1996;
Revoke the government's loan guarantee arrangements to state-owned companies
immediately afterwards.
Agree to the Commission's joint monitoring of the process.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a taste of things to come: the first public clash of party leaders,
Kohl against Scharping, the two certain combatants for next year's battle
royal in the German elections, meeting each other for the first time across
the floor of the German Bundestag.
For those with a fine eye and ear for the parliamentary scrap, it was a
surprisingly dignified affair. Whatever divides the two gentlemen from the
Rhineland Palatinate, they clearly share a mutual respect.
The youthful Mr Rudolf Scharping, 45, barely 100 days in office as leader of
the Social Democrats (SPD), delivered an hour-long onslaught on the record
of his rival with only a handful of notes to guide him. He steered clear of
personal invective, stuck to the issues of unemployment, social spending,
and the soaring budget deficit, and his opponents were obviously impressed.
As for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the charges against his government of
incompetence, lack of vision and failure of leadership simply rolled off his
broad back. He gave the occasional word of advice on how his young
challenger might one day hope to fill his office. It was painfully
condescending.
However, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, and the big man's heir apparent, showed he remains a
street-fighter in spite of being confined to a wheelchair. He accused Ms
Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, the SPD shadow finance minister, of spouting
'unutterable rubbish' in her budget speech, causing that normally
unflappable lady to storm out of the chamber.
Mr Scharping only put one foot wrong: he suggested that even if the
chancellor had firmly squashed talk of curbing old age pensions at this
stage, his party would surely come back to its nefarious plans 'after the
elections in 1994', implying that the CDU would win. It was a small slip, on
a day with honours even.

FT  09 SEP 93 / The Marseillais out of tune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MARSEILLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE PIECE of graffiti scrawled on a wall outside the Olympic Marseilles
football stadium sums up the mood of the city - 'Seuls contre tous', or
'Alone against everyone'.
Marseilles, one of France's most depressed cities, is already painfully
accustomed to the loneliness of economic decline and political isolation.
The Marseillais now feel more abandoned than ever after this week's decision
by the European football authority, Uefa, to exclude Marseilles from this
season's European Cup because of allegations of bribery by the club's
officials.
Anger will have turned to resentment when it was announced yesterday that
rich rivals Monaco, from along the Mediterranean coast, had accepted the
French Football Federation's invitation to replace Marseilles in the
tournament.
'The French Football Federation could have done something,' said Mr
Jean-Claude Boisson, a taxi driver who, like most in Marseilles, is a
lifelong supporter of the local club. 'But they did nothing to help us -
nothing. They're jealous of O-M's success, jealous of Bernard Tapie (the
club's chairman) and they don't give a shit about Marseilles.' Mr Boisson's
anger is typical of the reaction in Marseilles to the Uefa ban. Marseilles,
like Liverpool and Naples, conforms perfectly to the cliche of an
economically depressed city that has salvaged its civic pride through the
triumphs of its football team.
Marseilles, which once prospered as the main trading post between France and
its North African colonies, has been in decline since the empire
disintegrated. These problems have been aggravated by its political
position. Marseilles, a socialist stronghold, was shunned by the Gaullist
governments of the 1970s and by the socialist administration in the 1980s
because Mr Robert Vigouroux, the present mayor, is an independent who
clashed with the party establishment.
The city's population has dwindled by 100,000 to 800,000 in the past decade.
The level of unemployment is almost twice the national average at 20 per
cent and reaches 30 per cent in the slums. But in recent years the
Marseillais have had the consolation of watching their football team become
France's most successful. 'It's the only thing we've got,' said Mr Mario
Prossero, a fan.
The Marseilles club owes its success to Mr Tapie, an entrepreneur who took
over the club in 1986 after making a fortune by rescuing bankrupt
businesses. He has since invested an estimated FFr130m (Pounds 14.8m) in the
team.
His generosity was almost certainly linked to his political ambitions. Mr
Tapie has since 1989 been member of parliament for a nearby Bouches-du-Rhone
constituency and was briefly urban minister in the last socialist cabinet.
However, the football club has flourished, culminating in last season's
triumph when it became the first French team to win the European Cup.
The fans are now pinning their hopes on Mr Tapie, who hopes to stand as a
future mayor of Marseilles. He will today hold meetings in the city with
local officials and bankers, and then address the club's supporters at the
stadium.
'He's helped us before and he'll help us again,' said Mr Philippe Marcaini,
another fan.

'We have to ensure that in a few years' time the (Italian) state won't come
back to us with the same arguments,' a spokesman for Mr Van Miert said. The
remainder of Efim's debts, largely to suppliers, will be dealt with under
normal state aids procedures, the Commission stated.
The European Commission agreed a loan scheme yesterday to help steelmakers
set up a Dollars 1bn restructuring fund, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The plan is a key element in EC efforts to entice the ailing industry to
shed 30m tonnes in excess crude steel capacity.
The EC executive said it would provide loans to companies, grouped along
three product lines, which agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts
made by December 31, 1994.
The loans would be paid back by the companies which did not cut capacity.
Officials said the fund would earmark about Ecu 1bn (Dollars 1.17bn) to
cover capacity cuts of 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip, 2m tonnes of
plates and 2.5m tonnes of heavy section.
The EC originally gave steelmakers until September 30 to present closure
programmes to qualify for its rescue plan, which also includes money to
cover layoffs and other social costs.
However, that deadline is in doubt because the Commission has still not
resolved steel subsidy cases critical to the restructuring effort.
Steel subsidies will be discussed by EC industry ministers on September 21.

FT  09 SEP 93 / French railways try to refine Socrates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S national railway yesterday announced a series of measures to draw
passengers back into its carriages following an unfortunate brush with high
technology.
Mr Jacques Fournier, president of the SNCF rail company, sought to restore
its image as one of Europe's most efficient services following the
introduction of a computer booking system that created chaos and had
prospective travellers waiting up to 40 minutes for tickets that were often
wrongly priced.
The over-complex system, called Socrates, was introduced at the beginning of
this year at a cost of about FFr1.3bn (Pounds 140m). Plagued by software
problems, it tarnished the image of France's proud railways, contributing,
along with recession, to a 6 per cent cent fall in passengers in the first
half of the year.
Mr Fournier assured passengers that more technical problems had now been
ironed out.
The system had succeeded in making 18m reservations in June, July and August
and could make 420,000 reservations daily, compared with 201,930 a day under
the old system.
But just in case of hiccups, SNCF will allow passengers to board a train
with a simple 'ticket of access' and pay the fare in their compartments.
This should avoid the biggest problem arising from Socrates' teething
troubles whereby frustrated passengers who gave up waiting for tickets and
boarded trains without them were liable to be fined.
Special offers are to be introduced next month in which young passengers,
families and the over-60s will be offered 50 per cent discounts on cards
which give reduced rail fares. The validity of reduced-fare cards issued so
far this year will be extended by three months.
Drawing travellers back onto the trains is not just necessary for the image
of SNCF. The company also faces serious financial pressures. Losses so far
this year amount to about FFr8bn.
With the French government facing a mounting budget deficit, targeted at
FFr317bn this year, such shortfalls are increasingly difficult to sustain.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Norwegians turn a deaf ear to right: A conservative economic
message finds no echo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Conservative party, fighting an uphill battle against the ruling
Labour party in next Monday's general election, came up last month with a
telling message on the deteriorating state of the public finances.
Mrs Kaci Kullmann-Five, the opposition leader, picked up on a reference made
during the last election campaign in 1989 by Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland, who told a group of schoolchildren that the government should no
more overspend than their parents should buy Mercedes cars they could not
afford.
In fact, said the Conservative leader, government deficit spending over the
past three years amounted to the purchase of more than 300,000 Mercedes, and
Labour's plans for the next four years would add another 460,000.
The problem for the Conservatives, who are slipping in the polls, is that
few Norwegians appear to be listening. On the contrary, the minority Labour
government is making much of an improvement in the oil-dependent economy
since it took over from a Conservative-led coalition in 1990 in the midst of
recession. Last year, gross domestic product grew by 3.3 per cent. Even
excluding North Sea oil and shipping revenues, the economy grew by 2 per
cent. Much the same performance is expected this year, with a slight
improvement forecast for 1994.
Oil and gas production rose sharply, with crude oil output rising by 14 per
cent to a record 2.22m barrels per day. This year, average daily oil
production is expected to hit 2.28m barrels.
More tangibly, as far as voters' pockets are concerned, interest rates and
inflation have tumbled.
Inflation is set to rise slightly to 2.75 per cent for the year as a whole,
but at its current level of 2.3 per cent is the lowest in Norway for three
decades.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Norway has cut its key overnight lending rate no less
than 12 times this year from 11 per cent in January to 5.5 per cent today.
The three-month domestic Euro-rate stands at 6.2 per cent, compared with 6.6
per cent in Germany and 7.7 per cent for the Ecu.
The less good news concerns unemployment.
The real jobless rate has grown steadily to 8.2 per cent of the workforce in
August and will not stabilise until next year.
Compared with its neighbours, Finland and Sweden, Norway has escaped
lightly, given that it shares many of the same characteristics of high
welfare and production costs and indulged in the same credit-led boom in the
late 1980s.
Finland and Sweden have both seen their economies shrink for three years in
succession and anticipate only a modest return to growth next year.
Unemployment in Finland has topped 20 per cent and is at 13 per cent in
Sweden.
But the jobless rate in Norway still stands at its highest level since the
second world war and is a top political priority. So Mrs Brundtland's Labour
party, relying on the safety net of oil, has made no bones about using
fiscal policy to boost the economy.
The result has been a steady slide into deficit from a budget surplus
equivalent to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1990 to a forecast deficit this year
equal to 7.5 per cent of GDP.
Excluding oil, the figure shoots up further to a deficit of 12.8 per cent of
GDP. Government forecasts are also based on a projected oil price of Dollars
19 per barrel, a level significantly above current prices.
It is not just Mrs Kullmann-Five who has attacked the issue of the deficit.
Mr Hermod Skanland, the governor of the Bank of Norway, has been a
persistent critic.
'We can no longer base growth and employment on government stimulation of
demand,' he said in a speech early this year. 'Other countries have
previously had to embark on the far more difficult path of adopting
structural policy measures to improve the functioning of the economy.'
What critics like Mr Skanland are worried about is a long-term weakening of
the non-oil economy at a time when the benefits of oil revenues should be
being used to reform and strengthen what is usually known in Norway as the
mainland economy.
They want to see, among other changes, government deficits curbed to allow
for an easing of Norway's high taxes and measures, such as changes in labour
market practices, to improve competitiveness and expand Norway's narrow
non-oil manufacturing base.
As the Conservatives are finding, however, it is a call that has received
little echo in the election campaign among voters whose belief seems to be
that the hard times are behind them.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S ruling Labour party has widened its lead over its rivals and is set
to remain in power after next Monday's general election, according to an
opinion poll published today.
The poll, published in Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily newspaper,
suggested that support for Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour
party had surged three points to 37.4 per cent compared with a week ago.
The main opposition Conservative party slipped for the second week in
succession, this time by 0.6 points to 19.4 per cent.
Labour's gains appeared to be at the expense of the Socialist Left (SV)
party, with which it has agreed to co-operate after the election on most
issues, except the Europe Community. The SV's support fell by 2.5 points to
10.3 per cent.
Political analysts said the Labour party's strategy to play down the issue
of Norway's application to join the EC appeared to be paying off. Labour
party policy supports the application but membership is opposed by most
Norwegians, according to polls.
Today's poll was taken after Mrs Brundtland had campaigned in the staunchly
anti-EC north of the country where she told fishermen that a vote for Labour
did not mean an endorsement of EC membership. She said the issue would be
decided in a referendum to be held by 1995.
Her approach seemed to have blunted the attraction of the anti-EC SV, which
has made the issue of membership a key part of its campaign.
The anti-EC Centre party, heavily supported by Norway's highly subsidised
farmers, managed to progress in the poll by 1.1 points to 11.7 per cent,
almost double its vote in the 1989 election.
The right-wing Progress party, meanwhile, continued its poor showing in the
polls, shedding 1.1 points. Its support now stands at only 6.6 per cent of
the electorate.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Major and Clarke head off rightwing tax revolt: Chancellor
hints at VAT rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THREATENED revolt on tax and spending by rightwing cabinet ministers was
stopped in its tracks yesterday by a combined broadside from Mr John Major,
prime minister, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Clarke also hinted strongly that an increase in the rate or scope of
value added tax was likely in the November Budget.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Clarke insisted that all
taxation options remained open, rejected speculation that the government
deficit might be lower than the Treasury forecast of Pounds 50bn, and ruled
out any further discussion of the cabinet's agreed public spending total of
Pounds 254bn.
Mr Major signalled his intention to end last year's Conservative drift and
disunity by launching a scathing attack on rightwing dissidents and pledging
tough long-term action to control public spending.
In an article written for evening newspapers, Mr Major gave the clearest
signal yet that spending on health and social security would be cut in the
long term.
'We need to look at the long-term difficulties in funding social expenditure
 -now outstripping inflation by some 3 per cent a year. That can't go on.'
Mr Major's tough approach to long-term spending pressures, combined with the
chancellor's uncompromising stand, cuts the ground from underneath the
rightwing cabinet minority.
The right, led by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr John
Redwood, Welsh secretary, claims tax rises this year could be avoided by
more spending cuts and faster-than-expected economic growth, which would
raise government revenues.
A showdown was expected at the political cabinet - held without officials -
to follow today's cabinet, the first for six weeks. But the right may choose
to withdraw in the face of certain defeat.
The prime minister's hopes of an autumn recovery in government popularity
were boosted by an unexpectedly warm response from party activists during a
tour of the West Country.
Local officials said he blamed the Tory Eurosceptic wing for much of the
disunity which has dogged the party since the 1992 general election. 'He was
very vehement indeed on the 20 or so dissident MPs,' said one official. 'He
said this effectively reduces his majority to five.'
Mr Major's helicopter trip to the south-west was ridiculed by Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who claimed it reflected Conservative
'panic' about the party's declining support in the area.
But local Tory officials said Mr Major encountered little of the bitterness
that has emerged in the region since July, when the Liberal Democrats
overturned a Tory majority of more than 30,000 in a by-election victory.
Mr Major held private meetings with several hundred constituency chairmen
and officials at secret locations in Wiltshire, Somerset and Hampshire.
Local Tories, worried by the party's loss of support to the Liberal
Democrats over such issues as VAT on fuel and high water charges, were
enthusiastic about his performance.

FT  09 SEP 93 / EC offers Pounds 385m aid to West Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday injected fresh momentum into the Middle
East peace process by announcing plans for a Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) five-year
aid package for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The funds are intended to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to
capitalise on the historic breakthrough on self-rule in the occupied
territories and reach a full settlement.
In a linked move, Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC commissioner responsible for
external political affairs, appealed to Syria and Lebanon to end their
boycott of the multilateral talks on regional co-operation in order to
complete the process of reconciliation between the Arabs and Israel.
The Commission aid package, which must be approved by the 12 EC member
states, is part of a three-pronged Middle East policy. This includes
forthcoming negotiations on a new partnership agreement between the
Community and Israel; aid to the occupied territories; and a concerted
effort to use EC money and expertise to promote closer regional
co-operation.
A senior Brussels official said a draft EC negotiating mandate would propose
offering Israel an updated 1975 trade agreement and closer political ties.
'Put crudely, they will receive a little more than the Maghreb but less than
Poland,' he said.
The EC initiative comes amid accelerating international moves to channel
hundreds of millions of dollars to the Middle East, intended to cement
regional peace efforts.
Officials from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestine Liberation Organisation
and the Gulf states are to meet at the World Bank on September 20 to discuss
new infrastructure including roads, communications and water.
Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish commissioner responsible for EC development
policy, said the EC funds for the occupied territories would be split
equally between EC grants and EC loans from the European Investment Bank.
The grants would cover education, food aid, and health projects; while the
EIB loans would be used to attract private capital into much-needed
infrastructure. 'The only way for lasting stability is greater regional
co-operation,' he said.
The EC is already the chief supplier of aid to the Palestinians, raising its
contribution from Ecu60m to Ecu90m this year. The latest aid package will be
drawn from existing funds and will require cuts in other unspecified areas.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Deputy chairman of Lloyd's quits posts under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN MERRETT, one of the most controversial underwriters at Lloyd's of
London, resigned as deputy chairman of the insurance market and from its
ruling council yesterday after heavy pressure from other senior figures.
Mr Merrett's agency - one of the biggest in the market - faces substantial
difficulties after a sharp fall in its popularity among Names, the
individuals whose assets support the market.
Mr Richard Keeling, deputy chairman of Lloyd's agency Murray Lawrence, was
elected to succeed Mr Merrett as deputy chairman.
In his letter to Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, Mr Merrett
attributed his decision to resign to an increased workload.
He said: 'We have spoken a number of times over recent weeks about the
problems that I have arising out of workload, already substantial and likely
to increase as a result of the challenges and opportunities facing the
Merrett group.'
Last week members' agents - who handle the affairs of Names and channel them
into syndicates - explained that Names had lost confidence in the management
of the Merrett group and that capacity - or capital - supplied by them to
syndicate 418, the group's biggest syndicate, would fall from about Pounds
150m in 1993 to about Pounds 50m in 1994.
As a result, the group has been forced to step up efforts to persuade
corporate investors to back its syndicates. The group is currently
negotiating with Marsh McLennan, the US broker, and JP Morgan, the bank,
about converting a company, set up earlier this year to provide reinsurance
to Merrett syndicates, into an incorporated Name that would invest directly
in the group's nine syndicates.
The Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest organisation of Names,
yesterday welcomed the resignation, claiming that 'it is constructed for
Lloyd's as a whole'.
Names argue that Mr Merrett's interest as an insurer of fellow Lloyd's
agents against legal awards for negligence conflicts with his position as a
member of the council, at a time when the Lloyd's council could be involved
in helping to negotiate out-of-court settlements in litigation between
lossmaking Names and agents at the market.

FT  09 SEP 93 / Embattled VW chairman warns of 'enemies within'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FERDINAND PIECH, Volkswagen's embattled chairman, who is fighting charges
that his company stole secrets from its rival, General Motors, sees enemies
all around. There are even some working against him inside his own senior
management, he says.
They are fighting a losing battle. What he views as the attempts by his
opponents at Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, to
discredit his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, worry him least of all.
In a frank and wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times, Mr Piech
offered few counters and no concessions to his antagonists. Instead, he made
plain that he sees everything that is going on - both beyond the factory
gates and behind his back.
He presented the face of a man at home with and master of the most
extraordinary imbroglio in Germany's recent business history. It is, after
all, his own creation.
'My creativity costs money and someone has to stop me,' he says. The person
in this instance is Mr Lopez, under investigation for theft and industrial
espionage against Opel, his former employer, and Mr Piech's 'soulmate'. Mr
Lopez is the man for whom, he says repeatedly, 'I would put my hand in the
fire'. He was hired to rationalise VW production and squeeze ballooning
costs. Mr Piech makes no exceptions for himself.
Like Mr Piech, he is a skilled cost-cutter, a zealot, and a rare friend and
ally against the VW chief's private demons: corporate bureaucracy and
traditional German manufacturing practice.
Before Mr Piech took charge last January, he was advised to clear out all
the old management. 'But I didn't do so . . . and as a result there are
still too many dead bodies in the cellar.'
The resistance to him is still there, even though Mr Piech has made
wholesale changes to the executive board and purged six of VW's former nine
management layers. There are those who work against him, leaking and
gossiping, forgetting that he has mastered other personal crises before and
learnt from the experience.
He relates with some feeling his struggle in the late 1980s to take the
wheel at Audi, VW's quality-car division. But Mr Piech's already developed
cost-cutting zeal worked against him among labour representatives on the
company's supervisory board. Mr Wolfgang Habbel, then chairman and due to
retire, was given a new two-year contract.
'The same day, two members of my immediate staff tried to get a job with
him, although they had worked for me for many, many years,' Mr Piech says.
'And if your nearest environment turns against you, you really don't feel
very good'.
Mr Habbel had been re-elected at the insistence of the workers'
representatives on the Audi supervisory board, despite a deepening crisis in
the company. 'I had been running the company for many years . . . I did his
job,' Mr Piech recalls, with no apparent sense of paradox.
'I said I would stay one more year . . . But for the next six months I did
only my job in research and development, and left everything else to him.'
The crisis deepened. Workers' officials overcame their fear of his rigorous
style and fears that he would shift production abroad. 'They came to me and
said they had made a mistake and that they would correct it.' At the end of
his ultimatum year, Mr Piech got the job. 'It was at that time that I learnt
I needed allies.
'In those days, when my wife went shopping nobody wanted to know her. Now
when she goes out in the village where we live, surrounded by many
Volkswagen people, they come to her and say, 'Stay, fight, you will win, we
need you'.'
'It's a new experience for me, but we have a very strong relationship now
between labour and management,' he says. He sees his allies in the group's
115,000-strong workforce.
A curious picture emerges of a D-Mark-billionaire Austrian, content at last
in an isolated patch of Lower Saxony, in alliance with with hard-headed
trade unionists in a grassroots Social Democrat stronghold. From there, he
thumbs his nose at conventional German business wisdom while his motor
industry associates look on with mounting alarm as he goes his own radical
way.
'There are some who believe that the worst thing of all would be if he were
to succeed,' says a company insider. These, the theory goes, include
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party and its sister grouping
Christian Social Union, supported by mainstream business, playing a double
game.
That is an alliance which would like to be rid of Mr Piech and Mr Lopez. On
the one side the aim is to discredit the Lower Saxony government and the
labour-dominated VW supervisory board. One result, it is imagined within VW,
would be to improve the conservatives' chances of winning next year's
federal and regional elections.
The Bonn government lost its say in VW affairs when it sold its last holding
and withdrew its two representatives from the supervisory board. Another
result would be to demonstrate that Germany's traditional 'softly, softly'
approach to reform is, after all, best.
Whether Mr Piech can believe in such a convoluted conspiracy theory or not,
he has repeatedly emphasised that there is no going back to the company's
old ways.
As Mr Piech's confident proclamations of a group turnround this year fade
into muttered assurances of a profit from his power base at the German
parent, it becomes almost daily more apparent that a key short-term aim is
to keep the faith with his key shareholders and his suffering workforce.
If that means sacrifices elsewhere, then Mr Piech is not afraid to make
them: ruthlessly if need be.
There have already been signs enough of wavering on the supervisory board,
prompted from without as well as within. Mr Piech has a saying, which he has
refined since his Audi days, and which has been heard in Wolfsburg recently:
'Either I do it my way, or I go.'
The chances appear to be increasing that if he were to use it now in
earnest, he might have to accept defeat, and leave Volkswagen to the
still-lively corpses in the cellar.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Nippon Steel forecasts loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steel company, yesterday announced that it
will post at least Y15bn (Dollars 144m) in pre-tax losses for the year
because of the prolonged economic slump and the sharp appreciation of the
yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company had earlier hoped for a
pre-tax profit of Y20bn.
Other leading steelmakers, Kobe Steel, Kawasaki Steel, NKK and Sumitomo
Metal Industries, are scheduled to make similar announcements this Friday.
Japanese steelmakers have been hit by the sharp fall in steel sales to
leading customers, especially in the car, electronics and construction
industries. Nippon Steel said it had set up a task force to work out a
restructuring programme to reduce administrative staff in its steel
divisions.
Nippon Steel plans to cut some of its losses by selling securities. It will
skip its interim dividend. For the first six months to September 1992, the
company paid an interim dividend of Y3 per share. Sales for the first half
are expected to fall 8 per cent to Y1,090bn.
The company revised its forecast for the half year down from a Y5bn loss to
a Y15bn loss. Mr Shigeru Omori, vice-president, said: 'It seems difficult
for the business environment to improve in the latter half. The best our
company can hope for is to post no profits but no losses either in the
second half of 1993-94.'
At the beginning of the year in April, steelmakers forecast losses for the
first half but had hoped that a forecast recovery in the economy would
support corporate earnings for the year.
For the year to last March, Nippon Steel saw its annual pre-tax profit
plunge by 71.2 per cent to Y28.9bn. The company is working on a three-year
cost-cutting plan reviewing its 1980s diversification programmes.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Deal will prise open German power sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN Anglo-American consortium is poised to break into east Germany's highly
regulated energy structure, which will open up the region to more
competition.
The consortium - led by Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison
Knudsen of Idaho - is buying Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle (Mibrag), the large
lignite open cast mines straddling the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is
also buying a 44 per cent stake, or the equivalent of 400MW capacity, in a
power generating plant being built at Schkopau, near Leipzig.
The deal, expected to be signed later this month, follows 18 months of
negotiations with the Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German
industry.
The purchase of Schkopau is the main prize. Besides paying DM800m (Pounds
320m) for its stake, the consortium will have access to the power grid.
The grid is controlled by Veag, eastern Germany's big utility company, and
effectively monopolised by west Germany's eight utilities. This structure
restricts participation by outsiders. However, a spokesman for Veag
confirmed yesterday that Veag would buy 400MW from Schkopau, which will give
the Anglo-Americans indirect access to the grid. The consortium will also
have authority to build or buy into more power blocks and sell its energy
via the Veag grid.
'This is the beginning of the breaching of the energy monopoly in eastern
Germany,' an energy expert said yesterday.
He added the group was well placed to exploit the potential of Buna, large
chemical works in Saxony-Anhalt which the Treuhand is due to privatise, and
Leuna, the oil refinery in which Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company,
holds a stake.
The deal's two-tiered price arrangement will be based on a down-payment and
will be linked to the amount of lignite mined over several years. It is
crucial for the Treuhand, as the sale of Mibrag sets a precedent for
privatising the giant Laubag lignite fields in Brandenburg.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Czech church expects no miracles in talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Czech Roman Catholic Church prepares to open talks with the
government on the restitution of property nationalised by the Communists
after 1948, Father Miloslav Fiala is optimistic. 'I think we will find an
acceptable compromise,' he says.
But after four decades of communism, Fr Fiala, spokesman for the Czech
Episcopal Conference, evidently does not expect miracles in the negotiations
later this month on the return of its former earthly goods.
'Opposition (to restitution) has been relatively strong, and we must be
prepared for a compromise,' says Fr Fiala. 'The Church has to realise that
it will not obtain all the properties nationalised in 1948.' The amount of
property involved is considerable, with land representing about 1 per cent
of all land in the Czech Republic. Some politicians have suggested the
Church is being greedy in wanting all the land back, and they say
restitution should be limited to what is needed for the Church's liturgical
activities.
Before the Communists took over in 1948 the Catholic Church owned about
169,000 ha of forests, 46,000 ha of agricultural land, 1,000ha of rivers,
lakes and reservoirs, 1,419 ha of gardens and parks, and 3,024 buildings,
including educational facilities and workshops. No one knows the property's
value at today's prices, though some estimates suggest it could be worth Kcs
60bn (Dollars 2bn).
Prague's cathedral is still in state hands. Although the churches themselves
fell under state control, they were not formally nationalised. In 1991 the
Church won back some monasteries.
Fr Fiala says opposition to full restitution, which was the Church's
original objective, has come not only from left-wing politicians and
parties, but also from within the liberal parties established after the 1989
revolution that ended communism.
The issue has divided the four-party government coalition led by the liberal
free-market Civic Democratic party (ODS).
The ODS wants to limit restitution to property directly held by the state,
and excluding commercial interests.
Fr Fiala argues the church must have an income to exist and to do its work.
'We have practically nothing,' he says, apart from revenue from educational
activities, proceeds from small parcels of land returned to monasteries in
1990-91, and support from religious orders abroad. Income from forestry
alone could provide about Kcs50m - Kcs70m annually.
Last week, Prague Archbishop Miloslav Vlk said restitution of Church
property was not 'the most important reason why the Church is here'.
The Church had been without property for 40 years and could continue that
way if necessary, but the property would ensure its independence and enable
it to fulfil its 'special role' in society.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (21): Why it makes
sense to farm work out - Telecottages explained / The real telecottage is a
community-based project, set up to help local businesses with accountancy,
planning, publicity and marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a farm labourer loses his job, the prospects look grim. But a domestic
sideline - a landscaping service, wood-turning, or even making corn dollies
 -might just turn into a real income-earner, given help with promotion and
administration.
A telecottage is an organisation set up to provide just such facilities to
local, rural businesses. Anyone can benefit: the technology of word
processing, PCs, and photocopiers and so on becomes available on a
pay-as-you-use basis.
According to the Telecottage Association, launched in April this year, in
its simplest form the telecottage is a room filled with computer and
communications equipment that can be used by local people, teleworkers,
business and community groups. But telecottages vary so widely that a
'typical' example does not exist.
Teleworkers themselves tend to use the term very loosely to describe their
own home-based workplace, be it bedroom or room above the garage. In fact
this is likely to be a one-person office, part of the home, either equipped
and paid for by an existing employer, or housing the tools of a freelance
trade. It would be more accurate to call this a 'telebode'.
The real telecottage is a community-based project, set up to help local
businesses with planning, accountancy, marketing and publicity. It can be a
village hall, an extension to someone's home, or a converted building made
redundant by the recession or the death of a local industry. Among the
economic benefits are the reduction of commuting and its environmental
impact, and the introduction of well-paid employment to rural areas, where
as many as 100,000 agricultural jobs are likely to disappear during the
decade, according to the Rural Development Commission's estimates.
The decline of rural mining industries adds to the gloomy picture and makes
it imperative to introduce locally-based opportunities to the rural
population, especially where public transport is limited and expensive. The
development of the Telecottage Association took place under the wing of ACRE
 -Action With Communities in Rural England, a voluntary organisation funded
by the Rural Development Commission. Inspired by the success of similar
Scandinavian projects, ACRE has already run a series of seminars on
telecottages, addressing day-to-day practical problems including marketing
strategies and 'image' - even how to answer the phone.
Rhys Taylor of ACRE is the man responsible for getting the most recent
teleworking marketing conference featured on the Radio 4 daily soap opera
The Archers. 'The way telecottages develop is very flexible,' he says. 'It
can start as a community project and turn into a business, or start as a
business venture and become a community service. We know examples of traffic
both ways.'
The Telecottage Association was founded to provide background information on
setting up a telecottage. It supports a training scheme for teleworkers and
local centres, and helps them get over the first financial hurdle by
providing computer and communications equipment on a low-cost rental basis.
Besides the Rural Development Commission, which has been supporting
telecottages since 1991, the Telecottage Association has an impressive array
of sponsors including BT, as part of its Pounds 14m community action
programme, and the Calouste Guilbenkian Foundation, which has a particular
interest in helping women in isolated rural areas.
Apple Computer is providing its latest Macintosh computers, printers and
software on a low-cost short-term loan arrangement to participating
telecottages. All the Macintosh computers have built-in networking and
remote access capabilities so that teleworkers can work as part of a group
or independently, regardless of location.
One of the telecottages on view - literally, via BT videophones - at the
Association's launch was Boon, located in Devon, about 10 miles outside
Dorchester. 'We do some work on database preparation and field work on
desktop publishing contracts for Dorset Health Commission,' says Boon
project co-ordinator Drew Llewellyn. His centre supports 12 regular
independent workers whose recent projects includes research on a community
health project and creating a directory of local resources.
About 60 per cent of the people who go to Boon are total novices in IT and
an important function is spreading the message through training and
refresher courses on technology. A sister company, Abilities, associated
with the Radar rehabilitation charity, specialises in training people with
disabilities. Boon approached both local and national sources for set-up
funding and collected Pounds 10,000 from the Barclays Communities Enterprise
scheme.
'Altogether it's a wonderful opportunity for local people who have not
fulfilled their career potential,' says Llewellyn.
Alan Denbigh, teleworking consultant and Telecottage Association executive
director, gives advice to corporations on setting up flexible working
projects, including telework. 'One of our aims is to give the telecottages a
higher profile so that they can draw in work from larger companies. The
experience that some already have in running such projects can now be shared
through the Association.'
There are nearly 60 listed telecottages in the UK. Denbigh points to Wren,
one of the best funded projects, as an example of what can be achieved in
just over a year. 'They secured European funding and links with the local
Training and Enterprise Council, and have become something of a model.'
Wren has training and meeting room facilities, offers hourly hire of its
Macintosh equipment, and runs courses entitled Rural Women Back to Business,
which have resulted in regular custom from trainees who subsequently set up
their own enterprises. The whole point of a telecottage, says journalist and
telecottager Tony Crofts, is that modern skills should bring a high income.
'Telecottages are all about revitalising the rural economy by allowing
country dwellers to acquire modern skills and earn at urban rates,' he says.
Chris Moller of the Home Office Partnership, consultant to the EC on
teleworking, is very precise about telecottage terminology. 'The telecottage
is multi-client neighbourhood office, or a business resource centre. Often
it is an organisation set up to provide facilities to local business, but
that can mean they can provide a passive service, for instance, for such
things as bookkeeping.
'Part of our mission in terms of our EC work is to improve the rural
infrastructure: to move wealth creation from the city centre down the phone
line to the village. We see the telecottage movement as supply-driven.
'Our role is to promote demand, and get large corporations to realise why it
makes business sense to farm work out to telecottage enterprises.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (20): Good software
tools aid Ford automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
THE complex business of defining the features and their metamorphosis into a
finished product is a perennial problem for any manufacturer. In the motor
industry it is compounded by the high costs of developing new models and
ensuring that they meet the demands of the prospective market, writes Philip
Manchester.
Ford's Escort series, for example, has about 300 different 'features'. Every
one of these must be taken from the original marketing vision through to
final production.
Ford of Europe recognised that automating this process was not easy. Its
Product Features Database (PFDB) has a wide audience of users - from the
sales department, through manufacturing and finance to the planning
engineers.
It needed good software tools to help meet this need. 'We were concerned
with user interfaces and, in particular, we wanted to be able to offer
graphical user interfaces to present information to the users. It would not
have been feasible to use a character-based interface,' says Nigel Booth,
manager of pre-production systems with Ford of Europe.
'The system had to be a new and self-contained application - although, at
the same time, it had to be mainframe-based to cope with shared databases,'
Booth adds.
In 1990, when Ford decided to go ahead with the new PFDB application, it
looked around for tools to get the project moving quickly.
'We were not looking for rapid application development tools specifically -
but we needed something which would give us a way to prototype the systems
and show them to the users early on,' explains project manager Peter Harris.
'We looked at a lot of packages to do this. But they were all based on
low-level programming languages and would need custom-built code to do the
job.'
Ford chose Easel, a software development tool specifically aimed at
providing graphical user interface (GUI) based applications for mainframe
environments. The product features a database which sits on an IBM mainframe
server and is accessed by the Easel-built applications. Easel has features
which allow it to capture standard IBM mainframe instructions and present
them in GUI format.
Ford was able to get the whole system up and working in about six months
which, by mainframe standards, is quick. The real bonuses came, however,
from the ability to build prototypes to show users in the design phase and
the ability to make changes at the front end without affecting the mainframe
system.
'I am not sure if the system is either quicker or slicker as a result. But
we feel we got better quality end products. And by putting the presentation
software on the PC we can make changes at a much faster pace,' notes Harris.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (19): Volvo finds
package to smooth takeover - Application / Consolidation of the
manufacturing operations meant two incompatible computer systems had to be
brought together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO'S takeover of Leyland's bus manufacturing operations against a
background of significant changes in the public transport market, inevitably
posed a problem when it came to management information.
The consolidation of the two companies' manufacturing operations meant that
two incompatible computer systems had to be brought together.
Volvo has IBM's AS/400 minicomputers and Leyland's systems were based on a
McDonnell Douglas computer. But Volvo Bus, the UK marketing company, needed
stop-gap information systems quickly, to cover the time it would take to
integrate the two systems.
Information systems manager Denny Wood wanted a software development tool
which could work with the existing systems and deliver applications to users
with the minimum of fuss:
'It was a means to an end at a time when we could not recruit programming
expertise. Our corporate systems run IBM/AS/400 using the Synon package. But
we needed something that was more productivity oriented,' says Wood.
Although Wood and Gordon Scuffins, his systems manager, both have sound
experience of information technology systems, neither had the required
AS/400 programming expertise to build the applications users needed.
Wood chose, therefore, to buy in a RAD package from Hoskyns called
MRC-Productivity to help.
Originating in the USA, MRC-productivity is described by Hoskyns as a tool
for development late in the software cycle - that is for applications that
build upon existing infrastructure systems. Hoskyns adds that, unlike the
advanced tools used for building large systems, MRC-Productivity does not
require a large training commitment from users staff.
'The only training I had was a demonstration and a two-day course,' says
Scuffins.
Specifically, the tool has been used to develop information systems for
internal use in the area of reporting.
'We needed reports on such things as part sales analysed by dealer,
geographical area and product type. This helped the production purchasing
staff negotiate favourable deals on parts,' says Scuffins.
'The MRC tool has proved invaluable for these sorts of application because
it means we are able to respond very quickly to user demands. In general
terms I think we can say we respond in hours rather than weeks.'
Wood concludes that Volvo's first experience with RAD 'has been a very
successful investment' and he is convinced that the user demand for
applications could not have been met without it.

<TEXT>
RAPID Application Development (RAD) is the latest label to be attached to
techniques for the creation of software for computer-based information
processing systems.
At the technology level, RAD is a new and quicker way to build software. But
RAD is more than a set of tools to help software development. It is a
combination of a new management approach to systems building, best practice
in development methods and appropriate software tools.
The move to RAD has been made possible by the convergence of technology
advances in both hardware and software. Workstations and open client-server
systems form the hardware base; graphics-based interfaces and
object-oriented design provide new ways to build the software.
The 1990s has seen a significant change in the way that applications
software is built. Changes in infrastructural systems software such as
operating systems and database management incorporate much more what once
constituted an application.
Complex software to handle graphical user interfaces, database management
and communications increasingly forms part of the infrastructure - leaving
application builders to concentrate on the business problem.
At the same time, many companies need to build on existing - so-called
'legacy' systems - to give their users the advantages of advances such as
graphical user interfaces.
As a whole, RAD promises to make the development process easier by providing
tools which can make use of existing data and systems without sacrificing
quality and robustness of design.
RAD techniques also reach deeper into the end-user community than previous
methods of development. RAD demands more commitment from end users and
requires their involvement in many stages of the development process.
A significant part of RAD is the empowerment of users - to allow them to
continue to evolve an application by building their own extensions to the
original system.
In simple terms, RAD is merely a quick way to build software. It has evolved
historically from continuing efforts to make it easier to exploit the power
of computers. Early programming languages such as Fortran and Cobol, the
fourth generation languages which emerged in the 1980s and the more recent
tools for computer-aided software engineering (CASE) all aimed to make it
easier to build software applications.
RAD is the latest manifestation of these efforts.
The fast-changing market conditions of the 1990s mean that the information
systems, which support a business and give it a competitive edge, must be
able to adapt and change to meet new demands quickly. RAD offers the
potential to do this. Earlier methods of development were too complex and
too cumbersome. The success of RAD depends, however, as much on management
will as it does on technology. One of the keys is to get the end user to
take more responsibility - both in terms of defining the business goals of
the application and in terms of controlling the technology which can deliver
the solution.
It is recognised that great gains can be made in productivity at the start
of the application development process, if end users are brought together
with information systems staff to discuss and agree what is the primary
business goal of the new application.
'It has to be a partnership between users and IT staff,' says Ian Palmer,
chairman of software consultancy James Martin &amp; Company.
'RAD must not be driven by technical people. You need a team drawn from both
sides and the development must be managed and co-ordinated properly,' he
adds.
Other software developers are also taking this seriously. Leading software
company Andersen Consulting, for example, uses intensive 'focus' groups to
produce a rigorous system definition with users.
Over a period of a few days, users and systems designers discuss the
business goal, the technology needed to support it and the means of
delivery.
The end result is a detailed definition of the new application, how it can
be implemented and what flexibility needs to be built in to cope with future
needs.
'We interviewed a lot of companies about this and found that there were
often contradictions in what people say when designing a system. The focus
group aims to overcome this by forging a consensus. We have found it a much
quicker way to get a real definition of the business objectives of the
system,' explains Andersen Consulting partner Rob Baldock.
He adds that the focus group approach achieves several important goals. It
crystallises the application both in the minds of the users and the
information systems professionals. It identifies training needs well in
advance. And it specifies the infrastructural needs of the system in a
long-term context.
The essence of Andersen Consulting's view is that RAD takes place in a
context and this must be fully understood before turning to the technology.
If the business context is not understood, RAD becomes nothing more than a
quick way to build the wrong system.
'In your haste to develop a new system you must not sacrifice flexibility,'
says Baldock.
Andersen Consulting's approach also recognises the importance of a flexible
infrastructure for modern applications development. This can only work
against a background of an efficient infrastructure.
In the 1990s this infrastructure is based on some form of 'open' system,
running on a network with a diverse collection of terminals, peripherals,
communications servers and database stores. In hardware terms, the
infrastructure can already be created from a set of components.
This approach is also finding favour among software developers. The rapid
rise of the object-oriented approach to software creation is a good example
of this approach. It sees all information systems as a set of objects which
behave in a predictable way. These software objects can be re-used by
different applications.
Many RAD specialists have identified that object-oriented development will
make their job easier and the technology will play an increasing role in
future applications.
'If you can combine business rules with object-oriented technology you have
a good way to speed up development,' says Sam Jacobs of Trinzic
International, a RAD software specialist.
'It means you can produce demonstration prototypes quickly and get
high-level interest in a company early in the design phase'.
Jacobs says that the market conditions of the 1990s means that the
involvement of senior staff in IT decisions is essential so that
applications are built to serve business goals.
A RAD system in the 1990s must be able to provide the means to cope with an
open, changing infrastructure which can keep pace with advances in hardware
and software as well as changes in requirements from end users.
RAD techniques point in the right direction. They offer systems designers
the opportunity to concentrate on the building a flexible infrastructure and
the provision of general services.
These services can be harnessed by end users - through their desktop tools -
to meet real business needs as they occur.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (17): Complex
contract was worth Pounds 15m - Large-Scale Application: East Anglian health
authority - Continuing reforms within the health service will bring a
shake-up in health IT, and fresh opportunities for private sector operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EAST ANGLIA, like other regions, ran a central mainframe computer service
for its eight districts. But in 1989 the government announced its Working
for Patients initiative, which handed much more autonomy not only to
districts but also individual hospitals, which could become largely
independent trusts.
'We consulted the staff very closely and there was general agreement that
they were having trouble providing a viable service,' says Keith Heron,
general manager at Huntingdon district and also chairman of the regional
computing committee.
'NHS salaries are not great and people were at the top of the scales. Our
location in Cambridge meant we were training people who were then filched by
local companies and the Science Park. We were not able to retain the best
people and had trouble recruiting good staff, so we had quite a few
vacancies.
'The staff and the users were gradually all coming to the view that we had
to look at the private sector.'
Staff were also consulted during the evaluation of suppliers. The short-list
was three of the top six suppliers: Hoskyns, Sema and Data Sciences. These
companies spoke to the regional committee at meetings which also included
staff representatives. There were then meetings between the companies and
the staff representatives alone. 'Both staff and management felt most
confident about Sema's attitude towards employing our staff, transferring
their terms and conditions, training and career development,' Heron says.
'There was a guarantee of no redundancies for three years: that was one
reason for going to Sema and some of our staff have done exceptionally well
there, gaining promotion and better training and career paths by working for
a big computing company. This also meant we would continue to be supported
by people who had NHS knowledge in general and experience of our systems in
particular.
'In addition, although we would have contractual commitment from the
directors, just as important was their personal attitude. Sema was not the
cheapest, although close to it, so our selection was clearly not based
solely on cost.'
Sema was awarded a complex contract which nominally ran for five years and
was worth Pounds 15m. The company took on 100 region computing staff: most
have moved to a Cambridge site now set up by Sema. It also took over an ICL
mainframe computer and two big DEC Vax minicomputer configurations.
Applications on these and local machines range from payroll to patient
administration.
'In a sense we have not saved any money,' Heron says. 'The proposal was that
the supplier would take over everything - in effect the existing budget -
and we would also pay a management fee. However, we had some unfilled
vacancies, so that was reflected in the budget.
'Sema took over our equipment, which is leased, but charge it back to us at
19 per cent. With interest rates much lower now, we are looking at buying
out the lease.
'The main benefit was that we got a viable service, both for maintaining the
existing systems and for future development.'
The contract guaranteed Sema Pounds 9m for running the existing service over
the first three years of the new health service structure.
During that time the districts and the 30 hospitals and other trusts would
work on their future computing needs and could install their own systems.
After three years they could break with the central service, taking their
service funds with them.
The remaining Pounds 6m was not guaranteed, although it includes a system
development element arranged in a way which encourages districts financially
to go to Sema.
As Heron puts it: 'Sema took quite a risk on operational services but less
risk on development services.'
Even so, he points out that the health service reforms mean that instead of
dealing with just eight districts, Sema also now has to negotiate with the
30 trusts.
Sema's marketing director, Paul Hopkins, says some trusts are moving some
systems from the old mainframe to program packages running on smaller local
machines. But he thinks Sema is in a strong position to retain much of the
business beyond the end of the contract.
'We're now working on convincing trusts that they should concentrate on
delivering health care and leave us to concentrate on delivering information
technology,' he says.
SUPPLIER PROFILE
Sema Group PLC was created in 1988 from the merger of the long-established
UK computing services company, CAP, and French company Sema-Metra. The group
has 3,500 staff, including 1,000 in the facilities management division.
It has been in facilities management for 20 years
Offices: Sema has three IBM and four ICL computer centres, including those
in Glasgow, Birmingham and across central and southern England.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (16): A big pool of
skills and resources - User View / National Grid Company / The trend towards
distributed computing is raising new challenges for facilities management
companies and their clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Grid Company's Central Division was a rather unusual client for
facilities management; it did not have a corporate computer.
Central is the biggest of National Grid Company's three divisions, handling
electricity transmission to an area running from south-west England and
south Wales across the Midlands to the east coast.
When the electricity industry was sold to the private sector in 1989 the new
National Grid Company took the opportunity to move from ageing computer
systems run on the old Central Electricity Generating Board's mainframe
computers and switch to smaller, networked computers running the Unix
operating system.
Central Division now has Sequent S3 computers in its five geographic
management units, its construction unit and its main office near Bristol.
These run financial, personnel, work management, stores and purchasing
systems, mainly using program packages from Oracle. There are at least 50
personal computers at each of the seven sites, linked to each other and to
the Sequent machines through Novell local area networks. The offices are
also linked to each other.
Once this new set-up was in place, however, the division decided that it
wanted to be able to concentrate on its core business.
'I wanted to avoid creating a large information technology department,' says
Tony Hill, the manager responsible for computing, finance, accounting,
business development and marketing.
'We would have needed a substantial mix of skills and would have been
vulnerable if people left or were ill.'
The fact that the division's computing was based on a network rather than on
a central machine made it an unusual prospect for facilities management
companies. This is reflected in the fact that two of the biggest specialists
in this field dropped out of the bidding.
The contract went to Data Sciences, one of the top half-dozen service
suppliers. Hill says it was 'one of the very few' already handling such a
network for a client and it also had centres which broadly matched the
division's geographic spread.
The contract has three elements.
Data Sciences runs a help-desk for all seven sites from its Swindon office.
Users can dial direct to the company's National Grid team there. The unit
also manages all maintenance contracts.
The second element is related to the staffing issue raised by Hill.
Previously each of the seven sites had one computing specialist to manage
the local systems, load new software, handle data back-up and deal with
basic user problems.
'This was just one IT person in an office of perhaps 700 people,' Hill says.
'There was no career progression and the job did not fit comfortably into
the structure of the unit. If he went sick or on holiday there was no cover
and if he left, the office was vulnerable until a replacement could be
found.'
Hill hoped to move the systems administration jobs to Data Sciences but felt
this was too big a step for people used to working in the security of a
nationalised industry. So Data Sciences is taking over the job gradually, as
people leave. It now supplies systems people to two sites.
'I pay for Monday-to-Friday cover, not for a particular person,' Hill says.
'This means we've got better cover than we had before.'
The third part of the contract involves a bureau operation on Central
Division's corporate ledger systems. This is run on two IBM RS6000 Unix
computers, again using an Oracle package. And, again, Hill did not want the
concerns of running a computing operation, so although the division owns the
equipment it is installed at Data Sciences in Swindon and managed by the
company.
The contract is initially for two years at a cost of Pounds 965,000, but
Hill says that 'essentially it could run for ever'. Price increases are
written in but they are less than those of the retail prices index.
Hill says there have 'undoubtedly' been cost savings, but he puts the
benefits in other areas: 'We have access to a big pool of skills and
resources. It is up to the supplier to provide them, so we get continuity
without having to organise people and replace them when they leave.'
Hill believes management time spent on computing has been cut to 10 per cent
of one person's time. His team of three computing specialists now
concentrates on future strategic issues.
The management effort goes mainly on monitoring the contract. 'We meet at
least monthly,' Hill says. 'This takes time: they're in business to make
money; we're looking for a long-term relationship. We put a lot of work into
setting performance criteria based on numbers: for example the number of
calls handled by the help desk.
'We have a good contractual relationship: Success in a facilities management
contract involves both parties playing their part.'
SUPPLIER PROFILE
Data Sciences was formed as Datasolve in 1965. It was bought by BOC in 1975
and sold to Thorn EMI in 1982. A management buy-out in 1991 led to the
creation of Data Sciences as a facilities management, systems, consulting,
payroll processing, disaster recovery and software products company with
1,750 staff.
Offices: Data Sciences has eight computer centres across the south of
England, mostly with IBM or compatible mainframes and one with ICL
equipment. Half the centres also have Unix machines.
Turnover and profit: 1992 turnover Pounds 119m; profit after tax Pounds 5m.
Facilities management is 30 per cent of turnover. Market research says the
company is the fifth-biggest facilities management supplier in the UK.
Price: Average contract size Pounds 4m in 1991; Pounds 4.9m in 1992.
Clients: More than 50, mostly in UK

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (17): US market faces
challenge of AT&amp;T power - Martin Dickson looks at the implications of the
fifth largest takeover deal in the country's history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The immense potential of the mobile communications industry in the US has
just been underlined by the Dollars 12.3bn agreed takeover bid for McCaw
Cellular Com- munications, the biggest operator in the cellular telephone
market, by Amer- ican Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US long-distance
carrier.
The takeover deal, the fifth largest in US history and the biggest in the
tele- communications industry, will create an extremely powerful force in
the booming cellular market, combining McCaw's entrepreneurial approach to
business with AT&amp;T's brand name and technological expertise.
The full bid takes the place of a deal announced last November under which
AT&amp;T was to have acquired a one-third stake in McCaw, with the option to
take full control later, and the change reflects the difficulties that the
two sides found in implementing the earlier plan and the commercial
advantages of a full merger.
AT&amp;T's eagerness to get into the cellular market through the McCaw
acquisition, and its willingness to pay what the market considers a fairly
full price, represents a powerful endorsement of the potential of wireless
communications in both the US and around the world.
Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, has a vision of 'anytime, anywhere com-
munications'. That will involve individuals having their own mobile personal
communications numbers, which they will carry with them. They will be
contactable wherever they are, thanks to a variety of new radio com-
munications devices, including phones, personal pagers, fax machines,
computers, video screens and devices combining several of these functions.
However, this vision is still a considerable way from ful- filment and faces
numerous potential problems.
First, the US telecom- munications industry has yet to turn mobile commun-
ications from a relatively high-priced business tool into an affordable
mass-market one.
Second, cellular telephony has yet to become a particularly profitable
business. The industry faces a heavy capital expenditure burden - some
Dollars 11bn in 1992 - as it expands its customer base and moves from analog
to much higher quality digital technology.
It also suffers high costs in acquiring new subscribers - anything from
Dollars 500 to Dollars 1,300 - and suffers from a 33 per cent churn rate -
that is, the number of customers who move, change carriers, or cancel
service in a year.
At the same time, its revenues per subscriber are dropping as it expands its
customer base from deep- pocketed business customers into the much more
price-sensitive consumer market. Average monthly bills have fallen from just
under Dollars 100 five years ago to around Dollars 70 now. To boost profits,
cellular companies may need to reverse this trend, or improve their
operating efficiencies, or both.
Third, it remains unclear to what extent the cellular telephone industry
will be complemented or challenged by a new system of radio telephony,
called personal communications services (PCS), which should be in operation
in the US by 1995 to 1996.
Fourth, a huge battle for dominance of the industry is developing between
the various participants in the rapidly converging US telecommunications and
television industries.
Still, there is no doubting the promise of mobile com- munications. The US
cellular market has grown from virtually nothing in 1984 to more than 12m
subscribers currently and is adding 9,500 new subscribers every day.
EMCI, a communications consultancy, reckons there will be 14.4m US cellular
subs- cribers by the end of 1993, with 17.7m by the end of 1995 and 25m by
the end of 1996.
The country also contains some 14m paging subscribers, and 1.4m users of
specialised mobile radio, which provides businesses with mobile radio
services to meet internal communications needs. Several mobile satellite
services are also in the offing, aiming to provide wireless portable phone
services in areas not reached by cellular.
AT&amp;T's entry to the cellular business has the rest of the telecommunications
industry worried on several counts. First, it poses a challenge to direct
rivals in the cellular business, especially the nation's local telephone
companies - the seven 'Baby Bell' regional business and independent
companies such as GTE.
When the US government set up a cellular network in the early 1980s it gave
out just two licences in each area - one for the established local telephone
monopoly and one for a new, independent rival.
McCaw, which build up a national presence by taking over many of these inde-
pendents, is already a tough rival to local monopolies and the injection of
AT&amp;T's expertise promises to make it even tougher.
AT&amp;T has one of the best- known and respected brand names in the US, which
could help counter the cellular industry's lingering reputation for uneven
service; it will be able to package new services combining long-distance and
cellular operations; and the computer intelligence embedded in its network
should enable it to offer a more seamless and sophisticated national
service.
The local monopolies are also concerned that it will eventually be able to
bypass their wires and link up cellular users with the AT&amp;T network,
depriving them of the huge access charges that long- distance carriers pay
to local phone companies for completion of calls. The takeover will
therefore be bitterly opposed by the Baby Bells and other local telephone
companies.
It also poses a strategy challenge to MCI Commun- ications, the
second-largest long-distance carrier, which has no cellular interests at
present. MCI does, however, have a war chest of cash, thanks to British
Telecom's decision earlier this year to take a 20 per cent stake in the
group, and some of this could be used for a cellular alliance.
An important new element in this struggle will be PCS, a new form of
cellular commun- ications, using inexpensive handsets and low powered
micro-cell transmitters in office buildings and neigh- bourhoods, which
promises to bring wireless communications to the masses.
It could tap a vast new market. A 1991 study by Arthur D. Little, the
management consultants, estimated that 10 years after PCS becomes
universally available in the US, it could serve as many as 60m subs-
cribers, producing Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn in annual revenues -
provided the service was priced reasonably.
The Federal Communic- ations Commission is expected to decide this autumn on
several key PCS questions, including the rules for auctioning franchises. It
has expressed a bias towards excluding existing cellular operators from
bidding in markets they already serve.
The cellular industry seems bound to lose some customers to PCS, provided
the latter service proves cheap. But PCS may well turn out to be
complementary to cellular, rather than a direct rival, with the former used
mainly by pedestrians and the latter by vehicle-based callers.
The PCS industry may be more fragmented than cellular - some three to five
suppliers could be licensed in each area. But the companies which already
have commanding positions in cellular seem certain to also be among the
major players in PCS, thanks to their technical and marketing expertise.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (15): Good deal for
the dealers - Case Study / Westpac Banking Corporation / An Australian
financial institution saved Pounds 2m in capital costs and Pounds 500,000 a
year by contracting out UK computing operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE to a new headquarters triggered a switch to computing facilities
management by Westpac Banking Corporation's UK branch - and saved it about
Pounds 2m in capital costs, writes John Kavanagh. It is now paying services
company AST Trans-Act about Pounds 3m over three years to run its computing
operation - and still saving Pounds 500,000 a year, or 25-30 per cent of its
previous costs.
Westpac is one of Australia's biggest financial institutions. In the 1850s
it was the first foreign bank to open a branch in London. It now has 400
staff at its offices in the City, handling treasury and capital markets
services, risk management and bullion dealing.
Computing is vital to these activities. Dealers enter transactions to
networked personal computers as they happen and these local networks are
linked to the mainframe computer service, now run by AST at its own premises
a couple of miles away in Waterloo.
In 1991, Westpac was preparing to move across the City to its present
offices. 'Apart from facilities management we had two main options,' says
Peter Allen, chief manager, management services.
'We could move our IBM 4381 mainframe computer to the new offices. But that
would mean extra building work to provide a computer room and the related
environmental equipment.
'The other option was to move the computing operation outside London, to
cheaper premises. In both cases there would have been capital costs which
could have been around Pounds 2m, as well as running costs. In addition,
facilities management reduces vulnerability from dependence on a group of
specialised people. Running a mainframe demands that you employ a large
number of operators and specialist systems programmers This is not viable
for an operation of our size. With facilities management you have access to
a wider range of skills.'
Westpac had two main concerns when considering facilities management.
One was security: 'We were giving up control of our security to a third
party, so that company had to have the same concepts and procedures as us,'
Allen says.
'Our other concern was whether the supplier would be able to match the
quality of service we were already getting from our in-house team.'
AST was chosen because it specialises in facilities management for the
finance sector. It claims to be the only service supplier in the UK to be
authorised to link directly to the Swift international banking network.
Allen says AST, at the time largely owned by the Royal Bank of Canada, 'has
the right background and approach to security: it is run along banking
lines.'
Westpac retained system development and maintenance, plus personal computer
support, a total of 17 people. Six of the operations team joined Westpac and
the other 12 were made redundant.
'We wanted to keep development in-house, because there are things we do
which we think are unique,' Allen says. 'Operations is not strategically
important, so we don't lose by contracting it out.'
The six staff who moved across were chosen by AST according to their skills
and experience. 'We were keen to see them retained, both from their own
point of view and from ours, because they know our systems well,' Mr Allen
says.
'They were naturally concerned about moving. They felt they had careers at
Westpac. As a subsidiary of a bank, AST was able to offer a very similar
package and could also offer better career paths.'
Westpac's processing was transferred to AST's much bigger IBM 3084
mainframe. AST took some of the Westpac's existing equipment; the bank sold
the rest. AST provides Westpac's link to Swift and also acts as the UK node
in Westpac's worldwide network.
Although capital and running cost savings were the main reason for going to
facilities management, another benefit has since emerged.
'Suppliers promote the fact that facilities management frees you to
concentrate on your core business,' Allen says. 'I didn't believe it at the
time but it has certainly proved true.
'The whole area of running the mainframe service has gone. The only thing we
have to worry about is making sure AST is meeting the agreed service
levels.'
The contract with AST is for three years. The Pounds 3m includes 24-hour
support, management of the communications and disaster recovery if needed,
plus a fixed amount of use of the mainframe by Westpac for system
development.
Westpac's first big experience of facilities management has given it the
confidence to look at other areas. It is now looking at contracting out both
the management and maintenance of its headquarters and the support of PC
packages.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (15): Service providers come
under threat - Catalysts face changing role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN CHANNING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL of digital cellular, the imminent launch of Mercury's One-2-One
service and the need to widen the market for mobile communications have
forced the UK's service provision industry to put on its thinking caps.
Service providers have long been accepted as the catalyst that sparked the
boom in cellular radio in the UK, but their traditional role as the
interface between the network operator and the customer is now under threat.
One service provider relishing the challenges of the future is North
London-based Cellcom. An industry pioneer, Cellcom has been a service
provider since cellular began in the mid-1980s. With turnover up 16 per cent
to Pounds 32.7m in 1992-93 and margins up to 20.5 per cent, Cellcom is well
placed to respond to the new networks and services.
The increased promotional activities of Vodafone and Cellnet have stimulated
the UK cellular market. 'Business has been exceptionally buoyant and we have
had three record months,' says Mr Jack Knight, marketing manager of Cellcom.
'Churn remains about the same at around 2 per cent a month, but the growth
has tended to put this into perspective.'
Though Mr Knight sees some of the recent growth occurring among those who
previously did not perceive mobile communications as an affordable product,
he does not believe that the industry has turned the corner in terms of the
true consumer market. 'People's patterns of making telephone calls have not
yet changed.'
He has doubts as to whether the new Mercury One-2-One service, to be
launched in London next month, will make a dramatic difference to the
market. 'To be a success, the new service will have to grow its own market
sector. If all it does is take from the existing market, then it has failed.
The launch campaign will help to raise awareness of personal communications
but it has yet to be seen whether the timing is right or the product is
viable.'
He points out that the company has made a number of shifts of position on
the market it proposes to address. 'Mercury is clearly not, at this time,
attacking the consumer, but is going for the small business market.'
Britain's service providers have recently complained to industry watchdog
Oftel about some of Mercury's proposals, particularly in relation to handset
subsidies. Though the complaints are still being considered, Cellcom and
other service providers have applied to Mercury to sell the new service.
The key to selling mobile communications in the mass market is tariffs.
'Mercury's tariffs are well down on those currently being charged by the
cellular operators but they are offering less,' says Mr Knight. 'However,
the competition is not just Vodafone and Cellnet, it is CT2 Rabbit Telepoint
and BT/Mercury. For the next stage of development the industry must address
the running costs of mobile phones; this is the biggest single factor
affecting penetration of the mass market.'
One of the problems facing both the digital cellular services and Mercury
One-2-One is that the UK analogue networks are still a major threat. The
cost, variety and availability of analogue terminals and the range of
facilities on offer far outstrip the offerings from GSM and PCN, and are
likely to do so for some time.
Mr Knight sees GSM easing its way into the market and addressing niche areas
where its special features, such as pan-European roaming and encrypted
speech, are seen as benefits. 'The UK does not have the problems of some
European countries whose analogue networks were over- crowded or
non-existent. The transition to GSM will be much more orderly. As UK users
look to change their phones they will tend to migrate to GSM if it offers
similar or better service.'
GSM terminal type approval is still a problem and the industry is reluctant
to oversell the service while this barrier exists. 'It is important that
customers understand the drawbacks as well as the benefits of GSM,' says Mr
Knight.
proliferation of new mobile services and networks. 'The market needs more
facilities and these developments strengthen the case for the service
provider. The more networks there are, the more need there is for an
independent agency able to stand between them and the customer. Why deal
with five separate networks, offering five different services and five
separate bills, when you can deal with one service provider, get all the
services you want and pay a single bill? The concept of service provision
holds up very well as the new networks come on stream  - it's a one stop
shop for both dealers and the public.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (16): Keeping down costs -
Company Profile / National Power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER prides itself on having one of the most advanced information
technology systems in the country. In computer networking the UK electricity
company 'is probably the leader in Europe', according to Mr Paul Miles, the
company's IT department services manager.
Mobile communication services are used extensively by National Power. But
the resources allocated to the services by the IT department are relatively
small. Though 350 people work in IT, Mr Miles employs only one person to
look after mobile communication services.
The company uses four different mobile communication services - on site
paging, on site trunked mobile radio, radio-paging and cellular telephones.
There are on site paging and trunked mobile radio systems on most of
National Power's 400 sites, with an average of 30 to 40 pagers and 25 to 30
trunked mobile phones per site. Both services link into National Power's
private telephone network, which connects the 400 sites to the head office
in Swindon.
National Power has 8,500 staff, of which 1,000 are located at head office in
Swindon.
Cellular telephones are the company's most expensive item of mobile
communications expenditure. National Power's 570 cellular telephones rack up
an annual bill of just under Pounds 280,000, divided equally between monthly
subscription and call charges. Its 300 radio pagers cost Pounds 60,000 a
year in service and rental charges. Mr Miles acknowledges that cellular is
an expensive system to use compared to the ordinary network.
In National Power's case, the cost to a departmental manager of supplying
staff with cellular telephones is particularly high, compared to the fixed
telephone network. No internal charge is levied for intra-company calls on
the private network and 'it comes as quite a shock for managers to see the
size of the cellular telephone bills,' says Mr Miles.
Cellular costs are kept down by the extensive use of a Cellnet service
called Call Access. This allows National Power cellular telephone uses to
make calls to head office or to any of the regional sites at roughly half
the normal cellular telephone call rate.
To subscribe to Call Access, National Power has had to install a private
circuit between its head office in Swindon and a point on the Cellnet
network that connects into the BT system. All calls between National Power
cellular subscribers and its head office and regional sites pass along the
private circuit. Cellnet would normally have to route calls from its radio
base station to the interconnection point on the BT network.
The speech quality of cellular telephones is 'variable' according to Mr
Miles. But National Power works very closely with Cellnet and its service
provider British Telecom Mobile Communications to discuss black spots in the
system. BTMC and Cellnet are 'very responsive' says Mr Miles, and Cellnet
has in the past acted on its recommendations to improve coverage in
different regions.
National Power has four different accounts for its cellular activities, all
of which are held with BTMC. But the four accounts are to be rationalised
and the company has asked for new quotes from BTMC and other service
providers. Large account holders such as National Power can usually obtain
discounts of around 10 per cent from published tariffs on call charges and
monthly subscriptions.
The majority of National Power's 570 cellular telephones are used by
managers in Swindon who spend a lot of time travelling to and from sites,
and by what Mr Miles describes as 'technical doers'. A small number -
roughly 40 cellular telephones - are used by field service staff.
Budgeting for mobile communications services is done on a departmental
basis. The job of the IT department is to provide an internal service to
internal customers, and it is up to individual managers to decide what
services they can afford.
All in all, National Power is satisfied with the mobile communications
services it uses. New services such as the European digital GSM system and
mobile data hold few attractions for the company, according to Mr Miles. 'We
do not see digital cellular as a need and the same goes for mobile data.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (14): More workers will be
flexible - Joia Shillingford on how new technology is likely to change
employment practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE COMPUTING and communications are helping to fuel the boom in flexible
working. Ms Amanda Lavery of Ovum, the technology research company,
estimates that by the year 2000, the number of company-employed flexible
workers (commonly called 'teleworkers') will increase 20-fold - from the
current 600,000 to 12m in the US and Europe. She defines flexible working as
'any work carried out using a computer and/or telecoms, outside
company-owned premises by a company's employees'.
In a new report, Ovum estimates that the value of the market generated by
flexible working in Europe and the US (including hardware and software
sales, datacoms equipment and annual data traffic) will increase 30 times
from Dollars 1.1bn today to Dollars 33.4bn by 2000.
These projections may seem wildly optimistic but a number of factors are
driving the trend: the desire to bring sales and service closer to the
customer; falling computer, software and telecoms costs; and the
availability of new products which make it easier for mobile workers to keep
in touch with the office. These products include:
Wireless access to in-house electronic mail. Using new Microsoft software,
users need only plug a Mobitex radio modem into their portable PC to
exchange messages with other Microsoft Mail users on their office local-area
network. Data is transmitted over the RAM Mobile Data wireless network.
Computerised fax systems which allow remote access. For example, a system
from Vienna-based Topcall enables users to go to any fax machine outside the
office, dial in a 3-digit PIN number and get all their faxes for that day
forwarded to them.
Personal communicators/personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as those
from Apple, Sharp and Amstrad. These videocassette-sized computers can be
used in conjunction with an optional modem to send or collect information
from the company network. Apple (UK) is believed to be planning a link
between its Newton PDA and the Rabbit network (not currently approved for
data), which would provide a form of wireless data communications.
Devices for linking ordinary modems to mobile phones, so that portable
computer users can send or receive data without going to a conventional
phone. TeleAdapt, a UK-based company specialising in helping mobile workers
communicate, has introduced a device that will connect any modem to the base
of either an NEC P3 or OKI 900-series cellular phone. The US-manufactured
device, called Axcell Cellular, works by making the modem believe it is
connected to the standard telephone network.
Answering services connected to pagers. BT has launched Response Master, a
telephone answering service linked to a pager. The user is given two phone
numbers: one made available to callers which acts as an answerphone; the
other which allows access to stored messages. The user's pager bleeps when a
message is left, but he or she can retrieve it at a convenient moment.
BT expects the service (which costs 54p a day including a simple pager) to
be used by maintenance engineers. It saves engineers from having to break
off a job to take a call, but the pager will bleep every two minutes until a
new message is retrieved.
The number of products designed for flexible working is increasing as
computer and telecoms companies realise the huge sales opportunity that has
been created. A whole host of lighter, cheaper, more powerful and more
energy-efficient portable computers has come to market, some allowing
handwritten input via a 'pen' stylus.
In addition, some suppliers are actively encouraging the spread of flexible
working by supporting teleworking init- iatives, such as the one-year
Connected Community project. Backed by BT, Apple, the Department of Trade
and Industry, and the Rural Development Commission, this involves equipping
a 'tele- centre' in the small agric- ultural town of Kington, in Hereford
and Worcester, with the latest technology, and studying its impact on the
community.
But the trend towards flexible working is not being driven by technology
alone. Ms Lavery says there is now a body of experience showing the kind of
benefits teleworking can bring; as a result many large companies are
actively looking at this area.
Some want greater organisational flexibility to respond to positive changes
(such as an increase in new business) or negative changes (such as flood,
fire or terrorist attacks on company premises). Mr Peter Thompson, co-author
of Henley Management College's Future Work Forum survey, says: 'The recent
bombs in the City have highlighted the vulnerability of organisations that
are all located in one place'.
Concern about the environment is also helping to generate interest in
flexible working. Thirty-five per cent of respondents to the Henley survey
cited environmental issues (eg, reducing traffic congestion and pollution)
as a driver for change.
Benefits. Some employers are deterred by the cost of equipping potential
flexible workers with adequate hardware and software. But for those who are
willing to make the investment, the benefits include:
Cost savings in the long term. Hewlett-Packard was able to save Dollars
300,000 annually by equipping its maintenance engineers with flexible
solutions.
Improved accuracy. In California, police have been given pen computers which
they can use to produce traffic citations. The software prompts the user
with a checklist of questions such as 'At what speed was he/she driving?'
and 'On which road?'. Then, by checking the information against the central
police mainframe, the software decides whether the driver has broken the law
and, if so, what the fine should be.
Increased sales. Drinks company Martini &amp; Rossi increased its sales by 5-10%
when its sales force could make on-the-spot quotations, using Poqet notebook
computers and mobile printers.
Staff retention and space savings. A scheme which allows any employee to
work from home has helped the Trading Standards department at Oxfordshire
County Council to cope with a 100 per cent increase in its workforce despite
limited office space. It has also helped the department to hold on to its
trading standards officers who, because of their specialist knowledge are in
demand from employers, such as large supermarkets.
Efficiency and customer satisfaction. At 'white goods' supplier Seeboard,
field service engineers have been given NEC briefcase faxes (which plug into
portable phones) so that they can order spare parts in front of the customer
or get call-out details without going into the office. The company expects
increased levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Nevertheless, a number of obstacles remain. According to Henley, the biggest
of these are human factors. Half the respondents to its survey of 200 senior
UK executives felt that middle management saw difficulty in controlling
workers based outside the office.
However, Mr Keith Butterfield, manager of a teleworking pilot at ITSA (a UK
government agency) believes good managers have nothing to fear. Based on his
visits to US schemes he believes: 'Good managers will manage teleworking
well, but poor managers will need training and support to succeed.
Henley Management College has set up a Future Work Forum for companies
interested in flexible working. More information on 0491 571454.
Flexible Working with IT: the Business Opportunity has just been published
by Ovum at Pounds 725 (Dollars 1,345). For more information, contact Jennie
Batchelor on 071 255 2650 or fax: 071 255 1995.

He answered that, looking around at all the high-technology equipment needed
to keep him alive, it was the knowledge that the work went to the lowest
tender.
Westminster City Council wisely looked at issues other than price in
choosing a company for facilities management (FM). Recognising that the IT
system had the potential to totally disrupt operations, Mr Roots looked at
other issues - particularly how the council felt that the company and they
would work together.
Facilities management is often described as 'out-sourcing your redundancy
plan'. Westminster saw that as more and more councils looked at FM, there
would be a glut of former IT staff. The first to act would secure the best
deals in placing their people.
FM is an example of obtaining advantage through efficient asset management.
ITNet is doing nothing secret or proprietary. It is doing nothing that
Westminster could not have done for itself except to provide management in
specialist areas. Westminster council has decided that its core business is
managing the city infrastructure and welfare. IT is not seen to be part of
that core.
ITNet also concentrates on maximising its human assets. It spent a lot of
time selecting the people they wanted to transfer from Westminster City
Council. ITNet used independent assessment centres and psychometric tests
for senior personnel. Since the handover, it has used MORI to poll staff for
their views.
It seems that both sides benefit from the deal. Westminster is able to get
its IT services at a competitive price and avoids most of the redundancy
costs. ITNet gets a London base, some equipment and an excellent reference
site for future contracts. Whether other councils will get such a good deal
is open to debate.
Lessons from this case:
There is more to long-term contracts than the price.
Stick to areas of management competence.
The early bird gets the worm.

WESTMINSTER City Council's first step towards contracting out its computing
was to draw up an internal computing strategy. As a result, it has the
future mapped out well beyond the end of its seven-year facilities
management (FM) contract and was able to negotiate more flexible
arrangements.
'Without a proper information technology (IT) strategy we would simply have
contracted out what we were already doing and carried on with the same
systems,' says financial director Bill Roots.
Those systems run on a large, central, IBM mainframe computer and on a
variety of smaller departmental machines. There were about 110 staff in the
central unit and about 30 others attached to individual departments.
Westminster City Council, covering central London, is no stranger to
contracting out services of all kinds and was doing so long before the
government introduced compulsory competitive tendering. The council now has
almost 40 contracts worth a total of more than Pounds 60m a year and
bringing savings of Pounds 10m a year.
IT's turn came up early last year but there was concern about the large
variety of systems and computers.
'Since the mid-1980s a lot of different kit had been installed in different
departments and we hadn't really worked out where we were going overall,'
says Roots. 'We felt we needed a clear long-term strategy. In particular, we
wanted to avoid more in-house development and go for program packages and
also move to open systems.'
Every department in the council looked at how computing supported its
activities and how IT might be developed.
'We decided to contract out the computing centre first: that was the biggest
unit and success here would prove the merits of facilities management to the
departments. In addition, the strategy involved running down the mainframe
eventually.'
Despite Westminster's experience of contracting out services, Roots says
that the FM negotiations were the most complex and difficult he had done.
'Usually you're given a price and that's it,' he says. 'With facilities
management you get a price and then you start to negotiate. For example the
supplier wants to examine and systems and vet the staff's skills. Our
eventual supplier started Pounds 3m more expensive than the cheapest offer.
'We were only considering the mainframe operations side at that time. We
were impressed by what the various suppliers could offer and we added system
development, the help desk and the telecommunications network; the prices
gradually came closer together.' Westminster chose ITnet as its supplier.
The contract is worth Pounds 38m over seven years and the council expects to
save Pounds 11m. ITnet has taken over the mainframe and most of the 110
central computing staff.
'ITnet wasn't the cheapest,' says Roots. 'In fact, we rejected the cheapest,
because I wasn't happy about their balance sheet. ITnet showed in their
presentations and written submissions that they understood our needs.'
Westminster was especially attractive to ITnet, according to managing
director Simon Ricketts, because the company was looking for a base in
central London.
'Opportunities are arising here, especially in the insurance business, with
the end of the recession.'
Two details illustrate the complexities of the negotiations. ITnet wanted a
central London base but also the option to move out of such expensive
offices when the time was right. 'Taking on the mainframe wasn't a
consideration for us but the accommodation was an issue,' says Ricketts.
'We've taken a lease with Westminster which is flexible but enables us to
get out after 12 months. If we then move to cheaper premises, we pay
Westminster 20 per cent of the saving. So it's a good deal for both sides.'
Another contract issue almost put the whole deal at risk. Westminster had 14
leases on various items of computer equipment. But the terms no longer
reflected the equipment value. 'We got into very heavy negotiations with the
leasing companies, who were not the easiest people to deal with,' says
Roots. 'At one stage the FM deal was off. I wasn't prepared to pay what they
wanted and I was ready to make their name mud in the market. In the end they
came round.'
Meanwhile Westminster was also negotiating over the staff. This was 'a big
issue and a difficult one', Roots says. The council wanted to find a way to
avoid redundancy costs, give the staff continuity of employment, yet not
require ITnet to offer exactly the same terms and conditions.
Things went wrong when the council was given conflicting legal advice. The
uncertainty made the staff 'suspicious and nervous' about what was
happening.
The computer operations manager, Colin Kettley, now employed by ITnet as
site manager, confirms this feeling among the staff. 'The legal negotiations
certainly affected morale,' he recalls. The situation was becoming fraught
and it got to the stage where people were looking forward to the move, just
to end the uncertainty.'
Roots says ITnet 'did a good job', talking to staff and making job offers
very soon afterwards, some time before the contract was even finalised.
Kettley agrees. Roots adds: 'We learned a lesson here. If I did it again I'd
tackle this area much sooner. You can't have such indecision: it's not fair
on people.'
Even so, only six people were made redundant compulsorily; another 15 'took
friendly redundancy,' as Roots puts it.
Kettley, one of the 90 who did get transferred, appreciates the new regime.
'There's a much more open style of management, which benefits staff by
involving them more,' he says.
The installation is manned almost entirely by former Westminster staff.
Westminster expects to save Pounds 11m over the life of the contract. But
Bill Roots sees equal benefits elsewhere: 'We've gained flexibility by
getting rid of the big central machine, the staff and the systems migration
problems.
Since moving to FM, Westminster has contracted out its payroll
administration - again to ITnet. The contract runs for three years at a
total cost of Pounds 1.5m; Westminster expects to save Pounds 500,000.
Westminster is now turning to the departmental systems. ITnet has already
won a contract from the social services department but it is far from
assured a clean sweep: most contracts will go out to full tender. After all,
this is Westminster.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (12): Only the elite can
afford such prices - Mark Newman looks at developments in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL AND eastern Europe were going to do it differently. Instead of
digging up roads and laying down cables, many experts in the
telecommunications industry said the new democracies would be better off
using wireless communications systems to vitalise their crumbling
telecommunications infrastructures.
But things have not quite worked out as the experts hoped. Mobile telephone
networks have been built in almost every capital city over the last two to
three years, but services are expensive even by western standards and
affordable only by an elite band of foreign businessmen and government
officials.
Meanwhile, there has been little improvement in the quality or availability
of local network services. The only exception is eastern Germany, where
Deutsche Telekom is investing DM70bn on installing a new telecommunications
infrastructure. It has used modified versions of existing cellular telephone
networks to provide services to businesses in a number of towns and cities,
but this is only an interim measure before cables are laid.
There are 11 cellular telephone networks in operation today across central
and eastern Europe, providing service to approximately 60,000 subscribers in
markets with populations totalling 115m. In all of these countries the
networks are operated by joint ventures between the local telephone network
operator - which retains a majority interest - and one or more foreign
telephone companies.
US West, the US regional telephone company, partners PTTs in five markets -
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Moscow and St Petersburg. Estonia and
Latvia have both chosen Telecom Finland and Swedish Telecom as their joint
venture partners, while Lithuania operates a joint venture with Tele Danmark
and Millicom International Cellular, a Luxembourg-based company. In Poland,
France Telecom and US telephone company Ameritech are the foreign partners,
while in Romania, Telefonica of Spain has a joint venture with Rom Telecom.
Ukraine Mobile Communications, which opened its network on July 1, has three
foreign partners - Deutsche Telekom, PTT Telecom Netherlands and Tele
Danmark.
The first subscribers to cellular telephone services in eastern Europe used
them almost exclusively as a substitute for the fixed network. In many
countries, people have to wait years for a telephone line to be installed.
Even then, it is hard to get an international line. A cellular telephone
line can be switched on in less than a day, and access to the international
network is never a problem.
Usage levels are two to three times higher than in western Europe at around
250 minutes a month. A large part of this is made up of international calls.
Subscriber levels fluctuate widely. Westel, the joint venture between US
West and the Hungarian Telecommunications Company, is the most successful of
the 11 operators. It had 32,000 subscribers by the middle of this year, four
times as many as any other system.
Mr Mark Bell, an executive director for operations at US West Spectrum
Enterprises, says that 'initially people bought cellular telephones as a
substitute for the fixed network, but they tend to hold on even after the
basic telephone service has improved.' Subscriber growth in Hungary is
higher than in most western European countries.
Other US West joint ventures in eastern Europe have been less successful.
Delta Telecom, its St Petersburg venture, has only 1,130 subscribers. Moscow
Cellular Communications has 3,960 subscribers, and the Eurotel Prague and
Bratislava companies in the Czech Republic and Slovakia have a total of
9,100 customers.
The high price of the services in these countries has contributed to the
slow take-up. A survey by the FT newsletter Mobile Communications last year
demonstrated that the average cost of buying and using a cellular telephone
for a year (assuming that a subscriber makes 250 minutes of calls a month
evenly divided between local and international calls) was Dollars 7,500.
It is the high upfront cost of subscribing that produces the major barrier
to a purchase. The average cost of buying a transportable telephone and
connecting to the cellular network was Dollars 2,020 in 1992, according to
the survey.
But the high prices will come under pressure with the launch of competing
networks. Russia has already awarded 12 regional cellular telephone licences
for systems using the European digital GSM standard. Hungary has shortlisted
five bidders for two GSM licences. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and
Poland all plan licensing procedures for GSM network operators.
There has been some frustration in a number of central and east European
countries about the high price of mobile communications services. When the
Hungarian government drew up a licensing process for two GSM licences, it
originally intended to favour those bidders who planned to set tariffs at
the lowest level.
But it changed its mind last month and the adjudication process will now
favour the consortia which offer the highest bids for the two licences. A
group comprising BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom has already offered
Dollars 48m for the licence. With a second round of bidding still to come,
the two licences could generate close to Dollars 100m for the Hungarian
Treasury.
The Hungarian situation illustrates the dilemma that countries in the region
face when deciding telecommunications policy. Delivering high-quality
telecommunications services to businesses and residential customers is
clearly a priority, but when the opportunity arises to replenish depleted
state coffers by selling the right to offer services to foreign telephone
companies, the temptation to take the money invariably proves the decisive
factor.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (13): Top of the growth
league - Asian demand seems insatiable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF you have flown from London to Hong Kong recently, there is a good chance
that down in the hold your luggage was nestling next to a consignment of
cellular telephones.
Exporting cellular telephones from the UK to Hong Kong and eventually China
has become a lucrative sideline for cellular telephone dealers.
Manufacturers already supply China directly, but demand far outstrips supply
and dealers can make a lot more money selling a handset to a middleman in
Hong Kong than to a UK mobile phone user.
The cellular telephone has become a symbol of China's dash for prosperity,
like it was in London and New York. The brick-like mobile phone that Michael
Douglas used on the beach at dawn in the film Wall Street is a small object
of desire in the Guangdong province next to Hong Kong - in spite of the fact
that Motorola of the US, the maker of the telephone, has since brought out
lighter, smaller models.
China's cellular telephone users grew from 38,000 in January 1992 to 160,000
at the start of this year. There were over 200,000 subscribers by the end of
June. All but five of China's 30 provincial state-owned telephone operators
have cellular telephone networks, and the National Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications has been besieged with requests from the provinces to
finance network expansion programmes.
So confident are they of future growth that leading cellular telephone
suppliers such as Motorola, Ericsson and American Telephone and Telegraph
have set up joint ventures in China to manufacture cellular telephone
networks and handsets.
While China has been singled out by the leading telephone companies as one
of the most significant markets in the 1990s, opportunities are presenting
themselves throughout south-east Asia, particularly in mobile
communications.
Licences to operate cellular telephone networks are being advertised in most
countries in the region. Australia has awarded two licences within the last
two years to operate digital networks based on the European GSM standard. A
consortium of Cable and Wireless and BellSouth of the US won one licence,
while the UK cellular telephone operator Vodafone is the largest foreign
shareholder in the second licensee.
McCaw Cellular, also of the US, is a shareholder in the Smartcom consortium
in Hong Kong, which opened the colony's fourth cellular network in the
spring.
In Japan, the Tu-Ka and Digital Phone consortia which are building regional
cellular telephone networks across the country, contain major Japanese
industrial groups such as Nissan Motor and Toyota. BT, Cable and Wireless
and Pacific Telesis are also shareholders.
A number of licence opportunities are still being contested. Binariang, a
Malaysian industrial group which has been awarded a licence to operate a GSM
network, is in discussions with a number of possible overseas partners.
Thailand's cellular operator, Total Access Communications, is doing
likewise. Vietnam is contemplating the award of a licence, while South Korea
started a licensing procedure but failed to finish it after the winning
bidder returned its licence following a change of government and allegations
of corruption.
India awarded six regional licences last October, but a successful high
court case brought against the adjudication committee by an unsuccessful
bidder has threatened to overturn the awards.
During 1992, the number of subscribers to cellular telephone systems in the
12 largest south-east Asia and Australasia markets grew by 50 per cent from
2.7m to 4m, according to figures published by the FT newsletter, Mobile
Communications.
It is the fastest-growing region in the world, outpacing Europe where the 12
largest markets grew by a comparatively sluggish 27 per cent, and the
buoyant US market whose cellular population rose by 46 per cent over the
course of the year.
Japan accounts for 40 per cent of subscribers in the region, but has grown
more slowly than some other Asian markets. This may change with the launch
of new regional services using digital technology, and a change in the law
from April 1994 when, for the first time, subscribers will be able to buy
mobile telephones rather than have to rent them.
Mr Andrew Bissex, who was posted to Hong Kong by UK cellular telephone group
Vodafone to compete for licences, says any comparison between the markets
for mobile communications services in Europe and south-east Asia is
difficult. People do not seem to buy mobile telephones for the same reason
as in Europe, he says.
'It doesn't seem to be related to tariffs,' Mr Bissex comments. 'It seems
that the demand for cellular telephones is closely related to the size of
the wealthy populations in urban centres.'
Whereas in the UK, the majority of mobile phone users are tradesmen, in
countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, a large proportion are traders.
'They use cellular telephones because the local telephone service is so
awful,' adds Mr Bissex. 'In many countries you can be kept waiting for up to
six months for a telephone line.'
Even when telephone lines are available, the quality of the service,
particularly for international calls, can prove a headache. It is often
easier to make an international call on a cellular phone where the operators
have managed to secure preferential access to international telephone
gateways.
In Hong Kong and Singapore, telepoint services - which only allow outgoing
calls and cannot be used in cars - have been successfully introduced after
failing to establish themselves as alternatives to cellular telephones in
the UK and Germany.
Mr Bissex reckons this is due to the high population densities of these
countries, which makes it relatively cheap for telepoint operators to build
networks providing 100 per cent population coverage.
'In Hong Kong, you can clip a telepoint phone on your belt as you leave your
apartment in the morning, and make calls as you walk to work and until you
arrive at the office.' The telepoint phone can then be converted into a high
quality cordless telephone for which normal tariffs apply. 'You can hardly
imagine a similar sort of service being popular in Manchester,' says Mr
Bissex.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (11): Running hard to make
up lost ground - Company Profile / Northern Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN TELECOM spent most of the 1980s carving out a market in the US for
its big public switches, and developing a new fibre-optic transmission
system. It failed to notice the rapidly growing cellular market.
The Toronto-based company is now having to run hard to make up lost ground.
'We're still a small player coming in late,' says Mr John Roth, president of
Northern's two-year-old wireless systems division, which now employs about
3,000 people.
While Mr Roth says that Northern already has a 'superior product', he
acknowledges that it has yet to build a reputation or a market presence
which can match its rivals, notably Sweden's Ericsson.
Its efforts to do so have so far had mixed results. On the one hand, a slew
of new products and two international joint ventures have succeeded in
raising its profile in the cellular business.
Revenues have tripled in the past two years (Mr Roth declines to be more
specific). Breakthroughs have included an order for switches and other
cell-site equipment from Southwestern Bell, the Texas-based utility which
has previously placed all its cellular business with AT&amp;T, Ericsson and
Motorola.
Northern is also supplying equipment for a residential wireless-telephone
system being developed by Ionica, the UK company which obtained a public
telephone operator's licence earlier this year.
But Northern's entry into the cellular market has not been without setbacks.
Its overall market share remains small.
Northern's strength is its switching expertise. It claims that its DMS-MTX
SuperNode digital switch has more than double the capacity of its nearest
competitor.
Northern expects demand for such high-powered switches to soar as the
distance between cells continues to shrink and more calls from mobile phones
require 'hand-offs' from one cell to another.
A big challenge, however, has been to improve its access to radio
technology. Northern gained one toehold with its purchase last year of the
cellular radio manufacturing business of Novatel, a financially strained
Alberta company. Northern has moved production to its own plant in Calgary,
from where it has shipped about 12,000 digital radios.
But a joint venture with Motorola, to serve the North American market, has
failed to meet expectations. Mr Roth says that 'we thought that (Motorola)
would have a stronger radio portfolio than it turned out they actually had.'
Another point of friction has been Motorola's strong commitment to Code
Division Multiple Access, a new - but controversial - radio-frequency
technology. CDMA clashes with the digital Time-Division Multiple Access
technique favoured so far by Northern.
The joint venture has been all but disbanded, although the two companies
still plan to press ahead with cellular systems which integrate Northern
switches with Motorola wireless equipment.
A global partnership with Matra Communications of France, based on the
European Groupe Special Mobile wireless standard, has been more fruitful.
This joint venture, known as Nortel Matra Cellular, installed a GSM cellular
network for Optus Communications of Australia earlier this year. It also has
orders from Austria, and is currently negotiating a sizeable contract in
Germany.
In North America, Nortel Matra has provided handsets and other equipment to
MCI, the US long-distance carrier, for GSM trials in Washington DC. The
tests aim to give cellular subscribers access to such features as voice mail
and screening incoming calls.
Northern's thrust into mobile communications has also taken it into the
low-powered end of the market. Its digital Companion wireless system is
designed for customers - such as hospitals, car dealerships and hotels  -
whose employees need a cordless phone without the range of a full-scale
public cellular network.
The Companion system can be used either as a sophisticated two-way radio, or
linked to a switchboard as an adjunct to an office telephone.
Employees can answer calls dialled to their internal phone number either on
a wired telephone or a cordless handset. Numerous other variations are being
developed, including a system which will link divisions of the same company
located in buildings miles apart.
British Telecom began offering Northern's Companion system last June. Mr
Roth expects that customers in 15-20 countries will have signed up by the
end of this year.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (10): Satellites move closer
to earth - Global Technology Projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH the dream of a truly global handheld mobile telephone service
moved a step closer when Motorola, the US electronics group, won financial
backing for its Iridium satellite tele- communications system - described as
the world's biggest private-sector aerospace project.
Companies from North and South America, Europe and Asia agreed to provide
Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as the first stage in
financing the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project.
Motorola, which conceived the project, has invested about Dollars 270m of
the Dollars 800m itself and expects its stake to fall to 15 per cent as new
investors join. Other US investors include Raytheon, the aerospace company,
and Sprint, the telecommunications group.
In Europe Stet, the holding company for Italy's domestic and international
telecoms businesses, is involved as is Mawarid, a Saudi Arabian industrial
group. The Japanese, including Sony, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, have invested as
the Nippon Iridium Corporation.
The financing agreement gives Motorola a clear lead in the race to build a
mobile telephone system capable of handling telecommunications traffic
literally 'from anywhere on earth'.
Satellite systems already provide a range of key telecommunications services
including maritime and aeronautical communications where land-based systems
are not an option. They also provide links to inhospitable and remote areas
of the world using briefcase-size portable satellite terminals, such as
those supplied by Inmarsat, the London-based 69-member International
Maritime Satellite Organisation.
These mobile com- munications satellite services are mostly based on
geostat- ionary satellites (Geos) which orbit the earth at a height of
12,000 miles or more. In contrast the Iridium system, and a handful of
similar schemes proposed by other consortia, are based on an emerging
technology called low earth orbit satellites (Leos).
Leos orbit at a much lower 550 to 6,000 miles. Because they are closer to
earth, telecom- munications systems built around Leos should suffer less
from the characteristic echo heard on some satellite voice links.
Perhaps more importantly, they will work with much less powerful - and
therefore smaller and lighter and cheaper - telecommunic- ations equipment
including pocket-sized handsets.
However Leos do have a number of disadvantages. Like Geos, they are solar
powered but because they orbit lower they will spend more time in shadow and
therefore have a much shorter lifespan of around five years compared to 10
or more for conventional satellites. They also rely on largely untested
digital telecommunications tech- nologies.
But their biggest - and costliest - disadvantage is that to provide reliable
global coverage many more Leos are needed than would be the case with their
higher-flying counterparts. In the case of Motorola's Iridium project for
example, 66 small telecom- munications satellites will be required.
Iridium plans to place the 'constellation' of satellites in orbit over two
years starting in 1996 and will use a combin- ation of McDonnell Douglas
Delta rockets from the US, the Proton rocket from Russia and China's Long
March launch vehicle. Commercial services would start in 1998.
Another five US-based consortia have proposed similar schemes although none
are quite as ambitious as Iridium and no other project has yet won hard cash
financial backing.
They include Odyssey (6-12 satellites), Globalstar (48 satellites), Ellipso
(12-24 satellites) and Constellation (48 satellites.) Participants in these
other Leo telecom- munications projects include US aerospace companies
Loral, TRW and Fairchild; France's Matra, Aerospatiale and Alcatel; Deutsche
Aerospace; Matra-Marconi, the Anglo- French joint venture; and Italy's
Alenia.
Most of the groups plan to start commercial operations between 1996 and
1999, some with coverage limited initially to the northern hemisphere.
Another group, American Mobile Satellite, a joint venture between McCaw,
Hughes and MTEL, already has a geostationary satellite system in operation
although coverage is limited to just North America.
Several other groups including Orbital Sciences and Starsys Global
Positioning of the US have plans for Leo systems which would provide data
rather than voice services.
Motorola's success in securing financial backing for Iridium is expected to
trigger a race between the other Leo contenders. Not only are there limits
to the world's satellite launching capacity, but most analysts believe the
market can probably support only two competitors.
To supplement revenues from voice traffic Leo systems will also carry fax
messages, paging, facsimile, computer data and provide radio- determination
satellite services, which locate telephones by latitude and longitude.
Iridium hopes to attract between 1.5 and 2 per cent of the number of
cellular telephone users by the end of the century - perhaps as many as 1.5m
subscribers.
Each customer will have to buy either an Iridium handset or a dual purpose
handset which will work with both Iridium and the buyer's own local mobile
telephone network. Calls will cost about Dollars 3 a minute, expensive in
comparison with conventional cellular rates.
Some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a mass market
voice telecommunications delivery system in competition with
terrestrial-based networks.
Even if the economics of Leo telecommunications networks can be worked out,
their backers face some formidable other problems. Not least is the need to
raise further substantial funding.
Iridium, for example, will need to follow last month's initial funding
tranche by another of almost equal size within two years. The remaining 60
per cent of the money needed will come from the debt market, says Goldman
Sachs, Motorola's adviser. By that stage Iridium and system developers will
also have to overcome a number of other difficult issues if they are to win
the backing of inter- national investors.
Among these is the issue of frequency allocation. Last year the World
Administrative Radio Conference in Spain agreed which frequencies to
allocate to Leos in principle.
But since then, the various groups backing the systems have been unable to
agree how this allocation should be divided up - threatening to delay the
timetable for licensing global mobile satellite systems in the US.
The dispute has arisen because Iridium, unlike all its other rivals, plans
to use time division multiple access technology - which does not allow
sharing - for its system. Each TDMA user has to be granted the exclusive use
of a designated block of frequen- cies. In contrast, all the other proposed
systems would use code division multiple access or spread spectrum
technology which is able to share a block of frequencies. The US Federal
Communications Commission has yet to rule on the issue.
Another set of unresolved problems relates to who should regulate Leo
operators - an issue which is exercising the European Commission and other
would-be regulators. Motorola, like most of the other contenders, has only
an experimental licence from the FCC while a European Com- mission report on
Leo satellite networks in December 1992 said it would take at least another
five years to answer regulatory and other questions.
However the biggest problem remains the apparent potential oversupply of
satellite system operators. That has not been eased by Inmarsat's own plans
for a new satellite-based global hand-held mobile telephone service
designated Project 21.
Inmarsat, seen by many as the main rival for Motorola's Iridium project, had
planned to base Project 21 on a Dollars 2bn Leo network. However, at the end
of July it abandoned the Leo concept in favour of a network using fewer
satellites placed in higher geostationary or inter- mediate orbits.
The decision to opt for a conventional system, taken after Inmarsat
commissioned reports on the various options and a potential user survey,
should enable Inmarsat to reduce its investment to about Dollars 1bn.
But whether the decision will benefit Iridium and the other Leo groups is a
moot point. On the one hand, it means Inmarsat is giving up the supposed
advantages of Leos and could have implic- ations for the type of service
that it is able to offer. This may make it easier for Mot- orola and others
to secure investor support for their Leo systems. On the other hand, it
highlights the technical com- plexities of Leo systems and may enable
Inmarsat to prov- ide a significantly cheaper service.
In the next few years these contrasting approaches will be put to the test.
Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the by the end of the decade
satellites will have added another important dimension to hand-held mobile
communications.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (12): Whirlwind
approach pays off - Strategic Planning / John Kavanagh takes a look at
Woolworths' use of facilities management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE last November, Woolworths was preparing to base its future computing on
a new retail management program package running on its big IBM mainframe
computer. Just 10 weeks later it had not only completely changed course to a
network of minicomputers but had also contracted out the entire mainframe
operation and 51 staff to a facilities management company.
The moving force behind the dramatic turn of events was Mr Colin Cobain,
recruited from Rumbelows last September as head of information technology
(IT). He arrived as Woolworths was looking at installing new point-of-sale
equipment in its 800 shops to enable it to record sales of individual items.
This will allow the company to keep much tighter control over sales, orders
and inventories and to move into electronic trading with its suppliers. At
present Woolworths can only record sales at department level, with no
breakdown by item.
Cobain felt that going with a mainframe package would take too long and that
switching to smaller computers would be not only quicker but also cheaper.
He immediately started considering setting up a network of IBM AS/400
minicomputers running a package from software company JDA. This soon looked
promising, so at the end of November the mainframe project was frozen.
By early January the JDA package and the AS/400 were chosen as the way
ahead. A month later a Pounds 10m three-year facilities management contract
covering the existing mainframe unit was signed with the services company,
Hoskyns.
Woolworths now has five AS/400s at its computing centre in Manchester, also
the home of the IBM 3090 mainframe. The new strategy proved itself almost
immediately: it took just two months to get the JDA package installed and
running.
Woolworths expects the new approach to cut its computing costs by at least
20 per cent a year once everything has been moved across. However, while
that is happening, the company still depends on the mainframe systems.
'We didn't want to spend much time on a service which was winding down but
we still needed it at the same quality,' says Cobain. 'We therefore needed
to both free ourselves to concentrate on the new systems and give the people
supporting the old systems an employer that could offer them a career and a
future, which we couldn't'
Woolworths saved time in selecting a service supplier by consulting another
facilities management user and using its short-list of Hoskyns, IBM and GSI.
Woolworths also talked to EDS.
'Hoskyns came across as far more capable of handling the staffing issues,'
Cobain says. 'In addition, Hoskyns already has a data centre in Manchester.
Our work and the staff will move there next Easter, so there was minimum
disruption for our people. Hoskyns guaranteed there would be no redundancies
for at least six months: this is more than our own staff have. 'Looking
after our staff was a primary goal.' The 51 people moving to Hoskyns were
the mainframe operations staff, plus applications software development and
maintenance people. Woolworths still has 140 computing staff, now working on
the new systems.
Money is being saved on the mainframe operation. 'The costs of running your
own machine are constant,' Cobain says. 'You can't pay IBM less for software
licences just because you're using the machine less. At present, we're
paying Hoskyns charges for use of the service, plus a management fee. When
the operation moves off-site next Easter we'll gradually pay less.'
The main benefit, however, lies elsewhere. 'The real saving is in management
time,' Cobain says.
'Without facilities management we wouldn't be able to move to our new
systems so quickly, because our managers would still be concerned with the
mainframe service.
'Moving totally to a new set-up demands full management concentration.'
In keeping with the whirlwind approach to the whole strategy shift,
Woolworths cut the contract negotiation time to a minimum by using
solicitors Clifford Chance, because it had been involved in facilities
management contracts before and had worked with Hoskyns.
In July, Cobain moved to sister company Superdrug as head of logistics and
systems - and also to a place on the board. He was at Woolworths for just
nine months. But he certainly left his mark.
A big attraction of the Woolworths contract for Hoskyns was that it took the
company into the retail sector.
'This sector has adopted IT very rapidly, with moves into capturing item
data at the point of sale and the use of electronic data interchange between
retailers and suppliers, yet it has not been quick to go to outsourcing,'
says Peter Falconer, Hoskyns' associate director responsible for marketing.
'This was therefore a good move for us.'
Even so, Hoskyns took on what is in effect Woolworths' cast-off: a
traditional central mainframe computer service.
'We have only signed two contracts of this sort - where the customer is
switching to a new approach and there is a time limit - in the last two
years,' Falconer says.
'Typically, as with the Woolworths contract, we take on what the customer is
already doing and improve on it. Then we make significant changes, while
still providing the same service. Then we start moving the customer's former
staff around, as necessary for our own business. Finally, if we are closely
involved as partners in the customer's strategy, we really do start changing
things.
'So, although we might have taken on a mainframe initially here, we are
moving with our customers and with the technology. We have mainframes - but
we also have AS/400s and DEC Vax machines and Hewlett-Packard Unix
computers.'
Hoskyns also took on 51 Woolworths staff - 'We normally take on all the
staff,' says Falconer. 'But it has to make business sense.' We never take
people on with the intention of making them redundant.
'The first thing we do after a contract is signed is to counsel each person.
We feel we're good at this: most of our people joined the company this way.
'It's normal for people's terms and conditions to be transferred intact.
These often include location. This means people can move to Hoskyns'
premises later rather than sooner but eventually they will have to move: for
example in the Woolworths contract they would be redundant. Some staff would
move fairly quickly to other projects in the region.'
Falconer says the company can normally accommodate everyone.
'There are bound to be less able people, but we can find them jobs. Some
people are happy to stay 'average.' As an IT company we can offer training
to improve them and perhaps guide them into a job they can do well.
'However, these days most IT managers are pretty professional and have
worked hard to get where they are. They're under pressure to be provide
efficient services, so they've probably weeded out or trained the duffers.'
Falconer offers another angle on the potential benefits for staff: 'We don't
have a facilities management business as such: Hoskyns is the business. This
means Woolworths people could move into our training group or into software
products. The people come into the company, not into facilities management.'
The problem with Woolworths' consideration of a big shift in technology was
that all the 190 computing staff immediately started worrying about what it
would mean for them.
'Anyone considering facilities management should let the staff know as soon
as possible, because it means a major impact on them,' says Brian Booth,
formerly capacity planning manager at Woolworths and now service planning
manager at Hoskyns, working on the Woolworths contract.
'Woolworths could have told us earlier: not necessarily saying who would be
going but at least giving us a clearer understanding of why facilities
management was an option.
'The spectre of redundancy was talked about but this was nothing new, as
redundancies were already happening in IT and elsewhere.'
The staff were put in the picture 10 days before the contract was signed.
The next they knew, Hoskyns had been awarded the contract.
'Generally, there was an initial feeling of bitterness, not against anyone
in particular but as a reaction to the fact that you weren't sure what would
happen,' Booth says. 'This is probably true of all facilities management
deals.' Hoskyns 'went out of its way' to explain what was happening, he
says.
'We were introduced to Hoskyns 24 hours after the announcement. There were
presentations, an open forum and a buffet lunch. There were individual
interviews immediately.
'They were clearly concerned about how people felt. Everyone I've talked to
is very happy with the way Hoskyns handled it all. A couple of people were
not comfortable about working for a services company but even they have
changed their minds.'
Booth says career development and training were quickly put in place. Some
people were soon looking to move into other Hoskyns business units, still in
the Manchester area.
'A more commercial focus emerged,' says Booth. 'Hoskyns improved the way we
work and put best-practice in place. I feel we've enjoyed this improvement.
After our initial fears we now cautiously feel that things are going OK.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (11): Let the
experts take over - Viewpoint / Contracting out is one way of passing the IT
buck to people who promise to tame it.  John Kavanagh assesses the risks and
benefits
</HEADLINE>

NO company would seriously consider devoting management and other resources
to setting up and running its own electricity supply business just to meet
its own needs - yet this is just what organisations in effect do with
information technology (IT).
That is one argument used by the increasing number of computing facilities
management companies entering a market worth over Dollars 2,500m in Europe
and growing by more than 20 per cent a year. Indeed, market research firm
Dataquest predicts that UK spending on facilities management will overtake
sales of mainframe computers within five years.
Facilities management typically involves contracting out the running of
computers and systems. Equipment and staff generally transfer to the
supplier, although they might continue working at the customer's premises
for a while. Sometimes the contract is signed with a long-term relationship
in mind; but an increasing proportion of contracts involve the supplier
running the existing service for three to five years while the customer
moves to new technology and systems: for example from a central mainframe to
a network of local minicomputers or personal computers.
Even organisations with the very biggest computing units are looking at
facilities management: the latest notable example is the Inland Revenue,
which is examining tenders for its entire set-up of three development
centres, a dozen computer centres and more than 2,300 staff.
Cutting costs is not the main reason organisations go for facilities
management, according to a 1993 survey by services company CMG. Its findings
are confirmed by interviews carried out for this survey.
The CMG survey shows the main reasons for choosing facilities management are
a lack of internal skills or resources, mentioned by 36 per cent of users,
the need to focus on core business activities (27 per cent), cost reductions
(23 per cent) and flexibility in the use and expansion of computing (eight
per cent).
The survey also shows that these benefits actually happen. More than 75 per
cent of users said facilities management had freed management to concentrate
on core business. In addition, 70 per cent said facilities management had
reduced staff numbers.
Other benefits realised include greater financial control of operations (48
per cent), reduced running costs (47 per cent), the elimination of staff
management problems (45 per cent), improved or guaranteed service levels (43
per cent) and the removal of staff shortages and recruitment problems (43
per cent).
There were mixed results on overall cost savings: 56 per cent reported
savings, 29 per cent said there was no change and 15 per cent said costs had
increased. Indeed, when asked about the disadvantages of facilities
management, 40 per cent of current users said there were no real cost
reductions - this was the biggest single group.
Even so, there were bigger votes for the benefits than for the
disadvantages. Other disadvantages mentioned were difficulties in defining
boundaries of responsibility (35 per cent), loss of in-house expertise (27
per cent), poor understanding by the supplier of the client's business (17
per cent), poor accountability (16 per cent) and loss of control of IT
services and strategy (14 per cent).
Many of these disadvantages are related and highlight the need, now being
underlined by service suppliers, to regard facilities management as a
partnership. All those arguments about IT being key to business strategy and
competitive advantage mean contracting out this area is not as
straightforward as signing away the canteen arrangements or office cleaning.
'Facilities management is gradually moving from being seen as an IT function
to being regarded as a business management service,' says Mr John Rioch,
head of CMG's facilities management services. 'This means users are
demanding more from their supplier relationship. They require a degree of
partnership, but current arrangements often fail to deliver in this
respect.'
This view is backed by other suppliers and confirmed by the CMG survey: less
than a quarter of users said facilities management was totally integrated
with theirbusiness strategy, although 48 per cent said there was partial
integration.
Without a strategic partnership, a company's IT is in danger of stagnating,
according to Mr Geoff Symons, a partner in the Nolan, Norton division of
consultancy KPMG, who advises companies considering facilities management.
This is especially true when the contract includes system development. He
says companies need to retain the ability to manage the service and the
relationship from the customer side.
Facilities management, then, must not be an abdication of management (it has
been argued that FM stands for 'failed management'). Indeed, all the users
interviewed for this survey have clear IT strategies in place: Westminster
City Council even delayed going out to tender while it put together such a
strategy.
'You must look at your management practices and your systems first,' says Mr
Bob Aylott, a principal consultant at KPMG. 'If they're unstable it can be
difficult to find a solid reference against which to measure the supplier's
service. And you might be giving a blank cheque to the supplier to get the
systems in order.'
Geoff Symons says such reviews of current practice can make companies think
about how the prospective supplier makes its profit - and whether its
economies can be achieved in-house.
However, Mr Simon Ricketts, managing director of service supplier ITnet,
suggests this is unlikely - 'a big supplier can get better computer leasing
and software licensing deals than individual clients,' he says. 'As
specialists we work faster and more efficiently across all the client
contracts. By far the biggest money maker is our tuning of the equipment to
make better use of the capacity by rationalising the workload across a
smaller number of machines.'
Such an insight into a supplier's business is useful at the negotiation
stage. 'The ability to negotiate is vital,' says Geoff Symons at KPMG.
Several big suppliers argue that some companies are so keen to expand or
break into this fast-growing market that they are taking contracts at an
initial loss, hoping to build up other work in two or three years from the
same client. There are fears that this will hit the industry's reputation.
John Rioch at CMG believes the relationship and accountability problems
highlighted by his company's survey justify these fears.
But there is no escaping the growth of a business which is attracting
customers of the size of the Inland Revenue and BP. Even the big computer
manufacturers, are moving into the market to help protect their future.
'No-one has all the management skills and professional resources to be world
class at everything they do,' says Mr Mark Otway, who runs FM services at
Andersen Consulting. 'Contracting out is a pragmatic response to reality.'
The Computing Services Association is a good first stop for companies

JANE YATES, manager of Deer Park Telecentre, is no newcomer to teleworking.
She deals with the membership of the National Association of Teleworkers, a
register of resources for teleworkers who want to find work on the open
market, which uses the Telecentre as its headquarters.
Now she also runs the Deer Park Telecentre, which she describes as 'a
virtual office,' officially opened on April 27 this year.
It grew from an existing service to business people staying at the Deer Park
Hotel at Weston, near Honiton in Devon, and is so far not a member of the
Telecottage Association.
'We see ourselves as a temporary office, a resource for small businesses who
don't want to tie up capital in equipment,' she explains.
But her brief goes further - 'People tend to think that the equipment is the
most important part of the scenario. But what we provide is the skill behind
that to deal with problems, particularly the confidence in using the
equipment.
'We try to get rid of the phobia some people have about the technology by
giving hands-on help, in privacy if people prefer.'
Digital Equipment (DEC) has played a large part in establishing the centre,
particularly in providing training, while the Worshipful Company of
Information Technologists has also been a valuable source of support and
guidance. There is a dedicated host modem linked to Digital's own offices
for the use of visiting employees and other visitors, which gives the Centre
another role - that of demonstration centre for live teleworking.
As well as providing back-up and support for the courses and conferences at
the hotel, (mostly for directors and senior executives), Deer Park provides
a secretarial service which embraces everything from general typing to a
personalised answering service, mail shots and creating transparencies and
acetates for presentations.
There are also two private rooms for hire, described as 'telephone kiosks of
the 21st century.' These provide business users with a private room on a
flexible hire basis, with use of fax, phone, PC, modem and printer.
'There are lots of skills the south-east, but they need to be co-ordinated,'
concludes Jane Yates. 'Quality control has to be carried out to a high
standard.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (9): How to enjoy
the best of both worlds - Case Study / Working from home is a privilege but
sometimes it can be difficult to split work and home life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
Helene Hook has the best of both worlds. She works for a well-established
software house, part of ICL, called CPS. But she also works at home, in the
study of her detached house on the outskirts of Twyford, near Reading.
It's a pleasant spot: a string of detached homes in spacious gardens faces
hedges and open fields across the lane. Hidden in the grass by the turning
is an old-fashioned milestone, with the surprising legend 'Hyde Park 33
miles'. The stone, probably dating from the 1820s, could have been
tailor-made for Helene, who moved here two years ago from Marble Arch in
central London. She has been a programmer since 1973 and has worked from
home since 1985 when she joined CPS as marketing manager. The company then
had a turnover of Pounds 1m and employed 150 people.
Two people work directly for Helene. She keeps in touch with them and others
in the company both by phone and electronic mail, and a secretary comes in
weekly to help with filing and administration. Technical support comes from
the CPS Reading office which houses financial and support staff.
'Technical support is vital because our work involves constant changes of
equipment. Technical support configures the systems and supplies us with
excellent 'noddy' guides, so everything comes pre-tested and any new
implementations take an hour or less. This saves a lot of time, but it's the
kind of thing other, non-IT organisation may not realise when setting up
home-working schemes.'
Other CPS workers are also home-based, but very mobile, visiting client
sites twice weekly on average. Salaries are commensurate with other parts of
ICL, anywhere between Pounds 12,000 for junior programmers up to Pounds
30,000 a year for managers.
Helene believes this way of working has already become more socially
acceptable. Home-working was originally associated with women whose domestic
duties as mothers keep them home-tied, but she predicts that caring for
elderly relatives will soon become another motive for teleworking.
'It's a wonderful, flexible lifestyle because people are in control of their
own time. Of course, there are demands and obligations, meetings and site
visits and the like, but even if they're working 37.5 hours a week, they are
doing it on their own terms.'
In Helene's experience, most people feel it is a privilege to work at home
and would not exchange the lifestyle for the more conventional nine-to-five
grind. 'People get used to no commuting and working in an environment of
their own choice.'
Although there's an effort made to bring teams together from the immediate
locale, there are far-flung CPS specialists in Scotland and Wales, including
one hill farmer. Electronic mail - 'I have grown to love it', says Helene -
keeps them all in touch.
She does not feel at all cut off, and sees no problem in creating a feeling
for company culture. 'We meet people face-to-face a great deal - at ICL
training courses, conferences and other get-togethers - as well as receiving
booklets and other publications on the ICL way of doing things.'
CPS takes great care with recruitment, demanding five years' experience and
checking motivation, commitment and working patterns at interview. But
management of people thereafter demands the sort of discipline that should
underpin any office procedure, remote or not.
'Ensuring quality is down to following procedure. We've been
BS5750-qualified since 1989, and all staff have to know our procedures. For
off-site working we have to be very formal about setting objectives,
monitoring progress on projects, what you expect of people, and what they
have to deliver.'
CPS, set up as a home-working company in the IT area, is acutely aware that
its own obligations, such as health and safety regulations, are less easy to
ensure (and enforce) in people's homes. Helene spends a couple of hours at
the screen daily and is careful to take breaks, and use a correctly-adjusted
chair. 'Most of this is common sense and we rely on employees to assess
themselves, but new employees get a start-up pack on how to arrange the
equipment.'
The room where she works is lined with books and acts as a wine store and,
she emphasises, is a general study for the house, not just her office.
Although CPS supplies and pays for the hardware, Helene has invested about
Pounds 100 in a rack which stacks PC, fax, modem, and other hardware in one
corner, leaving the desk free for paperwork.
There are few disadvantages, apart from the occasional intrusion on home
life when Helene's husband and two children are at home.
'It can be hard to split work and home life - one thing I can never ignore
is the fax tone. And calls out of hours can be tricky: little faces come
round the door if I'm still on the phone after five minutes.'
With the new array of mobile technology - laptops and mobile phones - she
believes a new 'mobile army' of workers will emerge. Another factor here is
the recession, as companies have sought to reduce fixed costs.
'Instead of huge corporations, many are working towards a central core of
fixed costs and mobile, home-based contract staff on the fringes.'
Clients think no less of her for being home-based, she finds. 'Suddenly it's
not second-class any more. Once employers have experienced the gains in
productivity that result, they're convinced, whereas before they were
concerned at losing their empire. Now they don't worry about work being done
by people they can't see.'
She concludes: 'People won't want to work in London if there are many more
bomb attacks. Teleworking is the ultimate decentralisation.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (6): The fax of
life in rural Oxfordshire - Small Company Application / Stonesfield
Telecottage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STONE walls along the road to Stonesfield mark the estate boundary of
Blenheim Palace, but the route cuts straight through miles of uninhabited
countryside before it arrives at a very different set of buildings. This is
Stonesfield, an unpretentious village whose character comes not from
postcard cosiness, but from steep tiled roofs and houses set at odd angles
to one another and to the road which curls around them at impossible angles.
Stonesfield's identity reflects its geological siting - on a rock which
provided the slates for all the Oxford colleges and yielded the first
discovery of a dinosaur bones in the 1880s. In the 1990s, Stonesfield has
its fair share of re-vamped barns and baronial executive homes on the
outskirts, but it remains a working village, not a dormitory, despite
redundancies at Cowley which have devastated the local economy.
Friends Close is in the centre, a new cluster of open, airy houses
reminiscent of a Scandinavian style. Above, on a tree, a small sign
'Stonesfield Telecottage' leads visitors up some garden steps which, like
the road, wind up and and around and finally down, into an airy room where
sits Kathy Coonerty, at an Apple Macintosh, and Tony Crofts, at a desk
loaded with papers.
Kathy, manager of the office, is typesetting magazine copy on the Apple
IICx. As well as being the manager, accountant and hub of the office, she
earns much of the revenue by typing. She has one-off jobs, such as a
recently-completed student thesis; regular clients including a local
novelist, Jenny Hinton; and she does typesetting and pagemaking for a
variety of newsletters.
A new customer leaves with 10p worth of photocopying. Howard Bond walked
from his home to the telecottage to copy a letter from the BBC. 'I read
about this service in the local news sheet, the Slate,' he explains. 'Now I
know it's here I'll use it again.'
The next customer is on the telephone: an inquiry from a Bosnian who wants
to enrol on a correspondence course for Teaching English as a Foreign
Language (TEFL). This is another business based at the telecottage, run by
Jim Wingate, who develops courseware and writes books for Intered in Vienna.
Tony Crofts deals with the inquiry and adds another letter to the pile which
Kathy will take with her to the post office when she leaves for the day. The
office also hosts a drama group and other local afternoon activities.
Although Kathy only works 12 hours a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Fridays, the door is always open. The telecottage itself is built on the
back of Crofts' higgledy-piggledy house, all gables and steps. Built
originally as a self-contained bachelor flat, with hand-made floor tiles and
a loft-bed reached by a ladder, it was destined to evolve into a study,
office and then telecottage, all part of Croft's campaign to bring
affordable housing, owned and run at community level, to Stonesfield.
Kathy joined Crofts initially as a secretary, having seen an advertisement
in the Slate. She became the manager when the telecottage started in April
1989. She had relocated in Stonesfield for her husband's work, and her
experience made her an ideal candidate for the job. She had evaluated
various word processing packages from their earliest days, when employed at
Thames Polytechnic and the Borough of Lewisham, and had also been involved
in training.
'Once you got over the initial fear, people loved using the system' she
says, recalling that those initially terrifed of computers often became the
most effective users, irrespective of age.
Now she works on the Macintosh and has added magazine layout to her skills,
as well as doing occasional training. She is self-employed and paid by the
hour. The Mac was chosen for ease of use and its power in design jobs such
as typesetting and pagemaking. Its only disadvantage is that most women
'returners' wish to learn skills on DOS-based computers.
Crofts is himself a TEFL trainer and agricultural journalist specialising in
environmental and rural matters. He charges no rent to the telecottage
business, but instead uses its facilities for his own work and deals with
all incoming inquiries outside Kathy's hours.
His wife, Randi Berild, an architect from Norway, has her own studio in a
gabled room in the main part of the house. The couple take it in turns to
work and share the childcare of their three-year-old son.
As well as Jim Wingate, Tony Crofts and Randi Berild, there are nine other
local businesses in the same street. There are three business consultants
(including one who is only resident at weekends), a woman who manufactures
custom-designed jogging suits, a couple who arrange fine-art holiday tours,
a graphic designer and another freelance architect. All use the telecottage
facilities on an occasional basis. Others, still struggling to find more
conventional employment, keep their CVs on the Macintosh and Kathy updates
them for each new job application.
The local colour is a necessary accompaniment to understanding the function
of the Stonesfield telecottage and the important part it plays both for
local businesses and, as the hub of a campaign for housing provided by the
community, for the community. No telecottage is 'typical' but Stonesfield is
less remote than many.
The village, a few miles from Oxford and within easy reach of the extended
M40, has suffered similar problems to many other picturesque places, as
wealthy middle-class incomers knock together small terraces to make spacious
ranches. House prices, even in the slump, have risen well above what local
people can afford, particularly the young couples and single people who
would not even merit one point on the council housing list.
Tony Croft's involvement with local housing has its roots in his job as a
rural journalist. He moved to Stonesfield in 1976 and subsequently worked
for British Farmer and Stockbreeder, an IPC (now Reed) publication based in
Sutton, Surrey. Remarkably, he persuaded IPC to allow him to do 'distance
working' because he had to be rurally-based, and it made economic sense to
visit Sutton only once weekly. He now runs the newsletter for RURAL
(Responsible Uses of Resources in Agriculture and on the Land), the
countryside information policy group.
He was further inspired by the 'father of the telecottage movement', the
late Henning Albrechtsen. On his way to Leningrad in 1988 he visited the
telecottage that Albrechtsen, a former UN interpreter and oil executive, had
set up above a supermarket in a remote corner of north Sweden, Vemdalen.
This centre provides the same quality of work as can be found in central
Stockholm, but to remote business clients, and at comparable rates. There
are now 80 such centres thriving all over Scandinavia.
When the pub next door, the Boot, was closed and sold for a house
conversion, Crofts wanted to see its adjoining land and car park put to
good, community-based use.
'Planning should be done at parish level. I believe in devolution to
community level. Houses should be built on the basis of need, not
profitability.'
The six dwellings in Friends Close are the result (see panel) and the
telecottage is an important contributor to funds.
He sees no point in letting prime land go to developers who build dwellings
inappropriate to local needs, pocket the profit and put nothing back into
the community.
'There's a tremendous potential for local democracy currently not being put
to use by the system,' he says. 'Decisions made in higher tiers of
government, usually urban-based, are often wide of the mark.'
Crofts' idealism is matched by business sense and a long-term view. A second
housing scheme of five houses is taking shape in the centre of the village,
on a prime site which once housed the Rose and Crown pub and the old village
school playground. It has been funded by Mercury Provident, the Ecology
Building Society, county and district council grants, the Central Telethon
Trust, the Marlborough Charitable Trust, and two other charities.
There are also a number of private supporters who have invested their money
as debenture loans, secured on some of the property over 12 years at a fixed
10 per cent interest. This guarantees a steady interest, and enables SCT to
draw realistic cash flows.
This method has been very successful, raising Pounds 60,000 in two months
from an advertisement in the Friend, a Quaker publication.
Crofts is now looking at a third project, funded the same way. This would
provide workspace for small businesses and a new home for the telecottage,
providing central services for everyone. In an ideal world, the post office
would be on the same site and be part of the mutually supportive local
network.
'A little nest of complementary activities,' Crofts calls it. The rural
idyll is no mere dream and, he suggests, is achievable with local support
and understanding: 'West Oxfordshire District Council has been wonderful -
they have backed promising projects. Local supporters have created a climate
where things can happen.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (9): Mobile phones, the
weight of things to come - John Williamson looks at an area where the UK is
in the forefront of technological developments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN they were launched in the UK in 1987, portable cellular telephones cost
over Pounds 2,500 apiece. They were brick-like in size and sorely lacking in
visual charm. As such, their appeal was largely limited to those whose
business and professional lives depended on the ability to make and receive
calls when a wireline telephone was not to hand.
Today, the unit retail price of a portable telephone is generally below
Pounds 300, and can be very much lower if the product is subsidised by a
network or service provider. Average dimensions have shrunk to those of a
typical video cassette recorder remote control. Leading manu- facturers such
as Motorola and Nokia are now talking of terminals as fashion access- ories
of the future, with user-changeable colours and shapes.
Unusually for practically any field of endeavour, the UK is at the forefront
of developments in this technology worldwide, thanks in large part to the
Thatcher government's creation of a highly competitive market regulatory
regime.
In the popular imagination cellular phones are closely identified with the
go-getting 1980s, being one of the essential accoutrements of the young and
upwardly mobile.
The first UK cellular pilot system was installed by Cellnet to support a
world economic summit held in London in 1984. Thereafter, car phones and
transportable terminals quickly lost ground in popularity to devices which
could be carried in a briefcase or handbag. At present, says Mr Mike Short,
Cellnet's director of external affairs, portables account for around 60 per
cent of the 1.75m mobile telephones in use in the UK, and up to 80 per cent
of all new sales.
The latter compares with a figure of around 45 per cent for the US, the
birthplace of cellular telephony.
Over the last few years technological advances have resulted in analogue
cellular telephones which, in the case of Motorola's MicroTAC II, weigh in
at as little as 167 grams. Size-wise, a new model being launched by Sony
this month has, at 64.2mm x 85.5mm x 24.4mm, virtually the same dimensions
as a pack of playing cards.
In spite of dramatic reductions in mass and price, national penetration
rates for cellular telephones remain modest in the extreme.
In the UK, cellular ownership amounts to no more than three phones per 100
head of population. Even Sweden, with the world's highest density of mobile
telephones, has only 8.6 units for every 100 inhabitants.
In reality, the overwhelming majority of cell phone users are still drawn
from the ranks of the business and prof- essional communities.
But this is set to change, and a move from what Motorola terms 'the classes
to the masses' is already in progress in many parts of the developed world.
This enlargement of the cellular industry's remit is due to three main
factors:
The established corporate and commercial market is approaching saturation in
some locations.
Additional competition is entering the cellular arena in some countries such
as the UK, Germany and the US. While the so-called personal communication
network (PCN) operators will inevitably attack some of the incumbent
cellular operators' customer base, to survive they will have to grow the
market constituency overall.
The advent of digital cellular provides a means to support true mass market
subscriber populations for the first time. As a rule of thumb, digital
networks can accom- modate around 10 times more subscribers than their
analogue counterparts for a given chunk of radio spectrum.
This new environment presents the phone manufacturers with some stiff
challenges.
As is generally acknowledged, portable phones of all types will need to
become even less obtrusive then at present. The ideal, says Mr Bob
Weisshappel, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's
worldwide cellular subscriber group, is to make terminals 'wearable' to the
point where users carry them as naturally as they now do pens or watches.
This does not necessarily mean drastically smaller terminals since there are
certain fixed values for 'face- and finger-friendliness' to be taken into
account.
Motorola, the world's leading cellular phone vendor with around 30 per cent
of the market, believes that terminal weight will be of more consequence
than size. However Nokia, the second largest supplier with 20 per cent of
the global business, reckons that weight reduction can reach a point of
diminishing returns.
Mr Anssi Vanjoki, vice president of sales at Nokia Mobile Phones, cites
market research which indicates that, below a certain mass, there is a
reluctance to pay a premium for further weight reduction. 'It doesn't feel
like it's worth the money you paid for it,' he says.
However, there is a consensus that the larger and heavier digital cell
phones now appearing on the market will have to slim down in record time to
the size and weight of the best case analogue telephones currently
available. 'Whenever you come out with something that's new, it will always
be compared with what is already there,' says Mr Weisshappel. 'That's the
standard market reference.'
With volume sales of digital terminals, industry calculates that pricing
should likewise be comparable. 'It's called when,' says Mr Weisshappel.
Greater simplicity of operation will be another factor shaping the cell
phone business of the future. 'To really hit the mass market, the phone has
to be simple to use and easy to understand,' says Mr Don Burns, general
manager and vice-president of Motorola's European cellular subscriber
division.
Continuing the VCR remote control analogy, Mr Peter Radley, Alcatel's vice
president for mobile communications, says that many phones currently on the
market virtually require the application of low-level programming skills
before their full functional repertoire can be accessed. Devoting resources
to build capabilities which are not used instead of using resources to build
facilities which are is a lost cost. 'It doesn't take the industry forward
as far as it might go,' he argues.
It is now also an article of faith in the mobile business that the dawning
of consumer cellular will be attended by a sizeable proliferation in the
variety and types of terminal offered for sale.
This will be a consequence partly of the need to accommodate the huge number
of user profiles resident in the consumer sector. 'If the phone is going to
be with you all the time, and be of value to you, it's got to fit your
life-style,' comments Mr Radley, 'and all our life-styles are different.'
Sometimes, as in the case of Swatch's deal to brand-name Nokia equipment,
companies outside the mobile field will try their hand at popularising the
mobile phone.
Further stimulating product variety will be the desire by both incumbent and
incoming operators to differentiate their services.
A current example of this is the One-2-One PCN phone built by Motorola with
styling, including a distinctive 'thumb print' master control button,
contributed by the operator Mercury.
It is clear though, that the convenience, utility and styling of the
portable phone are only one part of the mass market story. Four years ago a
survey in the US revealed that terminal price was a key consideration in the
decision to subscribe to a cellular service.
This is unlikely to be true today in many places. Current and would-be
subscribers are now aware of, and concerned about, the relatively high cost
of actually using a mobile phone. Initiatives such as off-peak, domestic and
volume discounts are designed to address these concerns, and in the UK
service provider The People's Phone will discontinue outgoing calls once a
limit agreed beforehand with the customer is reached.
In the final analysis, though, cheaper calls are needed across the board to
spark a true mass mobile revolution. 'They're definitely required to take
the market to its next level of maturity,' concludes Motorola's Mr Burns.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (8): The 'street wise' take
to telepoint - Paul Taylor examines the progress of public cordless
telephone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By general agreement, the launch of telepoint services in Britain in 1989
was little short of a debacle. But, despite the inauspicious start, the
UK-developed public cordless telephone service is proving a success in some
overseas markets, particularly in south-east Asia.
At the same time operators have found ingenious ways to turn basic telepoint
into a two-way service while equipment manufacturers such as Canada's
Northern Telecom have developed enhanced telepoint services.
Telepoint's brief but chequered history began in the mid-1980s when
Ferranti, the Manchester-based electronics group, developed a 'second
generation' digital cordless telephone technology known as CT2 which allowed
outgoing calls to be made within 100 metres of designated public points - or
base-stations.
In 1988 the British government licensed four groups to provide telepoint
services based on CT2. Unfortunately, the systems were incompatible with
each other, overpriced and poorly marketed in competition with cellular
services.
Even multinational backing was not enough to save three of the services
dubbed Creditphone, Phonepoint and Callpoint. All were abandoned within
three years, having accumulated fewer than 10,000 subscribers between them.
By the end of 1991 the fourth licence held by a consortium called BYPS,
comprising Philips, Barclays and Shell, had been sold to a new owner,
Hutchison Telecom, part of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa group.
At that stage most industry analysts were ready to write off telepoint for
good. But some equipment manufacturers including GPT, the UK-based
telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Motorola of the US and Northern
Telecom, coupled with network operators like Hutchison, have persevered with
the technology.
There is little disagreement that telepoint has taken longer to take off
than originally expected. But along the way some important marketing lessons
have been learned and telepoint services have proved a commercial success in
some markets.
In Hong Kong three operators, Hutchison, Chevalier Telepoint, and most
recently Pacific Telelink, backed by Vodafone, the UK cellular telephone
network operator, have launched successful services over the past 18 months.
Altogether, they have around 55,000 subscribers and are still growing
rapidly.
Telepoint services have also proved popular in Singapore, where the Callzone
service was launched at the start of 1992 by Singapore Telecom and in
Malaysia and Thailand where telepoint services are provided by the national
carriers. At the end of last year Callzone had more than 21,000 subscribers,
while Fonepoint in Thailand connected 5,000 subscribers in its first few
months of operation.
Mr Ken Miles, project manager for GPT Market Systems which supplies
telepoint infrastructure to Chevalier in Hong Kong, attributes the success
of telepoint services in these countries to their 'street culture' and dense
urban populations - both factors which lend themselves to telepoint
services.
'Everybody in Hong Kong either has a mobile phone or a pager,' says Mr
Miles. There are over 800,000 pager users in Hong Kong, many of them aged 18
to 25, and this is the market which has been targeted successfully by the
telepoint operators.
Hong Kong telepoint handsets and services are very cheap but the big
advantage of having both a pager and a telepoint phone is that it enables
the network operator to provide a pseudo two-way service and overcome one of
basic telepoint's main drawbacks - its inability, in standard configuration,
to receive incoming calls.
All three telepoint operators in Hong Kong now provide a 'meet me' service.
This works as follows: Suppose someone wants to reach a telepoint subscriber
with a pager. The pager number is dialled and the system asks the caller to
hold. A message is then sent to the pager asking the owner to dial a pre-set
number. Provided the telepoint subscriber dials the number within 60 seconds
the call is connected. If there is no response from the pager the caller is
put through to a voice message centre.
This system has proved so successful that telepoint operators elsewhere are
now adopting it. In the UK Hutchison's 'Rabbit' service has been testing a
variation of the 'meet me' service using an integrated telephone/pager
handset.
In France where France Telecom's Bi-Bop service was extended from Strasbourg
to Paris in April and signed up 10,000 subscribers in the first month, a
'meet me' service has been adopted together with an alternative system which
also provides pseudo two-way operation. Telecom Finland, which launched its
Pointer telepoint service last November, also began testing a similar
paging-based two-way service earlier this year.
Most industry experts agree that Hong Kong is probably a unique market in
Asia - not least because it is the only one with more than one telepoint
operator. However elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region GPT has sold one
system in Vietnam, had expressions of interest from India and recently
signed an agreement to become one of the main suppliers of telepoint systems
to China.
Earlier this year GPT also won a Pounds 2m contract to provide a complete
telepoint network - including the world's first cordless PABX for the city
of Nigbo in Zhejiang province. In less developed countries like China,
telepoint can provide a cost-effective basic telephone service where
previously there was no service at all.
GPT has also supplied the equipment for Australia's first telepoint service
called 'Talkabout' which was launched in Brisbane in March by Australia
Telecom. Talkabout also achieves two-way operation, though in this case by
introducing a concept called 'neighbourhood telepoint' or 'islands of
cordlessness' where part of city or town is covered by CT2 base stations
linked by a switch.
Each subscriber has a unique number by which he or she can be called. The
system provides subscribers with two-way communications within the area
where they live and with their handset they can also be registered for their
office or for another telepoint network in another city - or even country.
In Canada an upgraded two-way version of the telepoint cordless telephone
specification has been developed by Northern Telecom and adopted as the
country's official cordless phone standard. In January the Canadian
government selected four consortia to build and operate national two-way
telepoint serv ices based on the CT2-plus class 2 standard which allows
subscribers to be reached anywhere on the network, provided that they are
within range of a base station.
The new technology also supports smooth handovers between base stations and
allows handset manufacturers to incorporate indicators which will tell users
whether they are in range of a base station needed to use the handset.
Even in Europe, telepoint is shrugging off its early image of being 'the
poor man's mobile phone' to find limited success in some markets, though
progress is still disappointing.
In the UK Hutchison's re-launched national Rabbit network is now complete
with over 12,000 base stations covering 700 cities and towns and more than
10,000 subscribers. Hutchison has been aggressively promoting the service
and emphasising telepoint as 'the pay-phone in your pocket' rather than as a
direct competitor for cellular. It has cut prices for handsets, home base
stations, calls and monthly subscriptions and set a target of 60,000
subscribers by the end of 1994.
In addition, new telepoint services have been introduced successfully in
Holland and Finland and a trial is under way in Belgium.
However, there have been setbacks elsewhere. The Japanese Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications has put back its plans for introducing its telepoint
service until 1995 and in Germany Deutsche Telekom has abandoned plans for a
full commercial version of its Birdie service. Despite this, some important
lessons have been learned from the early disastrous telepoint experience in
the UK. Among these, analysts now agree that too many operators were
licensed and the service was mistakenly marketed as a competitor to cellular
instead of addressing a completely different segment of the market.
In addition, the three UK networks began with inadequate infrastructure in
place and handsets which were too expensive, working on incompatible
proprietary systems which caused customer confusion.
Today's telepoint operators have addressed most of these shortcomings and
have begun to extend the concept of cordless communications from the home
into the street and now the office where new cordless systems based on CT2
technology are beginning to appear.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (5): Teleworking
buzzwords
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Teleworking is most simply defined as 'working at a distance'. Teleworkers
do the work at a physical distance from the person or organisation employing
him or her. Teleworking organisations (as opposed to teleworking
individuals) process information for a remote client, usually as a third
party.
Homeworking, telecommuting, and remote working are all terms used to
describe various ways of teleworking. In BT's definition, the work
undertaken by teleworkers is generally electronic processing of information,
with results communicated to the employer by a telecommunications link.
Hot-desking is the use of one desk (and its technology) by a succession of
different workers. The employer provides a desk in permanent premises: the
territory belongs to no one individual worker, but is used by people who go
into the premises occasionally. A nomadic desk is remote access (often via a
laptop computer from wherever the worker happens to be).
The telecottage or telecentre is a local centre, open to anyone who needs
the service, providing PC, printer, fax, telephone and other equipment.
Funding comes from various sources, local and national, and can even come
from large corporations whose outworkers use the facilities.
Telexecutive is a word (originated by Francis Kinsman) used to describe a
highly qualified worker, probably part-time, whose flexible working pattern
might involve hot desking, homeworking and telecentre working.
Corporate telecommuting provides a formal framework for an organisation's
professional employees to work at home as appropriate.
Outsourcing describes the use of outside, possibly remote services to
replace those of in-house employees. The organisational model is to have
core workers responsible for key activities, who buy in outside resources as
and when they need them from peripheral resources (such as consultants) or
other outworkers.
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Networking) allows high-speed data
transmission on lines that can accommodate voice, image, computer data,
video and graphics.
Once jokingly referred to as an Innovation Subscribers Don't Need, or It
Still Does Nothing, there are now real applications which justify its use,
such as video-conferencing.
For the home or office user, a single pair of wires can serve phone, fax
modem, all on the same line, with incoming call differentiation, calling
line identity, and connection within milliseconds.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Time may resolve data
enigma - Paul Taylor considers the prospects for a market that has so far
failed to live up to expectations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE THE growth in mobile voice telephony has at times been spectacular,
the market for mobile data remains something of an enigma. Everyone agrees
it will be huge one day, but so far it has stubbornly refused to live up to
early expectations.
As a result, most mobile data operators have been scaling back their
subscriber projections, and in some cases their investments.
The latest casualty in the UK has been Hutchison Mobile Data which recently
ceased 'actively marketing' its fledgling dedicated data service and now
plans to offer mobile data services on its Microtel digital personal com-
munications network, which is expected to begin operations next April.
the shortfall between expectations and reality may be that most services are
still in their infancy. Another reason may be that customers are confused by
the bewildering array of delivery systems and equipment.
Mobile data ranges from one-way pager traffic and short alert messages to
more complex two-way data exchange and electronic mail. Excluding pager
traffic, mobile data services are offered in the UK by Vodafone and Cellnet,
the two cellular operators, surviving dedicated mobile data network
operators such as Ram Mobile Data, Cognito and Vodafone's Paknet, specialist
network operators such as Securicor Datatrak, and over private and public
access mobile radio networks including National Band Three - all using
incompatible standards and equipment.
Unlike the cellular telephone network operators, who have attracted more
than 7m sub- scribers for their voice services in western Europe alone, the
demand for data services has been disappointing.
But despite being characterised as the Cinderella of mobile services, data
transmission has several key advantages over voice telephony. In particular,
data transmissions take up much less air time than voice communications. For
example, a 35-word exchange between a dispatcher and a vehicle driver takes
more than 21 seconds when spoken but just 1.3 seconds even at the very slow
data exchange rate of 1,200 bps (bits per second).
Data is generally cheaper, quicker and more accurate than voice and while
pagers and cellular phones play an important role in communicating short
messages, they have limitations when it comes to transmitting complex or
large volumes of information.
Typical applications for mobile data involve transferring information to and
from portable computers or retrieving information from mobile data terminals
such as meter readers or updating information on the office computer
systems.
Mobile data can provide a corporate salesforce with up-to-date customer
information or keep track of emergency services, like truck fleets or
railway wagons. Other potential users in the future include the owners of a
new generation of hand-held devices called 'personal digital assistants'
such as Apple's recently unveiled Newton
The case for digital or dedicated data transmission services is, on the face
of it, a strong one. Generally, transmitting data over a non-dedicated
service means sacrificing transmission quality, coverage or compromising in
other areas. Transmitting data reliably over an analogue cellular system is
considerably more difficult than over the public switched telephone network.
Nevertheless, research shows that many customers require a combination of
voice and data communications. One solution is to build the specialist
electronics into dedicated equipment or use a special cellular modem.
For example, Vodafone's Mobile Data Service uses a special cellular data
link control modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free
data over its cellular network which also provides automatic standards
conversion.
Another option is to use a public access mobile radio service such as
National Band Three in the UK, which is now owned by Geotek Industries of
the US and has 35,000 subscribers according to Mr Andrew Robb, its managing
director. Using a simple modem mobile data - both status data and so-called
freeform data - is currently free on National Band Three and therefore
provides a flexible and very cost-effective option for users wishing to mix
voice and data. 'We probably have more data subscribers than Vodafone,' says
Mr Robb.
Mr Callum Mackie, who runs Protocall Ventures, an independent specialist in
trunked moble radio networks, argues that PAMR offers the best available
combination of voice and data. Protocall can provide a complete package of
terminals, software and network services enabling a fleet controller to send
and receive voice and data transactions over the airwaves using a PC running
a Windows-based fleet management and communications programme.
For those disinclined to use modems, another alternative is to wait for
digital cellular telephones based on the pan-European GSM or PCN standards.
Vodafone has already demonstrated a feature called the short message service
centre which enables messages of up to 160 characters to be sent to a GSM
handset and displayed on its LCD screen.
However, the GSM specification also includes a facility which will
eventually allow any terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or
a notebook computer - to be plugged directly into the handset.
This could bring the GSM phone into more direct competition with the
dedicated packet-switched mobile data networks which were licensed in the UK
in October 1991. Five 25-year licences were awarded to Cognito, DMC,
Hutchison Mobile Data, Motorola and Ram Mobile Data.
But of these original licence-holders DMC and Motorola, which has invested
heavily in the Ardis data service in the US, a joint venture with IBM, did
not take up their licences. Paknet, now owned by Vodafone, was subsequently
awarded a mobile licence in addition to its existing fixed data licence.
Cognito was closed after the sale of its parent, Dowty Group, last year, but
was relaunched last autumn following its acquisition by Sonnaire, a Swiss
investment company. Cognito's service provides customers with a mobile
two-way text messaging system using a hand-held communicator called a
Messenger which has a small screen and keyboard and operates via the group's
nationwide data network.
Hutchison based its nationwide data network on Motorola's RD-LAP technology,
which has proved less successful than Ericsson's rival Mobitex system. It
has recently stopped promoting the network, which had no commercial
subscribers.
However, Ram Mobile Data, a joint venture involving US-based Ram
Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues, is
using the Mobitex system which is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard
in Europe in the absence of an official standard from the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is not now expected before
1996 at the earliest. So far, Ericsson has won contracts in connection with
seven of the 10 European mobile data licences awarded.
Ram has also taken a lead in developing applications software for the mobile
data market - seen by many as the key to future growth. Mr John Jarvis,
Ram's chief executive in the UK, says the group is encouraging the
development of new vertical and horizontal applications, and the migration
of existing applications running on private data networks.
Already, more than 100 application projects are in trials with Ram. Among
the users of Ram network in the UK are the Next retail chain which uses the
service to speed up credit card transactions, reduce fraud and improve
customer service and DSL, a national maintenance organisation which use the
data network to provide field engineers with far more accurate and timely
customer details while they are on the road. The system also enables the
control staff more accurately to track its engineers and improve the overall
management of its fleet.
Working with Microsoft, the US software group, Ram has also introduced a
personal computer-based electronic mail package which allows new and
existing users of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows to send an receive
E-mail messages from the field via a Mobitex radio modem without connecting
to a telephone line.
Even though mobile data has had a sluggish start and suffered a number of
significant setbacks, most analysts still expect dramatic growth in the
mobile data market over the next five years because, as Insight Research, a
New Jersey-based research organisation notes in a recent report, 'the
technology solves a real problem: it allows people to transmit and receive
information where they find it most convenient.'
Insight predicts that advances in digital electronics and battery and
display technologies, coupled with liberalised regulatory environments will
result in the 1990s in 'a new era in wire-less wide-area communications,'
with the total global market for equipment of Dollars 2.4bn in 1993 growing
to Dollars 5.3bn in 1998.
The US researchers also predict that the world market for wide-area data
services will grow from Dollars 3.6bn this year to Dollars 9.2bn in five
years' time, a 20.7 per cent compound annual growth rate.
Eventual market size estimates vary wildly but Arthur D. Little has
identified 3.8m potential users for wire-less data services in the US within
the next decade and Booz Allen Hamilton expects the market to be even bigger
with between 12m and 15m users by the turn of the century. Meanwhile, PA
Consulting has predicted that there will be 2m users of two-way mobile data
in the UK by the end of the decade.
By then it should be clear which mobile data technologies have matured and
survived the inevitable shake-out.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (7): Straws in the wind on
cellular - Cellnet, Vodafone and others will soon have to 'compete for real'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
IT IS the boast of Vodafone and Cellnet, which hitherto carved up virtually
all the UK's cellular business between them, that they have never raised a
tariff.
With their margins stratospheric, it is an idle boast. Vodafone last year
made an operating profit equivalent to 46 per cent of sales. Cellnet did
less well, but its margins are still remarkable. For those concerned about
collusion in duopolies, the case for a hard look at the cellular market by
the Office of Fair Trading may be overwhelming.
A reference to the OFT is nonetheless highly unlikely in the near future,
for two reasons. First, mobile phone users seem to enjoy paying through the
nose. At least, they make few protests. Low rates of migration from the
operators' high to low-usage tariffs, introduced last year, do not indicate
heightened sensitivity among existing users. With the market set for another
record year, with around 400,000 net new connections between Cellnet and
Vodafone, operators can continue to make a healthy living from those
prepared to pay current rates.
tion is on the way. The existing operators seem almost relieved at the
prospect. As Mr Gerry Whent said of Mercury One-2-One shortly before the
launch of its PCN network in the south-east: 'We need you as competition,
otherwise we will get regulated.' He immediately added, of course, that he
expected the mobile business to rise overall as a result, and Vodafone to
benefit thereby.
It is too soon to gauge the likely impact of One-2-One, but one thing is
clear: low prices, likely to promote a mobile consumer boom, are not on the
near horizon.
One-2-One will charge only two-thirds of the price levied by its two rivals
for peak rate calls made on its PCN network. But at 16p a minute at peak
rate, with an initial connection charge of Pounds 20 and a monthly
subscription of the same amount, it is still anything but cheap. And that is
after the cost of the handset itself, which comes out at about Pounds 250.
To match Vodafone's Lowcall and Cellnet's Lifetime services, One-2-One also
has a special tariff for low users. But that, again, is still beyond the
reach of most consumer pockets, with a monthly subscription of Pounds 12.50
and a peak-rate call charge of 25p a minute.
Vodafone and Cellnet have not been slow to respond. Vodafone has reduced its
London tariff to bring it in line with its national tariff - a 25 per cent
cut from 33p a minute to 25p at peak rate. It has also announced lower
charges for its new MetroDigital service to be launched next month, using a
digital network piggy-backing on its GSM network. The MetroDigital rate for
daytime local calls will be 20p a minute. Off-peak calls will be priced at
10p a minute.
Cellnet has gone further still, launching a new 'Citytime' tariff on its
existing analogue network, cutting call prices for subscribers within the
M25 area by up to 39 per cent. From next month, the daytime 'Citytime'
tariff for calls made within the area will be 20p a minute, but at the
expense of a far higher price than present - 50p a minute - for calls made
outside the M25 zone. All off-peak calls will be priced at 10p a minute.
These reductions are probably the minimum the older operators could have got
away with, given One-2-One's catchment area and the fact that about a
quarter of all mobile calls are made within the M25.
Of course, further cuts are on the cards if Mercury comes remotely close to
realising the goal of Mr Richard Goswell, its managing director, for 1m
customers. They might also come if Hutchison's 'Rabbit' telepoint service,
which is now complete, looked like creaming off a significant slice of the
'cheaper' business market - something it has failed to do so far, its price
providing insufficient compensation for its inability to receive incoming
calls, and the restriction of being able to make outgoing calls only in
places with a Rabbit sign.
There is a further straw in the wind: the growing reluctance of the
operators to sell their wares through service providers, who act as
retailers of their 'wholesale' tariffs, creaming off a profit on the way.
One-2-One has all but shut out the service providers - much to their chagrin
 -and will deal directly with most of its customers. Cellnet and Vodafone
are still bound to use service providers by the terms of their licences; but
these terms are subject to review at the end of the year, and it is likely
that one or both of them will undertake direct selling of their own, albeit
without seeking to undermine the service providers at the outset.
'The industry is moving towards more personalised communications and
marketing,' says Mr Dean Eyres, an analyst with Dataquest, the consultancy
company. 'Originally it was just sales, no marketing. Operators realise that
the higher margin business is going, and they have to start competing for
real.'
As yet, they have barely started 'competing for real'. It is not just a
question of whether an unregulated three-cornered market proves more
cost-conscious than the existing regime. There is also the question of how
to market such a complex array of tariffs - now some 10 in all - between the
three operators.
Mr Whent does not regard that number as a problem. 'It is far fewer than in
life insurance,' he claims. So wait for the mobile door-to-do salesman
around the corner.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (6): Swedish model catches
eye of radiopage operators - Andrew Adonis reports on a contrast in trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
IN SINGAPORE and Hong Kong, pagers are as much fashion accessories as means
of communication. You see them, brightly coloured, hanging from the hips of
teenagers 'about town' - some of them not even connected to a network.
Twelve to 20-year-olds are a target market for paging operators in cities in
the Asia-Pacific region, appealing to youth on trendiness and their parents
as a means of locating and retrieving their offspring. According to CIT
Research, the London communications consultancy, Singapore has around
500,000 paging subscribers, Hong Kong 700,000, Taiwan 1.2m, South Korea 1.5m
and Japan 6.5m.
The contrast with the UK, where paging is seen as a poor, black-coated
relation of the glamorous mobile telephone, could not be more stark. The
radio pager may have got there first, providing personal communications for
hospitals, police forces, fire brigades and the like decades before the
first carphone, but that upstart has swept all before it in profile and
profits.
Industry sources give a UK paging population of about 744,000, projected to
grow at between 5 and 10 per cent a year for the next decade. However, CIT
thinks an annual growth rate of only up to 2 per cent is feasible between
now and 2000, by when it expects the cellular telephone population to have
reached 5m, treble the current number.
CIT believes growth will be stronger on the continent, but starting from a
lower base. By 2000 it projects France with 520,000 subscribers and Germany
with 825,000. By contrast, the number of Asia-Pacific pagers is expected to
double by 2002, reaching 25m users - 11m of them in Japan.
'One of the most important drivers to the paging market in the Asia-Pacific
is its widespread acceptance outside the traditional business market,' says
Mr Robin Meakin, a CIT analyst.
Mass market appeal seems to be more important than competition: in the UK
five national networks are fighting it out, while some of the largest
markets - including Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea - are monopolies of
the state telecommunications operator.
Mr Meakin is sceptical as to whether paging will ever catch on as a consumer
good in Europe. He is also doubtful that there is a large market for
pan-European paging, pointing to the 'disappointing' take-up of Euromessage,
which allows roaming between five countries, and the low usage of
Eurosignal's roaming service option between Germany, France and Switzerland.
On the potential for a European mass market, all eyes are turning to Sweden,
where Telia Mobiltel, an offshoot of the state telecommunications operator
Televerket, is pioneering a new consumer service. It has two key elements:
agreements with distributors and retailers to sell no-frills numeric pagers
through high street outlets and mail order, complete with access number and
network connection; and a charging structure which places the costs on the
caller per call, not a monthly subscriber fee.
Between 9am and 4pm the calling charge is SKr6 (about 50p); at other times,
and all day at weekends, it is SKr1.5 (12p). The price differential with
mobile phones is dramatic, and the new package appears to be catching on.
Since April more than 15,000 'private' pagers have been sold, and supplies
are sold out. Business usage has also increased on the back of the consumer
advertising, with subscriber numbers to the business network at an all-time
high at the end of June.
'In cellular phones, the buyer seeks the seller: with pagers the seller
needs to seek the buyer,' says Mr Jan Holmgren, marketing manager for TM's
paging service, an ex-Motorola executive who masterminded the consumer
launch. TM commissioned market research showing a potential paging market of
1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population. 'The critical factor is that it should
be simple to buy and simple to sell. Distribution is the key, although the
charging structure has clearly made it more attractive to the consumer.'
Mr Holmgren stresses the price differential with mobile phones. 'The
activity in cellular is starting to have a pull-through effect with paging,
as people are finding out how high is the ongoing cost of cellular,' he
says.
The UK has five radiopaging network operators - Aircall Communications, BT
Mobile Communications, Vodapage, Hutchison Paging and Mercury Paging (which
bought Intercity Paging last year). BT has about 55 per cent of the market;
Vodapage and Mercury about 15 per cent each.
Monthly service charges are still the norm for all five. Efforts have been
made to simplify the service, with the purchase of pagers now accepted and a
streamlining of the charging structure. Hutchison has only one zone for the
whole country. Vodapage and Mercury have three. BT has six, its tariffs
guide resembling a railway timetable.
At the moment, pagers divide into three broad categories:
the simplest and cheapest is the tone-only radiopager, which bleeps to alert
its owner that someone wants to get in touch with him or her. BT's option
costs Pounds 10 a month to rent and use for one zone.
the numeric radiopager uses a small screen to display numbers - the phone
number of the person who wants you to call them, or a coded message. It
costs Pounds 18.50 a month to rent and use with a bureau service from BT
(one zone).
the alphanumeric radiopager, which has a small screen showing text and
numbers, typically up to about 400 characters though some display more. With
a bureau service this costs Pounds 28 a month to rent and use from BT.
All five operators are considering the 'Swedish option', though none has yet
made a public move. 'With the current tariffing package we don't think it is
worth going for the consumer market,' says Ms Suzanne Stevenson, paging
business manager at BT Mobile. 'It might be if you pay per call, but I don't
think that changing the colour of pagers is going to be enough by itself.'
That is a dig at Hutchison, which is taking a first tentative step into the
consumer market with brightly coloured pagers for sale in Dixons at Marble
Arch, London. Its Philips-made message pagers are retailing for Pounds 99
(including first month's subscription); its numeric pagers for Pounds 79;
and its tone pagers for Pounds 49 with a voice messaging service.
'We have taken an important first step,' says Mr Nigel Salomon, Hutchison
Paging's marketing director. 'Our strategy is to take the world's best-kept
secret and tell people about it.'
Hutchison is also pressing ahead with value-added products, where it is
anxious to discard the word 'paging' altogether. It recently launched
'Pulse', a 'pocketable financial information database'. Apart from a
standard database providing an overview of financial markets, Pulse offers
foreign exchange, various indices, equities and metals. It even bleeps when
prices or indices pass pre-set levels.
Horse racing results paging services are widely available in Hong Kong.
Alas, the last such service has wound up in the UK, and the Swedish model
appears to set little store by them.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (4): Room with a
zoom-in view - Selling from home - Putting a back-room operation up front
has worked for Unipart, a lap-top gives each home-based sales person a clear
set of goals
</HEADLINE>

UNIPART started a radical experiment in teleworking in 1991 when the
recession was making most companies cautious about trying new technology.
Chairman John Neill took a long-term view of how to get a strategic
advantage, and challenged his managers to find a new way of working that
would concentrate on customer support, writes Claire Gooding.
What happened is described by Stan Thompson, senior sales manager. 'They saw
the chance to take a back-of-house resource and to put it out up front. That
meant losing two layers of management, and it put us in tune with what was
happening.' The structure of regional and divisional managers was replaced
with a network of 31 home-based territory managers reporting straight to the
centre, working flexible hours but within a planned sales programme.
The computer system developed with the sales and marketing consultants Softa
has resulted in a two-way traffic of information. The system gives an
accurate, postcode-driven positioning of each customer in the territory.
'The system focuses on areas of opportunity,' explains Thompson. 'We can
assess the market penetration of product based on 10 key products, which
represent 75 per cent of turnover. That means we can give customers a fix on
what is selling and take advantage of specific market opportunities.'
All the managers are equipped with laptop computer and telecommunications
equipment connected to a central mainframe. Each individual has a business
plan and logs on every morning to be reminded of current goals.
Campbell Young, one of the business development managers, is based in
Witney. His office is a room above the garage attached to his three-bedroom
bungalow, where he spends on average nine hours a week. He logs onto his
Dell 325 laptop every morning to pick up messages. I can take a look at
sales territory and people, schedules, or the sales and marketing plan. I
can look at the figures and show my own performance against target,
comparing it with the rest of the UK.'
Young has been with Unipart seven years, but is new to computers and
teleworking. 'The system tells me on a daily basis what I need to do. For
instance, I might need to sell a certain amount of steering and suspension
before Wednesday to meet target. It focuses in on where the real
opportunities are.'
He has to think hard about any disadvantages. 'I don't miss the office. Any
good sales idea gets spread by e-mail or phone. You have to see it as a
tool, concentrate on your job. It's people that sell things, not computers.'
Unipart spent Pounds 120,000 on computer equipment for use in the field, but
just as important was the assessment of the teleworkers. 'The software and
the supplier are very important. So was the profile of the people we
employ,' says Thompson.
The investment of Pounds 100,000 with Softa was easily justifiable according
to Neill. In announcing Unipart's results in February 1993 - sales were up
from Pounds 556.7m to Pounds 661.4m in 1992, with profits up Pounds 4.4m -
he attributed success to 'the approach we have taken in involving and
motivating staff.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (3): Roses around
the door and a fax on the Welsh dresser - Analysis / 'Teleworking' and the
'telecottage' sound appealing and can be productive.  Claire Gooding
examines the issues facing employers and teleworkers who want to benefit
from this new way of working
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DISTANCE is no object for productive teleworkers, be they in a
high-technology telecottage, or cosy at home. It's a pleasure to get up in
the morning without having to think about what to wear for the office. To
spend less time waiting for trains or grinding gears and teeth in a traffic
jam makes sense on a personal level but also has wider environmental
benefits.
It is nearly 20 years since computer companies started talking about the
benefits of teleworking. IT companies were particularly well-suited to
exploiting the technology of the time. The FI Group, founded as F
International, built up its network of programmers initially from women
programmers working from home.
As the technology developed, computer companies such as Digital Equipment
and IBM invested in offices adapted to 'hot desking', a term used to
describe the sharing of one desk space by two or more people who work
largely from home and go into the office occasionally.
Terrorist attacks on city centres provide another powerful incentive for
'outworking.' Digital was up and working within days after its headquarters
was gutted by fire in 1990 - a rapid recovery which it attributes to its
flexible working patterns, including teleworking.
In the past 10 years PCs have become more affordable and the software
running on them easier to use. Where a local support team was once a
necessity, people can now work with 'sitalone' software: software so
self-explanatory that it needs no support or explanation such as on a
Macintosh or under PC Windows.
On the telecommunications front, there is ISDN - Integrated Services Digital
Network - which can support such applications as videophones, split signals
(serving fax, voice, modem and so on, on one line) and high-speed data
transmission. ISDN telephone lines are beginning to come into service and in
parts of Scotland are already part of the telework culture. Companies such
as Jaguar Communications of St Albans specialise in providing modems and
plug-in ISDN cards for connecting PCs.
Telemessaging and electronic mail (e-mail) systems such as British Telecom's
Mailbox and the Compulink's Cix remove the constraints of time-barriers.
Workers using such mail systems can choose their own working times.
Chris Moller of the Home Office Partnership points out that there are
several ways of working at home with PCs, modems and fax.
'There are three categories: in the first are employees with formal support
for working at home; self-motivated, educated people for whom the job itself
is the reward. In the second category are people involved with repetitive,
humdrum tasks, such as telesales. Teleworking is less practical for them,
partly because it is only the social contact that makes the job bearable.
'The third category is of specialists, largely freelance, doing such jobs as
translating. In effect they are free-standing: the work finds them.'
Working at home demands the skillswith which any freelance is familiar, and
computer skills come low on the list. The first is self-discipline and the
second comes under 'marketing.'
The National Teleworking Advisory Council (NTAC) is a forum set up to help
individuals and organisations exploring teleworking, founded by the
Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.
'We're evolving a code of practice, a guide for employees and employers
alike,' says chairman Peter Monson.
Most non-technical teleworkers, he points out, need help with the basics of
equipping themselves, such as printer interfaces, maintenance agreements,
telemessage systems, even voltage supply.
Sue Blacker, of the Devon and Cornwall Development Co in Lostwithiel,
Cornwall, is another NTAC member with a City of London background whose
concerns range from the technical (such as scanners versus modems), to the
management issues of contracts, pay, and promotion. She agrees that
marketing is a difficulty.
'If you give your address as Rose Cottage, it sounds as though you're not up
to the job. Why should an employer take the risk if there's a building full
of people on the spot who can do it? There are a lot of psychological
problems to overcome.'
Qualifications are one way for the isolated teleworker to convince agency or
employer that work carried out at arm's length can be relied on. Although
work on National Vocational Qualifications is under way, it does not remove
all the problems, one of which, according to Barney Gibbens, head of the
Information Technology Training Organisation (ITITO), is the difficulty of
assessing remote trainees.
'We hope there will be assessment centres all over the country, not just set
up by colleges, but by large employers, so trainees can visit local
centres,' he says.
Organisation and Technology Research's much-quoted report in 1991 took the
view that teleworking offered benefits to employees, but not necessarily
financial.
The telecottage movement stresses that it is promoting rural work at urban
rates - not second-class workers, paid at a lower rate.
There is evidence of a significant change of attitude in recent years.
Selling is one well-paid activity that seems to work well at long distance.
Unipart is not alone in devolving its sales to home-based workers. Sun
Alliance's Adam project, involving 27 home workers, and Marion Merrell Dow,
with 88 home-based sales and regional managers, both use the Oxygen system
for remote selling.
Many companies interviewed for this survey reported a sympathetic, rather
than a sceptical attitude to their home base. 'Not so long ago,' said one,
'people on the phone would think worse of you if they could hear the dog
barking or the children yelling in the background. Now they say, lucky you,
to be able to work at home.'
Francis Kinsman, futurist and writer of The Telecommuters, is a great source
of entertaining statistics on teleworking, which he sees as part of a wider
movement towards flexible work patterns. In his address to the recent
European Conference on Distance Working, he quoted the Henley Centre for
Forecasting's estimate that 15 per cent of work in the UK will be performed
remotely by 1995.
In Kinsman's opinion, the UK is well-placed to take advantage of this
radical change in work patterns. 'The Highlands and Islands and the Grampian
regions, because of ISDN, are aggressively looking to steal Pounds 100,000
worth of financially-based jobs from the south-east over the next decade.'
The real emphasis, he said, should be on flexible working and the networked
organisation, a model being explored by Tesco, Berkshire County Council,
Mercury, and Digital Equipment.
According to Kinsman, the 21st century might well become the era of the
telescab, with sophisticated information skills coming cheaply from an
international marketplace that includes the Philippines, Malaysia, and
China.
'The danger is that if we can do it, others can. London Underground tried
nine different UK software houses for its new timing system and settled for
a developer in Bombay at 40 per cent of the cost. There's a lesson there.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (4): Drive for the mass
consumer market - Personal Communications Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS network operators throughout the world will be watching
developments in the UK closely this autumn as the first of a new generation
of low-cost digital mobile telephone services are launched.
The advent of Personal Communications Network services marks a watershed in
the development of high-capacity sophisticated mobile telecommunications
using pocket-sized handsets and targeted at domestic customers and small
business users.
Their arrival promises customers an expanding choice of feature-rich
services and significantly greater competition between cellular network
operators.
PCNs - touted by their advocates as the future shape of mobile telephony -
are a high capacity derivative of the pan-European GSM digital cellular
standard employing smaller-sized cells and higher frequencies. Unlike the
high powered GSM which was principally designed for use in cars, PCN has
been designed from the outset to work with small, lightweight, low-power
handsets carried in people's pockets.
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute produced the DCS-1800
PCN specification in 1991. Because PCNs operate at 1800 MHz, double the
frequency of GSM, they have a much higher capacity which enables PCN
operators to set call charges which are much more directly competitive with
the hard-wired networks run by the public telephone operators.
However, the drawback is that using high frequency signals with a relatively
short range means that double the number of base stations are required and
the cost of building a network to reach 90 per cent of the population is
around Pounds 1bn.
In the UK, where the PCN concept was born, the government awarded PCN
licences to three international consortia at the end of 1989. However, since
then forecasts of the number of cellular subscribers by the end of the
century have been scaled back, forcing many of the PCN licence participants
to reassess their involvement.
As a result, there has been a wave of stake sales and mergers and one of the
three original PCN licences has been handed back. The two remaining licences
are held by Mercury One-2-One, formally called Mercury Personal
Communications, which is a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and US
West, and Hutchison Microtel, part of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa
group.
Hutchison Microtel has been looking for a partner to share the costs of
building its PCN service which is due to be launched in April next year. So
far, Hutchison is believed to have spent more than Pounds 300m developing
the service, to be targeted initially at the business and small business
sector.
Mercury One-2-One was due to be launched in the summer but a number of
technical problems emerged during a 'Beta' field test of the system so the
launch date has been pushed back. Initially the service will be limited to
the London area bounded by the M25, but it is due to expand throughout the
south-east to reach a quarter of the UK population by the middle of next
year.
The big challenge for the new digital network operators will be whether they
can broaden the customer base for mobile telephony to reach the mass
consumer market. Existing analogue cellular telephone services in the UK and
elsewhere, though highly successful, have mostly appealed to business
customers because of their relatively high charges.
Recently both Vodafone and Cellnet in the UK have introduced new tariff
structures designed to appeal more to low call volume customers. However,
these still fall short of offering consumers a realistic alternative to
basic 'fixed-wire' telephone services for only a modest premium.
Mr Richard Goswell, managing director of Mercury One-2-One, says its
research shows that 'if you get the prices right the consumer market is
definitely interested'. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that until handset
prices fall from their initial level of Pounds 250 to Pounds 300, the
service is unlikely to reach a mass consumer audience. 'There will be lot of
sales to small businesses and the consumer market will develop over time,'
he predicts.
But by the turn of the century he believes PCN handsets will be sold in
plastic 'blister packs' by high street electrical stores and will provide a
real, feature-rich alternative to the domestic hard wired telephone. In the
interim he expects PCN handsets to start appearing as a second telephone,
providing the additional advantage of mobility.
Mercury has set two standard tariffs, one called BusinessCall targeted at
higher volume business customers and the other called PersonalCall for small
businesses and low call volume individual customers. Both tariffs offer
savings of between 30 and 40 per cent over the equivalent tariffs on
Vodafone and Cellnet's existing national analogue tariffs.
In addition to more aggressive pricing, Mercury is betting that it will
attract customers to its PCN service by including some sophisticated
features, such as an integrated 'voice mail' answerphone service, call
barring, call divert and call waiting facilities.
Like GSM handsets, PCN telephones are operated using a smartcard which
contains customer billing and other information. This means handsets can be
shared and customers can make calls from any handset and be billed at home.
Links with GSM networks will allow the smartcard to be used in any other
country which has GSM or PCN.
However Mr Goswell emphasises: 'There is nothing magical about PCN.' It is
an approach to marketing rather than the technology which makes it
different, he says.
One of the prime motivations of the UK government in licensing PCN operators
was to promote competition. Vodafone and Cellnet have both cut tariffs
inside the M25 to counter the impact of Mercury One-2-One. Vodafone will
also be launching its own version of a digital personal communications
service called MetroDigital early next month.
MetroDigital, a microcellular regional cellular service previously called
MCN, is based on Vodafone's existing EuroDigital GSM network and will
provide a low-cost urban-based service, initially in south-east England.
Like PCNs, the service is aimed at consumers and small businesses. But
unlike PCNs, it will operate at the same 900MHz frequency as GSM and will
use the same handsets as the GSM network which are expected to cost around
Pounds 400 initially.
MetroDigital's pricing struc- ture emphasises the 'local' nature of the
service. Local calls will cost 20p and national calls 25p a minute, but
MetroDigital subscribers who make calls from rural areas via the GSM network
will have to pay a punitive rate of 65p a minute. All calls off-peak will
cost just 10p a minute.
By the end of next year Vodafone plans to cover all towns with a population
of 50,000 or more and in the interim MetroDigital customers will be able to
receive calls anywhere in the UK covered by Vodafone's GSM service.
Additional competition, at least in the business and corporate markets,
could come from low cost regional varieties of GSM itself. Cellnet plans to
introduce what it calls Local System for Mobile communications (LSM)
regional services in January next year, ahead of the launch of its national
GSM network. The LSM service will be available in an extended London region,
as well as Leeds, Birmingham and Manchester.
In Europe, only Germany has followed Britain's lead and licensed a national
PCN opera- tor. The E-Plus consortium plans to launch its PCN service in
Berlin and Leipzig early next year. However, PCNs are also being studied in
Spain, Italy throughout Scandinavia and in Switzerland. But PCN has stalled
in France - blamed by some on the 'not invented here' syndrome. Outside
Europe, Thailand has licensed a PCN and Australia is in the middle of
consultations.
However in the world's largest mobile telephony market, the US, where PCN
services are known as Personal Communications Services, their introduction
is still dogged by debate and the lack of any agreed standards. The Federal
Communications Commission has issued over 150 licences for experimental PCS
systems - often using different and incompatible technologies.
The complicated regulatory process in the US and a wrangle over radio
spectrum threaten to delay the introduction of commercial PCSs until the
second half of the decade - a delay which analysts say could cost the US
economy billions of dollars and would leave the US trailing Europe and the
UK in particular.
Over the next few months British consumers will have the first opportunity
to pass judgment on the PCN concept and whether it does indeed point the way
towards mass mobile telecommunications.
Mercury One-2-One's Mr Goswell says: 'I believe there is the opportunity in
the UK to turn this market into something much larger than it has been.' He
argues that consumers are willing to pay a premium for mobility or 'extended
cordlessness' but not as much as has been demanded to date.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (1): First phase of
the flexibility revolution - Comment / Flexible working, using computer
technology, is a peripheral concern for many suppliers and users, but its
wider implications have to be taken seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER technology is making 'flexible' working possible; the rapidly
changing demands of today's business environment may make it increasingly
necessary. It does not follow, however, that companies will find flexible
operation an easy discipline to implement - or that all staff will find it a
congenial way of working.
The London-based consultancy Ovum says that flexible work is 'any work
carried out using a computer, outside company-owned premises by the
company's employees.'
The list includes field workers in sales, maintenance, inspection and
delivery, but also professionals working at home and specialists seeking a
quieter, more motivating environment.
By this definition there were just over half a million 'flexible' workers in
the US and Europe at the beginning of this year.
So far, then, flexible working is a mere drop in the employment ocean. But
the companies pioneering flexible working policies are among the world's
largest and most innovative - Boeing, Mercedes, ICI, BT and Unilever among
them - suggesting that the dribble could grow to a flood by the turn of the
century.
This is certainly the dream of information technologists looking at the ways
in which people interact with computers. They see the growth of interest in
multimedia - the convergence of computing, video and wireless technologies -
as an essential precursor of a time when an executive's only link with the
office will be an electronic umbilical cord; when handwritten memos complete
with voice annotations and video clips will fill the ether; and when
newspapers will be delivered as a self-selected collection of electronic
'clippings' to a monitor screen.
This issue of Software at Work does not deal with anything so futuristic. It
is concerned more with the first phase of the flexible working revolution.
At one end of the spectrum there are the people entrusted to work from home
using personal computers.
Pioneers here include computer companies, who have a head start in the
technology. Digital Equipment, for example, encourages its staff to be
flexible in the way they work; some 20 per cent of its employees in the UK
have computer equipment at home. Elsewhere in the organisation there have
been attempts to bring the home to the workplace. In Stockholm, Sweden, for
example, Digital employees have designed their workplace around the themes
of the garden, the golf course, the beach and the archipelago. At the push
of a button, computers emerge from the ceiling to levels which make it
possible to work standing, sitting or even lying down.
AT the other end of the spectrum there are rural communities of flexible
workers trained to the same level of competence as their urban equivalents
and using electronics to give them access to the same resources.
This development is all quite small-scale at present. Flexible working is
being actively promoted by fixed and mobile telecommunications network
operators who see a potentially substantial new source of revenue.
The Connected Community project, recently launched by BT, Apple Computer,
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission is
studing the potential benefits of technology in small towns and villages.
Success depends on persuading large corporations to use such remote
resources. Nevertheless, the wider implications of moves towards flexible
working have to be taken seriously.
The development of 'personal digital assistants' and 'personal
communicators' - pocket-sized computers capable of sending and receiving
messages - reflects new interest in mobile computing. Researchers are
already working on the psychology problems that people are likely to face
when working alone. Office workers enjoy more than just the banter and
comradeship of their colleagues; they receive valuable, if covert, clues
which alert them to the state of business - the 'buzz' in a foreign exchange
dealing room as interest rates change, for example.
Some companies will look at flexible working as a way of saving money.
Certainly 'hot desking,' where employees have no permanent desk but use
common facilities in the office and personal computers at home, can lead to
substantial saving in real estate. Digital's most successful 'Office of the
Future' experiment has led to 30 per cent increases in personal productivity
and space-savings of 40 per cent.
But Ovum, which has just completed a study* of flexible working, warns that
costs may be higher than companies expect: 'Potential users should realise
that deciding on and implementing a flexible working solution is a complex
task and one for which there is little help from experienced external
suppliers.
'It is a fairly expensive process and has many hidden costs, such as the
setting up of help desks and installing virus detection software, that must
be taken into account.'
Ovum argues that software development will be a key cost, pointing out that
Metropolitan Life, the personal and corporate insurance company, took six
developers, four years and Dollars 2m to develop software for its
1,000-strong sales team.
Windsor Life, concentrating on life insurance and pensions, took two
programmers, 10 months and Pounds 200,000 to develop software for its 300
sales people.
These are hardly the kinds of projects which a sensible company is going to
entrust - at a management level at any rate - to an outside contractor.
Which suggests that those who believe that reports of the death of the
central information systems department have been exaggerated are right.
The Brussels-based consultancy OTR, in examining the future of the IS
department, concluded that there were several tasks which only a central IS
function could fulfil. These included ensuring that a company's IT
infrastructure was flexible enough to handle new demands from a fast
changing business environment.
Another task is ensuring that quality standards for large business projects
are met. The development of systems for flexible working comes into that
category. The use of computers to support staff working out of the office
will certainly grow over the next decade. Those that successfully implement
the new systems will be those who follow the older, proven rules of total
quality.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): For once, Europe is
ahead of the US game - Andrew Adonis looks at the likely impact of the new
GSM networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GSM stands for Groupe Speciale Mobile, a pan-European digital
telecommunications standard for a new generation of cellular services across
the continent compatible with each other.
The first GSM networks were launched last July in Germany, France and
Denmark. Vodafone launched its UK GSM service, called 'EuroDigital', on
September 1. GSM services have recently - or will soon - come on stream in
the other leading west European states, and eastern Europe is following
behind. Dataquest, the consultancy company, is forecasting 1m GSM
subscribers in western Europe by the end of this year, growing to 13m by the
end of 1997.
GSM networks are not going to replace existing analogue services overnight.
GSM requires new infrastructure and different, digital handsets. That leaves
analogue operators, including those constructing GSM networks, with
investments to recoup and capacity to fill. It also leaves their subscribers
with terminals useless for digital networks. With GSM handsets retailing for
around Pounds 400 in the UK - after a subsidy of more than Pounds 100 from
the operators - analogue handsets selling for a quarter of the price will
retain a strong attraction.
Dataquest projects that shipments of GSM telephones will overtake analogue
shipments by next year; and that by the end of 1997 analogue will have
barely half as many subscribers as GSM.
'The speed of the transition will be variable,' says Mr Dean Eyres,
Dataquest's mobile analyst. 'It will be fastest in countries like Germany,
where analogue penetration was lower and competition between GSM operators
is already strong.' With digital barely off the ground in the UK, Germany
already has nearly 500,000 GSM subscribers, and for most German users GSM is
more accessible than analogue.
The old and new are therefore set to co-exist until at least the turn of the
century. Indeed, some operators are deliberately delaying their GSM
offerings so as to maximise the potential of existing networks. In the UK,
Cellnet is still looking to double its analogue subscriber base and will not
be launching its GSM service until next year. Its strategy over the coming
months is to combat Mercury One-2-One and Vodafone's two digital services
with special analogue deals, playing hard on its lower all-in entry fee.
It is not just a question of existing capacity. Mr Stafford Taylor,
Cellnet's managing director, points to rapidly falling GSM handset and
infrastructure prices, and more versatile base stations appearing by the
month. Motorola, for instance, has just launched a base station ('ExCell')
about twice the size of a street cabinet, requiring none of the separate
buildings and protective fencing of its predecessors. Mr Taylor is gambling
that delayed digital gratification will bring higher short and medium-term
dividends.
Nor will it be a straightforward one-way migration from analogue to GSM.
Operators are piggy- backing 'local' digital services, with lower access and
call charges, on their 900MHz GSM networks. In the UK Vodafone's is called
'MetroDigital' and will be launched on October 1.
Digital networks operating to the higher 1800MHz frequency are also being
built. The launch of UK Mercury One-2-One's PCN service is imminent, and
Hutchison is constructing another. In Germany the E-Plus consortium - which
includes Thyssen, Veba, BellSouth and Vodafone - is also building a DCS 1800
network. In some countries far cheaper telepoint services, offering one-way
communication, are advancing too. Hutchison's 'Rabbit' service has so far
had only limited success in the UK, but in Benelux and France similar
services have fared better - though partly because of the inadequacy of the
cellular network, particularly in Paris.
GSM is thus only one of a number of new or revamped mobile services entering
the market. It nonetheless has a critical role to play - not only because of
its technological features, but because of the mode of its introduction,
which is helping to reorganise not just the cellular market, but the
configuration of the telecommunications services industry across Europe.
Moreover, for once Europe is ahead of the American game in mobile. The US is
still engaged in a dispute between operators over two rival digital
standards - time division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple
access (CDMA) - which is threatening to delay the widespread introduction of
digital systems.
GSM's principal tech- nological assets are fourfold. Being digital, its
capacity is far higher than that of analogue networks. It comes with a range
of value-added features. Through 'roaming' agree- ments with other GSM oper-
ators, it will in due course give mobility across much of Europe. And with
more than 20 countries beyond Europe having now adopted the GSM standard,
including Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, it offers the prospect of
cellular mobil- ity well beyond Europe.
Says Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs: 'It
looks as if we are going to end up with one standard for the US, and GSM for
the rest of the world' - a fortuitous development for Europe's GSM users,
who can expect to benefit from cheaper infrastructure and devel- opment
costs in consequence.
Most GSM operators now have roaming agreements with counterparts across
Europe, allowing GSM subscribers to make calls in any country with a GSM
network simply by inserting their personal smartcard into a digital handset.
Of the wide range of value-added services available with GSM, probably the
most widely appreciated will be the short message facility, allowing
handsets fitted with liquid crystal screens to receive messages, like
alphanumeric radiopagers. In the longer term the mobile data facility
incorporated within the GSM standard will permit mobile terminals, such as
portable computers and fax machines, to communicate through handsets at
speeds comparable to today's fixed data lines.
However, arguably the most novel and far-reaching feature of GSM is that for
the first time it is providing most of Europe's cellular phone users with a
choice - choice of network and choice of operator.
In the UK and US, analogue networks were provided by rival operators. In
most of Europe, however, the state-owned PTO provides the service, with no
rival licensed and few immediate incentives for the PTO to maximise its
subscriber base.
By contrast, GSM licences are generally being offered to two competing
operators (see table). Typically one of them is the PTO, but the cellular
activities of the PTO are increasingly being moved into separate divisions
and encouraged to compete aggressively. Belgacom, Belgium's state operator,
has gone the farthest of all the monopolies, hiving off its GSM operation
and inviting Pacific Telesis, one of the top five US cellular companies, to
join it as a minority partner in the project.
The reasons for this change of policy are not hard to find, although rarely
stated explicitly. Most of Europe's PTOs are anxious for privatisation and
greater operational flexibility. Separating out their mobile divisions, and
allowing them to bid for overseas licences and to work with private sector
partners, is good preparation.
As for governments, which award the GSM licences, licensing rival GSM
operators is a measured first step towards wider telecommunications
liberalisation. Under a recent European Community agreement, full
competition must be permitted in most of the fixed-wire voice market by
1998.
It is also turning into a useful, and increasingly lucrative, source of
government revenue. The policy of giving licences away to companies in
return for commitments to build within a pre-determined timescale, and in
some cases also to keep tariffs within set bounds, is giving way in poorer
countries to a straight auction.
Poland led the way two years ago, extracting about Dollars 100m from France
Telecom and Ameritech of the US for their cellular licence. Greece turned
the auction into an art form last year, when it got Dollars 164m each from
two consortia for their GSM licences. Following the Greek model, the
Hungarian government last month succeeded in pocketing nearly Dollars 100m
in return for its licences.
According to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter, the Greek auction
netted Dollars 16 per head of population; Poland Dollars 2-Dollars 3; the
Hungarians nearer Dollars 5.
That may be good news for southern and eastern Europe's hard-pressed
taxpayers. But if it becomes the norm, then those heralding cellular as the
means to meet the telecommunications needs of impoverished communities will
have to find a new tune.

launched
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorola has just launched the MicroTac International 7200, which it claims
is the world's lightest GSM digital cellular telephone. Weighing just 215
grams, the MicroTac 7200 is 25 per cent lighter and about 20 per cent
smaller than the MicroTac 5000 series GSM cellular telephones launched in
March.
Of particular significance is the introduction of SMS (short message
service) into Motorola's GSM range, which enables the user to send and
receive short data messages.
Features include a four-line, 24 character supertwist display, 100
alphanumeric memory, continuous signal strength and battery level indicator
and a call-in absence alert.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (1): Seamless networks on
way - Andrew Adonis looks at the latest milestone in the industry and
foresees the emergence of an integrated marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mobile communications industry is racing ahead so fast, the milestones
are out of sight almost as soon as they are passed. Few doubt, however, that
last month's Dollars 12bn-plus takeover of McCaw Communications by the US
giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph marks a decisive turning point, giving
a huge impetus to the development of cellular telecommunications and their
integration with fixed-wire networks.
AT&amp;T paid dearly for McCaw, too dearly in the view of many commentators,
given that McCaw is still loss-making and loaded with nearly Dollars 5bn of
debt. There are also regulatory hurdles to be overcome: the regional Bell
operators claim that the takeover breaches the 1984 ruling which forced AT&amp;T
out of the 'local loop', and will allow the long-distance and international
operator to re-enter it by the cellular back door.
If their arguments before the courts and the Federal Communications
Commission come to anything, AT&amp;T will have some hard explaining to do to
its shareholders. The balance of opinion, though, is that Mr Robert Allen,
AT&amp;T's chairman, will carry the day with his protestation that he is 'not
interested in re-entering the local telephone business'. In any case, the
1984 settlement is under increasing assault: the ban on the 'Baby Bells'
offering cable television in their telephone service areas may not survive
for much longer, and if that goes, the rest of the artificial regulatory
edifice will be in danger of collapse.
Assuming, then, that AT&amp;T is able to keep and exploit its spoils, where will
it go?
Dismiss crude ideas that AT&amp;T - or mobile operators almost anywhere else in
the world - will engage in head-on competition with local fixed-wire
networks. The economics make nonsense of that idea for the foreseeable
future, even allowing for a decline in cellular charges with rising volumes
and rapidly falling costs for infrastructure and terminals. Local fixed-wire
tariffs are set to increase in real terms, as further rebalancing of local
against long-distance and international tariffs takes place, but the
differential will remain stark.
Wire-less communications will complement, not replace, the fixed wire:
integration, not supersession, is the watchword. For users, the next few
years will offer improved quality, seamless services covering fixed and
mobile networks, and a range of new services for carrying voice and data,
albeit shrouded in acronyms like DECT, ISDN, GSM, MCN, PCN and CT2 (and they
are just the raw essentials).
There is also the prospect of lower tariffs, but not as low or as soon as
all that. Over the past year low-user packages have reached most markets,
but what they offer by way of reduced subscription and access charges they
take away by making the phones prohibitively expensive for the owner to make
outgoing calls. Indeed, the new generation of digital cordless phones is
pushing cellular prices sharply upwards. In the UK the first digital
cellular phones will retail for about between Pounds 250 and Pounds 400,
several times the cost of a (far lighter) handset for the existing analogue
networks.
For operators, the challenge is threefold. First, to exploit the potential
of their existing businesses more effectively than hitherto, in particular
by tapping the consumer market. Second, to build new markets by acquiring
domestic and overseas licences for new services, an ever-smaller proportion
of which are being awarded on the nod to established state operators. Even
in countries fiercely committed to defending their public telephone operator
monopolies for fixed-wire services, overseas operators are being encouraged
to provide mobile services, typically by licensing a second competitor to
the PTO for new services.
The third challenge is integration: to enhance the complementarity of
wire-less and wire-line services by improving the interface between them in
terms of technology, marketing and the provision of value-added services
such as personal numbering. It is in this third field that AT&amp;T is in a
position to add most value, marketing 'one-stop' packages and developing new
interconnections with its long-distance network.
'The seamless North American cellular network is becoming a reality,' says
Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst at Goldman Sachs. The
introduction of the IS-41 switching interface standard means that markets
across the US are being inter-connected for automatic call delivery. The
roll-out of digital technology is also progressing, despite continuing
debate between two different technology standards.
Analysys, the Cambridge-based consultancy in the UK, argues in a recent
report that the next three years will see operators jostling for position
'in the emerging integrated marketplace'. In the US, AT&amp;T may lead the way.
By contrast, in Europe Analysys believes mobile network operators and new
competitors to existing PTOs are likely to do so, because of the regulatory
difficulties for Europe's PTOs in establishing themselves in the mobile
market and the technological difficulties of providing next-generation
services without a mobile network.
If successful in the US, AT&amp;T will boost a market that is already
experiencing phenomenal growth. Since 1984, the US cellular market has grown
from about 1m to 12m subscribers. It expanded by a further 627,000 in the
first quarter of this year alone, compared with 481,700 in the same period
in 1992. Economic and Management Consultants International, a Washington
consultancy, projects 17.7m subscribers by the end of 1995 and 25m by the
end of 1996.
The pattern is similar in western Europe, although outside Scandinavia it is
rising from a comparatively lower base. According to the FT's Mobile
Communications newsletter, the subscriber base has risen by a third in the
last year, with 7m at July 1. CIT Research, the London consultancy, projects
nearly 12m subscribers by the end of 1996 and 19.1m by the year 2000.
The Asia-Pacific region is also undergoing a mobile boom - the number of
cellular subscribers in the region's 12 largest markets in the region grew
by 50 per cent from 2.7m to 4m last year, and this year's growth rate is
again expected to outstrip that of Europe and the US. The mobile take-off is
not just in cellular: paging and telepoint technologies are advancing at an
extraordinary rate in the region, spurred on by the almost insatiable demand
from city-based private consumers for affordable personal communications.
Hong Kong alone has more than 700,000 paging subscribers, matching the tally
for the whole of the UK.
Eastern Europe is the region for which it is most difficult to project
growth. The recent auctioning by the Hungarian government of licences to
build a new digital cellular network led to a battle royal between consortia
led by the German and Nordic PTOs respectively. National cellular and paging
services are also set to come on stream in Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech
republic.
Beyond that, however, the funding of new mobile ventures for any but the
wealthiest of western businesses in large cities is problematic. Deutsche
Telecom is anxious to establish itself, but is not awash with cash given
constraints at home; some private operators, notably US West, have made
strides east, but as many again are distinctly wary of following. Says Mr
Gerry Whent, chief executive of Vodafone, the UK private mobile operator
which bid unsuccessfully for the Hungarian licence: 'It's all too difficult
and bureaucratic. Quite frankly, eastern Europe is not in our portfolio; we
don't think they are ready for capitalism yet.'
Europe, like the US, is moving towards a seamless cellular system with the
building of digital networks to the pan-European GSM standard. All the
leading European Community states apart from Spain now have them in
operation, although in some coverage is still patchy. In most countries two
competitors have been licensed, a significant change in policy from the
first generation of cellular analogue networks, which were mostly provided
by the state telecommunications monopoly.
With two competing analogue networks, the UK was a notable exception to the
European pattern from the outset. The former state monopoly operator,
British Telecommunications, holds only a 60 per cent stake in Cellnet, the
smaller and less profitable of the two. Vodafone is the market leader, and
since the McCaw sale it is the world's largest dedicated cellular company.
It is expanding fast into western Europe and Asia-Pacific, with a
medium-term goal of securing overseas licences covering as large a
population as in the UK, adjusting for income.
Moreover, the UK is set to become the first large European market with three
serious cellular operators, with the launch of Mercury One-2-One, a digital
PCN network operated by a joint venture of Mercury Communications and US
West. Initially its coverage will be confined to the M25 area around London,
but it plans to expand rapidly beyond.
One-2-One's fate will be an important test of the capacity of competition to
bring down prices in the cellular industry. Without the prospect of greater
competition, the margins currently achieved by Vodafone and Cellnet would be
almost indefensible.
Cellnet's revised tariffs, published last week, offer substantial discounts
to subscribers in the M25 area, a clear response to One-2-One. If the
reductions continue, pressure for regulation will ease.
Mobile communications is the world of dreams, abundant material for which is
contained in later articles. The ultimate dream, perhaps, is of a truly
global handheld mobile tele- phone service. It is still not in prospect, but
it has come a step closer with recent finan- cial backing for Motorola's
Iridium satellite telecommunications system - described as the world's
biggest private sector space project.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback as selling increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of US buyers, in spite of Wall Street's return from the Labor
Day holiday, together with a sell-off in stock index futures, depressed the
London stock market again yesterday. The September contract on the Footsie
index fell to an unnerving five-point discount at midsession without the
underlying blue chip equities attracting the arbitrage support associated
with such operations.
After moving narrowly at first, the stock market turned down smartly in the
afternoon, the FT-SE 100 closing 20.4 points off at 3,038.6. The index is
now around 2.5 per cent down from its recent trading peak, reached on August
27.
In addition to caution over near-term prospects for UK stocks, the London
market appeared to be somewhat less optimistic ahead of tomorrow's meeting
of the Bundesbank policy council. If the German central bank does not cut
rates, this will undermine hopes of an early reduction in UK base rates and
disappoint UK investors.
The launch by Mercury, the telecommunications group majority owned by Cable
and Wireless, of a new mobile phone service on favourable terms to Londoners
brought strong reaction among its rivals, which scented a vicious price war.
BT gave ground, as did Vodafone. C&amp;W drew no benefit from Mercury's plans,
however, falling sharply on fears of impending political developments in
Hong Kong, a factor which also unsettled HSBC.
Sentiment was also again unsettled by company trading statements which,
while not bringing new disasters yesterday, continued to provide little
evidence for the benefits of economic recovery at corporate level. In early
trading, the stock market was unimpressed by profits news from Fisons, the
pharmaceutical and scientific equipment group, and also from Williams
Holdings and Hillsdown Holdings.
At BZW, Mr Richard Kersley commented that last week's corporate news had
brought surprises, 'the bulk of them unpleasant', adding that, with stocks
trading on aggressive price/earnings multiples, there was little cushion to
absorb bad news.
There was little support for the international blue chips. Glaxo, the drugs
group, which reports final results tomorrow, remained under the bearish
influence of a leading agency stockbroker, and the rest of the
pharmaceuticals sector continued to lack the buyers who were driving prices
ahead at the end of last month. Oil shares, too, suffered as a weak crude
oil price kept investors out of the sector.
Although selling pressure was increased across the range of equities,
traders believed that the outlook for stocks at these levels remains sound.
As expected, retail, or customer, business in UK equities fell away sharply
on Monday, when New York was closed, returning a total of only Pounds
811.4m. This is the first time the daily total has dropped below Pounds 1bn
in genuine trading for nearly a year.
Seaq business increased to 626.2m shares yesterday from 421.1m in the
previous session, with non-Footsie trades making up 60 per cent of the
total. Yesterday's Seaq volume was at the low end of recent daily figures.
The UK institutions appeared to be keeping out of the market, and overseas
investors making only very selective forays into equities.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT the Bundesbank may not, after all, reduce German interest rates
this week led to strong selling in Footsie futures in London yesterday,
sending the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo.
The high of the day for the September contract on the FT-SE 100, recorded at
3,070, came within minutes. Thereafter, the future came under selling
pressure as the doubts over a reduction in German rates took hold. That
sentiment soon spread from derivatives to the equity market, bringing a
sell-off there also.
The September future fell to a discount to cash of 5 points just after
midday, a move that was repeated several times over the next few hours,
although it traded in line with cash for most of the session.
The day's low of 3,035 was registered in the last half-hour of business, but
nerves steadied before the close and September finished at 3,042, a 4-point
premium to the cash market. Volume in the near month contract was a healthy
11,084 lots, while that in the December contract, which closed at 3,064, was
3,040 lots.
Turnover in traded options improved to 30,728 contracts from Monday's poor
level of 20,044. However, business in the FT-SE 100 option was below
Monday's total, reaching 7,866 lots by the close. A big buyer of the
December 40 calls in Amstrad sent its volume to 6,640 contracts.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A healthy performance in Barclays shares on high turnover of 7m was
attributed to Lehman Brothers which, dealers said, was advising a switch
from National Westminster.
Lehman would not confirm that its was making a direct link between the two
high street banks, but analyst Mr Robert Law said he was a buyer of Barclays
as the bank with the 'lowest price to cash flow multiple in the sector' and
a holder of NatWest on the basis that its share price already reflected its
performance. Barclays gained 5 at 502p, while NatWest was held back, closing
unaltered at 481p.
Composite insurer Commercial Union performed strongly against a faltering
market as one securities house published an enthusiastic appraisal of the
group.
Mr Andrew Pitt, insurance analyst with Robert Fleming, reinstated his buy
recommendation on the stock. He said the company had underperformed the
market by 5 per cent over 12 months while the rest of the sector had
outperformed and it was now on a prospective yield of 5.3 per cent.
CU shares were 19 higher at one stage and closed 13 up at 606p after 5.5m
traded.
Building group Newman Tonks disappointed the market with a dividend cut in
spite of reporting an improvement in half-time figures. The shares closed 6
lower at 154p, having recovered from a worse fall earlier in the session.
Builders merchant Sharp and Fisher was wanted on expectations of favourable
interim results on Monday. The shares climbed 13 to 123p.
Shares in Westland Group were in demand following market talk and press
reports suggesting that the company may be a bid target. The stock ended the
session 6 better at 250p, with GKN, which has a stake of around 20 per cent
in Westland, still suggested as the most likely suitor. GKN hardened 5 to
493p.
The 3 per cent decline in interim profits at engineering group IMI
disappointed the market, leaving the shares 7 lighter at 287p as analysts
downgraded full-year expectations. Brokers also trimmed year-end forecasts
for Williams Holdings, which reported a marginal increase in half-year
profits. The shares weakened 7 to 326p, with volume climbing to 6.5m.
International mining group RTZ lost 12 to 723p in nervous trading ahead of
tomorrow's interim figures.
Rothmans International 'B' rose 6 to 701p as the extraordinary general
meeting approved the split of the tobacco and luxury goods arms.
Zeneca added 6 at 760p as investors bought for the yield attractions.
Bumper profits at Telemetrix lifted the shares 7 to 183p.
Results from Hillsdown Holdings were enlivened by the attractions of the
yield on the shares. The stock finished 7 stronger at 172p.
After Thorn EMI's profits warning - contained in a circular to shareholders
last Friday - the shares lost a further 15 to 968p as more brokers
downgraded profits forecasts. Most were cutting around Pounds 20m from
current year predictions.
Croda International moved ahead 19 to 330p on a near 30 per cent boost in
first-half profits to Pounds 18.5m. Hoare Govett changed its recommendation
from 'undervalued' to 'buy' and raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 3m
to Pounds 40m.
The financial restructuring at UK Land, which involved a one-for-22 offer,
sent the shares jumping 28 3/4 to 29 1/2 p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rank Organisation proceeded to gather pace in advance of the
closure of the BZW strike price auction for shares - worth Pounds 25m -
which the broker has agreed to acquire under its cash offer in respect of
Rank's enhanced share alternative.
Rank announced on Monday that 94 per cent of shareholders had accepted an
enhanced share alternative to the 1993 interim dividend of 31p, saving
Pounds 90m in cash and Pounds 26m in advance taxes.
But holders of 18 per cent of those not accepting the share alternative had
subsequently accepted the cash option offered by BZW.
Analysts said other marketmakers had marked the Rank share price higher in
the knowledge that BZW was buying the stock, but that the price was likely
to come off as the broker sold the stock into the market after today's
deadline. Rank closed 15 up at 789p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was one of the most heavily traded stocks in
the London market yesterday as Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) placed its
entire stake and finally put an end to the takeover speculation that had
surrounded the two banks.
The French state-owned bank, which is at the top of the country's ambitious
privatisation programme, sold its stake, which represented 4.68 per cent of
the Kleinwort equity or 6.15m shares, via Cazenove and Smith New Court.
The two securities houses placed the shares with investment institutions at
488p apiece, a 10p discount to the underlying share price.
In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, the French bank said yesterday
that it had an 'excellent working relationship with the Kleinwort Benson
group, which it envisages will continue'.
BNP bought the stake in March 1991 at 340p a share and there were
indications last year that it harboured ambitions to take over the merchant
bank. However, Mr Philip Gibbs, merchant bank analyst with BZW, said: 'I
think relations did cool between the two and what might have become an
agreement ended up as merely an investment.'
The sale follows the decision only a fortnight ago by American International
Group (AIG), a leading US insurance group, to sell its 6.6 per cent holding
acquired in 1988. Yesterday, Kleinwort Benson eased a penny to 497p in the
market on turnover of 15m shares.

Disappointing figures from Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific
equipment group, prompted a general downgrading of forecasts and pushed the
shares 6 1/2 lower to 170 1/2 p.
The company announced a first-half profit of Pounds 42.3m, at the lower end
of the range of forecasts. It also warned that profits from its instrument
arm were likely to 'fall significantly short of last year's'.
Lehman Brothers came down to Pounds 105m for this year from Pounds 130m
previously. Hoare Govett cut its full-year estimate by Pounds 14.5m to
Pounds 109m and the figure for next year by Pounds 33.5m to Pounds 127m, but
argued that the yield of 6.4 per cent was attractive.

FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms sector active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMS sector shares reacted badly to the launch of Mercury's new
'One-2-One' cellular system as investors became fearful of a price war in
the lucrative mobile telecoms business.
However, telecoms analysts were more sanguine, describing the share
markdowns as no more than a mere knee-jerk reaction and an excuse by some
investors to take profits in a sector which has recently had a successful
run.
Mercury, which is a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless, said its new mobile
system would offer domestic users free air-time in selected off peak hours
in the M25 London area. BT was considered to be potentially the main loser
among the telecoms group as current standard customers considered switching
to cellular on the back of the Mercury offer.
Mr Chris McFadden at Smith New Court said: 'Today's move is fundamentally
positive because it opens up the mobile telecoms market to the mass public.
The cake will now get bigger.'
However, specialists also pointed out that the response of the other
cellular phone groups and of standard telephone operators could deter
investors from the sector in the short term, and that shares were most
likely to be in for a dull time. C&amp;W shares tumbled 19 to 850p, BT ordinary
6 to 420 1/2 p, Vodafone 19 1/2 to 490 1/2 p and Securicor 29 to 710p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weakens despite sharp
rise by bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
HEAVY profit-taking left US share prices sharply lower across the board
yesterday as investors ignored further gains in a booming bond market,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 26.83 down at 3,607.10. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.82 to 458.52, while the American SE composite shed
5.29 to 456.28. The Nasdaq composite was particularly hard hit, surrendering
10.36 to 739.35. New York SE trading volume was 229.5m shares and declines
outnumbered rises by 1,234 to 756.
Dealers and investors returned from the long holiday weekend in a downbeat
mood, thanks in part to losses on overseas markets. Analysts said that if
the strong rally in bond prices continued it may not provide much of a help
to stocks because investors are increasingly worried that the bull market in
both stocks and bonds may soon face a correction, temporary or otherwise.
The autumn is traditionally a time to reassess market conditions, and
analysts worry that the record-breaking summer for both stock and bond
prices might prompt a quick and sharp sell-off by investors fearful that
both markets have become overbought.
This theory was put forward as a possible explanation for why another big
decline in bond yields yesterday failed to lift stocks, which initially
traded in a narrow range below opening values before falling sharply in the
final 90 minutes of the session amid heavy program selling.
Baroid Corporation advanced Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 8 3/8 in volume of 3.2m
shares after Dresser Industries announced that it had reached an agreement
to acquire the oil services company for Dollars 900m in stock. Dresser lost
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22 1/4 .
Gold shares dropped as the bullion price plunged on the commodities
exchanges. Newmont Mining lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 , Homestake
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 16 1/4 , Battle Mountain Gold Dollars 1 to Dollars
7 7/8 and Newmont Gold Dollars 3 to Dollars 39 7/8 .
Falling interest rates buoyed bank stocks, which have been a neglected

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average settles
below the 21,000 level

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS remained on the sidelines ahead of the release of the Bank of
Japan's tankan, or quarterly report on business sentiment, and share prices
lost ground on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average shed 98.71 to 20,962.10, falling below the 21,000
level for the first time in three trading days. The index opened at the
day's high of 21,065.81 and fell to a low of 20,880.19 just before the
close. Some financial institutions were seen reshuffling their share
portfolios, while the downside was supported by index-linked buying by
investment trusts.
Volume came to 250m shares, against Monday's 247m. Many foreign buyers were
absent following the US holiday on Monday. Declines outpaced gains by 703 to
280, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 7.13 to 1,689.78, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.66
to 1,291.53.
Investors failed to react to local press reports which forecast a reduction
in the official discount rate next week. Instead, some market participants
were discouraged by denials by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, of
a second supplementary package suggested in a leading daily newspaper.
However, some analysts believe that further talk of another economic package
will support share prices. 'We will see an inevitable process of consensus
building towards a new fiscal package,' wrote Mr Jason James of James Capel
in a recent report.
Trading concentrated on the clearing of earlier positions. Retailers, which
strengthened on earlier hopes of deregulation, lost ground on profit-taking,
as did foods, which were higher on Monday ahead of the medical and
bio-technology conferences.
Ito-Yokado, the supermarket chain, receded Y50 to Y4,960 and Seiyu lost Y50
to Y1,420. Ajinomoto, the foods manufacturer, dipped Y10 to Y1,460 and
Kikkoman, the soy sauce maker, eased Y10 to Y1,010.
Telecommunication infra-structure-related issues, which have been hit by
profit-taking recently, were higher. Oki Electric Industry, the most active
issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y555, while Fujitsu gained Y3 at Y839.
However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y8,000 to Y941,000 on
rumours that interest among foreign investors had shifted to DDI, the long
distance telecom company recently listed on the second section of the Tokyo
stock exchange.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 142.14 to 22,918.23 in volume of 27m
shares. The index lost ground for the first time in four days on small-lot
profit-taking.
Roundup
A FIRM mood took hold in many of the Pacific Basin markets.
AUSTRALIA saw a flurry of late buying which left the All Ordinaries index
5.3 higher at 1,967.8.
Commonwealth Bank forged ahead 35 cents to ADollars 9.95 after posting an
8.4 per cent rise in annual net profits to ADollars 443.1m. National
Australia Bank was 20 higher at ADollars 11.52.
Among media stocks, Nine Network climbed 32 cents to ADollars 4.25 in
response to its announcement of a 16.4 per cent increase in annual net
profits.
NEW ZEALAND picked up from early lows to finish slightly firmer on the day,
assisted by gains in Carter Holt Harvey, Telecom and Lion Nathan.
The NZSE-40 capital index was ahead 1.98 at 1995.79, after an early dip to
1.987.36.
SEOUL turned sharply higher after a flurry of late buying by individual
investors, actively hunting bargains in the vehicle, steel and high
technology sectors. The composite index advanced 15.18 to 690.95.
HONG KONG closed firmer, but off morning highs, in thin trade, inhibited by
current high price levels. The Hang Seng index was finally 27.05 up at
7,546.71, after 7,563.49.
TAIWAN rebounded strongly after recent falls, although brokers cautioned
that underlying investor confidence and the corporate profits outlook
remained weak.
The weighted index was lifted 58.49, or 1.5 per cent, to 3,874.03 by a wave
of late buying in speculative and government-related stocks. Turnover
expanded to TDollars 13.49bn.
KUALA LUMPUR continued to focus its attention on rumour-driven stocks and
the composite index added 1.30 at 849.70.
Union Paper, hit hard by allegations of insider trading, recouped 85 cents
to MDollars 6.85 after Monday's MDollars 6.20 drop as the shares resumed
trading after a two-month suspension.
BOMBAY finished sharply lower after the exchange authorities announced a ban
on short sales. The BSE 30-share index ended 87.67, or 3.3 per cent, down at
2,533.53 after a low of 2,515.50 at midsession.
The ban was intended to counter expected heavy sell-ing pressure after the
income tax authorities confiscated hundreds of thousands of shares held by
proxies of broker Mr Harshad Mehta in nine companies.

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore finds favour with foreign
investors - Relaxation of rules governing savings has also boosted activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago it was hard to find a happy broker in Singapore. The market was
in the doldrums while Hong Kong and other regional centres were stealing all
the attention. Volumes were low and margins were tight.
Now things are very different. Even the most diffident of brokers admit that
they have never had it so good. Until yesterday the local Straits Times
Industrial Index was attaining record highs, closing on Monday at 2,045,
compared with 1,500 at the start of 1993 and around 1,300 a year ago.
Yesterday the market fell back on profit-taking, ending at 2,036.
Singapore has benefited from the general advance in global equities. Foreign
funds, particularly from the US, have been pouring into east Asia, one of
the world's most dynamic economic regions.
A number of Malaysian stocks are traded in Singapore over the counter and
the recent vigour of the Kuala Lumpur market has also helped to push the
STII to new highs.
'Singapore has been caught up in the general optimism about economic
prospects in this part of the world,' says Mr Tom Inglis of Peregrine
Securities in Singapore. 'There are enormous funds now flowing into the
market here; Singapore has become fashionable again.'
Local factors have also helped. The economic fundamentals remain sound. with
growth in 1992 of 5.8 per cent, and signs of more robust growth this year.
Growth was 7.1 per cent in the first quarter and 10.1 per cent in the
second, partly due to a surge in earnings from the financial services sector
and the equity market revival.
Corporate news has also been positive, withbanks, which account for more
than 25 per cent of market capitalisation, averaging earnings growth of
about 30 per cent.
The government, famous for its planning skills, has had a direct role in the
revival of equities. Both corporate and personal taxes were lowered earlier
this year and there have been a number of new listings, including some of
the bigger, more profitable state concerns.
Most importantly the government relaxed rules governing the use of funds
from the Citizens Provident Fund, a compulsory national savings scheme.
Until recently CPF funds could only be used for property purchases and
investment in a limited number of stocks.
The government has become worried about rampant inflation in the property
sector and wants to release a portion of CPF funds for investments in
various projects, particularly to back a push into the east Asia region.
Hence, through a government sponsored media campaign, Singaporeans are now
being actively encouraged to buy shares. Incentives to share ownership are
also being offered to CPF account holders. From the beginning of next month
more than SDollars 22bn (Dollars 14bn) of CPF funds will be available for
equity investment.
'The release of the CPF funds is one of the most important factors in giving
buoyancy to the market,' says Mr Lim Kok Ann of Merrill Lynch. 'Singapore is
becoming a far more liquid market - as a result it will also become more
volatile.'
But Singapore is likely to remain a carefully controlled market. This was
reflected in the recent government announcement giving details of next
month's partial float of Singapore Telecom, the state owned
telecommunications and postal service.
Brokers had been billing the float as the single biggest privatisation so
far in south-east Asia, valued at between SDollars 20bn and SDollars 25bn,
equivalent to about 20 per cent of total market capitalisation.
But the ST float has been structured very conservatively. The government
plans an initial float of only between 6 and 8 per cent of ST, with 50 per
cent reserved for Singaporeans, the rest available to local and foreign
investors through tender. The ST float will set the pattern for future
listings of state companies, including the public utilities board and the
port of Singapore.
'The government is playing the ST float very carefully,' says one broker.
'It knows that there is plenty of local liquidity and it is going to make
sure that foreigners do not pick up a prime state asset like ST cheaply. You
cannot blame the government - but it does take the fun out of things.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt falls by 1.3% in low
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS began to emerge that the Bundesbank may not move on rates tomorrow,
and some bourses took this as a signal to move lower, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT fell below the 1,900 level although turnover remained low
throughout the session, only spiking in the car sector. The DAX index ended
off 24.32 or 1.3 per cent at 1,885.96 in turnover of DM6.3bn. In the
post-bourse the index slipped back further to 1,878.84.
Some analysts noted that most investors were unwilling to take positions
ahead of tomorrow's Buba meeting, particularly as a view was beginning to
take hold that there might not be a significant reduction in interest rates,
or that the council members might wait until their next meeting on September
23.
The car sector remained active with Volkswagen sliding a further DM10.50 to
DM361.50 and Daimler down DM10.60 at DM730.50.
The correction in PARIS continued, with a fall in the CAC-40 index of 20.67
to 2,137.29. Turnover was a low FFr2.8bn.
Lafarge Coppee, the cement group, was among the heaviest losers on the day,
closing down FFr17.80 at FFr409.50 after reports that the company was to
consider a capital increase at its board meeting next week.
Elsewhere, Carrefour continued to perform well after interim results, rising
FFr31 to FFr3,111.
In the media sector, Canal Plus put on another FFr20 to FFr1,324 following
the announcement of reorganisation plans for the television sector, while
Generale des Eaux, a shareholder in Canal Plus, added FFr34 to FFr2,640. The
latter has recently attracted an upgrade from Hoare Govett from hold to buy.
There have been reports that Generale des Eaux might realise a capital gain
from swapping all or part of its 20 per cent holding in Canal Plus for a
stake in Havas.
Total fell FFr5.10 to FFr304.10 ahead of today's results.
MILAN remained under pressure, the Comit index falling 7.15 to 609.75 in
volatile conditions, amid worries about rights issues and expectations of
some movement on German interest rates on Thursday.
Mediobanca, the merchant bank, shed L864 or 5 per cent to L16,434 in
response to its planned rights issue, announced late on Monday. The move
prompted speculation yesterday that it might be planning to use the cash as
part of a consortium to buy BCI, the privatisation candidate.
Fiat continued to lose ground on continuing worries that it might be
planning a capital raising exercise, the shares falling L178 or 2.7 per cent
to L6,409.
Ferruzzi's continued advance, up L37.2 to L411.7, prompted speculation that
the banks preparing a rescue package were building stakes.
ZURICH made up some of the ground lost on Monday, the SMI index rising 10.9
to 2,403.4, although there was concern that further profit-taking could
emerge in the absence of clear-cut moves towards lower European interest
rates.
STOCKHOLM saw Volvo Bs down SKr25 at SKr458 following Monday's news of its
merger with Renault. Unibank Securities, in an initial comment on the deal,
said that negative factors for Volvo included the fact that the Swedish car
group was to lose 'absolute control over its industrial core', while the
positive elements included long term development funding.
The Affarsvarlden general index fell 6.3 to 1,284.4 in turnover of SKr1.2bn.
AMSTERDAM slipped back, assisted by a loss in Ahold of Fl 1.80 to Fl 91.20,
after reporting interim results which disappointed some investors. The CBS
Tendency index fell 0.9 to 126.4.
ATHENS was put under pressure by fears that the government might be forced
into holding early elections. The general index, which was marked 5 per cent
lower at one stage, erased some of the loss to close 25.81 or 3 per cent
easier on the day at 820.90.
WARSAW, which has also been testing record highs recently, was another of
Europe's smaller markets to fall back, the WIG index shedding 420 or 5.6 per
cent to 7,141.3. Turnover was a record 1,360bn zloty.
TEL AVIV retreated on profit-taking after six consecutive sessions of gains.
The Mishtanim index fell 7.54 to 221.50.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rally short-lived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR yesterday regained some of the ground it had lost against the
D-Mark in recent days, rising to a peak of DM1.6250, but the rally proved to
be short-lived, writes James Blitz.
Last week's poorer than expected non-farm payroll figure helped to push the
dollar down to a close of DM1.6120 on Monday night. Yesterday morning in
Europe the US currency regained some lost ground as dealers took profits in
the wake of the hefty move downwards in recent days.
But the dollar was later unsettled after the Bundesbank announced that it
was setting a fixed rate repo in its money market operations at 6.80 per
cent, unchanged from the previous week. The Bundesbank's move suggested that
monetary policy will remain tight at its council meeting this week, and the
dollar closed at DM1.6105, down 15 basis points on the day. In New York,
however, the US currency improved to finish at DM1.6137.
Dealers have not given up all hope that the Bundesbank will reduce the
discount rate at its council meeting tomorrow, but such a move has barely
been discounted by dealers.
One factor which may have pushed the Bundesbank council in the direction of
'no change' in the discount rate were better than expected figures for
German GDP.
This rose a real, seasonally and calendar adjusted, 0.5 per cent in the
second quarter from the first quarter for a year-on-year decline of 1.9 per
cent. Economists had predicted that the year-on-year fall would be in the
order of 2.6 per cent.
However, Mr Richard Segal, international bond market analyst at Technical
Data in London, said: 'Closer examination of the figures shows that, by
sector, most categories of final demand declined. This suggests that the
economy is poorly placed to grow in the future.'
In spite of the Bundesbank's move, European currencies performed a little
more strongly against the D-Mark. The French franc closed at FFr3.519 from a
previous FFr3.523 and the Belgian franc was almost unchanged at BFr21.63.
Sterling also performed strongly against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4850
from a previous DM2.4625. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5425 from
a previous Dollars 1.5270.
In the last two weeks the pound has come under consistent pressure against
the D-Mark and the dollar. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of
America in London, said this is surprising, bearing in mind that the
fundamental reasons for sterling strength are in place: equity markets are
strong, recent economic data have been better than expected and the money
markets are not discounting an imminent cut in interest rates.
He believes that one of the main causes of sterling weakness may have been
that central banks have been selling pounds to buy D-Marks in order to repay
the Bundesbank for recent intervention.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Repo is unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday underlined its unchanged stance on monetary policy
by announcing a fixed rate repo at 6.80 per cent for today's operations,
writes James Blitz.
There are still some expectations in the market that the Bundesbank could
cut its discount rate from the current level of 6.75 per cent at its council
meeting tomorrow.
But with the repo rate unchanged, any cut up to 50 basis points would amount
to little more than a technical move. The central bank is clearly keen to
see some progress on consumer price inflation and the German budget deficit
reduction talks before easing policy any further.
Dealers in interest rate futures markets were therefore rather downbeat when
betting on German rate moves.
The September contract declined 2 basis points to close at 93.50. At this
level it is assuming that three-month money in Germany will be at 6.50 per
cent when the contract matures next week, barely changed from yesterday's
three-month cash rate of 6.53 per cent.
The December contract shed 3 basis points to finish at 94.10. But at this
level it is somewhat more optimistic, looking for some 63 basis points off
three-month money by the end of the year.
French franc interest rate futures were more generally upbeat yesterday as
the French currency stabilised against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
After closing at 92.65 on Monday night, the September Pibor contract rose to
a peak of 92.74 in the first hour of trading yesterday, but later fell back
to close at 92.70. Dealers are clearly looking for little change in
yesterday's cash rate of about 7.35 per cent before next week.
The December contract was more ebullient, peaking at 94.11 yesterday, some 8
basis points above Monday's close. But it slipped back to end at 94.03.
Dealers are looking for a large cut of 130 basis points in French
three-month money by the year-end.
Cash rates in the sterling markets were a little firmer as dealers continued
to take the view that UK interest rates would not come down quickly.
Three-month money was about  1/16 percentage point higher at 5 15/16 per
cent. Short-dated interest rates were little affected by a shortage of
Pounds 600m announced by the Bank of England.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold plunges another Dollars 10
in fresh sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE plummeted again yesterday, dropping by more than Dollars 10 a
troy ounce as the computer programmes used by some New York investment funds
sent out fresh 'sell' signals. The sell-off triggered similar plunges in
other precious metals and gold share prices.
Gold lost nearly 3 per cent of its value and fell to Dollars 351.50 an ounce
at one point in London before closing Dollars 10.10 down at Dollars 354.25.
The yellow metal has come down with a bump from Dollars 406.70 an ounce on
August 2, the peak of the recent rally and yesterday was at its lowest level
since early May. On the first trading day of 1993 gold touched Dollars 327,
a seven-year low.
Dealers said that there was some demand for physical gold as the price
approached Dollars 350 yesterday but some were doubtful whether this would
be enough to stem the landslide. 'It doesn't matter if the physical buyers
come back or not, the funds are in charge,' said one.
Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at the SG Warburg financial
services group, suggested the gold price had more or less reached bottom
although the next technical support point was Dollars 340. 'It certainly
won't go back to Dollars 325 and could improve slowly from now on and be
making its way towards Dollars 400 in six months time,' he said. He pointed
out that gold was emerging from a time of seasonally weak demand but
'physical demand is firm and could get firmer now the price has come back'.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, told
clients during a presentation in Antwerp yesterday that he suspected there
would be many more attempts in the coming months to push up the gold price -
'and each time the bulls will find some wonderful reason for doing so'.
He predicted that each time the price would fall back because 'the true
equilibrium price for gold at present probably lies somewhere between
Dollars 340 and Dollars 300 an ounce. The higher the averages remain above
this level, the more likely we are to see sharp drops in physical demand and
increased disinvestment sales and a higher level of scrap recovery'.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices near 3-year lows as
over- production continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT slide in oil prices gathered pace again yesterday, taking nearby
delivery quotations close to three-year lows.
In the European physical market the October price for North Sea Brent Blend
crude traded down 38 1/2 cents to Dollars 16.14 a barrel, the lowest level
for the second month price since July 19, when it briefly dipped below
Dollars 16 a barrel for the first time in three years.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said
the problem was that there was 'precious little new news' and the market was
concentrating on 'the re-occurrence of old facts', like the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' inaction in the face of persistent
overproduction and continuing concern about the prospect of the return of
Iraqi oil to the world market.
Traders hold out little hope that Opec will take decisive action at its
meeting on September 25 to get members' aggregate production down to the
target level of 23.6m barrels a day.
According to the Middle East Economic Survey the organisation's production
fell last month by 450,000 b/d to 24.335 b/d, but Mr Gignoux said MEES was
'the odd man out' with most estimates of August production being much
higher. Topping the range at the moment is the Petroleum Intelligence weekly
with its estimate of 25.05b/d.
Meanwhile, said Mr Gignoux, UN-Iraqi talks were proving 'more ongoing' than
many had expected, especially as the country had switched the emphasis from
a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil to pay for humanitarian aid to
the permanent relaxation of the embargo on its exports.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recession forces US coal
consolidation - A third of the national market is now controlled by 23
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE-long recession in the US coal industry has forced substantial
consolidation over the past three years, as oil and steel companies have
left the industry to focus on their core businesses.
While the economic and environmental liabilities make coal a chancy
investment, foreign natural resource companies, particularly UK and
continental European interests, have moved in in surprising strength to
acquire US coal reserves.
In a study of the 81 coal company mergers and acquisitions in the US between
1990 and 1992, the consultants Resource Data International and Hicks and
Associates found that ownership of 12 per cent of US coal production moved
overseas during the period.
This year, the world's biggest mining company, RTZ Corporation of the UK,
boosted the foreign ownership figure to 17 per cent when it entered the US
coal business through its purchase of the US mining company, Nerco. Nerco's
assets included coal mines in the Powder River Basin with annual production
of about 28.7m short tons (2,000lb each). RTZ quickly boosted its coal
interests in the region by also acquiring Sun Oil Company's Cordero Mining
Company for Dollars 120.5m. The Cordero property produced 13.3m tons of low
sulphur coal last year.
The expansion by overseas companies comes as some analysts say the coal
industry's recession is bottoming out, and prospects, at least for
environmentally correct low sulphur coal, are improving. A 20-year pattern
of long-term coal contracts is also ending, a development that will change
the economics of coal pricing.
The trend toward consolidation and increasingly international ownership
seems likely to continue. International companies like RTZ tend to take a
longer view of the business, assessing the risk factors of coal mining quite
differently from domestic companies.
Coal is not a glamorous business, but it is a steady one. It generates more
than half of the electric power produced in the US and of the 1bn tons of US
coal mined annually, 75 per cent is consumed by electric utilities. The
government suggests that US electric power consumption will to rise about 2
per cent a year over the next decade.
'The coal industry here is still very profitable, despite a long-term
decline in coal prices,' says Mr Ronald McMahan, president of Colorado-based
RDI. 'What we're seeing is a consolidation of properties in the hands of
bigger, stronger players.'
The consolidation includes not just the existing 2,800 coal mines in the US,
but vast coal reserves that remain to be tapped. When Hanson bought 100 per
cent of the Peabody Holding Company in two transactions valued at Dollars
1.23b in 1990, it became the owner of the largest coal mining company in the
US. Peabody and related subsidiaries own 43 mines with 86.6m tons of annual
production. Peabody's proven coal reserves are reckoned to be near 8.7bn
tons.
In 1991 the German concern, Rheinbraun AG made an even bigger investment in
US coal, purchasing 50 per cent of Consol Energy for Dollars 1.3bn. Consol,
a joint venture between Rheinbraun and DuPont, the US chemical company, is
the US's second largest coal company, with 55.2m tons of annual production
from 26 North American mines.
Although most US coal is consumed domestically, 14 per cent of Consol's
production was exported to the Far East and Europe, slightly above the US
average of 11 per cent.
Domestic mining companies also see the benefits of consolidation. If
authorities approve the merger of US mining groups Amax and Cyprus Minerals,
the combined company will become the second largest coal producer in the US.
Coal mining in the US has suffered for a decade from the after-shocks of the
1970s coal boom, when energy companies rushed to pay top-dollar for coal
mines, and then invested heavily to expand production and employment.
The glory days lasted through the 1970s energy crisis but faded in the early
1980s. As boom-year profits evaporated, however, competitive pressures
forced remarkable increases in productivity. US coal production rose 52 per
cent between 1979 and 1992, while the mining workforce was nearly halved.
At the same time, the production surge toppled prices. Mr Ralph Barbaro,
partner in Virginia-based Energy Ventures Analysis, estimates that US coal
prices on average are half of what they were 15 years ago. Shrinking margins
and low returns on capital prompted at least eight bankruptcy-related coal
mine sales since 1990.
New buyers are squeezing resources, including labour, to make their
acquisitions more profitable. Both Peabody and Consol are currently locked
in a struggle with the United Mine Workers union. The companies are seeking
to gain more flexible working practices in a new national contract with the
union, and job security issues are at stake as well. The strike, which began
on May 10, is costing Peabody about Dollars 1m a day.
The companies that have snapped up the coal mine bargains have done so with
an eye to acquiring reserves that are in compliance with the new US clean
air standards. Recent purchases of US coal properties reflect the impact of
the clean air legislation. Most have focused on the low sulphur coal regions
of central Appalachia in the eastern US and the west's Powder River Basin.
Mr McMahon says the trend reflects regional concentrations that are often
obscured by national statistics. 'Twenty-three companies (with assets above
Dollars 10m) now control 66 per cent of the US coal market, compared with 40
per cent in 1981,' he says. 'However, regionally, one large company, like
Consol in northern Appalachia and Kennecott (an RTZ subsidiary) in the
Powder River Basin, may have 40 per cent of the market.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African synthetic fuel
decision sparks new row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government's decision to authorise the continued operation
of the controversial R12bn (Pounds 1.65bn) Mossgas synthetic fuel project
has prompted renewed calls for deregulation of the fuel industry in the
country.
The decision, announced by Mr George Bartlett, minister of mineral and
energy affairs, follows a recent special report by the auditor-general
recommending that Mossgas, which came on stream recently, continue to
operate as there were sufficient social and economic benefits to offset the
project's marginal viability.
The green light for for the Southern Cape project - which converts
underground natural gas into petrol, diesel and kerosene - coincided with
the government's announcement that petrol prices would be increased by 7
cents a litre to R1.82 from September 15. This will bring the price increase
since last October to 19.7 per cent.
Mr Bartlett said the weakening rand/dollar exchange rate necessitated the
price rise, but the Automobile Association rejected that explanation, saying
it was the result of the high subsidies required to support the synthetic
fuel projects, Mossgas and Sasol.
Mr Roger Hulley, energy spokesman for the opposition Democratic party called
for the deregulation of the oil industry. He said the motorist was having to
pay a price 40 per cent higher than world crude oil prices because of a
misguided synthetic fuel policy.
The legacy of the years of sanctions is that South Africa still has a highly
regulated oil industry. The government sets the retail price, which may not
be undercut. It limits the number of petrol stations, sets the wholesale
margin and still purchases crude oil for the industry. Although government
still favours the current regulatory structure, it has contributed to the
deregulation discussion by recently publishing a 32-page document
'Government's involvement in the oil industry'.
Mr Bartlett said the cabinet had decided that Mossgas should receive import
parity revenue for its products. The import parity price, which Sasol, the
other synthetic fuel producer receives, is the base price at which fuel in
South Africa is sold. It is 8-10 cents a litre more than the export parity
price that the local oil industry receives for its exported product. Local
oil companies will be compensated for any losses incurred through having to
take Mossgas's production.
Mossgas will also receive tariff protection for a period of 10 years similar
to that paid to Sasol (an average of 12.5 per cent since 1979).
The auditor-general's report, which was drawn up by Deloitte and Touche,
found that, with sunk costs excluded, and based on import parity prices,
Mossgas would be viable. It would, however, remain sensitive to changes in
international fuel prices and to the exchange rate. The joint committee on
public accounts that considered the report said that no further money should
be invested in Mossgas unless the investment could be justified in terms of
normal commercial considerations.
Mossgas's origins lie in the desire of the South African government, during
the sanctions era, to source 40 per cent of its fuel needs locally. As such,
it was a strategic decision, not justifiable on economic criteria. Its
continued operation, however, is justified in terms of job creation and
foreign exchange savings.

The London Commodity Exchange's robusta COFFEE contract, after experiencing
a dull and generally weaker morning, surged ahead yesterday afternoon on
what traders described as buying related to availability of coffee against
September delivery. With tenders for delivery against near the September
contract amounting to just under 2,000 lots (5 tonnes each) and an uncovered
position of just under 5,000 lots, the posting of about 100 lots of
untenderables had sparked what seemed to be over-exaggerated concern, they
said. The November futures position touched Dollars 1,265 a tonne before
closing at Dollars 1,248, up Dollars 25 on balance. COCOA prices also moved
higher in the afternoon, with the December position closing Pounds 8 up at
Pounds 831 a tonne. 'I think the market is teeing itself to move higher this
week but if it fails, it's ready to fall right back down,' one trader said.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER market the main focus of attention was
in nearby spreads, which saw heavy trading activity. The cash premium over
three months metal touched Dollars 70 at one stage before ending at Dollars
58 a tonne, compared with Dollars 52 to Dollars 53 yesterday.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China lifts official price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA, WHERE high inflation and rapidly rising incomes have spawned a gold
fever, has almost doubled the state purchasing price of the precious metal
to stimulate production and combat smuggling.
The official China Gold News said the state purchasing price of gold had
been raised to Yn96 (Dollars 16.8) a gramme from Yn51.2 as from September 1.
It was the second price increase this year and the biggest rise ever. The
price had been raised from Yn48 on May 20.
An official of the China National Gold Corporation said the increase was
aimed at bringing China's domestic price closer to world levels, increasing
domestic production and discouraging sales to the non-official market.
Asked what national output would be in 1993, he said that remained a state
secret.
Rapidly rising incomes and inflation running at nearly 20 per cent in major
cities have caused a gold fever, making China the world's biggest importer
of gold last year, according to trade estimates.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Belgian prices stage recovery from
dramatic sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian bond market staged a one-point recovery yesterday, after last
week's dramatic sell-off, which was triggered when the authorities raised
interest rates to protect the currency.
However, the market has still not fully retraced last week's losses.
Ten-year yields fell to 7.24 per cent, down from 7.38 per cent on Monday but
still some way off last week's level of just over 7 per cent.
The yield spread between the Belgian 10-year benchmark and its German
counterpart narrowed to 109 basis points from 125 on Monday - the highest in
two years - but is still way above the 30 basis point gap recorded in July.
Dealers said volume was moderate rather than heavy, as some index-fund
managers came back into the market. 'But nearly all our clients completely
liquidated their positions last week,' one trader added.
GERMAN bonds weakened slightly amid growing doubts over the likelihood of
rate cuts at Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting. 'It's a tough call -
money supply and inflation don't suggest an easing but the D-Mark's strength
and technical considerations do,' said a Frankfurt trader.
But according to Mr Karsten Walprecht, a futures broker at Deutsche Bank,
the Bundesbank may once again surprise the markets. 'Expectations for a rate
cut are relatively low, but since the Bundesbank likes to act contrary to
market expectations, the chances may actually be quite good.'
On the supply front, the German government will auction a second tranche of
its 6 1/2 per cent bonds due July 15 2003 today. Some traders say the
auction may replace the Bund issue scheduled for the end of September.
Moreover, many banks need to cover short positions following the first
tranche, says a trader, who expects some DM6bn to DM8bn of bonds to be
issued.
UK GILTS ended slightly higher in fairly low volume yesterday, as the market
remained locked in a trading range, with no significant economic data due
this week.
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the
December long gilt future ended the day at 114 1/8 . One dealer said the
future is stuck in a 113 1/2 to 114 1/2 range, 'and it will take something
big to move it through that resistance level'.
FRENCH 10-year bonds shed early gains to end a slow session little changed
while the short and ultra-long sectors of the yield curve eased. The long
end was damped recently by heavy selling, while two to five-year maturities
weakened on waning hopes for near-term rate cuts. In the morning, some
switching from Bunds boosted French bonds but prices drifted back down as
follow-through buying failed to materialise.
JAPANESE bonds were little changed but remain underpinned by hopes of a cut
in the 2 1/2 per cent official discount rate. While JGBs have factored in a
rate cut, they will remain well supported until it happens, said Mr Nick
Stamenkovich, economist with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, who expects a half-point
ODR cut soon - possibly on Friday, when the Bank of Japan releases its
quarterly Tankan report. However, the cut is likely to trigger profit-taking
which could drive the 10-year yield back above 4 per cent, he said.
FOLLOW-through buying from Friday's strong rally and plunging gold prices
pushed longer-dated US Treasury securities to new highs yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105
3/32 , yielding a record low of 5.884 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.6726 per cent.
Longer-dated prices opened higher after the long weekend as sentiment
remained buoyant in the wake of Friday's unexpected decline in August
non-farm payrolls.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkey appoints banks for
Tofas sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA, HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has appointed J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank, and
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, to sell the government's stake in
Tofas, the Turkish car assembly arm of the Italian Fiat motor group.
The share issue is expected to raise around Dollars 500m. It will be the
largest international offering ever by a Turkish company.
Schroder will link with Turkey's Interbank and Lehman with Finanzbank. The
French Indosuez group is understood to have bid to handle the issue.
The government is selling 21 per cent of manufacturer Tofas Fabrikasi and 18
per cent of its marketing arm, Tofas Ticaret. Both companies' shares are
traded on the Istanbul stock market. The offer, which would be made on
Turkish and international markets, is expected to be concluded by the close
of this year.
Turkey's car market is currently growing at 25 per cent a year, in marked
contrast to the trend elsewhere in Europe.
The banks are considering three options - a full registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in New York, a restricted listing through
American Depositary Receipts, or a private placement with US institutions.
Bankers are also considering the possibility of listing Tofas on the
Luxembourg bourse.
Pennzoil, the US oil group, is to offer 5m common shares in the US and
internationally to raise around Dollars 333m. Proceeds will be used to
reduce borrowings, Reuter reports from Houston.
The group said the offer would be priced next week. Underwriters will also
be granted over-allotment options to buy an extra 500,000 shares.
Net proceeds, together with Dollars 10.9m of cash on hand, will be used to
redeem Dollars 111m principal of 10 per cent debentures due 2011, Dollars
120m of 10 1/8 per cent debentures due 2011 and as much as possible of the
outstanding Dollars 100m of 9 per cent debentures due 2017.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Stream of issues lifts 1993 volume
above last year's total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STREAM of new issues in the Eurobond market yesterday lifted volume this
year above last year's record level. Total 1993 volume has reached Dollars
271.6bn, according to IFR Securities Data, compared with Dollars 269bn for
the whole of 1992.
The Kingdom of Belgium launched its widely-expected D-Mark Eurobond issue
and Cheung Kong, the flagship of Mr Li Ka-shing's Hong Kong business empire,
made its Euromarket debut.
Meanwhile, the World Bank was putting the finishing touches to its global
dollar offering last night, in preparation for a launch at the start of
trading in Tokyo.
The Bank is expected to raise Dollars 1.25bn of 10-year bonds, priced to
yield between 10 and 13 basis points over the yield on underlying US
Treasuries.
Belgium's DM1bn offering of 10-year bonds was well received, syndicate
managers said. The bonds were priced to yield 16 basis points over the 6 1/2
per cent Bund due 2003, the lower end of the indicated range. When the bonds
were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said Belgium's offering provided fresh liquidity
at the long end of the D-Mark sector. Other 10-year Eurobond issues launched
earlier in the year have risen well above par, which makes investors less
inclined to trade in them.
The Belgian finance ministry said the 10-year maturity was chosen to tap
demand for longer-dated paper as well as to lengthen the maturity profile of
Belgium's foreign debt.
Belgium is scheduled to launch a dollar-denominated Eurobond issue in the
next month and may tap the Swiss franc sector early in 1994.
The other significant deal of the day was Cheung Kong's Dollars 500m
five-year issue, the first straight Eurobond by a Hong Kong corporate.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering established a benchmark for
other Hong Kong companies wishing to raise funds internationally. 'Cheung
Kong's issue opens up a whole new market,' it said.
The fact that investors were willing to buy the issue despite its maturity
in 1998, one year after the UK is due to hand Hong Kong back to China, bodes
well for future issues by Hong Kong borrowers, it added.
Demand for Cheung Kong's bonds was such that they are likely to be priced to
yield 82 or 83 basis points above the 4 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 1998,
at the lower end of the indicated range. The issue is due to be priced
today.
The aim of the issue is to expand Cheung Kong's investor base and to raise
its profile internationally. Cheung Kong does not have a rating at present
and any rating would be limited by Hong Kong's sovereign ceiling of A by
Standard &amp; Poor's and A3 by Moody's.
Late in the day, Citibank led a Dollars 300m seven-year Eurobond for
Telefonica de Argentina. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 3/8 per cent,
were priced to yield 348 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent US Treasury
due 2000.
Venezuela is expected to tap the Eurodollar sector in the next few weeks
with a Dollars 300m two-year offering. The issue, via Goldman Sachs, is
expected to be priced to yield between 250 and 300 basis points over the
yield on US Treasuries.
Another late-comer was France Telecom, which raised SFr300m through an
offering of six-year bonds. Lead manager Swiss Bank Corp said the issue
would refinance two Swiss franc deals which are due to mature in October. It
added that the coupon of 4 1/8 per cent was the lowest for a straight bond
since 1988.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank gave a significant boost to the
Matador market, Spain's domestic bond market for foreign borrowers, with its
Pta40bn three-year offering, the largest Matador to date.
An official at the lead manager Banco Central Hispano said that the bonds
were priced to yield 20 basis points below the yield on the underlying
Spanish government bonds, a more generous margin than investors had been
expecting.
In the sterling domestic market, Halifax Building Society raised Pounds 100m
through an issue of permanent interest bearing shares (PIBS). The issue was
priced to yield 150 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent UK government bond.
Spreads on PIBS have tightened substantially in recent months, reflecting
strong demand from investors for high-yielding instruments.
The National Bank of Slovakia yesterday raised Dollars 240m through its
first bond placement. The fixed-rate issue, in two tranches with maturities
of five and seven years, was privately placed with institutions in Europe
and Asia.

<TEXT>
CITIC PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Beijing's China International
Trust and Investment Corporation, yesterday announced a steep rise in
first-half profits and an increase in the interim dividend.
Net profit for the six months ended June advanced by 83 per cent to
HKDollars 802.3m (USDollars 103.6m) from HKDollars 439.5m a year earlier.
The interim dividend is going up from 8.2 cents a share to 10 cents.
The results included a maiden contribution from the company's 12 per cent
stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications purchased from China International in
January for HKDollars 10.4bn.
The purchase was funded through a share placement. The rise in half-year
earnings per share was therefore limited to 22 per cent, to 47.8 cents.
Operating profit more than doubled to HKDollars 503m, primarily due to a
strong performance from the trading operations at Dah Chong Hong (DCH).
The company almost doubled car sales in China, although Chinese austerity
measures are likely to hit the current six months.
DCH is the one investment to which Citic has added significant value, with
more than half of its new car sales now going to China. In addition, the
group has expanded DCH's trading and retail businesses into the mainland and
has taken a 51 per cent stake in a children's food factory in Shanghai.
Contributions from associates rose from HKDollars 314m to HKDollars 495m,
primarily due to Hong Kong Telecom, and to the performance of Dragonair,
which has seen earnings soar on the back of sharply increased business air
traffic between Hong Kong and China.
This was partly offset by the 46 per cent drop in earnings from Citic's 12.5
per cent stake in Cathay Pacific.
Citic is negotiating to buy a 25 per cent stake in a power plant in Shanghai
to add to its power project investments in Henan and Jiangsu provinces.
It has also taken 25 per cent of a joint venture with Japanese manufacturer
Isuzu to assemble trucks in China's most populous province, Sichuan.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu cuts R&amp;D to save costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics and telecommunications company, is
planning to cut the number of research and development projects by about 20
per cent in an attempt to reduce costs and focus its R&amp;D efforts better.
The decision is part of a wide-ranging exercise in reducing costs and will
involve all leading business fields - from computers and telecommunications
to semiconductors - in all parts of the world, Fujitsu said.
In the current business year, the company, which owns ICL, the UK-based
computer company, is aiming to reduce R&amp;D costs by about Y10bn (Dollars
94.33m) from an initially planned Y295bn.
Additionally, Fujitsu plans to cut capital expenditure. It is targeting a
reduction of up to Y100bn in capital expend-iture.
It hopes to reduce distribution and inventory costs as well. Last year, it
was able to cut inventory costs by as much as Y100bn by shortening the shelf
life of inventories, but additional reductions have been difficult, the
company said.
Fujitsu said earlier this year that it was looking to reduce the number of
employees on its payroll by 6,000 over the next two years through natural
wastage.
Fujitsu, which is Japan's largest computer company and a leading
manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and semiconductors, has
suffered heavily amid the downturn in capital expenditure and consumer
spending in Japan.
The company has also been hit by the trend away from large mainframe
computers, which have been a significant profit earner for the company, to
networks of personal computers.
In the year to March, Fujitsu reported a loss of Y8.7bn. It expects
restructuring efforts will help it return to profit in the current year.

AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, increased net profit by 11.4 per cent
to Fl 76.2m (Dollars 41.2m) in the second quarter of 1993, with higher
results in the Netherlands and Europe compensating for slightly lower
results in the US.
The second-quarter increase, which followed a 13 per cent rise in the first
quarter, takes net profit for the first half to Fl 172.4m.
Group sales in the second quarter rose by nearly 30 per cent to Fl 6.3bn,
largely due to the first-time consolidation of Schuitema, a Dutch food
wholesaler which is majority-owned by Ahold, and to acquisitions in the
Netherlands and Portugal. If these factors are excluded, the rise in sales
totalled 8.3 per cent.
Ahold, which generates about half of its sales through supermarket chains in
the eastern US, said US operating profit fell slightly to Dollars 38.9m,
from Dollars 41.8m in the second quarter of 1992.
Three of its US chains produced higher operating results, but its First
National supermarket chain posted lower profits.
In the Netherlands, operating profit registered a strong 43.4 per cent rise
to Fl 61.9m, partly due to new consolidations. But even after adjusting for
this factor, operating profit still showed an increase of 23.5 per cent.
European results swung into an operating profit of Fl 15.1m from a loss of
Fl 3.5m. Ahold attributed the improvement almost entirely to its rapid
expansion in Portugal. The Dutch group continues to post start-up losses in
the Czech Republic.

SKANSKA, the Swedish construction and real estate group, has concluded a
series of property deals worth more than SKr2.5bn (Dollars 316m) with the
Swedish National Pension Insurance Fund.
The agreement will net the company a SKr1bn capital gain at a time when its
performance has been hit by the downturn in the Swedish construction market
and big property write-downs.
Skanska is selling 20 commercial and residential properties in the Stockholm
area to the fund for SKr2.2bn. It is also buying a number of industrial and
office buildings in Stockholm and Malmo, and a residential area in Malmo for
SKr300,000.
Mr Melker Schorling, Skanska chief executive, said the deal would cut debt
and create room for new investments.
Proceeds will offset the substantial write-downs on foreign property
engagements which the company is expected to make in the second half of the
year.
'The deal is a positive indication that the real estate market in Sweden is
starting to recover,' said Mr Mats Mared, Skanska vice-president with
responsibility for real estate.
TRYGG-HANSA, the leading Swedish insurance group, yesterday applied to the
government for a charter to establish a bank.
It said the move would enable it to compete more effectively in the market
for individual pensions after a change in tax rules at the end of the year.
The new bank, to be named Trygg-Banken, will be 51 per cent owned by
Trygg-Hansa Life and 49 per cent owned by Trygg-Hansa SPP.
It will acquire parts of the group's finance company, Trygg Finans, which is
primarily focused on small and medium-sized companies.
It will supplement this with a small securities business and by offering
favourable interest rates to attract pension savings from individual
customers.
CULTOR, the Finnish foods group, reports eight-month profits after financial
items of FM227m (Dollars 39m), against FM152m last time, Reuter reports from
Helsinki. Net sales were FM4.08bn, compared to FM3.82bn. The company said
operating profits for the period were FM498m. For the first eight months of
1992 they were FM427m.

AN Australian company that successfully bid for a licence to build and
operate a casino in Melbourne aims to raise ADollars 246m (USDollars
164.00m) through an initial public offering of shares, AP-DJ reports from
Melbourne.
The licence was awarded to a consortium of companies, including Foster's
Brewing and property developer Hudson Conway, following a bid earlier this
week of ADollars 750m to the Victoria state government.
The consortium has formed Crown Casino which is to take a stock market
listing late this year or early 1994 to pay for part of their successful
bid.
Investment institutions and private shareholders will be offered ADollars
246.0m of shares, or 60 per cent of Crown, and the three-member consortium
will take up the rest, giving the company an issued capital of ADollars
410m.

COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia, the partially privatised, Sydney-based
institution, yesterday reported an 8.4 per cent rise in after-tax profits to
ADollars 443.1m (USDollars 295.4m) for the 12 months ended June.
Profit before restructuring costs and general provision transfers was
ADollars 492.3m.
The figures, at the upper end of analysts' expectations, pave the way for
the sale of a further 19 per cent equity interest in the bank by the federal
government. This move, already well-flagged, will reduce the authorities'
holding in CBA from 70 per cent to 51 per cent.
Yesterday, Mr Tim Besley, CBA chairman, said that he expected details of the
sale to be released 'in a matter of a few days'. The sale is expected to
raise around ADollars 1.5bn.
Operating profit after tax but before outside equity interests and abnormal
items rose to ADollars 589.5m from ADollars 415.9m, with the core banking
operations contributing ADollars 482.6m, against ADollars 385.3m. The bad
debt charge fell to ADollars 533.7m from ADollars 843m, which CBA attributed
to 'concerted action . . . to manage non-performing loans, as well as the
benefits of the recovery in the equities market'.
However, at the earnings per share level, there was more modest progress,
with CBA reporting 51.7 cents, against 51.5 cents last time.
Mr David Murray, managing director, admitted that there was a 'continuing
subdued economic environment,' with increased competition among lenders in a
sluggish domestic market.
But he said that CBA's relatively healthy figures reflected tighter control
on costs, with operating expenses falling by 6 per cent.
The bank's risk-weighted capital ratio improved from 9.84 per cent to 10.66
per cent. Total assets rose to ADollars 91bn from ADollars 88.3bn. CBA
shares rose 35 cents on news of the results, to ADollars 9.95.

<TEXT>
FIRST Pacific Company, the Hong Kong-based distribution to
telecommunications conglomerate, yesterday reported strong first-half
profits and an increase in the interim dividend.
Net profits before extraordinary items, but after preference share and
convertible share dividends, for the first six months of 1993 were HKDollars
252.3m (USDollars 32.58m), up 59 per cent from HKDollars 159.1m.
The company is stepping up its interim dividend by 43 per cent to 5 cents a
share.
The group's Dutch subsidiary Hagemeyer continued to show strong growth,
although its contribution was hit by negative foreign exchange movements. In
addition, Philippines-listed Metro-Drug, and Australian computer company
Tech Pacific, significant loss-makers in 1991, continued to recover.
Pacific Link, one of Hong Kong's three top cellular phone operators, further
grewits subscriber base. However, Pacific TeleLink, which is building up a
CT2 phone and pager network lost money, in line with group projections.
The group's property arm benefited from its acquisition of security company
Guardforce, and from further investment property sales. Banking operations
have been strengthened by the link-up with Mainland Government partners.
First Pacific's managing director Mr Manuel Pangilinan, said: 'While it is
unlikely that the growth rate in the second half will match what was
achieved during the first half of 1993, I expect to be able to report
significantly improved results for the full year.'

SKr3.9bn

SWEDBANK, the newly-merged Swedish savings bank group, yesterday unveiled a
SKr3.9bn (Dollars 493m) package of measures to help it weather the crisis in
Sweden's financial sector without calling on government support.
The bank is strengthening its capital base by issuing SKr1.9bn of perpetual
subordinated debt to international investors, mainly in Japan and the US.
Pricing is not being disclosed.
It plans to raise a further SKr2bn by selling a 60 per cent stake in two
wholly-owned subsidiaries to a group of 90 affiliated savings banks.
The bank says the moves would have increased its capital adequacy ratio at
June 30 by about 1.7 percentage points to 10.5 per cent, well above the 8
per cent international minimum. This will go a long way to enabling it to
survive without state support, although, like other Swedish banks, it
remains under pressure from heavy credit losses.
The bank hopes it will be able to withdraw its request for state aid later
in the year, when it expects to announce new measures to strengthen its
capital.
It applied for support at the start of the year but is now hoping to bail
itself out of trouble following similar moves by two other banks,
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Foreningsbanken.
First-half results from Swedbank confirmed evidence of a recovery in the
Swedish financial sector, which has been battered by two years of heavy
losses caused mainly by collapsing real estate values.
The bank's operating deficit fell to SKr1.59bn from SKr5.88bn after costs
fell by 15 per cent and credit losses shrank to SKr5.80bn from SKr9.25bn.

DOMINION Breweries, the New Zealand brewer, reports an increase to NZDollars
15.8m (USDollars 8.61m) from NZDollars 13.8m in net profits for the year
ended June.
The directors said it had been another difficult year, marked by tough
competition and reduced consumer spending.
The company, previous-ly known as Magnum Corporation, is controlled by a
joint venture of Brierley Investments and Singapore and Dutch liquor
interests. It has been undergoing an extensive restructuring after heavy
losses on investments in 1991.
Dominion is planning further write-downs and provisions this year of
NZDollars 30.6m, following last year's total provisions of NZDollars 264.3m.
It said said that the tough trading climate looked like continuing.
The board reaffirmed that there would be no rapid return to acceptable
levels of profitability due to the extent of the resources and investment
needed to rebuild the group.
It said all business units were profitable with the exception of DB Hotels.
There had been a significant improvement in earnings at Austotel, the
Australian hotel arm.
Further asset disposals were expected and as a result borrowings would be
further reduced.
The brewer's net debt last year fell from NZDollars 396.3m to NZDollars
216.5m.

<TEXT>
GERMAN banks may face a more difficult time in the second half of this year
than in the first six months, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of
Deutsche Bank.
In an interview in today's Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, Mr
Kopper says that economic crises tend to hit the banking sector with a six
to nine-month delay and that he is 'not sure that German banks can repeat
their good performance of the first half'.
He added, however, that overall profits remained satisfactory in Germany's
banking sector and that they should improve next year as a result of an
expected 'very modest economic recovery'. He said that German banks had
anticipated the problems arising from recession and that Deutsche Bank had
already increased its provisions this year by about 50 per cent to DM1.4bn
(Dollars 8.4m).
Mr Kopper said that small and medium-sized companies often faced their most
difficult financial problems at the end of recession and that even though
the worst of the economic downturn was over 'we still don't know how many of
our clients will be able to find their feet again'.
The Deutsche Bank chairman also expressed confidence in a continued fall in
German interest rates. 'There is no doubt that interest rates will continue
to fall,' he said, forecasting that short-term interest rates would be below
6 per cent by the end of the year.
According to Mr Kopper, the European central bank, which will be established
as part of the process of European economic and monetary union, should be
based in Frankfurt for 'psychological reasons'. He said it was necessary to
reassure Germans worried that the D-Mark would disappear with the creation
of a single European currency.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Valeo resists European car
market downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VALEO, the French maker of car components, yesterday showed resistance to
the downturn in the European car market by announcing first half net profits
of FFr383m (Dollars 68m), a fall of 6.1 per cent over the same period last
year.
The company said that the result was achieved despite the depressed European
car market and reflected improved operating profit margins outside Europe
and the benefits of its cost-cutting programme. The results included
extraordinary charges of FFr223m.
Sales during the first six months of 1993 fell by 4.6 per cent to
FFr10.59bn. Valeo said that most of this decline was the result of exchange
rate movements and was achieved against a background of an 18 per cent fall
in the European automotive market.
Valeo ascribed the relative strength of sales to expanding technology and
the growing internationalisation of its operations.
The company said that the continued depressed outlook for the European car
market meant that it would pursue its policy of industrial and commercial
adjustments and would seek to strengthen its position in growth markets such
as Asia and the US.
The company's balance sheet strengthened during the period. At the end of
June, net consolidated debt stood at FFr1.77bn compared with FFr2.15bn at
the beginning of the year.
The debt to equity ratio declined from 30 per cent to 23 per cent during the
same period.
Spending on research and development during the first half totalled FFr531m,
while capital expenditure was FFr636m.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Heinz surprises Wall St with
rise in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
H. J. HEINZ, the US food group, yesterday surprised Wall Street by posting
improved earnings for the first quarter.
For the three months to July 28, Heinz posted net income of Dollars 152.2m,
or 59 cents a share. A year earlier the company had underlying earnings of
Dollars 143.8m, or 55 cents, before charges for accounting changes of
Dollars 133.6m, which reduced reported net income to Dollars 10.2m, or 4
cents.
Sales edged slightly higher to Dollars 1.58bn in the latest quarter from
Dollars 1.56bn a year ago.
On Wall Street yesterday, shares in Heinz rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37
1/2 by midday, but later fell back to close Dollars  1/8 down on the day at
Dollars 37 1/8 .
In recent weeks the stock price has slumped, reflecting investors' concern
that the food industry might suffer from a price war.
Most analysts had expected Heinz to earn 57 cents a share in the latest
quarter.
The Pittsburgh-based company said its pet food products posted volume gains
in the latest quarter, as did its Ore-Ida food industry potatoes, especially
in the UK, Italy, Spain and central Europe. However, these gains were offset
by volume declines in its StarKist tuna, Weight Watchers frozen food and
Heinz grocery ketchup products.
Sales were lifted by a 1.3 per cent increase in prices in the latest quarter
and by the acquisition of the Wattie's Limited business in New Zealand,
which lifted sales 6.3 per cent.
The benefits of the Wattie's acquisition was offset by the impact of a
stronger US dollar against most currencies.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chief executive, said he was pleased with the latest
results, 'given the current economic environment in the US and overseas'.
In June, Heinz said it would take a Dollars 192m pre-tax charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover a number of cost-cutting measures including
an 8 per cent workforce reduction and a cut in its UK operations.
Mr O'Reilly said the restructuring charge would hasten productivity
improvements and concentrate a three-year rationalisation programme into 12
months.
But analysts saw the move as further evidence of the intense competition in
the retail sector which is putting pressure on the big consumer products
companies.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian groups loosen family
ties - Bernard Simon looks at empires parting with corporate treasures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FACING each other across Phillips Square in downtown Montreal are the
flagship branches of two of Canada's most venerable retailers: The Hudson's
Bay Company department store and Henry Birks &amp; Sons, fine jewellers.
Birks and The Bay were for many years among the country's best-known family
businesses. Montreal's upper-crust Birks family had presided over the
jewellery chain for 114 years. The Bay, whose roots go back to the 17th
century fur trade, was 65 per cent owned by Mr Ken Thomson, son of Lord
Thomson of Fleet, the publishing magnate.
However, both companies have recently loosened their family ties. Last
November, Mr Thomson sold more than half his Hudson's Bay shares to public
investors for CDollars 545m (USDollars 410m), leaving him with only a 25 per
cent stake.
Birks, strapped for cash and under court protection from its creditors, was
rescued earlier this year by Borgosesia, the Italian luxury goods group.
The recession has been hard on families that have long dominated Canada's
business landscape. One after another, they have been forced to part with
some or all of their corporate treasures. Some empires have all but
disappeared.
A group of international banks has ousted Paul, Albert and Ralph Reichmann
from the helm of Olympia &amp; York, the property developer which filed for
bankruptcy protection last year. O&amp;Y is now being gradually dismembered.
The empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family has
fallen victim to the plunge in North American property values.
Brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman have pruned their corporate tree in the
past six months. They have sheared away about CDollars 4bn worth of assets,
and stand to lose control of Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded
property developer, under a debt-relief plan filed in early August. Edward
Bronfman has substantially reduced his interest in key holding companies.
The Southam family has relinquished control of Canada's biggest newspaper
chain. Failure to control labour costs and weak management pushed Southam
into losses of more than CDollars 400m in the past two years.
The company is now controlled by Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the UK's
Telegraph group, and by Power Corporation of Montreal.
The Steinberg supermarket chain, once Quebec's biggest and most innovative
food retailer, has disappeared.
It was weakened by slipping market share, high labour costs and dissension
within the founding family after the death of patriarch Mr Sam Steinberg.
Even among the surviving family businesses, some have shrunk, while others
are financially weakened or riven by discord. A struggle surfaced last month
between Wallace and Harrison McCain over control of McCain Foods, the
international potato-chip and frozen-food group based in rural New
Brunswick.
The break-up of so many family empires has far-reaching implications for
Canadian business. Some of the country's biggest companies now find
themselves without a controlling shareholder, leaving them vulnerable to
takeover.
The contraction of the family fortunes is a blow to national pride. The
thought of Birks Jewellers falling under the sway of an Italian company
sends shivers down many a genteel Anglo-Canadian spine.
'It's sad in terms of a nation's life,' says Mr Peter Newman, who has
chronicled Canada's business families in several books. 'If you were
involved in the local community, you could depend on these companies because
they had a feeling for the country.'
The growth of the family-owned business in Canada was spurred by lax
competition laws and disclosure requirements. A strong, nationwide banking
system also nurtured many family empires.
Not all Canada's blue-blood families have fallen on hard times. Many have
managed to ride out the storms; some are even prospering.
Now that the Reichmanns have lost control of their family business, the
wealthiest Canadians, according to Forbes magazine, are Mr Thomson (who
still controls an international publishing, travel and property empire) and
the secretive Irving brothers, James, Arthur and John, whose fortune centres
on oil, gas and forest products in Canada's Atlantic provinces.
The Bata shoe empire remains intact, as does the food, supermarket and
forestry group controlled by Mr Galen Weston and his family. Mr Conrad
Black's wealth has grown appreciably since he bought control of the UK's
Telegraph group in 1985. His stake in Hollinger, the company which holds his
publishing interests, is currently worth about CDollars 242m.
On balance however, family money carries less clout than it used to. Mr Jim
Muir, director of research at Richardson Greenshields, a (family-owned)
Toronto securities firm, notes that much of the power in Canadian business
has shifted to professional money managers at pension funds, mutual funds
and portfolio management companies.
Under pressure from these institutional investors, the old practice of
stuffing boards of directors with the controlling shareholder's family and
friends is gradually waning.
The shift of power is also evident in more subtle ways. The Globe &amp; Mail and
the Financial Post have dropped their social gossip columns. Could there be
a more telling sign that the influence of the monied families which used to
dominate these columns, and the public's interest in them, is ebbing?

NORTHERN Telecom, the equipment manufacturing affiliate of BCE of Canada,
has begun reducing its Canadian operations as part of a plan to reduce the
present 58,000 payroll by 9 per cent over the next 18 months, writes Robert
Gibbens.
Nearly 800 jobs will go with the shutdown of one plant in Ontario and
another in Nova Scotia. About 1,200 more jobs will vanish in the remaining
17 Canadian plants. The company says obsolescence is the main reason for the
rationalisation.
About 2,000 more jobs will be eliminated in the US and several hundred at
STC in Britain, acquired by Northern in 1991. Northern took a CDollars 282m
restructuring charge in the second quarter to cover rationalisation costs.

RIO ALGOM, the former uranium producer now concentrating on copper and base
metals, has sold its potash division with mines in Saskatchewan and New
Brunswick to Potash Corp of Saskatchewan for CDollars 160m (USDollars 120m),
plus working capital, writes Robert Gibbens. Rio also retains a royalty
interest.
PCS, Canada's biggest potash producer, will take over a workforce of 440
miners.
The potash division contributed 12 per cent of Rio Algom's operating profit
in the first half of this year. Potash prices have been volatile
internationally partly because of big swings in Chinese demand.
Rio plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and expand its base metals
activities in North and South America, including development of the Cerro

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Tax credit helps JCI hold
earnings for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXTERNAL factors in the form of favourable tax changes and a one-off
dividend helped Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, the mining house, to
record largely unchanged earnings in the year to June.
The dividend was maintained at 132 cents per share on attributable earnings
of 293 cents per share, against 298 cents last time. Equity accounted
earnings rose slightly to 394 cents from 388 cents.
Mr Pat Retief, chairman, reported that at the trading level the group had
experienced another difficult year. Pre-tax profit fell by 10 per cent to
R415.7m (Dollars 123m) from R463.8m.
A R21m tax credit, however, boosted attributable earnings which, at R433.2m,
were only marginally lower than 1992's R439.4m. Earnings also included a
liquidation dividend from DAB Investments of about R22m.
Equity accounted earnings rose to R582.4m from R571.9m, largely as a result
of a R26m benefit from an adjustment to deferred tax provisions.
For the second year in succession the portion of JCI's earnings derived from
mining fell - to 36.4 per cent, or R212.1m, of the total from 42.4 per cent,
or R242.8m.
The group again earned more from its industrial and property interests which
are mostly unmanaged. They contributed 39.7 per cent of earnings, or R231.7m
against R259.3m last time. Most of the balance of income was in the form of
fee income.
Mr Retief said the contribution from platinum - JCI controls Rustenburg
Platinum, the world's largest producer - had fallen for the third year in
succession. It contributed R85.4m, or 14.7 per cent of earnings.
The gold division did well to more than double its contribution, while
income from diamonds, mostly trading interests, rose. Mr Retief said coal,
in which the group has invested more than R500m in recent years, continued
to be a 'major disappointment'.
On the industrial side, CMI, the ferrochrome producer, was hardest hit by
recessionary conditions and made a substantial loss. Motor group Toyota also
had a difficult year.
Best performances came from publishing group Argus, South African Breweries,
and the Premier Group in particular, where earnings rose by 16 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US carmaker, yesterday reached a significant milestone on its
path back to financial health when Moody's Investors Service, the credit
information agency, restored its debt to investment grade status after 31
months in the speculative category.
The upgrading concerns some Dollars 13bn of borrowings.
Moody's is one of the two leading credit rating agencies. Its upgrade should
allow Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services business, to raise
money on somewhat finer terms, although the debt market is already pricing
the subsidiary's borrowings at close to investment status.
However, Chrysler also needs an investment grade rating from Standard &amp;
Poor's, the other leading agency, to achieve a significant reduction in
interest costs on some of its other borrowings.
S&amp;P announced in June it was reviewing the company for a possible upgrade to
investment status. However, Mr Scott Sprinzen, an S&amp;P analyst, said
yesterday the agency would not finish its review until Chrysler had
completed this autumn's negotiations with the United Auto Workers on a new
labour contract.
Chrysler fell to junk bond status early in 1991 when it was entering a
severe motor industry recession with a weak product line-up and strained
balance sheet. Many analysts questioned whether it could survive as an
independent company.
Over the past 18 months it has clawed its way back to financial health,
thanks to asset sales, cost-cutting and a range of hot-selling new products.
Moody's, which raised Chrysler's senior debt two notches to Baa3 from Ba2,
said the ratings remained under review for a possible further upgrade. This
would depend partly on the outcome of the labour negotiations.
It said yesterday's action 'recognised the improving trends in Chrysler's
operating performance' and the potential for 'further earnings and cashflow
advances which will strengthen the company's balance sheet and
debt-protection measurements'.
Meanwhile, Chrysler yesterday unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show a new
range of small cars, writes Kevin Done. Called the Neon, the range has set
new standards in the US industry for efficiency in development and
engineering.
The Neon was developed in 31 months, from design approval to first
production, Mr Robert Lutz, Chrysler president, said. He said development
time had been cut from the 40 to 48 months required by most carmakers in
Europe and North America.
Chrysler has also cut significantly, to only Dollars 1.3bn, the investment
needed for the Neon project. Production of the range, which is set to
transform Chrysler's presence in the US small car market, will begin in
November.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Demand from oil groups prompts
services merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most broadly-based companies in the world oil services business
would be created by the planned merger announced yesterday between the
Texas-based companies Dresser Industries and Baroid.
The all-share offer by Dresser, which values Baroid at around Dollars 850m,
was prompted by the growing demand from oil and gas producers for
broad-based service companies able to carry out all aspects of an
exploration or drilling project.
This practice of buying services as a package, which according to Dresser
accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of the market, enables producers to
hold down costs and shift more of the project management risk on to service
companies.
Dresser and Baroid said the services they offered were largely
complementary, giving them a broad-based business able to compete with the
industry leaders Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Halliburton.
However, the combined company faces potential anti-trust problems from its
prospective share of the drilling fluids market. Through Baroid and M-I
Drilling Fluids, a company 64 per cent-owned by Dresser, the two account for
more than 50 per cent of the US and worldwide market in fluids.
Dresser said it would comply with any directions from the anti-trust
authorities to enable the merger to go ahead, including the disposal of part
of the combined fluids business.
In most other respects the Houston-based Baroid, with turnover last year of
Dollars 614m, two-thirds of it overseas, will extend the range of services
offered by Dresser, which in 1992 reported post-tax earnings of Dollars 121m
on sales of Dollars 3.8bn. Directional drilling and
measurement-while-drilling services, provided by Baroid's Sperry-Sun
subsidiary, and remote-controlled submarine services both extend Dresser's
range.
Based on projected earnings from Baroid next year of between 45 and 50 cents
a share - from 24 cents in 1992 and a projected 35 cents this year - the
merger would only marginally dilute the value of Dresser shares, analysts
said. Few cost savings are expected from the merger, though Dresser said the
reduction in central overheads would cut costs by between Dollars 12m and
Dollars 15m a year.
Meanwhile, the development of integrated service companies could lead to an
overall reduction in revenues for the sector.
Mr Jim Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber, said: 'It's a very good deal for
the oil companies: by getting one company to cover all the services, they
can achieve big discounts.'
Dresser shares fell Dollars 1/2 on the news, to close at Dollars 22 1/4.
Baroid's share price jumped by Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 8 3/8.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM to cut workforce at Opel
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors is reducing the workforce of its Opel/ Vauxhall car and light
commercial vehicle operations by 8.6 per cent, or 7,830 jobs, this year.
Staffing levels have been battered by the steep fall in new car demand, Mr
Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, said yesterday.
Hourly-paid jobs at GM Europe's plants - chiefly in Germany, Belgium, the
UK, Spain and Austria - are being reduced by 9.2 per cent, to around 68,000
from 74,929 in 1992. Salaried jobs, meanwhile, are being cut by 4.2 per cent
to 15,700 from 16,600.
By the end of this year, the number of hourly-paid jobs will have been
reduced by 13.3 per cent, from a peak of 78,390 in 1991. Mr Hughes warned
yesterday the workforce would be cut again next year, 'with some significant
numbers'.
Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said Opel
had operated profitably in the first half of the year. However, he warned:
'It will be difficult to stay in the black for the remainder of the year.'
GM Europe overall would 'earn a significant profit' in 1993, however, said
Mr Hughes. He claimed GM Europe again had the strongest financial
performance of the big six volume carmakers in Europe, and would perhaps be
'the only one in profit'.
He forecast a strong profit recovery in 1994 attributable to measures
already taken this year to improve productivity and cut the workforce.
GM Europe is forecasting a drop of 17 per cent in new car sales across
western Europe this year, to 11.2m from 13.5m in 1993.
Mr Herman said the decline in the German new car market had apparently
'bottomed out,' but there had not been 'a clear turnround in sales'.
'We expect the market will increase slightly in the second half of 1994,' he
said. Both German new car sales and production were forecast to fall by 20
per cent this year.

reinsurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AON Corporation, the Chicago-based insurance group, and CNA Insurance and
Corporate Partners, an investment affiliate of Lazard Freres, are to launch
a new Bermuda-based reinsurance company, underlining growing interest among
international insurers in the island as a centre for reinsurance.
More than Dollars 3bn of capital has been invested in Bermuda since June.
Both SCOR, France's biggest reinsurer, and Centre Re, a subsidiary of
Switzerland's Zurich Insurance, are planning ventures.
The new company will bring at least Dollars 200m to Bermuda. Mr William
Adamson, group vice-president and chief operating officer of CNA's
reinsurance, will act as interim chief executive. Initially the company will
focus on property catastrophe reinsurance and other 'niche opportunities'.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hopes fade for BFr25bn float of
Belgian state savings bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a BFr25bn (Dollars 717m) stock market flotation of
ASLK-CGER, Belgium's state-owned savings bank, is fading, according to
Belgium's biggest bank.
Generale de Banque had offered to pilot ASLK-CGER onto the Belgian stock
market in a British-style public offer of shares. However, Mr Ferdinand
Chaffart, Generale's chief executive, said yesterday he 'seriously doubted'
the bank's proposal would be accepted.
Generale de Banque announced that consolidated net profits had increased 10
per cent to BFr5.8bn in the first half of 1993, against BFr5.28bn in the
first six months of last year. The group said second-half net results should
be in line with the first half.
The bank believed a high-profile sale of shares in ASLK-CGER - the first
stage in a four-year BFr70bn privatisation programme - would have attracted
Belgium's private investors. 'I think (the Belgian government) has missed a
great opportunity to do something for the stock exchange,' said Mr Chaffart.
In theory, the bank's proposal for a public offer is still on the table.
However Generale said it now seemed more likely that Fortis, the
Dutch-Belgian financial services group, would buy a large stake in
ASLK-CGER.
The Belgian government expects to raise about BFr25bn from the sale of a 49
per cent holding in the savings bank, which has an extensive banking and
insurance network.
Gross profit at Generale de Banque rose 38 per cent, from BFr16.63bn to
BFr23.02bn, in the first half, helped by strong capital gains on government
bonds and a BFr2bn gain on the sale of shares in ABN Amro, the Netherlands'
largest bank.
Mr Chaffart said in view of the depressed economic situation, the bank had
decided to transfer most of those capital gains to reserves. Depreciation
charges and provisions against bad debts increased from BFr7.64bn in the
first six months of last year, to BFr12.52bn.
The group's customer deposits rose 7 per cent to BFr2,227bn from BFr2,083bn,
and total assets were up 8 per cent to BFr3,627bn from BFr3,364bn.
Gevaert, the Antwerp-based financial holding company, increased interim net
consolidated profits from BFr1.12bn to BFr1.56bn in the six months to June
30.
Current earnings reached BFr1.04bn from BFr959m. The company said it
expected to match last year's current earnings of BFr1.64bn.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Volvo emerges playing new role -
The Renault deal has transformed the group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Volvo fell sharply on the Stockholm stock market yesterday as
investors contemplated the company's future after the merger of its car and
truck manufacturing operations with Renault, the state-controlled French
automotive group.
Volvo's most-traded B sharesclosed at SKr458, down SKr25 from the close on
Monday of SKr483. Before the merger was announced, the shares stood at
SKr490.
Analysts said the tumble was partly due to worries about the complexity of
the deal, which would leave Volvo with a 35 per cent share of a new
Renault-Volvo company and the French government with 65 per cent until a
planned privatisation issue. 'It is the old story of buy on the rumour and
sell on the fact,' said one analyst.
A more significant concern, however, was over the shape of the Volvo parent
group after the merger is completed early next year. By placing its core
motor industry operations into a junior partnership with Renault, Volvo has
in effect transformed itself into a kind of holding group with a large
number of diverse interests.
'A lot of people are looking at Volvo now as an investment company that will
trade at a discount to its net asset value,' said Stefan Hansson of Enskilda
Research.
Post-merger Volvo will certainly play a different role to its traditional
one as Sweden's best-known industrial concern focused on motor
manufacturing. Aside from the 35 per cent stake in Renault-Volvo, its main
interests will, by next year, be a 100 per cent share in Branded Consumer
Products (BCP), and a 25 to 35 per cent share in Pharmacia, the respective
food and pharmaceutical offshoots of the soon-to-be-split Procordia.
'The motor company Volvo has, in point of fact, suddenly become an
investment company in which the biggest subsidiary makes cigarettes, beer
and food,' said Svenska Dagbladet, the conservative Swedish newspaper, on
its front page yesterday.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, prepared the way for this when he
struck a deal earlier this year with the Swedish government on the break up
of Procordia, which is controlled jointly by Volvo and the state. The
government is to hand over its share in BCP direct to Volvo and is
committed, when it privatises Pharmacia next year, to leaving Volvo as the
biggest shareholder.
Last year Mr Gyllenhammar also appointed as Volvo chief executive Mr Soren
Gyll, hitherto Procordia's chief executive. When the Renault and Procordia
deals are complete, Mr Gyll will again find himself largely concerned with
his old companies as day-to-day control of Renault-Volvo will be held in
Paris.
Volvo will also wholly own Volvo Penta and Volvo Flygmotor, the marine and
aero engine companies excluded from the Renault merger agreement. In
addition, it will have eight further interests ranging from 100 per cent of
the brokers Alfred Berg, through shareholdings in Custos and Cardo, two
investment companies, and a 25 per cent stake in a property company.
Most analysts expect Volvo to seek to rationalise its holdings around the
Renault-Volvo and Procordia holdings, easily the biggest and most valuable
of its interests. 'I believe we will see a lot of divestments in the next
couple of years. The main task for Soren Gyll is to see that Volvo gets a
clearer structure. There may even be some new investments made,' said Bo
Engstrom of James Capel.
Eventually, some believe, BCP - the Procordia food unit whose principal
attraction to Volvo at present is strong cash flow - will be sold. That
would leave Volvo's central interests in Renault-Volvo, Europe's second
largest automotive company, and Pharmacia, Europe's eighth largest
pharmaceutical company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial reduction in first half losses at Reece has come from cost
reductions, points out the chairman Mr Peter Knapton. Once sales pick up the
low cost base should ensure a return to profits.
In the first half of 1993 turnover fell from Pounds 6.56m to Pounds 6.14m
and losses were cut from Pounds 183,000 to Pounds 11,000. In the whole of
1992 there was a deficit of Pounds 662,000.
All divisions traded more profitably. The door panels operation returned to
profit helped by higher exports and cost control, while the fasteners
activity turned in a much reduced operating deficit, again principally
through cost savings.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wyevale Garden ahead 20%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WYEVALE Garden Centres lifted pre-tax profits by 20 per cent from Pounds
3.09m to Pounds 3.71m in the six months ended June 30.
The result was achieved on turnover 8 per cent ahead to Pounds 22m (Pounds
20.3m) and were in spite of adverse weather conditions in the peak selling
months of April and May, said Mr Christopher Powell, chairman.
He said the group had experienced 11 months of continued recovery across all
geographical locations and against that background a more positive approach
was being adopted towards further acquisitions. Wyevale currently operates
41 garden centres and five high street shops.
Earnings per share emerged at 8.7p (7.3p) and the interim dividend is lifted
to 2.75p (2.48p). The company's shares trade on the USM.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting and improving markets help
Adscene
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CUTTING and a steady improvement in the market helped Adscene Group,
the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, to raise pre-tax profits by 30 per
cent from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 2.1m in the year ended May 31.
The shares responded with a 12p rise to 187p.
Turnover was 7 per cent lower at Pounds 13.96m (Pounds 15.04m) and with
operating profits ahead from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.3m, margins grew from
13.9 per cent to 16.5 per cent.
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive, said that after a strong end
to the year trading had continued to improve in the first quarter.
Turnover had increased and advertising revenues of the publishing division
had shown consistent improvements.
Based on this performance, he looked forward to a 'most satisfactory year.'
With earnings per share up 19 per cent to 10.1p (8.5p), the recommended
final dividend has been raised to 3.2p (2.5p) for a total 1p higher at 5p.
The publishing side had a good year, especially in the second half when the
group experienced a marked improvement in trading conditions. Operating
profits grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.66m.
In printing, as a result of changed work schedules following more work from
the publishing division and tight cost control, margins were lifted from
12.1 per cent to 25 per cent. Profits increased from Pounds 460,000 to
Pounds 616,000.
Strong cash flow enabled the group to repay Pounds 1.78m of debt and reduce
gearing from 32 per cent to 13 per cent at the year end.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks rises to Pounds 8m but cuts
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMAN TONKS, the biggest manufacturer in Europe of architectural hardware,
hailed a sharp improvement in its US business as the main factor behind an
increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993.
For the period to June 30 1993, compared with the six months ended April 30
1992, turnover rose to Pounds 128.7m (Pounds 109.4m) and the profit came out
at Pounds 8.11m (Pounds 6.62m). Earnings per share were 3.73p (3.5p).
However, the company is cutting its interim dividend by about one-third from
3.8p to 2.53p and warned that the final would be reduced by a similar amount
(last year 5.5p was paid).
It explained that the poor market conditions in Britain, where 63 per cent
of turnover was earned, meant it could not maintain dividend levels.
'Continuation of the present level of dividend payments, and the consequent
burden of irrevocable ACT, would have a detrimental effect on cash flow.
Rebasing the dividend at a more affordable level will enable the group to
grow at a faster rate.'
Operating profits in the US, where two subsidiaries manufacture locks and a
third makes timber columns, more than doubled to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds
897,000).
Mr Geoff Gahan, chief executive, said stronger sales overseas had helped
turnover grow. The improvement had been boosted by currency fluctuations and
the devaluation of sterling, he added, citing the success of Tesa, the
partly-owned subsidiary in Spain, where the weak peseta had enabled it to
export 60 per cent of its output to the US.
The strong performance in the US and steady growth in UK operating profit,
up to Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.37m), was the result of a two year rationalisation
programme in which the workforce had been cut by 18 per cent since 1990 and
a number of smaller businesses closed.
Although the rationalisation was now complete Mr Gahan said: 'We will not
hesitate to cut costs further if necessary.'
Net bank borrowings, meanwhile, increased to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 16.2m).
This mainly reflected the final dividend payment for 1992 totalling Pounds
9m, a Pounds 900,000 acquisition in New Zealand and capital expenditure of
more than Pounds 5m.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Avonside begins to improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of Avonside, the building services and housebuilding group, fell
from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.2m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30.
However, the directors said the increased activity experienced in the
opening quarter had continued through the first half.
Explaining the downturn they noted that an extremely low level of housing
reservations in the final quarter of 1992 had translated into a low level of
sales completions in the first quarter of 1993.
Operating profits for that period fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 500,000,
but for the second quarter improved from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.8m.
Sales completions of 31 units in the first quarter compared with 87 in the
second quarter. In total, sales for the half year were down by seven units
to 118.
The directors believed that the worst of the recession in the housing market
was now coming to an end and that the sales upturn in both segments of the
group in the second quarter would be sustained during the rest of the year.
First half turnover expanded from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 28.5m. Acquisitions
added Pounds 832,000 to turnover and Pounds 126,000 to profits.
Earnings fell to 3.41p (4.37p) but the interim dividend is being lifted to
1.9p (1.8p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Macro 4 advances to Pounds 10.5m - Currency
movements account for about half of profits increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACRO 4, the mainframe computer software group, yesterday reported higher
full year pre-tax profits and turnover, helped by currency movements which
accounted for about half of the gains.
Profits at the pre-tax level increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 10.5m in the
12 months to June 30 on turnover which grew by 22.3 per cent to Pounds
23.3m. Net interest income was flat at Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.29m).
Earnings per share rose by 18.9 per cent to 31.5p and a final dividend of
11.48p makes a same-again 17.75p. However, the comparative dividend included
a special 5p payment.
The group's share price gained 10p to close at 663p.
The overseas proportion of turnover increased to 80 per cent (76 per cent),
of which 39 per cent originated in continental Europe and 36 per cent came
from the US.
Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said currency movements, particularly the dollar,
had a significant impact on the consolidated results which were based on a
year-end exchange rate of Dollars 1.49 compared with Dollars 1.90. On a
like-for-like basis, turnover would have increased by 11.4 per cent to
Pounds 21.2m and pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 9.54m.
Group cash balances continued to grow and totalled Pounds 19.75m (Pounds
15.6m) at the end of June, including Pounds 1.56m to cover a delayed tax
payment.
The Pounds 4.14m increase reflected the strong cash generative nature of the
group's activities and came despite higher dividend payments in 1992 which
included the 5p special.
Mr Kelly said the group had continued to make progress 'despite continued
difficult trading conditions.' He said cancellations were continuing to
impact the installed revenue base, but were still being outpaced by new
sales.
All of the group's subsidiaries managed to improve their turnover and
contribution to profits in local currency terms 'despite less than buoyant
local economic conditions, strong competition and extended decision cycles.'
During the year the group set up its own subsidiary in Spain, replacing a
series of unsatisfactory agents, and has begun to launch a range of products
for the AS/400 mid-range computer market to complement its core mainframe
software products designed to run on any IBM or IBM compatible machines.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology up 62%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFER Technology, the West Midlands-based specialist engineer, yesterday
said moves to reduce its dependence on the European motor industry had paved
the way for a 61.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, writes Tim Burt.
In the first half of 1993 turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 65m (Pounds
48.9m) and profits worked through at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.5m).
Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, said a decline in operating profit of the
automotive division - from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.43m - was offset by
strong exports and profitable acquisitions in the control and manufacturing
technology sector.
In the technology division operating profit rose from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds
3.64m, and substantial orders from China and the purchase of two specialist
US companies would lead to further growth, he said.
Mr Robinson said no further acquisitions or rights issues were planned.
Instead the group would concentrate on organic growth.
Predicting that the benefits of such growth will feed through in the second
half, the company has declared a modest increase in the interim dividend to
6.5p (6.25p) but said the final would reflect the improved results.
Earnings per share, after the rights issue to fund the acquisition of the
Fenworth components group, rose to 22.3p (20.1p).
There is to be an extraordinary meeting will consider a sub-division of the
shares from 50p to 10p, and a change of name to TransTec.

<TEXT>
SEASONAL LOSSES at JW Spear &amp; Sons, the toys and games company, deepened
from Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 861,000 in the half year to July 2.
The company blamed delayed orders and the inclusion of usual losses from two
acquisitions.
Turnover was static at Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 8.28m).
Exports and the addition of purchases in Belgium and the Netherlands made up
for lower UK sales.
The company said that the seasonal pattern had changed as customers had
proceeded cautiously.
Fully diluted losses per share were 12.35p (4.8p).
The interim dividend is being raised to 3p (2.5p).
Mr Francis Spear, chairman, said that orders were now ahead of the previous
year.
He thought it would be another year of steady growth.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Revival in demand lifts Headlam to Pounds
1.13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIVAL in consumer demand has boosted the profits of Headlam, the
acquisitive fabrics and flooring distribution group, in the first half of
1993, writes Tim Burt.
Backed up by increased efficiency and tight financial controls the pre-tax
profit climbed from Pounds 313,000 to Pounds 1.13m on turnover up by 78 per
cent to Pounds 43m (Pounds 24m).
Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the group was not planning further
acquisitions in the near future but concentrating instead on improving the
'motley collection of (eight) businesses' purchased since January 1992.
Mr Graham Waldron, chairman, said the profit growth mainly reflected the
success of the floor covering division, particularly through demand for
Aquatex, the industrial walkway product.
Difficult trading conditions, however, had kept its footwear sector only at
break-even levels; while the contribution of the fabric divisions was
expected to be enhanced by the past year's acquisitions.
Earnings per share increased from 0.86p to 2.88p and the interim dividend is
stepped up from 0.75p to 0.85p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New sites help Frost to 30% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROST GROUP, the biggest independent petrol retailer in the UK, boosted
profits and turnover sharply in the face of a 2 per cent fall in the
industry's first half sales.
Pre-tax profits rose by 30 per cent, from Pounds 2.57m to Pounds 3.34m.
Turnover advanced by 59 per cent, from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 81.8m.
Mr John Murgatroyd, group finance director, said that sales volume had risen
following the opening of 22 new sites in the first half.
The group, which was floated in October 1991 with 79 sites, had 148 at the
end of June, mainly in the Midlands and the north of England.
A further 35 purchases were under negotiation. 'We said on flotation that we
were looking for 250 sites by 1997. It looks as if we will achieve that much
earlier,' he said.
Mr James Frost, chairman, said the strong performance owed a lot to the
large number of site acquisitions and to the ability to bring them on stream
very quickly and to good effect.
'I would expect the same pattern to apply to the second half of the year',
he told shareholders.
The introduction of the Smilies concept of corner shop selling had gone well
to date and should be completed by the year-end.
Interest payable was Pounds 200,000 (nil) as borrowings rose to Pounds 5.7m
at the end of June.
Margins had been squeezed by the fight for market share as overall petrol
and diesel sales fell. The group now expected the market to increase through
more new car sales and falling unemployment, and believed itself well placed
to take advantage of any upturn from 1994 and onwards.
The group operates its sites through licensees, who pay a fee to run and
take the profits from forecourt shops. Mr Murgatroyd said that the current
spend in the shops was Pounds 76 for every 1,000 litres of fuel sold, but
the figure was 'growing rapidly.'
Earnings per share rose to 4.3p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is stepped
up to 2.2p (1.8p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Littlewoods boost for Iceland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICELAND Group, the food retailer, reported pre-tax profits in the six months
to July 3 up by 24 per cent from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 30.1m
Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the outstanding
feature of the period had been the success of Iceland at Littlewoods food
halls. Of 50 new stores opened in the half 20 were in Littlewoods shops.
Two Littlewoods halls are being opened each week. Mr Walker expects to reach
the full complement of 48 by the end of October.
Turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 555.3m (Pounds 480m). Like-for-like
food sales were ahead by 7 per cent.
Mr Walker said that the food retail market was becoming increasingly
competitive. Operating margins eased from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent.
Operating profits were ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 29.1m).
Profits at the pre-tax level were lifted by a halving of interest charges to
Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 4.93m), reflecting lower rates, reduced borrowings and
better cash flow.
By the end of the year the group expects total borrowings to be between
Pounds 70m and Pounds 80m.
Earlier this year the group changed its name from Iceland Frozen Foods in
order to cast off its image as a freezer centre. In the first half frozen
foods accounted for 54 per cent of sales, with 23.5 per cent to groceries,
15 per cent to chilled and 7.5 per cent in fresh goods.
Customers per week have reached 3.4m, In Iceland an average spend of Pounds
7.50 per customer had been static for two years. In Littlewoods the average
number of customers was twice as high, but their average spend was half that
of an Iceland customer.
The group opened its first Iceland store in France in June, and has followed
up with three more in an experiment described as tightly controlled with low
risk. The stores sell more than 180 of its standard UK products.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 6.75p, up from 5.48p. The interim
dividend is lifted to 1.2p, against an adjusted 1.03p.
COMMENT
While nobody in the food sector is immune to the battles between the
supermarkets, Mr Malcolm Walker is probably correct in his insistence that
Iceland is not a scaled down supermarket and will therefore come through
relatively unscathed. The link with Littlewoods appears to have been a
shrewd move which will accelerate the evolutionary changes in Iceland's
product mix. If the French experiment fails, the group can walk away at
little cost, but it has everything to go for. It is on target to open a
record 100 stores this year, and the Pounds 30m Swindon distribution centre
is on schedule to open next spring. Full year earnings per share are heading
for about 14.5p, showing that Iceland can trade well in a hostile
environment. The multiple of 15.5 makes them attractive enough.

THE RECOVERY seen in the second half of the previous year continued in the
first six months of 1993 at Metsec and a loss of Pounds 868,000 was
converted into a profit of Pounds 505,000 pre-tax.
The USM-quoted company, which has interests in building products,
electronics and engineering, said profits were generated in all divisions.
The most marked improvement was in the overseas activities of pneumatic tube
systems
Turnover was Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 31.1m). The result was helped by a fall of
Pounds 100,000 in interest charged. Earnings were 2.48p (losses 5.75p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PowerGen to raise interim by 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, Britain's second largest electricity generation company, is to
raise its interim dividend by 18 per cent - paving the way for another round
of high pay-outs for shareholders in the sector.
The increase, announced at yesterday's annual meeting, follows a series of
above-average increases announced in the final year results of the sector
two to three months ago. PowerGen's total dividend for last year was 13.5
per cent ahead of 1991-92s.
Yesterday's announcement, which will take the interim dividend for the year
ending April 3 1994 to 3.95p, led to a slight fall in PowerGen's shares
initially.
That reflected disappointment that PowerGen had not gone further following
bullish statements on dividends three months ago.
Its share price recovered to close  1/2 p down at 393 1/2 p after analysts
cautioned that it would have been imprudent of the company to lift dividends
too high during a review by the industry regulator on the generators' costs
and margins.
This is due to be completed by the end of the year.
SG Warburg Securities left its forecast for the full year dividend at 12.5p,
a rise of 19 per cent.
Separately, Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, assumed the
chairmanship of PowerGen yesterday in succession to Sir Graham Day.
He said the management's control of costs and the renewal of coal contracts
would lead to a 17 per cent real reduction in the price of electricity to
the regional electricity companies over the next five years.
The second of the company's three planned gas fired stations, at Rye House
in Hertfordshire, would be commissioned shortly. It would open on time and
within budget.
The interim dividend will be payable on November 12.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Expamet moves back into the black with
Pounds 1.95m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPAMET International, the building, industrial and security components
supplier, reported pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds
1.95m, against losses of Pounds 6.81m. The comparative figure was restated
from profits of Pounds 2.45m for FRS 3.
During the period the company completed the sale of non-core activities
resulting in exceptional gains of Pounds 303,000, against a charge of Pounds
9.08m.
Group turnover for continuing businesses advanced to Pounds 62.8m (Pounds
57.4m) with a further Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 15.1m) from discontinued
activities. Continuing operating profits were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds
3.34m (Pounds 2.89m) with discontinued losses of Pounds 338,000 (Pounds
823,000 profits).
A breakdown of continuing operating profits showed security division at
Pounds 700,000 (same), industrial Pounds 1m (Pounds 700,000) and building
Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.5m).
At the end of the period borrowings were Pounds 18.7m against shareholders
funds of Pounds 16.7m.
The company said that continental Europe being in recession and the UK and
US unable to show other than a fragile and patchy recovery did not help
prospects.
Considerable costs were being incurred to cut overheads and improve
efficiency. The full benefit of these measures would not be felt until next
year.
Earnings were 2.49p (losses 11.81p). The interim dividend is cut to 1.25p
(2.09p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Changes for SE Asian Warrant Fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South East Asian Warrant Fund, an investment company, is proposing to turn
itself into an open-ended fund with monthly redemptions.
According to Olliff &amp; Partners, the brokers, the fund has gross assets of
about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) and is trading at a discount of approximately
10.5 per cent.
The fund had originally planned a share buy-back scheme to eliminate the
discount but this was opposed by a large stakeholder, Regent Fund
Management. The new proposals will be considered at extraordinary meetings
to be held before the end of October.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Aviva Petroleum cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aviva Petroleum, the Texas-based oil and gas company quoted in London, cut
its net loss from a restated Dollars 8m to Dollars 269,000 (Pounds 175,800)
for the first half of 1993.
The company said that Dollars 6.4m of the Dollars 7.7m improvement in its
result reflected a change in accounting for oil and gas assets from the
'successful efforts' to the 'full cost' method.
In addition the latest figure included a full six months of production at
two of the company's Colombian wells, compared with only three months of the
1992 half. This lifted its Colombian oil revenues by Dollars 1.3m.
Total oil and gas sales advanced to Dollars 5.4m (Dollars 4.28m). Losses per
share were 1 cent, compared with a previous Dollars 1.53.
Aviva said its financial health was continuing to improve. Earlier this
month it finished restructuring its banking facilities, making funds
available for its Colombian exploration and development programme.
In July it completed a 12.9m common share placing at 95 cents per share with
a group of US institutions and private investors to raise Dollars 11.3m
after costs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Home Counties Newspapers Holdings achieved a turnround in its core
publishing business where trading losses of Pounds 203,000 became profits of
Pounds 331,000 in the first half of this year.
However, rationalisation costs and exceptional profits resulted in the
pre-tax figure falling from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 94,000. Turnover was
Pounds 12.1m, compared with Pounds 11.3m.
The figure was after rationalisation costs of Pounds 296,000 relating to
redundancy costs. Last time there was a Pounds 512,000 gain from the sale of
Reuters shares.
At the end of the period, cash balances at Pounds 1.91m were up on six
months earlier. However interest received fell to Pounds 59,000 (Pounds
237,000).
From earnings per share of 0.63p (3.66p) the interim dividend is being cut
from 2.75p to 2p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Industrial Control up at Pounds 6.23m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems
manufacturer which obtained a listing last year, raised pre-tax profits by
34 per cent from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 6.23m in the year ended May 31.
Turnover climbed 13 per cent to Pounds 72.9m.
Mr Peter Hall, chairman, said the results were satisfactory and took account
of the dilutive effect of the joint venture with Elsag Bailey which was
forecast last year.
The Bailey ICS joint venture and acquisitions had contributed to the results
and Mr Hall was confident that the current year would continue well.
The group was gaining a substantial amount of work in the North Sea, while
continuing to win new contracts in the Middle East and Far East. In
addition, the proposed joint venture in China was expected to establish an
entry into the market.
Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 9.76p (9.1p) after allowing for the
joint venture dilution, and the recommended final dividend of 3.07p makes a
total for the year of 4.4p (special 0.3p).
The 1992 flotation proceeds helped reduce interest charges to Pounds 692,000
(Pounds 1.44m) in the year. Gearing at year end was 37 per cent.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Croda recovery continues with 29% rise to
Pounds 18.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Croda International rose by 19p to 330p after the speciality
chemicals and coatings group reported a continuing recovery in profits.
At the pre-tax level they rose by 29 per cent, from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds
18.5m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover was 13 cent higher at Pounds
207.3m (Pounds 183.7m).
Currency translation boosted both the profits and sales figures by 8
percentage points.
Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, said chemicals increased trading profit from
Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 18.7m, which represented 82 per cent of the total.
Sales rose from Pounds 122.8m to Pounds 134.7m.
He said: 'All our major UK operations performed well and a key factor in
this good performance was the growth of our exports.'
Substantial capital expenditure in recent years in the UK plants continued
to pay off, with better products being produced by fewer people. The UK
workforce fell by 130 to 2,528. Overseas operations also performed well,
particularly in the US, Japan and Singapore.
Trading profits from the group's coatings division were flat at Pounds 3.4m
(Pounds 3.3m), reflecting competitive pressures in the industrial paint and
ink markets. Sales grew from Pounds 42m to Pounds 52.8m. The Australian and
New Zealand operations improved profits, but the US inks business
disappointed.
Cosmetics and toiletries, which increased sales from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds
19.8m, made a small trading profit of Pounds 500,000, compared with a loss
of Pounds 200,000 last time. However, customer demand remained weak on both
sides of the Channel.
Mr Valentine said trading outlook continued to be encouraging with clearer
signs of recovery in many markets, although not yet in continental Europe.
However, he believed that while the failure of fixed exchange rate parities
in Europe might increase competition, 'we shall benefit overall from
improvements in economies which have for some time been artificially held in
recession.'
Earnings per share rose by 31 per cent to 9.4p (7.2p). The interim divided
is lifted by 7 per cent to 2.95p (2.75p).
COMMENT
Croda is reaping the benefits of heavy investment, recovering markets and a
market shift towards higher purity and more natural chemicals, which the
group has positioned itself to benefit from. The small cosmetic and
toiletries division is languishing and coatings has been under pressure, but
overall Croda can look ahead confidently to increasing demand. The share
price has nearly doubled in the past year and forecast full-year profits of
Pounds 38.5m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.2. That 8 per
cent premium to the market does not seem unjustified, but the shares have
had a good run recently and look due a period of consolidation.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: GTI helps Telemetrix jump to Pounds 7.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ALL its three companies reporting substantial profits increases,
Telemetrix, the electronics and information systems company, saw pre-tax
profits jump to Pounds 7.93m in the six months to June 30, though last
time's Pounds 673,000 was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds
2.93m.
Group turnover advanced to Pounds 61.5m (Pounds 46.8m).
Operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 7.95m (Pounds 3.88m), with
continuing operations contributing Pounds 8.13m (Pounds 4.22m).
This was largely thanks to GTI Corporation, the data communications
subsidiary which was 60.6 per cent owned by Telemetrix during the period.
It made operating profits of Dollars 9.8m (with an exchange rate of Dollars
1.50/Pounds 1), against Dollars 5.7m (Dollars 1.80/Pounds 1) last time.
Since June 30 GTI has lifted its holding in Valor, its networks components
arm, a further 6.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent for Dollars 10.5m in promissory
notes, since redeemed by a public offering of 400,000 common shares in GTI.
This reduced Telemetrix' holding in GTI to 58.3 per cent, though Mr Curtis
said that his company's stake in Valor rose from 55 to 56.7 per cent with no
outlay of cash.
Valor's sales, mainly in the US, grew 61 per cent to Dollars 45.1m,
accounting for some 70 per cent of GTI's Dollars 64.2m (Dollars 49.6m) total
sales, though Mr Curtis acknowledged that this rate of growth in Valor's
local area network business could not continue.
Zetex, the UK manufacturer of specialist semi-conductors, 70 per cent of
which are sold outside the UK, raised profits to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds
809,000) on turnover of Pounds 9.37m (Pounds 7.02m). Shorn of its
defence-related operations, sales at Trend, the telecommunications test
equipment maker, fell to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 7.46m), but operating profits
rose to Pounds 680,000 compared with Pounds 247,000.
Further growth in its current markets would be sufficient, said Mr Tim
Curtis, chief executive, but the group was looking for acquisitions to
broaden its product range or to move into a new technology.
It currently has Pounds 6.6m cash.
Earnings per share emerged at 3.8p (losses 1.6p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Govett Strategic Trust calls EGM to take
vote on survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVETT STRATEGIC Invest-ment Trust, the small and medium companies
specialist with total assets of about Pounds 400m, has called an
extraordinary general meeting to propose that its life be extended.
A simple resolution 'That the company continue in existence' will be
proposed at an EGM on September 23, and requires a bare majority to be
passed. The resolution dates from a change in the company's articles in
December 1991 under which shareholders were given the right to vote on the
liquidation of the trust at the 1993 annual meeting and at subsequent
three-year intervals.
The poor performance of small company shares and a high level of gearing
caused Govett Strategic immense problems after the 1987 stock market crash.
In each of the financial years 1987-88 and 1990-91 the trust's net asset
value fell by 44 per cent.
Shareholder dissatisfaction led to the 'smoking fuse' clause in December
1991, designed to help narrow the discount to net assets at which the shares
traded.
At the same time, managers John Govett were given a performance-related
management fee, based on their ability to outperform the FT-A All-Share
Index.
Govett Strategic's board argues that the trust should continue because:
the trust's performance has shown a significant improvement both absolutely
and against the All-Share.
signs of recovery make this an inappropriate time to liquidate the trust. In
any case, the costs of liquidation would be substantial, especially given
that some Pounds 95m of debentures, which are trading above par, would have
to be redeemed.
the management agreement with John Govett has been renegotiated and is
likely to cost less than the current arrangement. Under the current
arrangement, Govett gets 0.375 per cent of total assets per annum, plus a
0.125 per cent performance-related fee. The new scheme would give Govett 0.5
per cent of equity assets, but only 0.125 per cent of bond assets.
the trust can use its reserves to at least maintain the total dividend for
the next three years.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: IMI declines 3% to Pounds 35.5m - Recession
in mainland Europe blamed for downturn at mid-term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in mainland Europe and a loss in computing services affected
IMI, the international engineering company, which reported a Pounds 1m fall
in pre-tax profits in the half year to the end of June.
The near-3 per cent decline to Pounds 35.5m came on the back of increased
sales of Pounds 546m (Pounds 515m). The shares fell 7p to 287p.
However, three of the group's four businesses increased operating profits
and the loss-making titanium business broke even in June.
The latter received a further boost by winning a long-term Pounds 10m deal
to supply parts to Pratt &amp; Whitney. Mr Alan Emson, finance director, said:
'We have been anxious to break into the US market for a long time; we will
now be supplying about 10 per cent of Pratt &amp; Whitney's needs.'
Special engineering, which incorporates the titanium operations, saw
operating profits rise from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 8.1m.
Building products and drinks dispensing increased profits to Pounds 11.2m
(Pounds 10.9m) and Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 14.7m) respectively.
The exception was fluid power. With more than half of its business in
continental Europe where the impact of the recession has been most severe,
profits fell from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 9.1m. Other and corporate business
incurred a Pounds 3.8m loss (profits Pounds 400,000) as two of its computer
companies, Brook Street and Redwood, slid into the red. The company blamed
the loss on the downturn in information technology and the cost of
introducing new software.
Mr Emson criticised the electricity duopoly which he blamed for a 16 per
cent increase in electricity prices. IMI spends around Pounds 10m a year on
electricity.
'We will be breathing into a lot of regulatory ears about this. It is an
increase that business can ill afford.'
Borrowings, which are mostly denominated in US dollars, rose to Pounds 129m
(Pounds 112m), representing gearing of 34 (31) per cent. The increase was
due to the stronger US dollar.
Earnings per shares fell to 6.9p (7.3p). The interim dividend is unchanged
at 4.2p.
COMMENT
It must be somewhat galling to turnaround a loss-making business only to
find another operation slide into the red. It would have been more worrying,
however, had the loss been reported by one of the core businesses. As it is,
the deficit in the small computer operations should prove short-lived. The
profit fall in fluid power has more long-term implications. IMI believes it
has come to the end of its recession-induced rationalisation. But if the
downturn in mainland Europe continues, further cost cutting measures may be
necessary. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 74m, the shares
are on a prospective multiple of 20. That looks high enough given the
uncertainty on the Continent.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber progress halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES before tax at Phoenix Timber Group were little changed at Pounds
1.94m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.96m.
However, the directors said the improved trend noted in the opening half had
not been maintained and, in fact, 'was reversed in the second half'. They
added that the withdrawal from the ERM created 'renewed uncertainty'.
It was pointed out that the deepening recession in the building industry had
led to increasing pressure on margins and a worsening in the level of bad
debts.
Substantial costs were incurred in the transfer and start-up costs of
production of Redmon Modular Systems. Furthermore, a review of accounting
procedures at Durabella had disclosed bad debts that, in part, had arisen in
earlier periods.
The group is withdrawing from the window making and timber engineering
businesses and extraordinary costs relating to this decision amounted to
Pounds 900,000. There was a further charge of Pounds 600,000 in respect of
timber importing businesses previously closed.
The combined effect of trading losses, extraordinary charges and a property
revaluation reduced shareholders' funds to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 9m).
The continued level of borrowings compared with the fall in shareholders'
funds has left the group in breach of its borrowing powers. A resolution at
a forthcoming EGM will propose to ratify and approve this breach and
establish a new borrowing limit.
The level of borrowings also puts the group in breach of certain banking
covenants. However, as announced in August, arrangements have been made for
the provision of new capital. Turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 21.57m
(Pounds 23.12m). Losses per share emerged at 13.5p (13.6p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boddington doubles after Pounds 15m
Devenish stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF YEAR profits at Boddington, the pubs and wholesale drinks group, more
than doubled as the company booked a net Pounds 14.7m gain on the sale of
its near 20 per cent stake in Devenish, a legacy of its failed bid for the
West Country pubs group.
The group was cautious about the outlook, however. 'There really are no
reliable signs that the recession's grip on consumer expenditure has
slackened,' Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman said. July and August had not shown
the usual seasonal uplift.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 9.7m) in the six months to July
4 on the disposal of the stake in Devenish, which was taken over by the
Greenalls pubs and hotel company in June. Stripping out property and
exceptional items, the company increased underlying pre-tax profits by 13.9
per cent to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.7m).
Turnover rose to Pounds 113.2m (Pounds 111.3m), excluding the new year
period because the trading year began on January 3. Pubs, the most
profitable sector, moved ahead to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 47.7m), hotels to
Pounds 7.18m (Pounds 4.37m), nursing homes to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 5.73m)
with only drinks wholesaling falling back to Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 53.3m)
against fierce discounting in free trade.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 14.1m), with pubs
contributing an improved Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 10.1m), hotels Pounds 1.13m
(Pounds 430,000), health care Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.5m) and drinks
wholesaling sagging to Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 3.1m).
Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 4.05m) while borrowings rose
to Pounds 101.7m (Pounds 93.7m), as the company converted a final Pounds
5.65m tranche of outstanding unsecured convertible loan stock.
Borrowings have since fallen with the proceeds from the Devenish sale.
Gearing, excluding the Devenish proceeds, at the half-way stage was 47.1 per
cent compared with 48.6 per cent at the year end.
The interim is 2.86p (2.6p) and earnings 18.1p (5.9p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson loss rises to Pounds 11.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; JACKSON, owner of the Poundstretcher discount retail chain, fell
deeper into the red in the first half of 1993.
The pre-tax loss increased from Pounds 9.73m to Pounds 11.45m. However, Mr
Ian Gray, chief executive, said yesterday that the group historically had
made a loss in the first half as Poundstretcher is highly dependent on
Christmas trading, with 50 per cent of turnover coming between September and
December.
Turnover rose by 4.7 per cent from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 66.8m. The group
said like-for-like sales in Poundstretcher were 5.5 per cent ahead. Toiletry
sales rose 30 per cent and confectionery sales 20 per cent.
B&amp;J, which operates 230 stores, is now one year into its three-year recovery
plan. Three months ago it had a Pounds 21m rights issue, its second in just
over a year, to reduce borrowings and finance a store opening programme.
Interest payments fell in the half to Pounds 851,000 against Pounds 2.12m
and the company had net cash of Pounds 2.1m at June 30.
Losses per share fell from 5.4p to 2.5p.
Mr Gray said yesterday that significant progress had been made with the
group's recovery plan. He blamed the increased loss on margin reductions
from the clearance of slow-moving stock early in the year, and more than
Pounds 2m of capital expenditure, including the installation of an
electronic point of sale system.
Working capital had been cut, mainly through a 10 per cent reduction in
stocks. This had been achieved without the benefits of Epos and at a time of
rising sales.
There is no interim dividend.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Unipart climbs 19% to Pounds 11.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIPART, the motor parts and accessories manufacturer and distributor,
increased its pre-tax profits by 19 per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds
11.3m in the first half of 1993.
The company, which is investing heavily to increase its component
manufacturing operations, also disclosed that its Premier Exhausts
subsidiary has secured contracts to supply exhaust systems to Saab, the
General Motors-controlled executive car maker.
The contracts, worth Pounds 6m a year, mark a significant step in a drive by
Unipart to broaden its manufacturing customer base in Europe. Once primarily
a distributor and maker of parts for its former owner, Rover Group, Unipart
also began manufacturing components for Honda several years ago.
This year it has begun supplying Toyota's Derbyshire car plant with
flywheels, axle housings and shafts through Advanced Engineering Systems, a
joint venture with Beans Industries in which Unipart has an 80 per cent
stake.
The first-half profit increase was on sales 5.6 per cent higher at Pounds
353.2m (Pounds 334.6m). Profit before interest rose by 21 per cent to Pounds
11m. No tax was payable.
The company, which is 46 per cent owned by employees and managers, 20 per
cent by Rover and the remainder by institutions, has revalued the shares
bought for 5p by employees when Unipart was privatised in 1987. They now
stand at 980p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Kynoch down 67% and shares fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kynoch Group, the specialist healthcare company which underwent a capital
reconstruction at the beginning of the year, yesterday reported a 67 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126,000 for the first half of 1993.
The company also warned that with the expected improvement in orders in the
second half not materialising, full year figures were likely to be well
below the previous year's Pounds 958,000.
The shares reacted via a 9p fall to 38p.
Mr John Salkeld, chairman, said results were hit by lower turnover in the
steriliser and disinfector business, together with higher overhead costs.
The fall in steriliser sales resulted largely from budget restraints in the
National Health Service. Remedial action was however, being taken.
Half-year turnover increased to Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 6.99m), but earnings
per share fell from 1.6p to 0.3p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AAF shares tumble after heavy loss from
Blackburn business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in AAF Industries fell 51p to 77p as the modular buildings and alloy
wheels group announced that 'a very large loss' had been incurred in the
first half in its Blackburn system building business.
There would also be very large exceptional and non-recurring items as a
result of the closure of the Blackburn operations and their transfer to
Brandesburton in Yorkshire. The results for the six months to June 30 were
now expected to be delayed until October. The shares recovered 5p to close
at 82p.
On July 7, AAF issued a profits warning for the six months to June 30. This
also related to the Blackburn business and prompted a 66p share price plunge
to 125p.
Only two months previously the group had made a Pounds 7.65m rights issue,
which diluted the stake of W&amp;A Investment Corporation, the South African
consumer and industrial group, to 43.1 per cent.
Mr Alex Brown became chief operating officer of AAF at the time of the July
warning and he said the decision to close Blackburn was instigated by him.
As a result of the current difficulties in Blackburn, AAF needed additional
working capital. W&amp;A has guaranteed the provision of a Pounds 5.1m loan
facility to AAF. This has been fully drawn. Further, W&amp;A will provide an
unsecured loan facility of Pounds 4m.
Mr Jeffrey Liebesman, W&amp;A joint executive chairman and AAF non-executive
chairman, said W&amp;A was in no hurry to have the loan repaid. 'We are acting
as a white knight,' he said.

FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: CRH in IPounds 147m rights issue
for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, Dublin-based international construction and building materials group,
announced yesterday a one-for-five rights issue to raise IPounds 147m
(Pounds 135m) to finance acquisitions over the next two years. The size of
the issue, at IPounds 2.60 per share, surprised analysts and the shares
closed down 9p at 292p.
The announcement was made simultaneously with better-than-expected interim
results showing an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 25.1m
on turnover up 17 per cent to IPounds 647m for the six months to end-June.
At the same time the company reported two further building material
acquisitions in the US for IPounds 30m.
It is buying Pennsy Supply, a building materials supplier in Pennsylvania,
and Clemente-Latham Concrete, a ready-mix concrete supplier in upstate New
York.
They had combined sales of Dollars 46m last year.
Dublin analysts were surprised by the cash call, underwritten by UBS, given
the small size of the acquisitions identified so far.
They have upgraded their forecasts, however, for the full year on the back
of the interim result.
Mr John Conroy of NCB stockbrokers is predicting full-year earnings per
share of 18p, in anticipation of a better second half result and 'the two
eps-enhancing acquisitions in the US'.
Mr Jack Hayes, managing director for finance and development of the group,
said: 'We think it is a good time to be buying now, and we want to be able
to do so without overstretching ourselves.'
He said CRH has spent some IPounds 600m on acquisitions over the past decade
and a further IPounds 300m in capital investment, most of which has been
financed from cash flow. Only IPounds 104m has been raised since 1984 in one
rights issue and two placings.
Acquisitions totalling IPounds 100m are expected to be made this year,
including the latest two in the US, and similar spending is anticipated in
1994.
Mr Hayes said that without a rights issue, group gearing could approach 100
per cent. 'This could have acted as a constraint on new acquisitions. We
want to keep our flexibility to be able to move fast' he said.
Gearing will fall from 60 per cent at June 30, to just below 20 per cent
after the rights issue.
Earnings grew by 13 per cent to 6.98p (6.17p) in the half year, and an
interim dividend of 2.34p (2.25p) is declared.
COMMENT
This call by CRH on a market which is not awash with surplus cash is a
cheeky move by a group which has put in a good performance in comparison
with its industry peers. But it looks as though investors will buy the
explanation that CRH needs to finance a very aggressive acquisition
programme to consolidate its diversified base in the US and European
construction industries. With interest cover now almost half the level four
years ago, some strengthening of the balance sheet was called for. But CRH
will have to find the acquisitions quickly and deliver the earnings to
reward its shareholders' faith. A p/e of 16 on forecast earnings of 18p this
year indicates investor caution.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) slips to Pounds 8.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, the Northampton-based
housebuilder, property and construction group, slipped slightly in the first
half as lower property profits offset gains at Wilcon Homes, the
housebuilder.
In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax figure declined from Pounds 8.77m
to Pounds 8.22m while group turnover grew by some 5 per cent to Pounds 102m.
Earnings per share dropped to 2.9p (3.2p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.27p.
Mr Lynn Wilson, chairman, said the half year results demonstrated the
group's 'resilience,' and noted that the fall in interest rates 'has led to
a slow, but at times faltering, recovery in the UK housing market.'
Strong purchaser interest in the earlier part of the year helped the group
sell 1,600 houses in the first half, up 28 per cent over the 1,250 homes
sold in the 1992 period.
The average selling price was unchanged at Pounds 54,000 although
nationally, prices fell by about 5 per cent and as a result the group's
margins remained under pressure. Wilcon Homes managed to increase profits by
7 per cent to Pounds 7.96m (7.44m) on turnover of Pounds 88.5m (Pounds
69.6m).
During the period the group also purchased 2,400 plots, increasing its land
bank with planning permission from 13,300 at the end of December to 14,100.
Outside the core housebuilding business, Wilcon Construction's order book
and profits were both reduced, reflecting the uneconomic level of prices
obtainable by building contractors. Profits dipped from Pounds 262,000 to
Pounds 221,000 on increased turnover of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 16.3m).
Profits at Wilson Connolly Properties fell to Pounds 39,000 (Pounds 1.07m)
on turnover down to Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 12.3m) but the chairman said
business was'encouragingly active'.
At the end of June the group had cash balances of Pounds 10m and gearing,
including land creditors, stood at 10 per cent.
COMMENT
The 'lumpy' nature of property profits makes for unflattering year-on-year
comparisons despite the solid gains at Wilcon Homes. Although the
construction business has been contracting and is unlikely to show any real
improvement until 1995, brighter prospects for property in the second half
should help lift full-year pre-tax profits to around Pounds 23m and earnings
to about 8.2p per share. The shares slipped 7p to 192p yesterday, but still
leave the company on a lofty forward multiple of 23.4.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Scholl dips to Pounds 11.7m mid-way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH marketing and develop-ment investment cost Scholl, the healthcare
company, a dip in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.7m in the six months to June
30, compared with last time's Pounds 13.7m, which was flattered by Pounds
2.4m in higher investment and one-off gains.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said the company had so far outperformed
rivals as recession swept continental Europe: 'There is a problem and we
can't stay above it for ever. We can't be any more optimistic than other
people. I am terribly concerned about continental Europe even if we fared
fairly well.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 94.1m (Pounds 85.8m), with about 5 per cent of the
gain attributable to currency movements and the rest to improvements in
third party distribution sales, including a contract with Bristol Myers in
Germany, and about 26 per cent growth in the Asia region, and 6 per cent in
Australia.
The company made two acquisitions in the first half of 1992. The Scholl
retail chain in Canada opened four additional stores bringing the total to
24, with three more planned by the year end. The Gerard House herbal
remedies company increased distribution from about 1,800 to nearly 5,000
points of sale.
It bought Septivon, the antiseptic wash brand, in June from Elf Sanofi for
FF125m (Pounds 14.7m) cash, plus taxes of FF8.5m (Pounds 1m).
Scholl said results had been brought down at the half year by a change in
the business mix: 'We used to be in a situation where all profit was made in
the first half. Last year the split was roughly 75 per cent in the first
half and the remaining quarter in the second and this trend is likely to
continue this year.'
At halfway the company had Pounds 6m (Pounds 19.4m) in cash and borrowings
of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.8m).
The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.6p out of earnings of
9.3p (11.2p).

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Peek declines to Pounds 2.1m but wins
Pounds 6m Bangkok contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEK, the international traffic and field data systems company, has won a
contract to install a Pounds 6m computerised system for the volatile drivers
of Thailand's Bangkok.
Announcing pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 2.07m
(Pounds 2.81m) - down as a result of the loss on disposal of a discontinued
business - Mr Jim Sanger, finance director, said he was aware Bangkok
drivers had threatened violence over the congestion.
'We believe congestion will be eased but we have made no contractual
guarantees on the speed of traffic,' he said.
'Over the last four or five years we have established ourselves as the
number two in the traffic world and profits have been up over the last
couple of years.'
He stressed the need to move to larger contracts but 'not to take on too
many at a time'.
Turnover on continuing activities was virtually flat at Pounds 39.1m with a
Pounds 5.8m contribution from the acquisitions of Signal Control Company and
Signal Maintenance Inc in March.
Operating profits dipped to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 2.91m) as operating
expenses rose on higher investment in the Hong Kong and German markets and
in applied technology.
The company booked a loss of Pounds 544,000 on the sale of Navstar, a global
positioning systems company, as the transport industry failed to respond
quickly to the technology.
Peek received interest of Pounds 194,000 against payments of Pounds 92,000
last time as the company switched out of certificates of tax deposit
following the settlement of a tax liability.
The company had borrowings of Pounds 1.89m at the half way stage against
cash of Pounds 11.4m in the previous period after the two acquisitions and
as working capital in the Netherlands increased.
The board declared a maintained dividend of 1.05p out of earnings per share
of 1.11p (1.74p).

<TEXT>
CAMBRIDGE Group, the Dublin-based asset financing group, has reported
exceptionally heavy pre-tax losses of IPounds 35.4m (Pounds 33.4m) for the
15-month period to May 31 1993, resulting from IPounds 37.17m in provisions
and asset write-downs made by the company's new senior management team.
The result has wiped out shareholder's funds on the balance sheet.
Cambridge made a pre-tax profit of IPounds 5.02m for the year to February 28
1992, but in May this year the board became aware of 'doubtful debts' and
this was followed in June by the resignations of a number of the group's
executive directors.
A review of operations was then carried out by the new management. A company
statement said: 'The board is currently in discussion with the group's
bankers regarding a possible financial restructuring of the business.' An
extraordinary general meeting is to be convened to discuss the company's
future.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptionals behind Hillsdown fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hillsdown Holdings rose 7p to 172p yesterday, although the food
group announced that pre-tax profit fell 17 per cent, from Pounds 74.8m to
Pounds 62.3m, in the six months to June 30.
Hillsdown blamed the drop in profits on higher interest costs and said last
year's figure had been flattered by exceptional profits. Sales of continuing
operations increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 2.23bn, mainly because of the
acquisition of a continental chilled salads business last year.
Sir John Nott, the former cabinet minister who took over as chairman in
April, said the group's restructuring was expected to be completed ahead of
schedule and on budget, but would not produce early results.
The group expects to sell its eight remaining abattoirs and two meat plants
by the end of the year, completing its withdrawal from the red meat
slaughtering business.
More than half its property trading portfolio has been sold and the group
expects to get out of this business more quickly and at better prices than
initially expected.
Mr David Newton, chief executive, said reorganisation in the poultry
business was almost complete, with the weekly output of chickens having been
cut from 3.5m birds to 2m.
Mr Newton said Hillsdown had coped with the difficult trading brought on by
devaluation, which increased its raw material prices by up to 15 per cent.
It still faced difficult trading conditions but he forecast higher operating
margins from most divisions in the current half, as a result of having
achieved higher prices and the restructuring.
The chief executive said the biggest disappointment in the first half was a
weak performance by the European tea and beverage operations. Fierce
competition for market share and a big jump in the costs of imported raw
materials had reduced profitability.
The businesses were being merged under a new management team, which would
bring small reorganisation costs this year but help performance in future
years.
The non-foods division, which includes housebuilding and upholstered
furniture, had seen few signs of improvements in its markets but several
divestments had increased operating profits and margins.
Under FRS 3, earnings per share fell to 5.1p (6.4p). The group, which has
one of the highest yields in the market, held its interim at 2.2p and
intends to maintain the full-year dividend at 8.8p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: WBB beats off hostile Belgian bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATTS Blake Bearne, the 280-year Devon-based supplier of ball clay, has
retained its independence despite a hostile 420p-a-share cash bid by
Sibelco, a private Belgian company.
Sibelco, which produces silica sand for the glass industry, conceded defeat
yesterday after its mandatory cash offer for the British company lapsed.
WBB's stock closed unchanged at 430p.
Mr John Pike, WBB's managing director, said the group was 'very relieved and
glad' that the offer had lapsed and thanked shareholders for their
confidence and support. He noted that the company had been subject to offer
periods for most of the current year.
Sibelco was one of three original concert party partners who held a 45 per
cent stake in WBB. The bid was triggered when one partner, Ceramics
Holdings, decided to sell its stake to Sibelco, lifting the Belgian
company's stake to 30.4 per cent.
Subsequently, in August, Sibelco also acquired the shares of the third
concert party partner, Quarzwerke of Germany.

SHARES in Amstrad, the consumer electronics company run by Mr Alan Sugar,

negotiating to buy Dancall, the Danish mobile telephone manufacturer which
is in payments suspension.
Berlingske Tidende, the national newspaper, quoted Mr Sugar as saying: 'We
are ready to buy. Whether the deal comes off depends now on the creditors.'
The newspaper added that Amstrad's offer would be considered at a creditors'
meeting on Monday.
There was no immediate confirmation from Amstrad yesterday, but Mr Sugar has
often expressed his interest in expanding the group's telecommunications
equipment side.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Piech says VW is too fat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume carmaker, is a duck which has grown too
fat to fly, according to chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech.
But it has sprouted a new feather - a DM12m (Pounds 4.8m) group profit in
July - and more are growing all the time, he said yesterday.
All the profit, compared with a DM1.6bn loss in the first half of the year,
stemmed from improvements at the German parent company, where Mr Piech and
his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua,
have focused much effort.
The workforce had responded with stunning enthusiasm to the implementation
of a refined continuous improvement programme, Mr Piech said. Productivity
targets for this year in German plants had been achieved in only six months.
'I was faced with having to move a two-tonne rock. It was impossible but I
got so much help that now it is rolling and gathering momentum like a
flywheel,' he claimed. The workforce had promised to deliver quality in the
VW range by next year comparable with that of the Toyota Lexus luxury car.
But Seat, the Spanish subsidiary, remains firmly grounded, and is one of the
main causes of Mr Piech's recent retreat from confident forecasts of the
group breaking even this year. He limited his forecasts to a promise that
the parent company, which earned a net DM447m last year, would show a profit
for 1993.
Audi, VW's luxury car division, is also in less publicised difficulties.
Output is down 34 per cent this year, according to Mr Franz-Josef Kortum,
chairman.
'At the end of the year we shall be able to break even only if we do not
lose any more sales,' he said.
World sales had fallen 26 per cent, and Britain was the only market to
register an increase. Deliveries to customers were up 26 per cent - compared
with an overall rise in car sales of 9 per cent - to 17,000 in the first
eight months.

FT  08 SEP 93 / MGN may save Pounds 70m through Maxwell agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has provisionally agreed to settle a series of legal
disputes with the private companies in the empire of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell which would save it nearly Pounds 70m in tax and costs.
The agreement, described in a circular sent to MGN shareholders yesterday,
removes the potential for lengthy and uncertain court action. It may also
help ease the sale of the 54.8 per cent of MGN shares held by the private
Maxwell companies.
Under the plan, MGN will abandon potential net claims of at least Pounds
130m against the private companies in connection with money siphoned off by
Mr Maxwell. Administrators to the private companies, from accountants Arthur
Andersen, will in turn waive counter legal actions against MGN and allow it
to release Pounds 19m in provisions.
In exchange for a payment of up to Pounds 2.8m, MGN will be assigned losses
from the private companies which will reduce its tax bill by up to Pounds
56m for the period 1989-91.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of MGN, said: 'The directors have concluded that
the benefits  .. and removal of uncertainties significantly outweigh any
benefits which might accrue from pursuing large but potentially difficult
and uncertain claims.'
The circular says that the money which MGN could claim from the private
empire includes Pounds 80m owed to it by Robert Maxwell Group, Pounds 30m
from London and Bishopsgate Group and Pounds 20m from Bishopsgate Investment
Trust. But Mr John Allwood, MGN's finance director, said that since the
private companies were insolvent, any eventual payments would be unlikely to
exceed 6p in the pound.
He said MGN would be able to reduce its provisions relating to the
misappropriated funds from Pounds 50m to Pounds 35m as a result of the
settlement, and release up to Pounds 4m in tax provisions.
The agreement proposes that Robert Maxwell Holdings (RMH), one of the
private companies, will split equally with MGN up to Pounds 10m of any costs
in connection with a claim brought against the empire by Banque Nationale de
Paris over a lease at Worship Street in London.
The settlement does not cover outstanding litigation on a lease at Orbit
House in London, and several insurance policies concerning Mr Maxwell.
MGN will retain the right to make legal claims against private companies
other than RMH, but will allow RMH to retain the first Pounds 7.5m of any
recoveries.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the settlement at an extraordinary
general meeting to be held on September 23 in London.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Williams hints at disposals move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is to focus on three of its
five core businesses with the clear implication that engineering and
electronics are up for sale.
The new strategy was outlined by Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, as he unveiled
static pre-tax profits of Pounds 76.4m (against Pounds 76.2m) for the
half-year ending June. The shares fell 7p to 326p.
Williams is to concentrate on building products in Europe and the US and
fire and safety where many of its brand names, such as Yale &amp; Valor and
Thorn Fire Protection, are market leaders.
However, engineering and electronics, which suffered profit falls and
account for around 10 per cent of the group's revenue, are understood to be
prime candidates for disposal.
Many of their businesses, such as Fairey Engineering, are only number two in
the market.
The desire to dispose of non-market leaders was one of the main reasons
which prompted Williams to sell Crown Berger paints in 1990.
Mr Rudd, while declining to comment directly on the future of engineering
and electronics, said: 'We are focusing on three core businesses which we
expect to grow organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.'
Borrowings have increased to Pounds 210.5m (from Pounds 161.9m) representing
gearing of 56 per cent. The rise in debt is mainly due to acquisitions.
Williams has been looking at possible acquisitions with a price tag of up to
Pounds 300m on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Rudd singled out Germany as
offering interesting buying opportunities.
Mr Roger Carr, managing director, said: 'Our investors have told us, without
exception, that they will support the right deal.'
Operating profit rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 86.4m on increased sales of
Pounds 589.9m (from Pounds 493.8m). Last year's pre-tax profits benefited
from an exceptional Pounds 6.1m, which included the disposal of its Racal
shareholding.
European consumer and building products saw operating profits rise to Pounds
36.2m (from Pounds 32.2m) on the back of a strong performance from DIY
products.
North American consumer and building products, benefiting from cost
reduction and the stronger dollar, increased profits to Pounds 25.1m (from
Pounds 20.7m).
Fire and safety's profits rose to Pounds 20.2m (against Pounds 17.5m)
excluding a four-month contribution from Thorn Fire Protection which was
acquired earlier this year from Thorn EMI.
Profits from electronics and engineering fell to Pounds 1.6m (from Pounds
5.6m) and Pounds 3.3m (against Pounds 4.3m) respectively.
Earnings per share fell to 8.4p (from 9p), although excluding exceptionals
earnings rose from 7.7p. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Fisons held back by losses in instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits for the first six months to June 30 at the lower
end of expectations. Profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds
46.4m.
Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 651m, but was boosted by currency
changes. The results were held back by a poor performance from the
scientific instrument operations which fell into loss. Fisons's shares fell
6 1/2 p to 170 1/2 p.
Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, said Fisons was looking
to license a number of asthma compounds. These included products either
fully developed or in late development, which could be co-marketed by
Fisons. The aim would be to fill the gap left by Tipredane, the asthma drug
halted in April.
Fisons was also looking for agreements to develop other compounds in the
early stages, said Mr Redmond.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said he still did not know when
officials from the US Food and Drug Administration would visit the factory
of Opticrom, the eye product. The treatment was withdrawn from the US in
1989 following FDA concerns over manufacturing procedures.
Mr Scroggs said the importance of Opticrom's relaunch was becoming
increasingly less significant. Its US patents expire next September and the
company has formed a strategic alliance with Allergan, a US group, to
co-market Opticrom's main competitor, Acular.
Trading profits at the pharmaceuticals division rose from Pounds 22.3m to
Pounds 29.4m on sales up 22 per cent at Pounds 213.7m. At constant exchange
rates, the sales increase was 6 per cent. Profits were helped by sales rises
in the US and manufacturing savings, but were affected by health reforms in
Germany and Italy, said Mr Scroggs.
Sales of Tilade, the new asthma product, rose 13.6 per cent. Mr Redmond said
there had been 27,000 prescriptions for it in the US in the six weeks after
its launch in June.
Operating profits at the scientific equipment business fell from Pounds
17.1m to Pounds 13.2m. The instruments business made a loss of about Pounds
2m. Customers were putting off capital investment and competitors' price
cuts were affecting margins.
Earnings per share were steady at 4.2p. The dividend was unchanged at 3.3p.

FT  08 SEP 93 / High price to pay for drifting off course: Japan's
steelmakers face lean years if there is no domestic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade of diversification has led Japanese steel-makers back to where they
began, confronted by declining demand for core steel products, a bloated
workforce, and the prospect of several years of red ink.
In forecasting a loss for the year, Nippon Steel, the world's largest
steelmaker, admitted yesterday that a restructuring begun in the mid-1980s,
in response to rapid yen appreciation, had drifted off course.
The yen has strengthened this year, but the diversification projects
intended to carry the steel industry through the difficult times have become
a burden. Nippon Steel and other leading makers expanded well beyond their
expertise into leisure, including an artificial beach and ski slope, burglar
alarms and a mushroom farm.
Many of these projects were affordable as long as sales were rising for
steel products, which profited in the late 1980s from a surge of orders from
the construction, car and electronics industries. From a low of 98m tonnes
in 1986, crude steel production rose to 110m tonnes in 1990.
But the good times are definitely over. Crude steel production last year
slipped back to 98m tonnes, and demand is still falling from traditional
customers within Japan. Even exports to China, which doubled in the first
half, are fading as a result of Beijing's attempts to slow its speeding
economy.
Mr Minoru Udono, steel industry specialist at James Capel Pacific, said the
leading steelmakers may face two or three years of losses, unless there is a
strong domestic recovery.
Nippon Steel's decision to skip its interim dividend 'is a bad sign',
according to Mr Udono. 'It means they are not expecting to return to profits
very quickly. 'The unprofitable diversifications must be ended. The
diversifications have been doing worse than the steel business. They face
very difficult decisions on reducing their workforces.'
Mr Udono estimates that the steel industry has a 17 per cent surplus of
workers, but cannot afford to establish new new non-steel subsidiaries in
which to park them, as is traditional in Japan. Nippon Steel hinted
yesterday that it would cut administrative staff to reduce costs, and other
makers may be forced to do more than allow workers to retire voluntarily.
Kawasaki Steel said this week that about 200 workers aged 20 to 30 would be
transferred from steelmaking to other companies in the group. Most transfers
in Japan are of workers over of 45, who are put out to pasture in affiliates
or subsidiaries.
Japanese media interpeted the decision as a sign that other parts of the
group did not want the middle-aged, middle-managers, but would take lower
paid, younger staff. Kawasaki Steel said the programme was intended to
'strengthen the management of group companies'.
Kawasaki's response reflects the industry's sensitivity to suggestions that
Japan's lifetime employment system could crumble in the steel industry. But
a call last month by Nippon Steel for a cut in salaries is an indication of
the extreme pressure on steelmakers to reduce costs.
Cost-cutting is needed partly because the companies are facing an increase
in depreciation charges, another by-product of their investment binge during
the 'bubble days'. At Kawasaki, capital spending rose from Y72.8bn in the
year to March 1989 to Y184.8bn in the year to March 1991.
These investments gave the company new plant and equipment just as the
economy was slowing. Capital investment was trimmed in the year to March
1993 to Y139.8bn, but depreciation charges in the same year were Y121.1bn,
rising from Y117.1bn and Y102.4bn in the two preceding periods.
Kobe Steel has already revised its long-term management plan, drafted in
December 1991. Capital spending over the next three years is estimated at
around Y60bn annually, down by about half from the 1990-1992 period.
If domestic recovery does not come quickly, the steelmakers may have to
abandon part or all of their most cherished diversification, the excursion
into electronics. All five leading steelmakers are making semiconductors or
computer-related equipment, and must decide whether they can afford the
enormous outlays needed to keep pace in these industries.
The steelmakers have always seen themselves as the producers of Japan's
'industrial rice', and their interest in semiconductors was prompted by the
belief that this sector would provide the 'industrial rice' of the future.
For this year, at least, the harvest does not look promising.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steel company, yesterday announced that it
would post at least Y15bn (Pounds 98m) in pre-tax losses for the year
because of the prolonged economic slump and the sharp appreciation of the
yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company had earlier hoped for a
pre-tax profit of Y20bn.
Other steelmakers - Kobe, Kawasaki, NKK and Sumitomo Metal Industries - are
scheduled to revise forecasts on Friday.
Mr Shigeru Omori, Nippon Steel's vice-president, admitted the losses would
be greater, but for realisation of profits from its securities portfolio. It
will skip its interim dividend. Sales for the first half are expected to
fall 8 per cent to Y1,090bn. The company revised its forecast for first-half
year losses down from Y5bn to Y15bn. For the second half, Mr Omori said:
'The best our company can hope for is to post no profits but no losses
either.' In 1992-93 pre-tax profits plunged by 71.2 per cent to Y28.9bn.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Deal gives S African blacks government role: Multiracial
council will oversee transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's constitutional negotiators last night reached a milestone
deal to bring blacks into central government for the first time, by agreeing
to establish a multiparty Transitional Executive Council to oversee the
transfer to democracy.
The authority of the council will be limited, not least by the fact that the
ruling National party is likely to be able to block the council's decisions
in the most important areas. But the council marks the end of 45 years of
exclusive National party rule, and represents a big psychological victory
for black liberation movements - especially the African National Congress,
which has fought apartheid for decades.
The council, which will include one member from each of about 20 parties
negotiating a new constitution, marks the first step towards full
multiracial government. It is the first sign of concrete progress from
constitutional talks that have dragged on for months.
It may ease frustrations in South Africa's black townships, where patience
with the process is wearing thin, and will lead to the lifting of remaining
international economic sanctions apart from oil and arms embargoes.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, said last night that the decision represented
'another step' towards lifting sanctions, adding that he expected the ANC to
call for their removal later this month. The TEC will take office only when
agreement has been reached on a new constitution - which might still take
weeks or months.
Equally, its installation might provoke a further surge in violence, with
the ultra-right Conservative party and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi vowing to oppose it. The Conservative party said at the
weekend that it would regard the installation of the TEC as a declaration of
civil war, and Inkatha has said it will not respect the TEC's authority in
the KwaZulu black homeland, which it controls.
Other homeland governments have also rejected the council, although most -
including Chief Buthelezi - are leaving open the option of joining the
council later if the new constitution meets their demands.
The TEC will have legally binding powers to act, but only in areas directly
affecting the forthcoming multiracial elections, planned for April 27 next
year.
Its authority will be further circumscribed by the fact that the South
Arican government (one of the parties to the council) will have what amounts
to a veto over its decisions, which must be taken by majorities ranging from
65 per cent to 80 per cent.
Government officials believe Pretoria and its allies could muster the votes
necessary to block TEC decisions.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Smith pledges raise hopes over party-union reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, improved his chances of winning his battle
with some of Britain's biggest unions over the reform of party-union links
yesterday by promising to strengthen employment rights and union recognition
laws.
In a speech to the Trades Union Congress at Brighton, which was warmly
welcomed by many of his union opponents in the debate over party reform, Mr
Smith made a vigorous defence of trade unionism.
In a significant shift in Labour employment policy, Mr Smith said all
workers should be covered by employment protection legislation from their
first day at work instead of after a two-year probationary period. He also
said the unions should have a right to recognition by employers.
The Labour leader's speech was immediately attacked by Mr David Hunt, the
employment secretary, as 'the same old failed formulas which would increase
unemployment and undermine competitiveness'.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, who is Mr Smith's leading
opponent in the dispute over party-union links, said: 'There is no doubt
that this speech has improved the mood marvellously. It has put the
constitutional tiff over selection of candidates into perspective. We all
want a solution.'
Many delegates said Mr Smith's speech was the most pro-union they had heard
from a Labour leader for a long time. Some commentators interpreted it as an
attempt by Mr Smith to distance himself from party 'modernisers'.
In spite of Mr Smith's positive tone, it was not clear whether he would win
the vote at the party conference over the introduction of one member, one
vote in the selection of parliamentary candidates.
But his speech may have helped to sway the conference delegations of unions
such as Nupe, the public-service union, and Usdaw, the shopworkers' union.
Some union leaders suggested that neither side would be able to win a
majority.
Before speaking to the TUC, Mr Smith said he remained committed to his
reforms, 'and I believe they will be carried by the party conference'.
In his speech, Mr Smith said that Britain's record on employment rights was
'a national humiliation' and he accused the government of advertising
Britain as a cheap labour site. He said employees should be 'full partners
in economic decision-making'.
On broader economic issues, Mr Smith impressed some of the party
leadership's critics. Making a firm commitment to full employment, he said:
'All instruments of macroeconomic management whether interest rates, the
exchange rate, or the levels of borrowing will be geared to sustained growth
and rising employment.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Gas leak at Thorp N-fuel plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF were evacuated from Thorp, the controversial nuclear reprocessing
plant in Cumbria, after a gas leak during tests yesterday.
British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, said last night that 'the work
being carried out was non-radioactive'. It added that there was only a
'slight' escape of gas outside the plant, which posed no danger to the
public.
The leak, which is highly embarrassing for BNF, comes at a sensitive time in
the long-running debate about whether the Pounds 2.8bn plant should get a
licence to start operation.
The current public consultation on the plant's future, the second in the
past year, is due to decide in the autumn whether to give the go-ahead to
the plant, which reprocesses used nuclear fuel.
BNF said last night the incident was embarrassing 'in a way' but added: 'The
tests are being carried out to make sure things do work properly.' The leak
of nitrogen dioxide, which can cause breathing difficulties, occurred at
3.30pm, and BNF sent 280 staff 'in the immediate vicinity' outside the
building. Twenty-five workers were taken to the medical surgery at the West
Cumbrian site for examination before being allowed home. Some are to have a
further medical check today.
Last week BNF won court permission to begin radioactive tests of the
500-metre-long plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build. But next
week it faces another court challenge from Greenpeace, the pressure group,
which will attempt to halt the tests on the ground that they prejudice the
government's eventual decision.
BNF said last night that the leaking gases were not part of the uranium
testing. Greenpeace said: 'Thorp is meant to be the ultimate in technology
and if BNF can't keep the non-radioactive materials under control, it does
not bode well for the safety of the whole plant.'
It added: 'This has been a bad year for them with leaks.' Earlier in the
year, radioactive gases escaped from two other, unconnected parts of the
Sellafield site.
Yesterday's leak occurred while the gas was being used to test the
ventilation in part of the plant.

FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having repaired relations with the US authorities and restored the balance
sheet to health, Fisons' new management must somehow deliver earnings
growth. Much depends on the recent US launch of Tilade, its new asthma drug.
A joint marketing agreement with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer might avoid the kind of
disappointing launches seen elsewhere. But with Intal, the old faithful,
losing patent protection next year and a pipeline short on promise, nothing
less than an unqualified success will do.
In the meantime, scientific equipment, which accounts for half of sales, is
suffering. The low-margin business supplying laboratory equipment continues
to plod along. But manufacturing high-value scientific instruments has
turned out to be highly cyclical. Despite the competitive gain from
devaluation, that division is trading at a loss. Margins will remain
depressed until customers feel confident about ordering expensive capital
equipment. Buying VG Instruments on a multiple of around 20 times near-peak
earnings in 1989 - funded with a rights issue at 211p - must be counted a
serious error.
Robbed of rising cash flow from instruments, and facing heavy capital
expenditure commitments, Fisons is being squeezed. Disposals have helped
relieve the pressure on cash flow. But with only the UK and European
horticultural businesses still to go - and no sign of a buyer  - cash from
that direction can not be relied upon. All the more reason to hope that the
US launch of Tilade is a success.

FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After running around like a headless chicken buying businesses in the 1980s,
Hillsdown is now restoring some sanity to its sprawling empire. Its
management is proving brutally effective in knocking the business into
shape. Although trading profits remained static in the first half at Pounds
81m, Hillsdown squeezed Pounds 50m more cash from its operations. Over the
past year, it has chopped Pounds 400m of low-margin commodity sales.
Much remains to be done while complaints about Hillsdown's exposure to
cyclical businesses remain as valid as ever. With refreshing candour,
Hillsdown admits it does not have much choice about its current strategy of
simply improving what it has got. Gearing of 42 per cent precludes any big
moves into higher value-added areas. It would be hard to get a rights issue
away, while the poor performance of Premier Brands hardly inspires
confidence that Hillsdown is the best of brand managers anyway.
For the moment, investors will have to content themselves with the secure
dividend: Hillsdown remains the fifth highest yielding stock in the FT-SE
350 despite its shares rising from 74p to 172p since last September. At some
point, attention must switch to earnings prospects. A multiple currently
matching that of Unilever either suggests the market is being wildly
optimistic about Hillsdown's recovery or - more probably - that it is unduly
glum about the Anglo-Dutch giant.

FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the failure of its bid for Racal, Williams has been bereft of
direction. A low share rating has curbed its acquisitive inclinations and
the company seemed in any case uncertain of its ability to clinch a large
deal at the right price. Instead it has kept its head down in the hope of
raising its rating with a spot of organic growth. Yesterday's interim
figures were not good enough to meet this aim. Underlying cash flow has
improved, but operating profits were up less then 8 per cent and gearing is
58 per cent.
Now Williams aims to improve its image further by focusing on building and
consumer products, and fire and safety. The implication is that its two
other divisions - electronics, which is heavily dependent on the German car
industry, and engineering, which suffers from the erratic flow of defence
orders - could be sold. It would be rash to expect any quick developments,
but such disposals could eventually create leeway for a large acquisition
which would not have to be financed by expensive equity.
The question is whether this would be an appropriate course. Williams has
cleaned up its accounts. It has no reason to make a special virtue of this,
though, and the absence of provisions on its new bolt-on acquisitions simply
underlines how remote are the old buccaneering days. If it really wants to
restore its rating, it also needs to demonstrate that it can use the
economic recovery to generate sufficient cash to reduce gearing. That will
take time. At least patience is rewarded by a yield approaching 5 per cent.

small business or sole trader and higher-end domestic customer who would
value mobility. The clear publicity coup of free local calls in off-peak
periods will grab headlines and doubtless fire the aspirant imagination. It
may also ease the pain of forking out around Pounds 300 for a handset,
though even that may not be much of a barrier, given the large sums spent on
other domestic gizmos.
While the target group and pricing will help expand the telecoms market,
One-2-One will hurt other operators. Despite the smoke thrown up by Vodafone
and Cellnet to confuse price perceptions, existing cellular tariffs will be
increasingly seen as excessive. The best tactic may be to cede market share
to the new entrant as long as the loss of customers is not too great. Yet
lower margins will come. What is less certain is whether Vodafone or Cellnet
can expand their markets rapidly enough to compensate for the fall. If they
cannot, current valuations look high, whatever AT&amp;T may have paid for McCaw.
BT cannot entirely ignore the threat either. The two trends in telecoms  -
more cable and multimedia in fixed links and increasing mobility for voice -
are both attractive to BT's wealthier customers. BT thus faces a competitive
challenge to its best prospects. Since it is currently banned from cable, it
had better make the most of mobile. Yet Cellnet has always been a laggard.
It may be time for BT to get a better grip.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Rabin stands firm on signing Palestinian deal: Armed
Israelis march against agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, dismissed opponents of an
historic Palestinian-Israeli deal as 'prattlers and liars' yesterday and
said he would not be deflected from signing the agreement.
Speaking as thousands of Israeli demonstrators, some armed with revolvers,
marched on his office, Mr Rabin said protests 'won't budge me at all' from
concluding the deal.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton formally offered to host a signing
ceremony for the agreement in the White House on September 13, if details of
the accord have then been completed.
The sticking point remained final agreement between Israel and the PLO on
the precise terms governing statements of mutual recognition, after which
both sides would be ready to sign the declaration of principles governing
interim Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in Cairo that this last hurdle
should be solved 'within 24 hours'.
Israel is seeking commitments from the PLO over its covenant. Palestinian
officials say they are prepared to supply such commitments, but say any
change in the organisation's charter would require the endorsement of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile - something Mr
Arafat and his colleagues wish to finesse to avoid both delay and potential
internal opposition to the accord.
Mr Arafat left Cairo for Oman yesterday. He is due to return to PLO
headquarters in Tunis today for a meeting of the organisation's executive
committee, or cabinet, to discuss the accord.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told the Financial Times that while
there were still differences between the two sides over mutual recognition,
he was 'cautiously optimistic' that the gap could be bridged by the weekend.
In spite of yesterday's demonstration - which gathered under the banner
'Israel is in danger, don't give in' - political momentum in Israel
continued to gather behind the deal.
Mr Zalman Shoval, a leading member of the opposition rightwing Likud party,
conceded in an interview that his party had little option but to accept the
agreement and look forward to a general election in 1996.
He said: 'It is a done deal. It is irreversible.'
Mr Moshe Shahal, the police minister, said he was deploying 2,500 police to
prevent the demonstrators from carrying out their threat to blockade Mr
Rabin's office.
Meanwhile, Israel suggested that international donors should provide Dollars
50m (Pounds 33m) in immediate aid to the occupied territories. Prof Jacob
Frankel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said such a transfusion should be
provided to effect a 'visible improvement' in conditions.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Fragile hopes light the horizon: The Israeli-PLO
rapprochement could lead to a wider peace in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outsiders have long been bemused by the tendency of Israelis to liken their
dour prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, to France's General de Gaulle. But as
the Israeli populace awakens with a mixture of anxiety, cynicism and fragile
hope to the possibility of Arab-Israeli peace, it is beginning to look as if
the comparison is not far off the mark.
As French president in the 1950s and early 1960s, De Gaulle fought a brutal
war against Algerians seeking to shake off colonial rule, then sat down with
the Front de Liberation National (FLN) to negotiate peace. Now the
71-year-old Mr Rabin, who is also minister of defence, is shuffling his way
to a similarly historic deal with the Arabs with whom Israel has been in
conflict since its foundation in 1948.
The next few days should see the signing of an agreement between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organisation - a movement consciously modelled on
the FLN - that will permit Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Middle East war, to take incremental
control of their own affairs.
As important, the two sides may exchange letters of mutual recognition in
which PLO leaders will renounce violence and call a halt to the intifada,
the six-year-old Palestinian uprising in the territories - thus setting out
together down a road that could lead to an independent Palestinian state.
In embarking on this course, Israel's Labour-led coalition government is out
to crack the issue of the Palestinians, which is at the heart of the
Arab-Israeli conflict. If it succeeds, the Israeli government and the PLO
will have broken the logjam obstructing progress towards a wider peace
between Israel and the Arab states to its north and east.
And the vision that some Israeli leaders have dreamed of for years - a
Middle East devoted to economic co-operation rather than condemned to war -
could start to become reality. Small wonder the Tel Aviv stock exchange has
this week been hitting all-time highs.
The enthusiasm is, of course, somewhat premature. A lot could still go wrong
on all sides. For the time being Mr Rabin, a cautious and hard-headed man,
is sensibly keeping the lowest of profiles, confining himself to terse
public statements about the need for 'painful compromises' with hated
enemies and leaving his foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, who negotiated
the PLO deal in Norway a fortnight ago, to make all the running.
Other Israeli leaders, from President Ezer Weizman down, are warning that
the hard part - negotiation of detail on security arrangements in the
occupied territories, and the separation of peoples whose lives have become
horribly entwined in the past 25 years - still lies ahead. 'We've just
broken through the barbed wire,' the head of state said this week, deploying
a characteristically homespun military metaphor. 'It's the hardest part of
the battle when you start to break through.'
But the negotiating process has now established such momentum that it is
difficult to see how Israel, the PLO or sceptical Arab states such as Syria
could revert to business quite as usual even if the advance gets bogged
down.
In Israel, the prospect of peace agreements has burst forth so suddenly that
the public is still dazed. Right-wing opponents of the deal with the
Palestinians, such as Likud party leader Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, are
mustering their forces, accusing Mr Rabin of negotiating a deal that will
mortally endanger Israel's security. Jerusalem is festooned with banners
proclaiming virulent opposition to Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic slice of Syrian territory also seized in 1967. And last
night, radical Jewish settler groups from the occupied territories were
setting out to barricade Mr Rabin in his office for 24 hours in protest.
But the opposition is divided, with Likud still smarting from a divisive
leadership election. What is more, there are growing signs the right is out
of touch with the Israeli mainstream. The settlers number only 4 per cent of
Israeli Jews, and even some of them are resigned to giving up their homes.
While the fears and uncertainties should not be underestimated, most polls
show a clear, if narrow, majority of Israelis backing the current peace
deal. In time, if Israelis and Palestinians show they can co-exist as
equals, the majority could even become substantial enough to permit the
territorial compromises that will be necessary to achieve a final settlement
of the conflict.
'There is a general mood in the country that the present agreement in
principle is something we should support because we are tired of wars,' said
Professor Shlomo Ben-Ami of Tel Aviv university. 'People are worried, they
want to know more about what is going on. But basically the majority of
Israelis have turned against strong ideological positions.'
This week's events are the product of a long and painful evolution of
Israeli as well as Palestinian opinion, and of a remarkable political
double-act between Mr Rabin and Mr Peres, two men who cordially detest one
another and who respectively represent the hawkish and dovish faces of the
coalition elected just over a year ago.
A country that has lost 18,000 dead in Arab-Israeli wars cannot find it easy
to contemplate peace. A people almost eliminated in the Holocaust still
lives in fear - sometimes justified, sometimes irrational - for its
existence. And the Palestinians, the people dispossessed of a country when
the Jewish state was born, have long been the incarnation in Israeli eyes of
the forces that threaten the country's survival.
That Mr Rabin now seems prepared to concede them the beginnings of the state
they denied themselves in rejecting the 1940s partition of Palestine
reflects more than war-weariness. It constitutes an existential choice, born
of the intifada and the realisation that 5m Israelis could not afford,
financially or morally, to seek indefinitely to control the territories and
their 1.9m Arab inhabitants.
Maintaining a hated military occupation is a burden that a small state with
a vigorous democracy and a desire for international acceptance could not
bear for ever. And the uprising was a vivid expression of the Palestinians'
desire for political rights of their own.
As a senior government figure put it yesterday, Israel had to decide: it
could grant them such rights as Israeli citizens, thus becoming a binational
state; it could expel the Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza as urged by
voices on the extreme right, and in the violent process destroy its moral
legitimacy; or it could practise a form of apartheid by openly treating them
as second-class citizens. 'Judaism and racism are in contradiction by their
very essence,' said the official. 'Any such idea would mean we were not a
Jewish state.'
Or it could allow the Palestinians to rule their own lives as a separate
people. 'No doubt they are an entirely different entity from us -
religiously, politically, you could even say nationally,' the senior
official added, in a sign of how far government thinking has moved.
The road to that separation is complex and perilous. The proposed interim
self-rule agreement is supposed to start with a redeployment of Israeli
troops from Gaza and an area around Jericho and an early handover of powers
in those areas to a Palestinian authority. Much detail, such as how Israeli
forces still present to protect Israeli settlers will work with a proposed
Palestinian police force, has still to be negotiated. Opposition to the deal
among Palestinians is such that the result could be horrific intra-Arab
violence, and nobody has come up with a plausible answer as to how Israel
would respond.
There is also a danger that the politics could turn sour - especially if Mr
Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman and self-styled president of Palestine, claims
his state before the Israelis are ready to discuss it, or seeks to pre-empt
the ultra-sensitive question of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their
capital.
But as both sides keep acknowledging, this is very much an interim agreement
in which such issues are left for final negotiation in a few years. If it is
signed, both sides will have an enormous incentive to make it work, not
least by improving the economic lot of the Palestinians in the territories
and combating the Islamic fundamentalism that breeds in the slums of Gaza.
If they do, it is more than likely that Palestinian statehood - possibly in
a loose confederation with Jordan - will be up for discussion before too
long.
And at that point Israel would be well on the way to attaining the status so
long denied it - that of a normal state at the heart of the Middle East,
able to devote its considerable intellectual and commercial talents towards
sorting out its economic problems and taking a leading role in the
development of its neighbourhood.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Job for Mr Hunt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government may not have finished with the trade unions yet. As
the increasingly depressed and depleted band of brothers and sisters confers
this week at the annual Trades Union Congress, Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, is saying that options for further curbs on union activities are
still being reviewed.
However, if the government continues to pursue the unions, it will find
itself engaged in an activity yielding diminishing returns. The quest to
strengthen individual employment rights and, at the same time, cut the red
tape that business deplores, could be conducted more profitably elsewhere.
Mr Hunt should look first at the creaking industrial tribunal system which -
as reported in the Financial Times yesterday - is currently failing
employers and employees alike. What was once supposed to be a quick route to
justice has become bogged down in legalism and excessive delays.
The recession and an increasing awareness by workers of their rights have
led to a sharp increase in the number of cases registered: in 1990-91, there
were about 43,000 applications to tribunals; for 1992-93, the figure stood
at just under 72,000. Half of these cases have to wait six months to be
dealt with - and in London delays of a year are not uncommon.
As the jurisdiction of tribunals continues to widen with each new piece of
employment legislation, and rulings from Brussels and Luxembourg further
complicate matters, the system is beginning to buckle. It is time for a
fundamental review by the government of options for reform.
Three proposals, in particular, should be given serious consideration.
First, the current arrangements which require representatives of both
employers and employees to sit alongside a legally qualified tribunal
chairman in almost all cases should re-examined. Speedier and cheaper would
be to appoint one specialised and highly qualified individual who could
adopt a more inquisitorial approach.
Second, as the Engineering Employers' Federation has suggested, the tangle
of case law built up over the last 30 years could be replaced by a set of
modern codes of employment practice. Tribunals would refer to the codes,
freeing both employers and applicants from the need to employ lawyers in
almost all cases.
Finally, where both sides agree, arbitration, perhaps under the auspices of
the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, could be made available
for individual employment grievances - a move which would help to relieve
the pressure on the tribunals.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Green agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EMOTIONS about the environment run deep, as the FT's postbag in response to
a summer series of leading articles about green issues has demonstrated.
The core of our argument has been that the costs and benefits of
environmental policies must be established as precisely as possible and that
priorities should be set on the basis of those calculations and judgments.
This is the inescapable task of the next phase of environmental politics,
which must try to implement the rafts of regulation which governments have
written in the last two decades. Everyone should consider that legislative
effort a success; we should also learn from it.
The costs of going green need to be made explicit, particularly as recession
has deepened reservations about meeting the bill. If people are ignorant of
price, their environmental demands may be limitless. But when UK water
companies this summer asked their customers where they would like money
spent, the results confounded those who say that customers cannot make hard
environmental choices. More on getting lead out of drinking water, even at
the expense of better sewage treatment, was the clear answer.
Governments and pressure groups also need to do a better job of helping
people judge which trends pose the greatest risk to their health. One global
'danger' after another has provoked anxiety: from over-population to food
and energy shortages, to ice ages and then global warming.
Some of these have stood the test of time more than others: the risk of
global warming, the FT has argued, should head the current list. Some look
overblown, such as fear of nuclear power, genetic engineering, ozone holes
or loss of species. The UK's Health and Safety Executive, a government
agency, has published perceptive reports pointing out that people's fears
often correspond poorly to the risk of disaster.
There are limits to the precision with which economists can value
environmental preferences, but those who resists attempts to price the
environment are more often than not wishing, undemocratically, to impose
their preferences upon others.
The public has shown strong support for green issues in the past two
decades; in the past two years it has also shown realism about the costs.
But a healthy debate requires accurate information about the state of the
environment, which governments have frequently failed to provide. The green
wish list is long and there is no sign that the world is willing to pay for
all of it.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Lines drawn for mobile warfare: Andrew Adonis on growing
rivalry in the phone market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until now, competition in the UK cellular phone industry has done little to
contain excessive profits. If Mercury One-2-One, the new network launched
yesterday, continues as it has started with its offer of free calls, the
industry's licence to print money may be cancelled. But it is fantasy to
think that, as a result, the mobile phone will compete head-on with the
fixed-line phone in the immediate future.
Yet Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, declared BT was the 'real
target' when he unveiled One-2-One. He said anyone would be 'mad' to use a
BT fixed phone in preference to a One-2-One cellular phone for local calls
in the evening and at week-ends.
Mad, up to a point. Local calls on the One-2-One network will be free at
weekends and after 7pm on weekdays. The offer only applies if you live in
the London area. One-2-One is expanding rapidly, but it will be another
two-and-a-half years before it has national coverage.
However, One-2-One is 'free' only after you have bought a handset for at
least Pounds 250 and paid a monthly fee of Pounds 14.69. Fixed-line phones
sell for a tenth of the price, and BT's monthly line rental is Pounds 7.65.
Furthermore, to make a One-2-One local call on the personal consumer tariff
at 6pm rather than 7pm, you pay through the nose. It costs you Pounds 2.94,
against 15p on BT. True, that is BT's off-peak rate, but go back to 3pm and
the BT price rises only to 40p. For national calls you will also pay a hefty
premium on One-2-One, before or after 7pm.
Most private consumers, then, would be mad to see One-2-One or any other
mobile service as an economic replacement for a fixed phone. Lord Young's
free local calls are nevertheless more than a gimmick. For the first time,
the marketing of mobile phones is being pitched at the domestic consumer,
not just the business user. In the process, One-2-One is bringing extra
competition to an industry desperately in need of more.
Mercury One-2-One is in fierce competition with the two existing mobile
operators, Vodafone and Cellnet, not with BT's national network. As the
mobile phones enter the consumer market, they will be an extra, not a
replacement for a fixed line phone. Indeed, as a fixed-line operator,
Mercury is trumpeting the virtues of the cable companies, which are creaming
private consumers from BT in urban areas on the basis of still lower
fixed-line call tariffs.
Until now, neither Vodafone nor Cellnet have seriously attempted to market
their wares to private individuals. They have not needed to. With operating
profits at nearly half of sales, it has been enough for them to assemble the
growing number of business customers who regard a mobile phone as essential.
Low-user tariffs, introduced by Cellnet and Vodafone last year, gave reduced
subscriptions in return for even higher call charges, but they were of
appeal mainly to a different segment of the business market. Vodafone's
low-user tariff accounts for only 106,000 of its 926,000 customers.
Three things are needed for a large consumer cellular market: networks which
can handle high volumes, and affordable entry charges and call tariffs.
The first condition is now fulfilled. One-2-One is just one of several
high-capacity digital networks coming into service. Vodafone launched its
EuroDigital network earlier this month; next month it unveils a MetroDigital
service aimed mainly at the local market. Cellnet launches a digital network
next year.
It is only a matter of time before high digital handset prices - the main
barrier to consumer entry - start to tumble. Handsets for the old analogue
networks are already as low as Pounds 70. Manufacturers suggest it will take
two-to-three years to get digital handset prices down from Pounds 250-Pounds
400 to under Pounds 100.
That leaves call tariffs, which Mercury has started to axe. In anticipation
of One-2-One, earlier this summer Vodafone announced tariffs for its new
MetroDigital network which were lower than any it had set before. Cellnet
sharply cut prices in London last week. Expect further reductions soon.
Meanwhile, BT is a not a completely idle onlooker. It has a majority stake
in Cellnet. And it can ill afford to be semi-detached from the cellular
industry if, a few years hence, One-2-One's prices make mobile phones a real
competitor to the fixed-line.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Regulating the regulators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT sub-plot during the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation of the gas industry was British Gas's attempt to curb its
regulator's power. As the full MMC reports published this week show, British
Gas pressed the line that its regulator Ofgas was aggressive, unpredictable
and strident. The MMC rightly rejected the company's more extreme
criticisms, concluding that the system was fundamentally sound. But it did
suggest that a broader review of utility regulation might be in order.
The idea is a good one. But before embarking on any such review, it is
important to appreciate that there is no regulatory crisis. Utilities have
not been reduced to quivering wrecks by overmighty regulators. If anything,
they have been able to earn handsome profits at the expense of the consumer.
There have, of course, been rows. But these are not evidence of regulators
running amok. Rather they are the consequence of strong personalities such
as Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas's chief, battling for consumer interests
against utilities which have naturally wanted to cling to monopoly profits.
It is no accident that the biggest rows have been in gas and
telecommunications, which were left as integrated monopolies when privatised
rather than being split up. If regulators' wings were clipped, they would be
less able to ensure fair treatment for consumers.
Similarly, the criticism that there is no adequate appeals process against
regulatory decisions is exaggerated. On most important issues, a utility can
appeal to the MMC. The fact that British Gas has been able to persuade the
MMC to recommend relaxation of some of its regulatory controls shows that
the checks and balances are working.
Nor is the argument that regulators have too much discretion convincing. It
is true that in some respects regulatory discretion is wide. But what is the
alternative? A more legalistic system is used in the US. But the consequence
has been that utilities have used their greater financial resources and
control of information to tie their regulators in knots. Another possibility
would be to hand regulatory power back to ministers. But that hardly seems a
good idea when one advantage of privatisation has been to reduce political
interference in commercial decisions.
The more telling criticism of the system is its lack of openness. Often
regulators fail to give reasons for their decisions, too many of which are
taken behind closed doors. As a result, it can be difficult for interested
parties to influence and challenge regulatory decisions.
But regulators are not solely responsible for secrecy. Utilities have often
tried to prevent the publication of detailed financial information that lies
behind regulatory decisions on grounds of commercial confidentiality.
Moreover, there are signs of improvement. Ofwat has been a model of
consultation in its preparation of new price controls for water companies,
while Oftel is about to experiment with a roundtable seminar to determine
telecommunications interconnection terms.
Undoubtedly more needs to be done and this is why the government should take
up the MMC's suggestion of a broader review, which could draw up a code of
practice as British Gas has advocated. One candidate to conduct such a
review would be the MMC itself. But since its powers and procedures should
ideally also be examined, a better candidate would probably be the Office of
Fair Trading. Either way, given that secrecy is the current system's main
defect, the review should be open.

By her own admission, Kim Campbell has little in common with the
stereotypical vest-clad Canadian nursing his beer in front of the
television. But Canada's cello-playing prime minister is now working hard to
shed her image as an aloof and testy intellectual, ahead of the general
election which she is expected to call today for October 25.
Campbell has spent the past few weeks putting in appearances at baseball
matches, barbecues and even a Highland dancing festival; her impish sense of
humour has been much in evidence. She told one group of supporters that she
has had difficulty since the G7 meeting in Tokyo last July fitting the prime
ministerial bottom into the prime ministerial skirt.
The question is whether such bons mots will be enough to swing voters behind
her Conservative party in the election.
The Liberals' leader, Jean Chretien, 60, has followed Campbell's lead in
putting style above substance. Stung by criticism that he is yesterday's man
after 30 years in politics, Chretien made sure photographers were on hand
recently to record him churning up the waves on a single water-ski.

The travails of public transport. A familiar looking character sitting on a
tube was approached by a stranger. 'Excuse me sir, are you Norman Lamont?'
'Yes,' said the former chancellor, with a smile. Taking a deep breath, the
stranger continued: 'Well, I'd just like to say that you ought to be ashamed
of yourself for the hardship and poverty you have caused millions of people
in this country.' 'And the rest of the world,' responded Lamont.
But British womanhood likes to see fair play. A fellow passenger tut-tutted.
'That's not a widely held opinion,' she said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual Trades Union Congress has long been a dispiriting affair; this
year's in Brighton is no exception. The proceedings are passionless and
rigidly stage-managed. The conference has had its moments though, including
one memorably poetic exchange yesterday.
Summing up a debate about labour legislation, Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU's
national officer in Scotland, ended by quoting from the Mask of Anarchy by
Percy Bysshe Shelley:
'Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number -
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you.'
But Arthur Scargill, the miners' leader, arguing for more militant
opposition to the government's employment legislation, politely pointed out
that Airlie had missed the final line of the verse: 'Ye are many - they are
few.'
It is no coincidence that the two men know that verse from the revolutionary
old Etonian poet so well. It once adorned the membership card of the Young
Communist League - of which both were members.

Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, was brimming with confidence at
the launch of Mercury's One-2-One cellular phone service yesterday.
He enthused about the merits of its free off-peak local calls and lamented
that the system had not been available when his children were teenagers.
When suggesting people could talk all night he did, however, gloss over the
fact that the phone's battery only lasts 55 minutes. Fortunately, of course,
replacements are available at extra cost.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may have lost a good number of general elections recently but no one can
say the British left lacks tenacity. Today sees the launch of yet another
attempt to get its economic message across.
New Economy, a 62-page quarterly described as half journal, half magazine,
sets out to reconquer the field of easily understandable economic writing
ceded during the 1980s to such right-of-centre publications as Economic
Affairs.
Produced by a left-wing think-tank - the Institute for Public Policy
Research - New Economy strikes a suitably populist note, banning the algebra
and footnotes that sometimes pepper learned economic journals.
The aim is 'to be lively and have meat', says editor Dan Corry, a former
Treasury official and adviser to the Labour party front bench.
He believes New Economy will appeal to non-economic specialists and A-level
students. But it does not neglect academics. Thanks to Simon Wren-Lewis,
professor of macroeconomic modelling at Strathclyde University, it will make
a regular feature of a new slimline economic model with the unsexy name of
Compact, which will offer a guide to UK economic policy.
There is little doubt that the launch issue's 5,000 print-run will be
eagerly snapped up; the publisher, Academic Press, is giving it away.
But the big test will come - as ever - when punters have to vote with their
cheque books. In early 1994, New Economy will go on sale by subscription at
rates of up to Pounds 95 a year.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK exporters need more diplomatic
back-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr F M KENNEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Observer column, 'Sundown in the east' (September 1), drew
attention to the fact that the UK has far fewer diplomats in the
Commonwealth of Independent States than its main commercial competitors.
On behalf of British contractors working in international markets, I would
like to say that I share the concern of your columnist at what appears to be
a dangerously short-sighted approach to important potential markets of
strategic significance.
In countries such as those of the CIS, where many companies are taking their
first tentative steps to build up a network of local knowledge and
experience, diplomatic help on the ground is vital. If British contractors
are to establish themselves in these new markets, an increase in diplomatic
representation is essential. In many of the CIS states, government officials
are accustomed to dealing with civil servants and diplomats from other
governments and it is important that the UK has representatives of a high
standard in place. This must not be done, of course, at the expense of
existing representation in other developing areas where a continuation of
political and commercial advice is equally important.
In 1991 the construction industry generated business worth some Pounds 7.6bn
in total exports for the UK, and the recent steps taken by the government to
reduce some of the difficulties faced by British exporters are very welcome.
These measures have included extending the availability and increasing the
extent of cover for export credits and reducing premiums, and launching a
major initiative to identify and second export market specialists from
industry to the Department of Trade and Industry. It does seem perverse,
therefore, for a government that has recently expressed and demonstrated its
support for exporters to follow at the same time a policy of limiting
diplomatic representation in potentially rewarding markets.
Is this a case of the foreign office pursuing its own agenda, or is it
simply a matter of Treasury penny pinching? What is obviously required is
greater co-operation between Whitehall departments to ensure that adequate
representation is present in the CIS states to enable exporters to take
advantage of the greater assistance on offer from the Department of Trade
and Industry.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Doors slam shut in salesman's face: Increasing bancassurance
sales are at the expense of UK insurance companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the kind of divorce that makes headlines. The Halifax, Britain's
largest building society, last week announced it would sever its ties with
one of the UK's largest insurance companies, Standard Life.
Citing irreconcilable strategic differences, Halifax said it would form its
own life insurance company next year, whose products would be sold
exclusively in its own outlets. The move is a blow to Standard Life, which
totted up nearly a fifth of all its UK sales through the Halifax last year.
Standard Life thus becomes the latest - and largest - casualty of a trend
which has seen the main life insurance companies frozen out of the
high-street retail branches that helped them sell their products most
cheaply.
Banks and building societies are eschewing the role of commissioned sales
agent for leading insurers, and choosing to set up their own life companies.
The development comes when, by all accounts, there is already far too much
capacity in the industry and observers are predicting a shake-out.
Mr Tom King, general manager in charge of marketing at Standard Life, said:
'I don't think the marketplace is big enough to hold all those companies
which are out there.'
But the banks are not concerned about overcrowding in the market. Mr Michael
Wadsworth, partner in the insurance practice at consulting actuaries R
Watson and Co, estimates that the average insurance sales agent based at a
bank or building society sells four to six times as many policies a month as
the average sales agent who solicits business from customers in their homes
or by telephone.
As a result, bancassurance - insurance products sold through banks and
building societies - is a cheaper sales method than the traditional route.
By the end of the decade, Mr Wadsworth forecasts, bancassurance will account
for 30 to 50 per cent of the UK retail financial services market.
Banks have long been aware of their potential as insurance distributors. Mr
Brian Pitman, chief executive at Lloyds Bank, recalled that in the 1950s
Lloyds allowed branch managers to broker independent financial advice,
pocketing the commissions they earned on each sale. 'Some of them made more
money as insurance brokers than they did as branch managers,' said Mr
Pitman.
Lloyds Bank stopped the sales in the 1960s, but compensated its managers for
the sums they earned selling insurance. The episode illustrates the
potential of banks and building societies to act as the natural marketplace
for retail financial products.
The current growth of bancassurance has its roots not only in commercial
considerations but also in the regulatory framework governing UK financial
services. The Financial Services Act, which took effect in 1988, led to
'polarisation'. Sales agents had either to 'tie' themselves to one company
by selling its products exclusively or remain 'independent' by selling the
best products from all providers.
Most banks and building societies realised that customers did not always
recognise the difference between independent and tied advice. Tying
themselves to one company earned the banks and societies more money, because
insurance companies pay higher commissions to those selling their products
exclusively.
It was only a short step for them to decide that having their own insurance
operations and selling their own products was most profitable of all.
Mr Pitman of Lloyds said: 'Our market research showed that, if we sold our
own products, our customers would buy them. And our analysis showed that
underwriting would be more profitable than broking.' Lloyds entered the
business by taking a 60 per cent stake in Abbey Life in 1988, an operation
that earned it more than a third of its profits last year.
Similarly, National and Provincial Building Society, which recently
announced plans to combine with the Leeds to form Britain's third-largest
society, earned 25 per cent of 1992 profits from the sale of its own retail
financial services.
But some seeds of doubt about the virtues of bancassurance have been sown,
partly by new Treasury rules allowing prospective policyholders to learn
more about the costs of insurance products. Buyers, for instance, will have
to be told in cash terms how much the sales agent will earn on a policy as
commission and how much of the premium payments will be withheld by the
insurance company if the policy is cashed in early.
For long-term policies, consumers can lose up to the first two years of
premium payments in administration charges and commission, and may have to
pay premiums for 10 to 12 years to earn a full refund of all premiums paid
on a 25-year endowment policy. Under the new rules, such information will
have to be revealed to those shopping for a policy, from next year.
'Mr and Mrs Homebuyer will fall off their chairs when they see those
numbers,' said Mr Roman Cizden, life insurance industry analyst at the
stockbroker Smith NewCourt.
Bank and building society outlets have been most successful in selling
endowment policies, because they also sold the mortgage that went with it.
Homebuyers have been convinced that an endowment was the best option - even
though it often led to higher monthly repayments without tax relief and to
heavy penalties for early encashment. By 1991, some 80 per cent of all
mortgages sold in the UK had an endowment policy attached.
Questions about the bancassurance strategy have been raised by one of
Britain's largest building societies, which has severed its tie with a
leading insurance company, saying it did not believe the insurer's staple
product - endowment mortgages - was necessarily in its customers' best
interests.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham and Gloucester Building
Society, Britain's sixth largest, announced last month that the society
would not renew its five-year contract with Legal and General Assurance
Society, under which C&amp;G agreed to sell L&amp;G insurance products exclusively.
C&amp;G decided to abandon retail financial products and concentrate on the sale
of so-called interest-only and repayment mortgages, which are sold without
the ancillary endowment insurance policy.
Industry observers point out that endowment policies have often been the
principal product in a bancassurer's sales strategy. If the new transparency
rules cause buyers to lose their taste for endowment mortgages, what will
happen to the bancassurance approach?
Mr Wadsworth noted that bancassurers had been most successful with
relatively simple endowments, unit trusts or lump-sum investment bonds. They
had achieved less success at penetrating the growing market for personal
pensions, which is more complex and which requires more sophisticated
training of salespeople.
Industry statistics, produced by the Association of British Insurers, bear
this out. While banks and building societies sold 21 per cent of unit-linked
insurance policies in the UK in the first quarter of this year, they sold 5
per cent of annual premium pension products.
Mr David Prosser, chief executive of Legal and General, argued that, while
some bancassurers would succeed, they could not satisfy customers over the
long term. 'What the average consumer wants is someone to talk to about
their problems and who will be around in five years to answer their
questions.'
Insurers are putting a brave face on the erosion of their distribution
channels, and say they can make up lost sales by cultivating their personal
relationships with customers and selling them a range of products over their
lifetime. But the wave of mergers and acquisitions of small to medium-sized
insurance companies is testament to the strength of the bancassurers and the
inroads they have already made into the market.

FT  08 SEP 93 / The grand design: Europe needs to plan a wider union that is
able to look after itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shape of Europe has been irrevocably changed by the collapse of
communism. That was already so obvious at the time that it has become a
cliche. But it may be only in 1993 that political leaders have begun to
absorb that change. American leaders have stopped behaving as though Europe
were their top priority. West European leaders have accepted, at last June's
Copenhagen summit, that 'the associated countries in central and eastern
Europe that so desire shall become members of the European union'.
The importance of the successful transformation of central and eastern
Europe for western Europe's security is also a cliche. But its economic
importance has been less emphasised of late, as the difficulties and risks
of the process have come to be better understood. It is good therefore to be
reminded, by the director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in
Brussels, Mr Peter Ludlow, that 'there is no other single source of hope for
western Europeans as important as the rapid growth of central and eastern
Europe'.
Mr Ludlow makes the point in a paper entitled Beyond Maastricht (CEPS
working document no 79, July 1993), which attempts to set the EC agenda for
the next few years. It was finished a few days before the climax of the
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. That will certainly provide
fodder for the 'revised and extended version' promised for October, but is
unlikely to affect the main conclusions. The essence of Mr Ludlow's reaction
can be divined from the following sentence: 'If, despite everything,
instability becomes the norm and the prospect of hanging on until 1997 or
1999 in a system such as the present one becomes unsustainable, an
accelerated timetable towards a core monetary union would be preferable to a
new era of floating . . .'
By itself, that would be little more than a desperate reiteration of
Euro-orthodoxy. The originality of Mr Ludlow's approach lies elsewhere, in
that he has not only grasped the new strategic context but integrated it
into his vision of the EC/European Union's future. This means that
short-term planning has to be dominated by the timetable of enlargement
negotiations with the Efta countries, while long-term planning must be
undertaken both for and by (a crucial point) a wider Europe stretching
eastward to the frontier of the former Soviet Union.
Mr Ludlow correctly identifies access of central and eastern European
producers to the western market as the most important issue, and 'the real
and imaginary fears' of EC member states about competition from the east as
the main constraint. He suggests that this be tackled head on: the two sides
should work together to develop common strategies in the 'sensitive
sectors', including 'a new common agricultural policy'. Strong stuff, but as
he says, 'both sides are going to have to take far-reaching decisions about
agriculture anyway. Why not, as prospective partners, prepare the ground
together?'
As if that were not enough, Mr Ludlow goes on to point out the financial
implications. 'It is clearly unacceptable,' he writes, 'that the associate
states which have now been accepted as prospective members should continue
to receive financial assistance from the EC worth less than 10 per cent of
the structural funds allocated to the four poorest member states.' He urges
an investigation of 'the benefits for the EC if it began sooner rather than
later to treat the associate states according to the same criteria and on
the same footing as it has already agreed to treat its own poorer regions'.
Mr Ludlow anticipates the 'response of hardened budget experts within the EC
. . . that increases in the EC budget of the order needed are
inconceivable', but brushes it aside as 'a superficial and short-sighted
judgment of the kind which opponents of the Marshall Plan . . . advanced in
the United States after the second world war'. The prosperity of eastern
Europe, he concludes firmly, 'is in western Europe's interest and the costs
should be rapidly offset by the benefits'.
In the shorter term, Mr Ludlow argues that the Maastricht revision
conference scheduled for 1996 should be brought forward to 1995, as soon as
possible after the French presidential election; and that the Efta candidate
countries should be included in it, as Spain and Portugal were in the
conference that negotiated the Single European Act in 1985. They, with
whichever existing member states feel the need to do so, could then hold
more or less simultaneous referendums on their accession treaties, including
whatever amendments to Maastricht have been agreed, rather than subjecting
us to another series of cliffhangers like those of 1992-93.
Mr Ludlow is too hard-headed to adopt my proposal that the conference be
replaced by an elected constituent assembly. But he does suggest that it
should be preceded by a strategic review, to identify the threats or risks
to European security in the new situation and the instruments (both military
and economic) available to meet them. Those instruments include Nato, but
arguments about the competence and value of Nato can no longer be a
substitute for the development of a European capacity to deal with European
problems.
As Mr Ludlow puts it: 'Europe's leaders cannot at one and the same time
bemoan the demoralisation which their failures in the former Yugoslavia have
caused and run away from trying to develop a collective framework in which
to deal with this and future problems.'
The review, he suggests, should be set in motion by the special EC summit
planned for late October. That will not be a moment too soon.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free market breaks up the family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY CLEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Lawson is still fighting yesterday's battles against socialism ('A
paean of praise to capitalism', September 4/5) and fails to recognise that
freedom of the marketplace is acting to undermine the family values he
espouses, not support them.
The pursuit of self-interest; the increasing economic and social liberation
of women and men; the market's need for occupational and geographical
mobility and its lack of adequate valuation for a sense of community and
permanence all operate to assign a low price and priority on long-term
social relationships, ie families.
Fewer and fewer people are willing to subordinate their own personal
interest to that of their family, as Lord Lawson commends. A dynamic,
competitive, atomistic market system causes families to break up. It is
happening all around us; hasn't he noticed?

FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Britain well out of social 'shackles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At last European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, shows the Commission's
true colours on social policy ('Brussels to side-step UK on works councils
issue', September 7). In backing the absurd notion of a World Social
Charter, he is again pushing the idea that if we cannot compete effectively
then everyone should be equally handicapped with higher employment costs.
Those saddled with the high costs of implementing the Social Chapter are now
waking up to their loss of competitiveness in relation to the Pacific Rim.
Their response has not been to throw off the shackles, but to call for the
same costs to be imposed around the world. The UK is well out of it.

   From Dr SUE MAYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In her article, 'Greens' bogus science' (September 6) Bronwen Maddox
attacks Brian Wynne and myself for criticising the way that science is used
in environmental policy.
Bronwen Maddox's own analysis amply illustrates the issues by conferring a
'rigour' on science which the Financial Times would never ascribe to
economics. She concludes that there is a firm distinction between 'needless
worries' and 'real threats'. She implies this difference can be proved. In
real life, science, like economics, is not like that. Nor is decision
making.
The problem we and others have identified is that science is systematically
abused by governments and industry in order to use its authority to disguise
value judgments and policy decisions.
A common example is the use of the absence of data to imply there is nothing
happening in the environment: for example, the now discredited principle of
'dilute and disperse' was justified because sulphur emissions or sewage
discharges were diluted to the point of immeasurability.
Similarly, the UK government measures radioactive emissions, but it assumes
that a one in 10,000 risk of dying as a result of radioactive discharges is
acceptable: the measurements are scientific but the definition of the
problem (a 'real threat or a needless worry') is not.
Bronwen Maddox claims that the proposals for a precautionary approach
'destroy any notion of proof'. In reality, scientific proof of safety is
already unattainable and it is in the face of this that we propose the
implementation of a precautionary approach. We should use the best
scientific knowledge available to us to make decisions but not ignore its
limitations in favour of vested interests.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: BR's secret pot of gold?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAEME P THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am afraid that John Welsby, BR chief executive, railways (Letters,
September 1), missed one major potential source of revenue for BR - actually
enforcing the purchase of tickets by the travelling passengers.
As a commuter who travels extensively on the rail network, I have become
increasingly concerned and annoyed at just how easy it is to evade paying
fares. I recently kept a regular log of when I was asked to produce my
ticket. Over a three-month period the average was once every four days; on
one occasion it was once in 16 days.
It is clear that there has recently been a heavy fall-off in the number of
station ticket-collecting staff and of stations at which staff are present,
especially early morning and late evening. Penalty fares are no real
deterrent at Pounds 10 a time.
Are the uncollected revenues a secret pot of gold to encourage privatisation
operators to bid for franchises?

FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: Happy night at the club - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEDAR Walton's seasonal quartet is the kind of band jazz clubs are made for.
The sound of a rusty toned tenor relaxed against easy swinging piano and ice
bucket accompaniment while the heads around dip to the pulse of a drummer
happy in his work is enough to make you want to give up the concert hall for
good. So comfortable is the pianist at Ronnie Scott's club that the first
set featured 'Ronnie's Decision', a bobby ode to the wisecracking Frith
Street proprietor.
Yet though he is an inveterate tourer, whose quartets have usually featured
a top shelf saxophonist (young Ralph Moore in this case), Walton is fixed in
most people's minds as an accompanist whose prints are to be fond on many of
the great bebop sessions, notably from Blue Note.
He spent the golden years of hard-bop freelancing as well as working for a
spell with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and has led his own bands since the
early 1970s. Ever a stimulating and bright accompanist he has also
contributed to the book of standards with original numbers such as 'Mosaic'
and 'Bolivia'.
For this week at Ronnie's, Walton is reunited with the conversational time
keeping of drummer Billy Higgins and bass player David Williams, on/off
partners since the mid-1960s: the addition of talented young bop stylist
Moore on tenor keeps the Walton quartet tradition
alive
As a leader, Walton mixes the understated persistence which kept him in
demand as accompanist with a sparkling but spare solo technique to give
Moore space to work freely and sometimes precisely in the mix of standards
and originals.
Walton addresses the keyboard as if sitting down to a particularly intricate
jigsaw puzzle, picking chords experimentally before embarking on a long blue
line against the grain of the tenor's muted wailing.
Higgins, emitting a self-absorbed and gravelly gurgle from the throat, roams
across the cymbals, the bass drum rolling low and hard. Modest and
economical in delivery. 'Bluest Blues' and 'My Ideal' had Walton sitting out
entirely between solos for Williams' fret tramelling excursions on the
string bass.
Smokey rather than smoking, this superior late night jazz grows more
intoxicating as the night wears into the wee hours. As the new CD title
suggests, it is Simple Pleasure and well worth enduring Ronnie's elderly
jokes for. Look out next week for more in a similar vein from tenorist's
James Moody's quartet at the same place.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: Pinter goes gently with images of death - First Night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harold Pinter's first full-length play since Betrayal in 1978 turns out to
be slightly longer than advertised - nearer 85 minutes than 75 without an
interval. It also looks as if it is intended to be his last, for Moonlight
is full of references to the dying of the light without quite the rage that
Dylan Thomas advised should go with it.
There are a few moans to be sure, but for the most part it seems that Pinter
is happy to go gently, leaving his record to be judged as people think fit.
An old man (Ian Holm) lies on his death bed. His wife (Anna Massey) is in
attendance. Three grown up children, two boys and one girl, are at various
times on the stage, though never directly with their father. The
grandchildren, for whom he says he is waiting, do not turn up. A married
couple, old acquaintances of the man and his wife, briefly do.
Nothing much happens. You would not expect it to. The effect depends on
whether you think lines like 'It's enough to make the cat laugh', followed
after the famous Pinter pause by 'Do we have a cat?' are funny. Once, in
early Pinter, they were. Now, I think not. And if not funny, it is hard to
find another justification.
There is some reminiscing. Plainly it has not been the happiest of
marriages, but it has not been the most unhappy either. The husband has had
his infidelities; the wife has dabbled in lesbianism. Yet, you can hear them
saying to themselves, at least they are not quite as suburban as the couple
who turn up to see them.
The sons talk to each other on a separate part of the stage. Here there may
be some parody. They mention places in the south of England as other people
may talk about Monte, and go through lists of names like old soldiers
remembering their regiments. I am unable to elucidate further; possibly it
is the end of old England.
Images of death abound: not only Dylan Thomas, but also The Journey of the
Magi and Shakespeare. 'Take him all in all,' says one of the sons of his
father, 'I shall not look upon his like again.' There is a generous toast to
those who have not made it this far: 'To all those we left behind, to all
those who fell at the first and all consequent hurdles.' Only Prospero is
missing.
Yet if this is really Pinter's farewell, the production could have been
better done. The set, designed by Bob Crowley, is strangely flat: one big
bed and a smaller one almost side by side. The rear part of the stage
remains largely unused, save for the ghostly daughter flapping about in
white. In short, there is not much life, though this may be intentional, in
David Leveaux's directing.
And if the aim is pathos, it would surely have been better to let Pinter
play the leading role. He is, after all, a very good actor, still at the
height of his powers. Then the message would have been unmistakable. But
perhaps he prefers to remain enigmatic to the end.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: The Seagull, a fluent display of fringe virtues -
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEKHOV must have had his tongue in his cheek when he described The Seagull
as a comedy. No play that contains so much feeling and ends with a tragic
off-stage suicide can quite fit that description. Yet one sees what he
meant.
The Seagull is full of ironies, has some comic characters like Sorin, the
invalid brother of the actress Arkadina, and has some comic situations which
should be played for all they are worth. Perhaps Arkadina in particular does
not belong to the really tragic mould. But unless you have a peculiarly
warped sense of humour, the younger characters - Konstantin, Nina and Masha
 -surely do.
The production at the Orange Tree in Richmond has many of the virtues we
have come to expect from the pleasantest of London's fringe theatres. It
uses the fluent translation by Michael Frayn which almost persuades one that
the play was written in English in the first place. Frayn simply skips the
habit of constantly repeating Russian names.
Paul Shelley's direction has clearly been carefully thought out. The acting
is impeccable down to the smallest part. No irony is missed. Watch the way
Diane Fletcher's Arkadina recaptures her lover, Trigorin, when he says he
wants to leave her for a younger woman. Trigorin is played by David Yelland:
if you look at his face, it is immediately clear that she has only partly
won him back and that he despises himself for going that far.
And if you want to see a proud, tortured but unprotesting woman on stage,
note Naomi Capron as Masha. There is no fuss, just a controlled suppression
of emotions when she cannot have the man that she wants. This is an even
harder part to play than Arkadina who, as an actress, has the perfect excuse
for letting herself go whenever she wants. Ms Capron makes Masha the most
interesting character in the play, for all the others are either superficial
or parodies. Her performance is superb. Cathryn Bradshaw's Nina looks
melodramatic beside her.
For the rest, the production is not quite satisfactory. There are times when
it is impossible to see all the characters. They seem to stand in diagonal
lines. As it happened, I had a splendid view of Trigorin being repossessed
by Arkadina; others may not have done. Chekhov's description of the piece as
a comedy may have been unduly overlooked: occasionally it could be played
faster and the pregnant pauses cut short.
One of the reasons why we have come to expect such high standards at the
Orange Tree is the artistic direction of Sam Walters. He has worked by
developing a permanent company which understands the Richmond stage. Walters
is now on sabbatical and The Seagull is performed by a more ad hoc group.
The occasional lapse in the direction makes the case for a resident company,
playing together all the time, look stronger than ever.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: You have the right to speak British - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER dinner with his father a four year old boy asks 'Daddy, do you know
what the police say when they arrest you?' and the man, who has spent a
considerable part of his adult life watching crime series on television,
replies 'They usually say 'You're nicked''. But the child insists that that
is not right: 'They say 'You have the right to remain silent'' and he adds a
number of other clauses, mainly about the right to consult a lawyer.
What the boy is quoting is not the standard British caution, but its
American counterpart (known , if I remember my Ed McBain correctly, as the
Miranda rules). Serve on a British jury these days and you are likely to
find that your fellow jurors' ideas about the law consist of one part folk
myth rooted in English common law, and nine parts US legal procedure picked
up from the small screen.
This rather than, or as well as, the ubiquity of Diet Coke and Mickey Mouse
is presumably what French intellectuals mean when they growl about 'American
cultural imperialism'. Neither the child's parroting nor the jurors'
misunderstanding is surprising when you look at the quantity of US drama on
British television screens. At the weekend television's autumn season began
to crank up, thank goodness, and one of its first offerings was a 90-minute
drama in a new batch of 'Screen One' on BBC1 called Wide Eyed And Legless.
It would be difficult to imagine anything more English. Julie Walters played
Diana Longden, a woman paralysed by a mysterious illness which necessitates
steel cages on both hands, obliging her husband Deric (Jim Broadbent) to
dress her and wheel her to and from countless hospital consultations,
showing up the medical profession's ignorance and impotence without any
effect upon their arrogance. Though driven repeatedly to the brink of
suicide, Diana maintains a jaunty front for the sake of Deric and their
children, and Deric, as their son remarks, worships his wife.
The spirit and attitude of this drama bring to mind the Ealing comedies; it
is heroic on a domestic scale. It is also chirpy, melancholy, sentimental,
eccentric, and gritty. Above all, thanks to Jack Rosenthal's script (from
Deric Longden's two autobiographical books, Diana's Story and Lost For
Words) it is funny. Deric's relationships with the loyal women at his
decrepit lingerie factory are endearing and funny. Deric's mother, played by
Thora Hird as the world champion of the non sequitur, is funny. Asked 'Are
you Deric's mother or Diana's?' she replies 'Possibly', and upon being told
'That's not Lawrence it's Kenneth' she says 'Well I knew it was someone of
Arabia'.
Eventually Deric meets and fancies a blind novelist named Aileen Armitage
(another good performance, from Sian Thomas: this one will win awards).
Diana wills them to one another and then drowns herself in the bath. This
drama brought to mind other British television productions from years ago:
On Giant's Shoulders about thalidomide boy Terry Wiles, for instance, and
Trevor Griffith's work Through The Night, which had much to say about the
superciliousness of doctors. They too were on a small scale, yet they too
were powerful. All three, in a manner typical of the best of British
television drama, dealt with worlds which we either inhabit or could find
ourselves inhabiting.
There are many US television dramas of which the same cannot be said, even
in relation to American viewers, for instance Lonesome Dove, a six-hour
Western, shown last week by BBC1. In line with modern cinema tradition, at
least since Heaven's Gate, it looks vividly authentic: sand, dust and bright
light; primitive conditions, baggy and ill fitting clothes, dirty people and
ramshackle buildings. It is one of those rare cowboy films full of cows
(like Red River) and, as with Rawhide, the cattle drive is, at least
ostensibly, the locus of the drama. In spite of that it feels diffuse and
unfocused, more like a soap opera than a mini-series, in the sense that
there are countless sub-plots yet no central story. Watch long enough and
(again, as with soap opera) this ceases to matter since the characters
themselves become so familiar and engrossing that they serve as a substitute
for plot.
It will be said of Lonesome Dove, as it has always been said of Westerns,
that although set in the 19th century it is really telling us about our own
age, and for Americans there is probably some truth in that: the casual use
of guns, the cheapness of life, the acceptance of vigilante vengeance do, by
all accounts, apply as much or more today as in the days of Wyatt Earp. But
it is to US society that they apply, not (yet, anyway) to ours, even if
Americans do make their television programmes in our language. Happily this
is not a world that we live in. Of course that does not mean that British
viewers cannot be entertained by Lonesome Dove; the BARB figures may well
tell us that more viewers watched it than watched Wide Eyed And Legless.
Perhaps the same applies to another US mini-series, Cruel Doubt, shown on
ITV last week, though I doubt it and hope not. This was an example of what
seems to be emerging as the dominant genre within the world of American
mini-series: weird and horrible crimes committed in suburbia, somewhere
behind those big unfenced lawns running down to pavements where winsome
'kids' do wheelies on thousands of dollars worth of advanced carbon fibre
technology.
As so often with these series, this one was based upon a real case. A
teenage college boy who is a heavy user of drugs and an obsessive player of
dungeons and dragons, draws his friends a diagram of his family's house so
that they can murder his parents and he can inherit their money. No doubt we
ought to be aware of such crimes; there is a tendency for most things
American to cross the Atlantic eventually, but journalism would seem the
best means of conveying such information. It is hard to see how anyone
except the mentally disturbed or a particularly morose and spiteful teenager
could possibly find Cruel Doubt entertaining.
For some reason BBC2 has chosen to describe its mini-series, Love And Reason
as a 'satire' about 'the rough and tumble of politics', although there was
nothing in the opening episode that looked remotely satirical.
So far it has been a story about factional bickering within the Labour party
in the 1980s and the question of whether to modernise in line with Kinnock's
policies or stick to Keir Hardie style flat-cap socialism, even if the caps
are being worn by women. The trouble is that we have seen this sort of
material handled so much better in GBH and, so far as inner-city corruption
among planners and councillors is concerned, Muck And Brass.
If the human story of sexy Lou Larson becomes more dominant the drama may
become more compelling, but sticking with Labour's internal wrangling would
seem like death. Labour's tribulations in the 1980s appear more dated than
Lloyd George's selling of honours. So although Love And Reason portrays a
world we have lived in, it feels utterly old fashioned and remote.
It should surely not be asking too much for British television to offer us,
in addition to an avalanche of American material and all those steam train
romances, some drama that engages us in the world where we now live. Wide
Eyed and Legless was a good, indeed excellent, start, but much more will be
needed if this autumn season is to be a memorable one.

MARTIN Crimp has won the 26th John Whiting Award, given annually by the Arts
Council to the writer of a new play which demonstrates a distinctive
development in dramatic writing.
The Treatment, the play which won Crimp the award, was performed at the
Royal Court in London in April. It is unusual in that the setting is New
York, a city that Crimp only visited briefly as part of an annual exchange
between the Royal Court and a New York theatre. It deals with skulduggery in
the film world. It was a critical, but not a box office, success, but was
admired by US producers and opens at the Newman Theatre in New York in
October.
Crimp was awarded his cheque for Pounds 6,000 by Frances Barber, the
actress, at the Hampstead Theatre yesterday. Previous winners of the award,
which commemorates the playwright John Whiting, include Tom Stoppard, Peter
Nicholls, Howard Brenton and David Edgar.

BBC2's sports journalism series, On The Line, examines Beijing's bid to
stage the Olympics in the year 2000. The emergence of Chinese athletes at
the World Championships in Stuttgart, particularly female distance runners,
and the Chinese medal count at the Barcelona Olympics have put China on the
international sporting map. There has, however, been a lot of muttering
about precisely how those successes were achieved. The programme tries to
find out (8.30). At the same time C4 repeats the episode of Inspector Morse
in which the Jag driving ale enthusiast investigates the death of a
deaconess.
BBC1's Inside Story penetrates the murky world of prostitution in the
Paddington area of London (9.30). The programme goes undercover with the
police vice unit as they track down and arrest the pimp of a 16-year-old
prostitute and raid a brothel run by the Chinese mafia, the Triads.
Sportsnight reports on the qualifying games for the football World Cup:
England v. Poland, Wales v. Czech/Slovak republics, Scotland v. Switzerland
and Northern Ireland v. Latvia (10.20).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dwyer, a property investment and trading group, yesterday announced a number
of changes to its board including the appointment of Graham Kennedy, a
director and consultant at James Capel, as its non-executive chairman.
Three new directors have been appointed to the board, to replace three who
are stepping down.
The latest changes mean that only one director, Anthony Kirwan, was on the
board before last November when Desmond Bloom, chairman and chief executive,
resigned to cut the company's overheads.
The outgoing directors are Martin Silverman, formerly deputy chairman and
finance director, Michael Dwyer and Martin Phillips.
The new directors are Graham Kennedy, 56, a former head of corporate broking
at James Capel, David Dugdale, 50, a former joint chief executive of James
Capel and William Bolt, 61, a retired partner of Chesterton, chartered
surveyors.
Joey Esfandi, chief executive, says the board reorganisation had been agreed
amicably. He says the board changes were appropriate given the new direction
that the company was taking following its change of management last year.
'The alteration in the board structure forms part of the changes which are
being implemented at the company,' he says. 'I believe we have an excellent
team at Dwyer, combining both senior City and property expertise.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / People: Likierman to advise Treasury on accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Likierman has been appointed as chief accountancy adviser to the
Treasury and head of the government accountancy service.
Likierman, 49, professor of accounting and financial control at the London
Business School, will be seconded initially for three years, taking up his
post on December 1. His predecessor, Sir Alan Hardcastle, retires at the end
of this month.
The job, which was advertised at Pounds 90,000-Pounds 120,000 a year,
involves advising the government on accounting policy, liaising with
professional bodies, overseeing financial management initiatives and covers
responsibility for co-ordinating accountants employed by the Civil Service.
The appointment comes at a time when there is considerable change in
accounting and auditing standards, regulation of auditors, restructuring of
accounting in the public sector and contracting out of services to private
enterprise.
Likierman is a member of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance and of the Financial Reporting Council. He was
president of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in 1991-92.
His research has emphasised the link between economics, accounting and
financial management in public expenditure. He has examined performance
measurement, spoken in favour of cautious moves towards private-sector style
accounting within the public sector and on the need to raise the profile and
influence of accountants within government.
After graduating in PPE from Balliol College, Oxford, Likierman trained as a
management accountant with Tootal in Manchester.
He served as a member of the Cabinet Office Central Policy Review Staff, was
adviser to several House of Commons select committees, a council member of
two Next Steps agencies, and a member of the Audit Commission. He has served
on several government inquiries including one on auditors' liability.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Rapeseed popularity grows
among 'greens' - Lubricants made from plant oils are gaining ground, but
cost is a limiting factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To some, they jar on the eyes amid the summer green of the European
countryside. To others, they are a welcome splash of bright colour.
Throughout northern Europe and across parts of North America, glaring yellow
fields of rapeseed have become a common crop for the foodstuffs industry.
Increasingly though, the plant is making inroads into industry - encouraged
by EC subsidies - as the base oil for lubricants which do not pollute the
ground or air.
As industrialised countries introduce stricter environmental laws and
guidelines, the use of non-mineral oil-based lubricants is gaining ground.
Last year, Austria became the first country to put a legal ban on lubricants
containing mineral oil, though this was only for use with chain saws.
Other countries, notably Germany and Switzerland, are becoming more
conscious of the damage lubricants can do to the environment, especially
near rivers or streams. Thus, reckons Theo Mang, technology director at
Fuchs Petrolub of Germany, use of environmentally friendly lubricants could
account for between 10 and 15 per cent of the German market by the end of
the century. At present, they make up only around 1.5 per cent of the
market, which totals 1.2m tonnes a year; the west European market is more
than 5m.
Products based on mineral oil are poorly biodegradable, only about a third
of their content being absorbed into the environment over the accepted
21-day test period. Lubricants based on plant oils and their derivatives
break down almost entirely.
'Up to 40 per cent of the volume of lubricants goes into the environment
after use,' says Mang. Most of this is deliberate. The dispersal is part of
the process in which the oils are used, as with so-called total loss
lubrication in which equipment is fed with oil to keep bearings running
smoothly.
Companies are unlikely to switch to non-mineral oil products for love of the
environment. Such products are more expensive. Also, they are not usually
subject to a specific ban, the Austrian law being an exception.
'Concern for the environment is not going to be enough,' believes Mang. 'We
have to find other arguments.'
Fuchs, a world leader in the development of plant oil-based products,
stresses instead the costs that can be incurred if lubricants accidentally
pollute environmentally sensitive areas.
In Germany, one litre of spilled hydraulic oil can spoil one cubic metre of
soil. Cleaning this up costs around DM1,500 (Pounds 600).
Storage can also be cheaper for lubricants made with rapeseed, oils such as
sunflower oil, or from esters (organic compounds) derived from them, since
no special precautions are needed to prevent these entering the water table.
At the simplest level, as with chain saw oil, rapeseed-based lubricants can
cost up to 30 per cent more than regular lubricants. But beyond this, the
costs soar. For more complex hydraulic lubricants, the price can be double
that for products based on mineral oil.
In very specialised cases, this may not matter. Some aviation oils are based
on esters, not because of their environmental properties but for technical
reasons. For most applications, however, the price difference is important.
Mang says companies are gradually more willing to consider plant oil-based
products, 'but price is a limiting factor'.
An important stimulus to their wider use is the attitude of the authorities.
Most German forests are state-owned and their administrators have laid down
that biodegradable oils must be used for mechanical work there. Public
authorities are also taking a tougher line on types of oils used on
construction sites for their new buildings, and the Bundesbahn (federal
railways) is testing plant-based oils for greasing its track.
As this awareness spreads throughout industry in Germany and elsewhere, Mang
sees a growing market for non-polluting lubricants. 'I'm convinced it's only
a question of time before it develops in other countries like France and the
UK.' He also sees prospects in the US and Canada, especially for
wood-processing machinery and possibly later in South America.
Clearly, official pressures will have a strong influence on the speed and
extent to which plant oil-based products made by Fuchs and other companies
are taken up. In Germany, the country's Blue Angel label for ecologically
sound products - awarded by a panel of government, consumer, industry and
environmental representatives - has been applied to chain saw and total loss
lubricants and Mang expects it to be extended to hydraulic oils.
At present, around 70 per cent of Fuchs' non-polluting lubricants are
rapeseed-based, the rest being made from synthetic esters derived from
rapeseed or other natural fatty acids. But the more demands that are put on
the lubricants, the more reliance is likely to be placed on esters.
If price were no object, around 90 per cent of lubricants could be made with
plant oils or esters, reckons Mang. But even in his wildest dreams he does
not see this happening, especially with recession causing companies to look
hard at costs.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: An island's experience -
Regional electricity companies will shortly have to promote conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Chapman was suspicious when Manweb, his local electricity
distributor, offered help in reducing the power requirements of the
aluminium factory he manages. Working in a highly competitive industry he
found it hard to comprehend why any company should seek to cut its sales
volumes.
However, Chapman and his factory, owned by the Aluminium Power Company
(Alpoco), took Manweb's advice and are now reaping the benefits. The
projected annual savings on Alpoco's power bill amount to more than Pounds
16,000. The company is among several thousand beneficiaries at Holyhead,
north-west Wales, where Manweb has been conducting a six-month experiment on
promoting energy efficiency measures.
The results are expected to include a reduction in peak electricity demand
next January of about a ninth. They will be examined closely by other
regional electricity companies, which are beginning to look at similar
initiatives, and by environmental campaigners.
In the UK, energy efficiency has never achieved the prominence it has in
North America, where electricity companies are required by regulatory
authorities to promote it.
But that is about to change. In a recent review of the 12 regional
electricity companies' (Recs) supply businesses, Offer, the electricity
regulator for England and Wales, removed incentives for Recs to make profits
just by selling more electricity, rather than being more efficient.
From next April, the companies will be required to spend Pounds 1 per
customer, per year on energy efficiency measures. Similar measures are
expected in Offer's review of the Recs' more profitable distribution arms,
scheduled for completion next year.
The Holyhead initiative was conceived after a Copenhagen energy conservation
conference attended two years ago by Colin Leonard, Manweb's power marketing
director. Leonard admits the company could see the public relations
advantages in a conservation experiment. More important, the company felt
the experiment would give it a lead in building its energy conservation arm.
With value added tax being introduced on domestic fuel sales next year, the
energy conservation industry is set for growth. An attraction for Manweb is
that profits will not be regulated by Offer.
In choosing a testbed area, Manweb was attracted to Holyhead because, as an
island at the edge of the company's distribution area, it was electrically
self-contained. In addition, the company faced a bill for Pounds 750,000
within two years on reinforcing the network on the island.
The reduced energy consumption means that expenditure can be deferred.
Manweb says it is not looking to make money out of the initiative; rather to
learn from the experience. However, with the aid of an Pounds 80,000 EC
grant and the reinforcement work savings, it hopes it can recoup its Pounds
500,000 investment in the Holyhead project.
Manweb's money has been spent on a mixture of gifts and incentives to the
island's 3,500 households and 660 businesses. Domestic customers were
offered two low-energy light bulbs for 70p each, less than a tenth of their
usual price, and a free hot-water cylinder insulation and low-cost
insulation and draught proofing. Commercial and industrial power users were
each provided with a free energy audit and financial help towards
implementing the recommendations.
At Alpoco, the bulk of the savings (Pounds 13,500 a year) have come from
reconditioning three of the five compressors needed to convert molten
aluminium into powder. The reconditioning cost Pounds 30,000 but with Manweb
contributing Pounds 5,000, Alpoco expects to recover its expenditure within
two years.
Manweb contributed Pounds 10,000 to the Pounds 12,000 cost of installing a
power factor correction unit needed to regulate power flows. Alpoco's
investment of Pounds 2,000 should be repaid within a year.
Requirements at the Anglesey Sea and Surf Centre were much simpler. A modern
building, it already benefited from energy technology equipment. 'Our
problem was that electrical surges were causing lights to pop,' says Nigel
Denis, manager.
Manweb's solution was the installation of 82 low-energy compact fluorescent
lamps at a cost of Pounds 4 each. The energy saving alone is about Pounds
250 to Pounds 300 a year, roughly equivalent to the cost of installation.
Simple solutions have also been the hallmark of Manweb's approach in the
domestic market, as pensioners Emrys and Mair Owen have discovered at their
one-bedroom bungalow. The installation of two compact bulbs, four-inch loft
insulation and draught proofing has cut the Owens' monthly electricity bill
from Pounds 36 to Pounds 28 a month.
But if Manweb's customers have benefited from the experiment, what has the
company gained, other than deferral of Pounds 750,000 of expenditure? 'We
have had almost every known energy saving measure known to mankind on the
island,' says Leonard. 'We aim to find out what works and doesn't work and
what people will resist.'
The knowledge will be provided by a comprehensive survey of Holyhead
inhabitants over the coming months. Depending on the results, Manweb will
decide whether to market products more aggressively in other areas.
Some lessons are already apparent. According to Benstead, response to the
project was considerably greater among the 3,500 householders, most of whom
have adopted at least some energy-saving measures, than it was among
businesses.
'We had to drag businesses to the talks we gave for them on energy
conservation,' he says. 'We found that very few were prepared to undertake
any work which did not pay for itself within a year or so.'
This has been a factor in prompting Manweb to consider schemes in other
areas where it will provide capital costs for energy-saving devices in
return for a proportion of the savings in future years. 'Many customers will
not invest in energy savings because they want to direct scarce capital at
core businesses,' says Leonard.
'Some organisations, including hospitals, have no money but would benefit
enormously, for example, from new lighting systems. Like other electricity
companies, we have low gearing and can afford to help.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / People: Italian with designs for Dawson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile company, has appointed the
merchant banker Arnoldo di Giorgio to the newly created post of director of
corporate strategy. He will be responsible for identifying and helping
secure acquisition opportunities.
Di Giorgio, 34, was until recently director of investment banking with IMI
Capital Markets UK, an offshoot of IMI, the Italian state-owned investment
bank. He has also worked for Schroders and the Industrial Bank of Japan,
both in the US and Europe.
Born of Italian parents in the US but educated in Italy, he says he came
into contact with Dawson International while acting for companies which
Dawson was attempting to take over.
Sir Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson, says it is hiring di Giorgio because
of his international experience of the textile industry. 'This new
appointment brings additional resources to help realise our full potential
and marks the strengthening of our resolve to do so,' he said. Di Giorgio
will join Dawson on November 1 and will be based in London.
Dawson is divided between Dawson Premier Brands in the UK, which is
predominantly in knitwear, and Dawson Consumer Products in the US, whose
products include thermal underwear. It made pretax profits of Pounds 32m on
turnover of Pounds 431m in 1992/93, making it a medium-sized player among
other textile groups.
'Dawson has reached a critical level of profits and sales,' says di Giorgio.
'It can either go up or down - it can't stay where it is. I would like to
see global approach.'

The merchant bank Lazard Brothers, which is 50 per cent-owned by Pearson,
publisher of the Financial Times, has appointed another non-executive
director, Michael Orr, thus increasing the number of non-executives on the
board to eleven.
The chairman of Molins, manufacturer of specialist machinery for the tobacco
and packaging industries, Orr, 56, is a very active City figure, having
already notched up non-executive positions at WH Smith, Granada Group,
Sketchley, Govett's Strategic Investment Trust, the Throgmorton Trust, and
the Staffordshire-based brewers Marston Thompson and Evershed.
Is Lazard's chairman, David Verey, confident that Orr (right) will be able
to squeeze some extra time into an already busy schedule?
'That is his (Orr's) agony and to some extent mine too,' says Verey. 'But he
is very conscientious and we reckon on him spending about a day a week with
us,' he adds.
Verey alighted on Orr 'because he presents an unusual mix for a merchant
bank; he is someone who understands merchant banking but is also plugged
into the industrial scene'.
Having spent time with Grand Metropolitan - as finance director - and with
Merrill Lynch, Orr is 'energetic, active, intelligent and well regarded, an
unusual combination,' feels Verey.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Recruitment: Time to face up to the final score - Not
everybody has the luck to be in a position to look ahead with nary a
backward glance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FORWARD, forward let us range,' urged Tennyson, adding for good measure:
'Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.' And
who could fail to admire such a firmly future-orientated policy?
Even so, not everyone has the luck to be in a position to look bravely ahead
with nary a glance backward. Take for instance the Jobs column's present
writer who returns from the summer break today with over a thousand
appearances in this corner of the FT behind him, but only 20 more to go
before retiring.
While that may simply herald welcome relief to you out there who at worst
may be fated to read them, it presents somewhat of a problem to me who has
to write them. Indeed, having not been in such a situation before, I've
spent a few holiday hours wondering what to do about it.
True, the 20 columns left to me add up to about 26,000 words still to be
penned, which seems more than enough to go on with. So I shall half take
Tennyson's advice by discussing any new developments noticeably relevant to
highly skilled work, as well as updating the customary reports on surveys of
pay and so on.
But the words remaining are as little to the near 1 1/2 m already churned
out, some of which had a bit of thought behind them. Accordingly, I'll also
be casting back in hope of piecing together the odd useful lesson emerging
from the past, which in the Jobs column's case is longish. It first appeared
in November 1968, although it went absent from January 1970 before returning
to start its present run three years later.
Whatever Tennyson says, such backward glancing is not only irresistible, but
sensible. It's all very well for him to bang on about letting the great
world spin for ever etc. But the fact is that neither he nor anyone else
could stop it. The best we can do is try to benefit from its future changes
by behaving wisely, and hints on how to do so often lie in changes that have
happened before.
Admittedly, the one that has probably had the widest impact on this column's
readership, has taken most effect in only the last few years. It is the
scrapping of whole layers of management by numerous employers, in business
at any rate, and the ditching of in-house staff furnishing less than central
services in favour of buying them in when needed from external concerns. But
the portents were surely there to be spotted well in advance.
For instance, in 1968 it was the case at least in Britain that young people
who did well in the academic system might fairly safely expect to be handed
life-long careers. Provided they impressed a university recruiter from a big
organisation, and then avoided badly blotching their copybook, they could
count on an above-average standard of living until they were dead.
Moreover, as some of those so recruited rose to command the then thriving
established outfits, it seemed reasonable to suppose that managers with the
skills to ensure an ever more prosperous future could be produced by the
same means. All that we needed to do was expand the existing higher
educational system, and top it off with postgraduate management schools.
Yet the flaw in that idea was soon apparent as established organisations
began falling by the wayside before the first higher educational expansion
was complete. Nor, given the heavier crashes that have accompanied further
academic expansions, can we sensibly expect still stronger doses of the same
supposed elixir to work henceforth.
The problem is to find better ways of identifying and honing effective
skills. And since I think past columns have chanced upon some useful clues,
I shall try to develop them in the remaining weeks. There will also be more
about the Laws of Organisational Stupidity and other related themes. . . but
not just yet.
FOR the moment I'm turning to one of the aforementioned customary reports on
salary surveys, summarised in the table below. As in previous years, the
figures are drawn from the most recent cross-Europe study by the Wyatt
management consultancy. The full report - which covers 17 countries and of
course contains a far greater wealth of data than is given here - is priced
at Pounds 1,250 plus VAT.
For each of the 10 countries I have listed, the table ranks the directors in
charge of the various functional departments by the money value that
companies evidently put on them. The basis of the ranking is the gross pay
received in cash, salary plus bonuses and so on, of a typical chief
executive in the same land: a figure that is given in italics under the
country's name, with other currencies converted into sterling at the London
closing exchange rates of last Friday.
Below that come the various directors, ranked by their gross pay shown as
percentages of the pay of their home country's chief.
As may be seen, the values apparently placed on the various functions vary
considerably, although finance takes pride of place six times out of 10. The
differential the chief enjoys over the average for all subordinate directors
taken together is highest in Italy, and lowest in the UK.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Management: Give yourself a pat on the head - Lucy Kellaway
examines ways to overcome stress at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I WANT you to relax. Rest both your feet firmly on the ground. Shake your
hands like this, and place them in your lap. Now shut your eyes, gently
close your lids and concentrate on doing that. Breathe in through your nose
and then out through your mouth. Slowly, slowly, take your time.'
It could have been a relaxation class for expectant mothers. In fact it was
a seminar for stressed-out executives, given in London this week by a woman
who fights stress on the front line in New York.
Silvea Thomas has taught the New York police force and fire service how to
overcome the pressures of their work, and argues the same methods of coping
apply to anyone in any job. Dealing with stress while making a violent drug
bust in Harlem or fighting a towering inferno is no different from managing
the pressures of nine-to-five office life in the suburbs.
'The way in which the body responds to stress is common to everyone,' she
says. 'The issue is not the level of stress but how you deal with it.'
The trick, she argues, is to recognise at the outset when we are getting
into a stressful situation, and learn how to talk ourselves out of it. So
whenever an underling is obstructive, or the boss shouts, the pulse begins
to race and the adrenalin flows, we must stop for a minute. 'Say to
yourself: 'What's the rush? slow down', or count to 10, or do anything to
give yourself time for a change of focus.'
This she says sends the body a physical message which helps switch off its
alarm signals. You should 'give yourself a positive to take place of the
negative'.
This means that when challenged you should act as your own cheerleader,
telling yourself that you can do it. In extremis you should not only urge
yourself on, but should pat yourself on the head. She recommends that you
give yourself a series of little strokes all over your head starting from
the top.
If you are embarrassed to do this in the middle of a meeting you could go to
the lavatory and do it there, she suggests. People should also take their
lunch breaks, no matter how busy they are, and go for a brisk walk. They
should make an effort to snatch moments during the day to clear their minds
and relax.
Firefighters in New York - which may be the stress capital of the world -
may have long since realised the importance of stroking their hair and
inhaling deeply. But according to Thomas people in the UK are still not
aware of the extent of the damage done by stress nor the need to address the
problem.
On returning to the UK after an absence of nine years, she finds stress
everywhere. People are frightened of losing their jobs, and those who still
work are having to work harder. Meanwhile improvements in technology have
meant that everybody is on call 24 hours a day. 'You can be caught anywhere,
everywhere,' she says.
She believes figures from the UK Health and Safety Executive for the amount
lost each year through occupational stress sickness are too low because they
only look at absenteeism.
More realistic are official US figures which estimate that the overall
effect of stress, taking into account the inefficiency it causes, will cut
gross national product by 10 per cent.
So if the person opposite you on the train starts giving their head little
pats, look on them with respect: they may indirectly be increasing the
country's GNP.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Management: A little local difficulty - Christopher Lorenz
reports on a shake-up at Ciba that has caused tension among national
subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolfgang Samo has pioneered a string of controversial changes at Ciba, the
Swiss chemicals and drugs multinational. He is best-known in the company for
three things: for the toughness with which he has turned round several of
its problem businesses; for his early creation of small, transparent
business units at a time when Ciba was still heavily centralised and
organised in large, opaque lumps; and for transforming the motivation and
performance of managers outside Ciba's Basle base by shifting the global
headquarters of several businesses away from there well before so-called
'transnational' structures became fashionable in the late 1980s.
But never before has Ciba's top management - which now includes Samo himself
 -repeatedly had to reassure the rest of the company that an experiment
which he is conducting today will not necessarily be applied to the rest of
the group tomorrow. The latest attempt to pacify managers' fears is being
made this month, following a lakeside conclave of the top team in late
August.
A tall and youthful 55-year-old bearded German who bears more than a passing
resemblance to Europe's best-known corporate revolutionary, Percy Barnevik
of ABB, Samo admits that, even in top management, some people think one of
his latest actions is 'sheer madness'.
But he adds quickly that several other division bosses would like to follow
suit.
Out in the various countries affected by his action, reactions to Samo's
move also differ, ranging from enthusiasm in Spain, Italy and France to a
decided lack of conviction in Britain.
The British say their reluctance has been misconstrued, and that it resulted
from organisational difficulties arising from the relative size and
complexity of the UK polymer operations, which are based outside Cambridge.
But Samo claims that 'it has nothing to do with the organisation - it is
purely a matter of the individuals'.
The action in question was taken last January in polymers, one of the most
hard-pressed of four divisions which report to Samo. As part of a
Europe-wide 're-engineering' project for that division which is even more
far-reaching than most such exercises, the divisional heads for 10 west
European countries were replaced by a leaner supranational structure.
Salespeople in each country are still organised nationally, but they now
report to one of three regional sales managers located around Europe, who in
turn report to a European sales manager in Basle.
The move has not only meant the early retirement of a batch of national
division managers, but also a further weakening of the muscle of a second
group of more senior executives, Ciba's 'group company heads' -
once-powerful country bosses who used to control the activities of its
various divisions on their territory. This has naturally provoked
resistance.
Until 1990 the 'group company heads' were jointly responsible for local
divisional operations. Since then, in common with many other companies in
chemicals and other industries, this strong geographic influence has been
reduced throughout Ciba to a 'dotted line', giving clearer control to
divisional bosses. In polymers, that dotted line has been removed entirely.
Instead, 'there's a big hole', says Samo.
That is what John Fraser, the UK group company head, dislikes. 'I feel no
problem at the loss of direct authority over divisional heads,' he insists.
'I've been doing that for eight years of my own volition,' as part of a
decentralisation policy he initiated in the UK before the rest of the group
followed suit. But he does prize the ability to comment from time to time on
UK aspects of divisional affairs, and for his input to be respected. In
polymers 'that has now been lost', he says starkly.
The second source of the fuss over the polymers move is the national heads
of other divisions, who 'fear the same fate as polymers', as Samo puts it.
There are also some genuine fears that, although most of the division's
customers are multinational companies which themselves operate across
national borders, the removal of local management will impair Ciba's
responsiveness to different demands in different markets.
Samo protests to the contrary: the need to make the barely profitable
polymers division more customer-responsive by shortening its lines of
communication was one of the sparks behind the re-engineering project, he
says; the others were the division's in-built heavy overheads and stocks. To
help achieve this, the existing network of 28 warehouses will be cut to six
between November and the end of 1994, and order processing will done
centrally in Basle.
This re-design of polymers' supply network, and the associated information
system, was the concept with which the re-engineering project began, before
it was enlarged with the help of consultants from CSC Index to encompass the
changes in sales management. Together, annual savings of more than SFr30m
(Pounds 14.2m) are expected, compared with the project's one-off cost of
SFr20m-plus.
The fact that the change was so systems-driven, and that consultation, staff
training and 'culture change' initiatives were left very late, is one of the
points on which the UK's John Fraser criticises the project.
John Beadsmoore, who was UK head of polymers until the post was abolished in
January, agrees. He retains a sort of sponsorship role which has been
negotiated especially with Basle, but his main job is now global head of the
group's adhesives business, a responsibility which Samo transferred to him
from Basle last year.
Samo says he wishes Beadsmoore were 'more struck' by the latter than by the
loss of polymers. 'We still have a lot of convincing to do with our British
colleagues,' he says.
Diplomatically, Beadsmoore and Fraser claim repeatedly that their
differences with Basle have been over the 'how' of the re-engineering
project, rather than over its basic direction, and that their constructive
suggestions have been misconstrued as opposition. But it is self-evident
that this is an understatement.
From his relatively neutral vantage point north of Basle on the River Rhine,
Fraser's German counterpart Walter Fuellemann sees the British reaction as
'quite understandable'. He says: 'It's easy to plan strategic projects in
black and white, but when you go into detail you hit a minefield.' Local
management has no choice but to speak up, he says.
Fuellemann also sympathises with Beadsmoore's rueful observation that, for a
company now so committed to decentralisation, the new polymers organisation
is remarkably centralised on Basle.
Samo replies firmly that Basle just happens to be virtually in the centre of
Europe, that it is only the division's salesforce and logistics management
which have been centralised - much of the rest was already in Basle - and
that in other respects his decentralisation drive continues.
In the end, Fuellemann sides with Samo on the need to centralise (or
'regionalise', as he puts it) in polymers. 'The only way to find out whether
a European organisation really works, and can be a reasonable approach for
other divisions too, is to try it,' he says. If, after a year or two's
experience, other divisions are allowed to follow suit, Samo forecasts that
that the centralisation would not necessarily be on Basle: 'it could just as
well be Brussels, or elsewhere', he says.
He is equally clear that 'it would be crazy' for pharmaceuticals, and
several other Ciba divisions which need deeper sales management in each
country, to copy the new polymers organisation. 'Each division is different,
and needs to be organised differently'. If he has his way, Ciba will move
even further away from having a standardised structure, and become a model
of what business school academics call 'the differentiated organisation' of
the future.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Statutory basis sought for employees' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC yesterday backed a policy on trade union and employment rights
incorporating what it said were 'the best labour practices' in Europe and
the US.
But a motion from Mr Arthur Scargill, mineworkers' union president, calling
on unions to defy labour laws, was defeated by a two-to-one majority.
The TUC policy calls for a 'fair and balanced legal framework' for unions
based on International Labour Organisation conventions.
This would involve introducing statutory rights for workers to join,
organise and be active in unions; to strike; and to have legally binding
union recognition agreements with employers.
The strategy also includes a more active role for the TUC. This would
involve provision of TUC help to unions whose members are offered individual
contracts of employment so that they can continue to receive union services;
a TUC campaign against the trend of union derecognition by employers; and a
TUC effort to publicise the trade union cause among the public. 'The lack of
trade union freedoms in the UK is now a human-rights issue and should be
pursued as such,' the TUC said. 'The time has now come to shape a new deal
for the individual at work.'
Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF technical union, moving the TUC
policy, said: 'The pendulum of attack on employment and trade union rights
has swung too far against individuals.'
Mr Scargill was applauded for his characteristically belligerent speech as
he put an NUM motion calling for 'non-co-operation' with employment laws.
'Don't comply with the laws,' he said. 'We need to stand up and be counted.
The movement must fight back and take collective action when it is
necessary.'
But the NUM motion was defeated on a card vote by 4,757,000 to 2,498,000.
Britain's biggest union - the 1.4m strong Unison public service union -
backed the miners.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Unison honeymoons in Brighton: Lisa Wood on the problems of
the marriage between three unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH HIS trim figure, gold spectacles, smart blue suit and well-polished
black shoes Mr Alan Jinkinson looked like the managing director of a
fast-growing company as he addressed the TUC conference as the boss of
Britain's biggest and newest union.
Mr Jinkinson is general secretary of Unison, formed in July by the merger of
Nalgo, Cohse and Nupe, the public-service unions. Their experiences during
the courtship and marriage forms just one of a number of examples that other
unions may consider in formulating merger plans.
Unison, with assets of Pounds 80m, employs 1,800 staff to look after the
interests of 1.4m workers, ranging from white-collar town-hall employees to
hospital ancillary workers. These pay annual subscriptions totalling almost
Pounds 100m.
Mr Jinkinson, previously general secretary of Nalgo, says that merging
unions cannot be compared with merging companies, which have different
objectives.
The main aim of the unions' merger was to prevent employers from playing
them off against each other. Economies of scale were important, but not at
the expense of union democracy and jobs. Critical to the success of the
merger, he says, was that no single union should be seen to be in the
driving seat and that compromises were made at every level.
It took more than four years of meetings, consultancy reports and delegates'
conferences before the knot was eventually tied. There have been no
compulsory redundancies and none of the offices around the country have been
closed. Nor have the three London headquarters of the former unions been
rationalised.
The belief is that buildings will be sold gradually over time and staff
levels will be reduced by natural wastage. Pay for Unison's employees has
yet to be standardised, which could result in the wage bill going up.
The three unions had very different cultures - from the activist-led Nalgo
with its roots in local government to the more bureaucratic Nupe where
poorly paid workers, such as ancillary workers in hospitals, drew heavily on
the assistance of full-time officials.
Administration also differed: Nupe collected its subscriptions centrally,
while Nalgo raised funds through its local branch network. New structures
are being introduced which reflect a successful compromise of the different
backgrounds, says Mr Jinkinson.
It is a claim that is only partly endorsed, with some officials arguing that
a more 'big-bang approach' might have been useful to knock heads together.
One says: 'Some feel a touch of Stalinism would not have gone amiss.'
Officials talk of the practical difficulties of, for example, dealing with
fluid groups such as those representing women and black people, and the more
bureaucratic elected committees of Nupe.
Mr Mike Folliard, an ex-Nupe branch secretary and chairman of the staff side
at Central Manchester Healthcare Trust, says: 'Not a lot has happened
locally because part of the agreement was that there would be a transitional
period of two years.'
Employers say they have not yet seen any benefit from the merger. West
Dorset Community Health Trust, like a number of other trusts, wants to trim
Unison's presence around the bargaining table from six to two
representatives. The trust says: 'Unison argues that two people cannot
represent the interests of such a wide variety of people. We disagree.'
Mr Jinkinson admits there is duplication at present, with joint branch
secretaries and chairpersons reflecting the entrenched self-interest. But he
believes this will resolve itself in time, and he refuses to be drawn on
whether there is over-representation of the union in workplaces. A colleague
says: 'We are not here to help the employers - our job is to represent the
interests of all our members.'
Unison disputes claims - such as one made recently by the Royal College of
Nursing - that the merger has alienated some of its members, including
nurses, who do not want to be part of a big general union which they believe
is dominated by Nalgo.
Mr Jinkinson argues that membership of Unison will confer big benefits.
'Employers can no longer divide and rule - playing off white-collar workers
against blue-collar ones.'
Unison's power has not yet been tested. Mr Jinkinson hints that there could
be a call for a show of strength next year if pay offers are not generous.
If any evidence was needed to show that the vigour his former union for
taking on the bosses had not been sapped, it came yesterday. Unison, with
the majority of its delegates drawn from the former Nalgo, was the only big
union to support a call by Mr Arthur Scargill to break the Tory labour laws.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Lobby against unfair sacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC, in alliance with the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux, plans to lobby the government to improve workers' legal protection
from unfair dismissal.
At present people who work more than 16 hours a week fail to qualify for
such protection until they have worked full-time for their employer for two
years.
Ms Ann Abraham, chief executive of the association, said yesterday that
employers were systematically sacking workers a few days before they reached
the two-year threshold - and sometimes re-employing them again a few days
later - simply to stop them from qualifying for employment protection under
the 1986 Wages Act.
The TUC and the association want the government to reduce the qualifying
period for unfair dismissal to six months.
Ms Abraham said no other EC country had such a restrictive and lengthy
qualifying period.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Employers urged to end age bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH employers yesterday were urged to stop discriminating against older
workers as a Europe-wide survey revealed that an increasing numbers of
employees over 50 were being 'persuaded' to retire early by their companies.
The study, by the European pressure group Eurolink Age, said that
recruitment policies in most countries start to work against applicants from
the age of 40.
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged employers to tackle
discrimination against older workers as part of a campaign to improve work
opportunities for women, ethnic minorities and those with disabilities.
It warned companies that unless they 'secure the best contribution from all
the talent available, they will not compete effectively'. While progress had
been made in some areas, there remained glaring examples of
under-representation of some groups of workers, it added.
Launching a new statement on equal opportunities, the CBI said redundant
executives aged over 40 take twice as long to find jobs as those under 35.
The CBI also pointed to the fact that more than 40 per cent of the labour
force is female, yet only 8 per cent of managers are women; disabled people
are four times as likely to be unemployed as those without disabilities; and
only 36 per cent of young people of Asian origin are in employment compared
with 71 per cent of white young people.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social and
employment affairs commissioner, would be invited by the CBI 'to make equal
opportunities a central part of the community's social policy'.
The Eurolink Age report, published as part of the European Year of Older
People, finds that older workers are subjected to early loss of employment,
discrimination in recruitment, exclusion from training and enforced
retirement throughout the EC.
It calls for age limits, for example in job advertisements, to be abolished;
employment and training measures for older workers; and action to promote
good practice across Europe by governments, employers and trade unions.
The study says US age-discrimination legislation has succeeded in protecting
older workers' employment rights and eliminated the most blatant forms of
discrimination but has not changed underlying attitudes.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Obituary: Sir David Brown - pioneer of engineers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID BROWN, the industrialist, lover of fast cars and one of the great
characters of 20th-century British engineering, has died in Monaco aged 89.
As chairman of the David Brown Corporation, Sir David forged a family-owned
engineering empire that spanned gears, machine tools, castings and other
products.
To the general public, Sir David was a motor-racing fanatic whose company
once owned Aston Martin, the maker of luxury cars.
His achievements were many and various. His David Brown Tractors company,
founded in 1935, was the first to make an all-British tractor in England. In
1959 he was inaugurated as Chief Flying Sun of the Iroquois Tribe of the
Mohawk Nation - an unusual accolade for a British businessman, it resulted
from his links with Canada.
Sir David was once described as 'at once energetic, forceful, ruthless, shy,
withdrawn, gregarious, shrewd, suggestible'.
He shared with Mr Joe Bamford, founder of the JCB construction equipment
group, an intense enthusiasm for mechanical matters, and a deep desire to
keep control of his company in family hands.
Sir David had become managing director of the family business, then called
David Brown and Sons, in 1932, 11 years after joining as an apprentice. His
heyday was the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, when his control of the company was
absolute. By the time he sold David Brown Corporation in 1990, he had lacked
any day-to-day involvement for some 20 years.
Sir David's great strength was his technical savvy. He was quick to spot how
a new technology could lead to an edge in the marketplace, and would always
move promptly to exploit new opportunities.
As a businessman his weakness, perhaps, was that he was never driven by a
strong impulse to create profits. His involvement with Aston Martin from
1947 to 1972 encapsulates this approach - he once admitted that he never
made any money from the carmaker but he had a good time.
The original David Brown gear manufacturer, founded at Huddersfield in 1860,
is now thriving under new owners as the David Brown Group. Aston Martin and
some of Sir David's other businesses have long since been sold - although
this year Aston Martin revived the DB designation, the initials of its
former owner, for the first time in 20 years.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Attack on plan to ease care rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to relax the regulation and inspection of private
residential care and nursing homes came under attack yesterday from health
professionals and the Labour party.
The Department of Health this week wrote to the proprietors of residential
care homes, which are registered with local authorities, and private nursing
homes and hospitals which are registered with health authorities, as part of
its Whitehall-wide drive to cut the 'onerous' burden of regulations on
businesses.
All of the 247,000 homes and hospitals in the private and voluntary sectors
have to comply with the Registered Homes Act of 1984. Since the National
Health Service started to cut its provision for long-term elderly patients,
the number of private beds in Britain has leapt to more than 500,000 from
64,000 in 1988.
The British Federation of Care Home Proprietors said that the cost of
registration and inspection was 'burdensome' and that there was a strong
case for self-regulation. At present, providers have to pay a one-off
registration fee of up to Pounds 1,060, recurring annual costs and expect
about two inspections a year.
Mr Clive Johnston, group commercial manager of Takare, the Telford-based
provider of 5,000 places at 200 nursing homes, said statutory regulation was
essential. But the fact that residential care homes and nursing homes were
registered with both local and health authorities made for unnecessary
bureaucracy.
He said: 'The number of inspections and the quality standards differ from
authority to authority - what satisfies one will not satisfy another.
Registration requirements should be standardised throughout the country.'
The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts opposed the plans
to deregulate the sector. 'Nursing homes are responsible for providing
24-hour nursing care to vulnerable people,' said the association, which
inspects the homes to ensure that qualified nurses are on hand and standards
of drug administration, food, hygiene and overall quality are acceptable.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the plans 'put business
before care' and called on the government to withdraw the letter.
'The Tories introduced the Registered Homes Act as a specific response to
problems emerging in the burgeoning private care homes market. Removing
inspection and registration . . . will assist cowboys to flout the rules.'
He was critical that the letter invites proprietors to make suggestions as
about to how to reducing the 'combined impact' of environmental health, fire
and other regulations.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Upward-only rent reviews defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH contradicting claims that the commercial property market's system
of upward-only rent reviews is inflationary was published yesterday by the
British Property Federation.
'The report shows that, far from being inflationary, upward-only rent
reviews have exerted a strong deflationary influence on the market,' said
the federation which represents landlords.
This came as part of the group's response to a government consultation paper
about possible reforms to the commercial property lease structure. The
system of upward-only rent reviews has been criticised during the recession
because it has prevented rents paid by existing tenants from falling in line
with rents being asked for empty properties.
Although rental values moved faster than retail prices in the early 1970s
and late 1980s, the rate of price inflation exceeded that of rental values
for most of the last 22 years. 'The commercial lease has protected tenants
against the full effects of rental value inflation,' the report says.
Tenants would have paid more if they had replaced the conventional lease
with an agreement to link rent increases to retail price inflation in each
of the last 22 years except for 1989 and 1990.
If the structure were changed, rents would rise in the longer term to
protect investors against increased uncertainty and risk, the report says.
Critics of the system include the Bank of England, which said earlier this
year that 'upwards-only rent review clauses seem designed for a world which
had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values'.
The options in the consultation paper include prohibiting upward-only
reviews and allowing rents to move either up or down, but never below the
initial rent.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Lure of profits tempts corporate Names: Attracting
institutional capital to Lloyd's may be easier than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE finance teams at more than half a dozen banks and securities
houses are increasingly confident about their ability to attract corporate
capital to the Lloyd's of London insurance market, which prepares to publish
its rulebook for 'incorporated Names' in the next few days.
Many organisations are well-advanced with plans to raise several hundred
million pounds for the Lloyd's market. They include UK merchant banks which
are aiming to float investment companies or trusts on the Stock Exchange, US
investment banks which generally favour private placements among US
institutions, and venture capitalists and the 'super-rich'.
They say that the lure of significant profits as insurance rates increase is
proving attractive to institutional investors.
'Our optimism is rising quite a lot. The mood in the markets has swung,'
says one British corporate finance executive, who adds that even cautious
Scottish investment houses are becoming interested.
Insiders at Lloyd's believe it could be able to attract between Pounds 500m
and Pounds 1bn in fresh capital next year, offsetting a decline in funding
provided by Names, the individuals whose assets currently support the
market.
Lloyd's announced its plans to seek corporate investment last April in a bid
to shore up its capital base. This followed the loss of more than 10,000
Names and some Pounds 3bn in capacity during the past four years.
The new rulebook for corporate investors effectively amounts to a
'prospectus' and will detail the terms on which new investors will be able
to participate at Lloyd's. Accounting, regulatory and other rules are
spelled out in detail in the document, which will provide a comprehensive
picture of how the Lloyd's market works.
Final approval is still dependent on existing Names, who must vote on the
plans at an extraordinary general meeting in October. Their approval is far
from guaranteed.
Two months ago financiers were worried about the scale of liabilities faced
by Lloyd's from US pollution and asbestos claims. But they now believe plans
to 'ring-fence' old claims by setting up a new reinsurance company will
work.
Even where doubts still exist, bankers are playing down the dangers. One
financier is telling potential clients that while the 'ring-fence' scheme
may not be entirely successful, it will still provide an extra layer of
protection not enjoyed by investors in a number of UK and US insurance
companies, which are also exposed to US liabilities.
Similarly, concerns that allegations of mismanagement and regulatory failure
would make it difficult to sell investments seem to have evaporated. 'I
sense that Lloyd's has passed its absolute crisis point,' said one banker,
who only three months ago put the chances of success of his own bank's
scheme at only '50:50'.
Bankers are placing more emphasis on the prospects of profits, as premium
rates in the specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance markets reach
new highs.
Prices in the marine, aviation and other specialised markets in which
Lloyd's specialises have also risen strongly.
'The opportunities for profit are now very real in the London market, as the
rating structures in many of the major classes of business have been
corrected and there is a commitment to manage capacity far more
professionally than has been possible in the past,' says Mr Michael Wade, a
backer of Corporate Lloyd's Membership. This group is a subsidiary of
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which aims to launch a quoted investment
company later this year.
Whether investors will eventually prove receptive to these arguments remains
open to question. The timetable is tight - flotations would need to take
place in November.
Moreover, market sentiment about Lloyd's has proved to be notoriously
volatile. Although loss-making Names and their action groups have been quiet
recently, they have been remarkably successful in affecting perceptions in
the past. Lloyd's appears to have a good chance of raising much-needed
capital, but its leadership can take nothing for granted.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Victims of cancer treatment to sue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST six cancer patients wrongly diagnosed at Birmingham's Royal
Orthopaedic hospital are to sue for compensation, triggering a potential
flood of litigation against the local area health authority at the centre of
the case.
Five solicitors have already received instructions from clients and a
further two expect to do so in the next few days, according to the Law
Society, which has set up a service to co-ordinate actions.
'People have come to expect high standards,' said Mr Stephen Jones, a
partner with Pannone &amp; Partners, who added that the amount of litigation has
risen in the past seven to eight years. Pannone is representing Ms Vicki
Hunter, a 20-year-old PE student who lost part of her right leg as a result
of unnecessary cancer treatment.
Diagnostic errors have so far been identified in 42 cases handled by Dr
Carol Starkie for the hospital's bone-tumour unit. About 1,600 more cases
will be re-examined over the next three to four months, and the total of
misdiagnosed patients is expected to reach 100.
Solicitors for plaintiffs point out that recent changes in legal-aid rules
will make it more difficult for families to obtain help to finance actions.
'Changes may mean that people won't take action,' said Mr Tony Hall, of
Birmingham-based Anthony Collins, who is representing Matthew Guest, a
nine-year-old who received unnecessary chemotherapy treatment.
Even so, the cost to South Birmingham Health Authority could run into
millions of pounds, highlighting the burden of medical negligence claims for
both hospitals and general practitioners.
The Medical Defence Union, one of three mutual insurance schemes which
provides cover for GPs, said claims reached Pounds 28.5m last year, with
costs increasing by at least 15 per cent annually in recent years.
Health authorities are not insured for medical negligence claims and must
meet most of the costs of awards from their own budgets. Ms Cheryl Blundell,
a medical negligence specialist with Berrymans, the firm of solicitors which
acts for defendants, suggested that authorities could be stretched by the
cost of awards, which can reach more than Pounds 1m. The Law Society is
considering further legal action against the Lord Chancellor over his latest
plans to cut legal-aid pay.
From November Lord Mackay is proposing to pay solicitors a fixed hourly rate
set by him for civil legal-aid work. At present fees are set by district
judges.
The society claims Lord Mackay's proposed hourly rate of Pounds 65 is about
25 per cent less than the average now allowed by district judges.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Interest in corporate capital increases after publication of
Lloyd's business plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the publication of Lloyd's business plan in April interest in
corporate capital appeared to be greatest in the US. There a number of
investment banks examined the possibility of private placements of
investment funds among institutional investors, venture capitalists and rich
individuals. JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers have both been working on
schemes to raise corporate capital for nearly a year, for example. Morgan
has linked up with Marsh McLennan and Salomon with Johnson &amp; Higgins, two
large insurance brokers which place considerable amounts of business at
Lloyd's.
More recently UK merchant banks have also become involved. Partly because of
the relatively small size of the venture-capital market, UK banks have tried
to develop investment trusts or companies which would be listed as quoted
vehicles on the Stock Exchange and marketed to institutional and retail
investors.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is understood to have agreed to underwrite the launch
of Corporate Lloyd's Membership, an investment company or trust sponsored by
the Sedgwick Group, one of the UK's largest insurance brokers. Samuel
Montagu, which together with James Capel, another Hongkong and Shanghai Bank
subsidiary, is backing a separate investment company of some Pounds 250m,
has received most publicity. Montagu and Capel are supporting a scheme which
would channel capital through at least eight managing agents at Lloyd's.
Most UK merchant banks are also involved. Rea Brothers has linked with UBS
to back a Pounds 35m scheme; SG Warburg, which advised Lloyd's on its plan
to attract corporate investors, is involved in a separate plan; while
Lazards and Kleinwort Benson are supporting initiatives by two other agents,
Octavian and Sturge Holdings respectively. In other deals Phoenix
Securities, a London-based 'boutique' securities house, has linked with
Anton Members' Agency and the New York securities house Donaldson, Lufkin
and Jenrette.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Charity probe into trust linked to friend of Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-based organisation linked to Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish-Cypriot
businessman who stood bail for Mr Asil Nadir, is being investigated by the
Charity Commission.
It emerged last night that the affairs of UK Turkish Islamic Trust, a
registered charity with links to Moslem groups, are under investigation by
the commission. Mr Guney is registered with the commission as the chairman
of the trust.
The commission last night refused to go into details. But a commission
official indicated the potential seriousness of the investigation. He said:
'Following representations which suggest the administrative control of the
charity was inadequate, we have made our own enquiries and established that
there are causes for concern.'
It is understood that the commission has requested that the trust put its
affairs in order, and strengthen the trustee body as a first step.
Mr Guney, a north-London Turkish-Cypriot whose business interests include
running cemeteries, was ordered in July by an Old Bailey judge to surrender
Pounds 650,000 he promised as part of a record Pounds 3.5m bail which Mr
Nadir skipped in May, when he fled to northern Cyprus rather than face
charges of false accounting and theft. Mr Guney was given six months to pay
and warned he could face two years in jail if he defaulted.
Mr Justice Tucker, the judge in the case, said during the court proceedings
that he was satisfied that Mr Guney had played no part in Mr Nadir's flight.
However, the judge added that Mr Guney had not taken all reasonable steps to
ensure that Mr Nadir turned up to face trial.
In his appearance before Mr Justice Tucker, Mr Guney based his defence on
the Serious Fraud Office's failure to let him surrender his surety when the
case was first transferred to the crown court. The judge ruled that none of
the parties involved had ever considered that Mr Nadir had been surrendered
into the custody of the court, so that his sureties were still responsible
for his appearance at trial.
The scheduled date for the trials of Mr Nadir and an associate, Mr John
Turner, is October 4. However, sources close to the SFO indicated last night
that the trial of Mr Turner might not begin then because of Mr Nadir's
continuing refusal to return to the UK.

FT  08 SEP 93 / BP hopes for lift in N Sea oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North Sea could produce more oil and gas in the next 20 years than it
has produced in the past 20 years, Mr John Browne, managing director of BP,
said yesterday.
This would be achieved through more advanced technology and lower operating
costs, and would be helped by the UK government's new petroleum revenue tax
regime.
Mr Browne, opening the biennial Offshore Europe Conference and Exhibition in
Aberdeen, said the North Sea was mature after 20 years of high production
levels but was not finished, even though output was declining in some
fields.
He held out the possibility that UK oil production would stay at its current
level of 2.2m barrels a day well into the next century and even reach 2.8m
b/d, and that the UK government would receive an income of between Pounds
2.5bn and Pounds 3.5bn a year for 20 years.
He believed that within 20 years new technology could raise the proportion
of an oilfield's recoverable reserves from the current 45 per cent to 60 per
cent or even 70 per cent, and it could permit production from very small
fields.
Other productivity improvements would come from developing closer
partnerships between oil companies and offshore contractors to seek the most
cost-effective ways of operating.
'Given a further 30 per cent reduction in capital costs and a 50 per cent
reduction in operating costs over the next 20 years, it is possible to raise
the total volume recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around
65bn barrels to around 75bn barrels.'
Mr Browne said the reductions in petroleum revenue tax in the last Budget
were a further incentive to reduce costs and would be seen over time to have
brought great benefits to the North Sea.
Proposals for a Pounds 100m energy park, offering research and development
facilities for energy-related companies, were unveiled yesterday by Teesside
Development Corporation. The corporation, whose chief executive Mr Duncan
Hall dismissed science parks as 'somewhat passe', said the energy park will
establish Teesside as an international R&amp;D centre for the energy industry.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Busier M62 wins Pounds 540m development boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday announced plans to spend Pounds 540m improving the
M62 trans-Pennine motorway to cope with congestion and increasing
heavy-goods traffic between Liverpool, Greater Manchester, Yorkshire and the
Humber ports.
The proposals are to spend two tranches of Pounds 270m. One would provide a
relief road parallel to the M62, where the M61, M63, M602, A580 and M66 all
feed into it. This causes chronic congestion at present as local and through
traffic merge.
The other Pounds 270m would go on widening 21 miles of the M62 to four lanes
in each direction between the M66 Bury-Manchester motorway and Huddersfield.
The relief road would merge into the main motorway at the point it becomes
four lanes wide.
A process of public consultations was announced yesterday in Manchester by
Mr Robert Key, the roads minister. Mr Key also announced he was dropping
plans for a new link road between the M56 and M62 through green-belt areas
near Warrington after protests.
Exhibition of plans and consultation will take place over the next few
weeks. Objections - which would trigger public inquiries - are thought
inevitable because the relief road will run through several Greater
Manchester suburbs and hundreds of houses and other buildings will have to
be demolished.
Mr Key said designers hoped to minimise the environmental impact by building
25 ft high mounds on each side of the new motorway and planting trees to
screen it.
Because they are classed as improvements to existing infrastructure, the
relief road and M62 widening plans would be financed from the normal
public-sector roads programme, the Department of Transport said yesterday.
There is no provision yet in government spending plans for either project,
which - if finally approved - may therefore have to wait several years to
get on the programme.
Greater Manchester's motorway ring should be completed in about three years,
when the M66 links with the M63 in the conurbation's eastern suburbs. The
proposed relief road would separate trans-Pennine through traffic from local
users where the M62 forms part of the ring.
Heavy goods traffic has been increasing steadily as the M62 has formed a
land bridge for trade between Ireland, northern England and northern Europe.
The ports of the Mersey and the Humber are handling record levels of cargo.
These have continued to increase, even in the recession.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Growers attack forestry sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been urged not to privatise the Forestry Commission's
woodlands by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain, whose members
are mainly private-sector timber growers and processors.
The committee says it is the wrong time to privatise Forest Enterprise, the
Forestry Commission division which owns and manages 2m acres of woodland.
The committee says market conditions for a sale are poor, Forest Enterprise
has only recently been created and privatisation would divert investment
from planting.
An inter-ministerial committee is reviewing the system of incentives for
tree planting and the ownership of the Forestry Commission's woodlands, with
privatisation an option.
Environmental organisations and the Ramblers Association are against
privatisation, and opposition has also come from Timber Growers UK, whose
members are private forestry owners. and who might be expected to buy some
of the woodlands if they came on the market.
The committee adds that Forest Enterprise should be separated from the
Forestry Commission and be given agency status, which would allow it to
adopt a 'conventional commercial approach, free of the distortions followed
by a government department.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Quango sets course for teacher training reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUANGO is to be created to supervise the training of schoolteachers in
England, Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced yesterday.
The Teacher Training Agency will distribute funds to universities, colleges
and schools that provide approved initial teacher training.
The agency will shift the emphasis in teacher training to school-based
training and away from college-based courses which many government advisers
hold responsible for falling educational standards.
At present, universities and colleges receive their funds for teacher
training from the Higher Education Funding Council while schools are
directly funded by the Department for Education.
Mr Patten said that establishing a single funding body would 'ensure that
there is a co-ordinated approach to the provision of places and an
appropriate balance between the different types of training'.
The agency will take over the duties of the Teaching as a Career Unit, a
quango that provides information about careers in teaching. The unit will be
wound up and the agency will become a 'one-stop shop' for information and
advice on teaching.
Mr Patten also announced abolition of the Council for the Accreditation of
Teacher Education, the quango responsible for approving teacher-training
courses. Approval of initial teaching qualifications will be given by the
department of education to 'reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and clarify lines
of responsibility'.

MR Patrick McLoughlin, junior minister at the Department of Trade and

More companies should join the Investors in People initiative, set up by the

<TEXT>
THE government should end mortgage tax relief for the better off and target
the relief to those who most need it, according to the Construction Industry
Council, one of the industry's lobbying organisations.
Redirecting the relief to those who need it least would play an important
part in balancing the Budget and improving the economy, the council said
yesterday.
Mr Ian Dixon, the council's chairman, suggested that linking mortgage tax
relief to the council-tax bands may be worth considering.

FT  08 SEP 93 / R&amp;D spending shows 7% fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL UK spending on research and development fell 7 per cent in real terms
from 1990-91 to 1991-92, according to the government's annual review of R&amp;D
published yesterday. There was also a slight decline in cash terms, from
Pounds 12.0bn to Pounds 11.9bn
The fall takes the country's R&amp;D expenditure in real terms, adjusting for
inflation back to the level of 1985-86.
A sharp decline in industrial R&amp;D - caused by recession and defence cuts -
accounts for almost all of the overall fall.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Smaller companies in leasing firing line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL to extend consumer credit protection legislation to small
companies could lead to a sharp decline in the amount of hire purchase and
leasing finance available to small businesses, the Finance &amp; Leasing
Association warned yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes.
If at the same time the limit of financing agreements covered by the
Consumer Credit Act were to be doubled to Pounds 30,000, an estimated Pounds
830m could be lost to small businesses, the association said.
The warning comes as the Office of Fair Trading is due to publish a
consultation paper on whether the act should be extended to incorporated
businesses. At present it applies only to individuals and unincorporated
businesses.
The Department of Trade and Industry is also considering plans to double the
size of financings covered by the act.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Scar-free healing 'within five years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS will know within five years how to heal wounds without scars, it
was predicted yesterday at the launch of an Anglo-American research
initiative on scarring.
The University of Florida is working with University College, London, and
Moorfields Eye Hospital to develop new scar-prevention treatments for severe
burns, disfiguring accidents and surgery.
The starting point for the collaboration is research already carried out at
Moorfields and the University of Florida. They have found that a single
touch of 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer drug, greatly reduces the risk of
scarring - which can cause permanent blindness - in patients undergoing
surgery for glaucoma, a common eye disease.
The next stage will be to define the roles of various natural chemicals,
called growth factors and proteases, which regulate the healing process.
Clinical trials are starting in the US of growth factors to heal persistent
wounds. In the UK, Manchester University plans to start clinical tests
within six months of a technique to neutralise the growth factors that cause
scarring.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Sleepy pineapples arrive fresher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN researchers have devised a way of putting pineapples 'to sleep'.
This will prevent the tropical fruit from rotting in transit and means it
will be just ripe enough when it reaches supermarkets in Europe.
First consumers to taste the drowsy but more succulent produce will be in
Scotland, where fruit company Geest is carrying out market trials under the
Necta brand name.
Pineapples have previously been picked before they were ripe to enable them
to withstand damage during shipping. Unlike bananas, which continue to ripen
after picking, pineapples simply begin to rot once they are off the bush.
The Costa Rican pineapples are peeled and cored in a pilot plant before
being packed.
Geest is using modified atmospheric packaging, developed at the University
of British Columbia. This stops rotting by extracting oxygen from the sealed
rigid packing.
'The atmosphere keeps the 'living' fruit fresh, like a cut flower in water,'
explained Mr John Dutton, managing director of Geest's Prepared Produce
division.
When sales trial are launched in Scotland a 500 gram whole cored pineapple
will cost Pounds 1.99, 250 grams of pineapple chunks 99p. It will be next
summer before shoppers in other regions of Britain can taste the fruit.
Mr Dutton, whose company specialises in pre-packed fresh produce, said Necta
would eliminate the messy preparations needed to serve whole fresh
pineapples. 'They (Necta) taste better than most fresh pineapples and the
taste is much more consistent.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Italian group agrees rail deal in W Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO build a rapid transit system in the West Midlands took a step
forward yesterday when Ansaldo Trasporti, the Italian rail equipment group,
signed a joint-venture deal to develop and operate the line.
The deal removes some of the uncertainty over the Pounds 110m contract,
which was thrown into confusion earlier this year when Taylor Woodrow,
Ansaldo's original partner, abruptly withdrew from the venture.
At the time, Taylor Woodrow's decision was put down to an economy drive to
minimise losses in its contracting business. The company's withdrawal forced
Centro, the operating arm of the West Midlands Passenger Transport
Authority, to seek a new developer for Midland Metro Line One, a light
railway to run between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.
Centro officials said yesterday they had reopened talks with Eurotransit, a
second consortium formed by UK construction group Tilbury Douglas and AEG of
Germany, but had failed to reach agreement.
The breakdown allowed Ansaldo to resubmit its bid, which has now been
accepted by the transport authority. However, construction of the line will
not begin until Ansaldo finds a new civil engineering partner, and it
depends on winning significant government funding.
More than Pounds 100m in state aid or private-sector finance would be
required to complete the project, according to Centro.
Mr Bob Tarr, Centro's general director, said efforts to secure the
government funding 'would now be redoubled with an aim for a start date for
work on Line One during 1994-95'.
Under the contract, Ansaldo and its partner will pay Pounds 10m towards the
building costs and will receive a franchise to operate the transit system
for 20 years without subsidy.
When completed, Midland Metro will run 20km from central Birmingham, via
West Bromwich and Bilston, to Wolverhampton using mainly existing railway
trackbeds.
Mr Dick Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands Passenger Transport
Authority, said: 'We now have an agreement to build and operate the first
line on the terms we were seeking.
'I now hope Ansaldo's discussions with the construction industry provide the
final piece of the jigsaw.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Civil Service pension funds trail Abbey on performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Civil Service pensions offer only average benefits when compared
with similar plans offered by private-sector employers, a study has shown.
The study, conducted by Union Pension Services and sponsored by the GMB
general union, found that some banks and financial institutions offer the
best benefits available. The study ranked 100 leading pension schemes in
Britain by the benefits they offered and the contributions required from
employees.
It is the first effort to conduct a systemat comparison of private
employers' benefits. Among factors taken into account were the size of
contributions required from members, statutory increases to benefits, the
rate at which members accrue pension rights, and ancillary benefits such as
ill-health pensions and discretionary benefits.
The top 10 schemes for benefits and contributions were: Abbey National
Scheme, ICI Fund, TSB Group Scheme, Legal and General Fund, Burmah Castrol
Plan, BBC Scheme, Rothmans Fund, Shell Pension Fund, Woolwich Building
Society Fund and Siemans Scheme. The bottom 10 were: Rank Organisation Plan,
DRG Pension Fund (Lower Scale), TI Group Scheme (General Section), Massey
Ferguson Works, Massey Ferguson Staff, Daily Mail Scheme, Harmsworth Scheme,
Philips Pension Fund, NEI (Scale 1) and DRG Pension Fund.
Among civil service schemes, which have historically been reputed to offer
benefits superior to private-sector schemes, the Universities Scheme
achieved the top overall rating of 51 per cent. This compares with the
top-rated private-employer scheme, Abbey National, at 104 per cent.

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Moves to pacify farm lobby - Commission
agrees to increase EC 'set-aside' compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed to increase the amount of
compensation for EC farmers for land they have to take out of production.
The move was seen in Brussels as a further attempt to pacify the French farm
lobby, and to make it easier for France to accept the international farm
trade accords on which the future of the Uruguay Round now hangs.
Paris at the weekend renewed its threat to veto last year's Blair House deal
on farm trade between the US and the EC, a linchpin of any future deal on
world trade reform. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday refused to
yield to the entreaties of European employers' leaders for a speedy
conclusion to the Gatt negotiations, saying he would not be rushed into a
bad deal 'by fetishism for dates'.
France only agreed in June to accept the oilseeds clauses in Blair House
after additional compensation for 'set-aside' had been agreed by EC farm
ministers on May 27. Yesterday's move is part of the same decision.
Yesterday's Commission proposal would raise the compensation for
cereals-producing land which is taken out of production from a rate of Ecu45
to Ecu57 (Dollars 65.55) per tonne, calculated on the previous yield of the
land. This would add Ecu352m to the EC's farm budget of more than Ecu36bn,
Commission officials said, but the extra cost would not start until 1995.
'Set-aside' is required under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy, which slashes farm prices severely, compensating farmers for the
cuts only if they leave around 15 per cent of their land fallow to rein in
over-production - a decision which has caused outrage throughout the French
countryside.
The French government's formal objection to the Uruguay Round parts of Blair
House, recently delivered to the Commission, says the EC could only meet the
Gatt commitments in it through further set-aside. 'For France, there would
be no question of accepting an increase in set-aside, which has already
reached intolerable levels,' the document said.
The Commission also moved, in a package designed to make set-aside more
flexible, to allow farmers to set aside more land than the statutory
minimum, with full compensation.
Nobody in Brussels doubts, however, that much bigger instalments of money
will be needed for France to accept a Uruguay Round farm settlement, and
that this is likely to require a raising of the ceiling on farm spending.
Mr Carlos Ferrer, president of the Unice employers federation, said Europe's
companies needed 'a positive outcome this year' to the seven-year Gatt
negotiations. But the French prime minister indicated the line he will take
when he meets Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, today in Paris.
'Some say France is risking delaying the end of the Uruguay round
negotiations,' Mr Balladur said. 'I will only take this risk seriously when
the 54 countries who have not even presented in Geneva their offers on
tariffs do so.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN car industry leaders yesterday attacked a new car trade deal
between the European Community and Japan, saying it was unacceptable for
Tokyo to boost its market share during the EC sector's worst decline since
the second world war, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The board of directors of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association
said the deal meant Japan's EC market share would rise to at least 12.5 per
cent this year from 11.3 per cent last year.
In a statement issued after discussion at a board meeting in Frankfurt, the
association said this increase ran counter to a 1991 EC-Japan agreement
limiting Japanese car exports to the EC for the rest of the decade.
'At a time when European automobile manufacturers are announcing massive
workforce reductions, an increase in Japanese market share is unacceptable,'
the statement said.
The 1991 arrangement was based on the principle of fair sharing of market
downturns as well as increases and both sides had undertaken to uphold the
spirit and the letter of this understanding, the association said.
The latest agreement, announced in Tokyo last weekend after talks between
the European Commission and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, would cut Japanese car sales in the EC by about 100,000 this year
while the market would shrink by at least 2.4m.
Japan agreed to lower the ceiling on its 1993 exports of cars and light
commercial vehicles to the Community to 980,000, compared with an earlier
limit of 1.089m set in April.
The April accord was based on a forecast that EC demand would fall by 6.5
per cent in 1993; the new deal is based on a fall of 15.9 per cent.
The motor industry association yesterday welcomed both sides' efforts to
adjust their market forecasts, but called on them to implement a transition
period under the 1991 accord to complete European restructuring smoothly.

Deeside, North Wales.
The 3,000 sets of crankshafts and cylinder blocks shipped each month will be
worth a relatively small Pounds 5m a year.
But they are of symbolic as well as practical importance to Toyota at a time
of renewed tension over the level of Japanese imports to Europe's
diminishing new car markets.
The components will be used in 1.8 litre engines built at Toyota's Shimoyama
engine plant and destined for Japan and other big markets. They are seen as
a formal stamp of approval of quality at the UK plant. But the company also
said the substantially lower costs of manufacturing in the UK made it worth
importing the components to Japan.
Although Toyota had always planned to export product to overseas markets
from its engine plant in Wales, the recent sharp appreciation of the yen had
speeded the process, the company said.
Toyota said the exports to Japan were part of its policy to optimise
capacity at its plants around the world. Toyota has been importing engines
and engine components into Japan from its US manufacturing plant in volumes
of about 100,000 per month since 1992.
'Deeside has the capacity. The quality and the price are right, so this
makes good business sense,' said Mr Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of
Toyota UK.
Production began at Deeside a year ago before the start of car production at
Toyota's Pounds 700m facility at Burnaston, Derbyshire, early this year. Car
and engine output is scheduled to rise to 100,000 a year in 1994, and
200,000 a year in the late 1990s. At this output level Toyota expects its UK
operations to be purchasing Pounds 700m worth of components annually from
European suppliers.

ANSALDO, the engineering subsidiary of the Italian state-controlled
Finmeccanica group, has announced it has won four water treatment contracts
in the Middle East totalling L325bn (Dollars 204m).
The awards strengthen Ansaldo's presence in the Middle East, less than a
week after it won a contract heading a consortium to build a L800bn power
station and desalination plant in Abu Dhabi.
The largest of the new contracts is for a L200bn project in Kuwait to
produce 600,000 cubic metres a day of drinking water from existing
desalination plants. Another for L62bn involves the supply of 22 water
treatment plants in Cairo for the Egyptian Ministry of Reconstruction
capable of processing 100,000 cubic metres of water a day.
A third contract, worth L43bn, was awarded by the Saudi Agriculture and
Water Ministry for the construction of a water storage and distribution
system in the capital, Riyadh, for water coming from Gulf desalination
plants. A further water treatment contract worth L20bn, with the Milan group
Emit, was won in Damascus.

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: ABB robots deal with GM Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Robotics, part of Asea Brown Boveri, has won a 'breakthrough' order
worth nearly Dollars 20m to supply more than 200 industrial robots to
General Motors Europe.
The deal is ABB Robotics' first European order from GM, which has previously
bought most of its robots from its former joint venture company, GMFanuc
Robotics.
Last year, however, GM sold its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc to its partner,
Fanuc of Japan, as part of its strategy to concentrate on its core business
of vehicle production.
The robots are part of substantial investments by GM at its plants in
Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK. At least 120 of the robots ABB is
supplying will go to the Vauxhall Motors plant in Luton.
Most of the robots will be delivered next year, and will be mainly used for
spot welding. ABB Robotics said the performance and cost efficiency of its
product line were key factors in winning the order against fierce Japanese
competition.
ABB Robotics' and the renamed Fanuc Robotics are the two biggest suppliers
of robots to European industry. Over the past decade, the automotive
industry has been the largest customer for industrial robots. It remains
important to the robot industry even if growth opportunities are higher in
less robotised industrial sectors such as the food industry.

FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US to impose sanctions on China and Taiwan
over rhino horn trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is set to go ahead with sanctions against China and Taiwan for
illegally trading in rhino horns, irrespective of what the 120-nation UN
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decides,
David Gardner writes.
The Cites standing committee, meeting in Brussels, was expected to reach a
decision last night or today, after considering evidence that the two
countries had failed to stamp out the trade, banned since 1976.
But Mr Bruce Babbitt, US secretary of the interior, has said he will
recommend that President Bill Clinton go ahead anyway with a ban on nearly
all wildlife products moving from and into China and Taiwan, under a 1967 US
law.
EC officials yesterday said sanctions could be counter-productive at a time
when the Chinese and Taiwanese governments were trying to end the rhino horn
trade.
Investigations by environmental organisations have turned up evidence that
in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is still a brisk trade in rhino horns,
a traditional Chinese remedy for reducing fever.
According to the Environmental Investigation Agency, the price of Asian
rhino horn has reached recent peaks of Dollars 60,000 a kilo, spurring
poachers to prey on the sparse five surviving species. Zimbabwe last year
registered 1,500 rhinos, according to Mr Dave Currey of EIA, but this year
confirmed it had only 300.
According to the EIA, worldwide stocks of black rhino are down to 2,300;
white rhino to 5,200; Sumatran rhino to 500-900; Javan rhino to only 80; and
Indian rhino to 1,900.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Reinventing government is not easy: George Graham looks at
Vice-President Al Gore's plans to overhaul US bureaucracy, and the obstacles
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICE-PRESIDENT Al Gore is not the first person to set about overhauling the
US federal bureaucracy, and scepticism about the results of reports such as
his National Performance Review is now deeply ingrained.
Mr Gore says he reviewed 500 previous studies purporting to be comprehensive
reviews of what needs to be changed in the federal government, and that his
review will be different.
The review, which promises Dollars 108bn (Pounds 71.5bn) of savings over
five years and a 12 per cent reduction in the size of the federal workforce,
seeks to defuse the conflicts with Congress that have hampered
implementation of previous recommendations by arguing that it would change
not what government does, but how it does it.
It also claims to be different because it is based on the ideas of
government employees themselves, not on outside nostrums.
The National Performance Review offers a list of specific recommendations
aimed at cutting wasteful spending, streamlining bureaucracy, improving
customer service, overhauling federal procurement rules and rebuilding the
federal personnel code.
Suggestions include:
Consolidate the Agriculture Department's 42 agencies into 30 and close one
in 10 of its 12,000 field offices.
Close all the regional offices of the Housing and Urban Development
Department and pare down its 80 field offices.
Fold the Drug Enforcement Agency into the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Allow government agencies, including the Internal Revenue, to use private
debt collectors and accept payments by credit card.
Eliminate the 10,000-page Federal Personnel Manual by September next year
and replace it with general principles which would allow managers to hire,
fire and reward excellence.
Lift the level below which agencies can make purchases without special
authorisation from Dollars 25,000 to Dollars 100,000.
Budget over two years instead of one.
Reduce the ratio of managers to one for every 15 employees, instead of one
for every seven employees.
But Washington sceptics say that even if the Gore report is different from
President Richard Nixon's Ash Council or President Ronald Reagan's Grace
Commission - and it is certainly better written than those were - it is
likely to suffer the same fate as they did.
Others believe, however, that public opinion, stoked by Mr Ross Perot's
presidential campaign last year, is so eager for an attack on waste in
government that Congress will be forced to take up Mr Gore's challenge.
Many of the recommendations can be implemented at least in part by
presidential order, and President Bill Clinton promised yesterday that he
would do his part.
'There are a lot of places in this report where it says the president
should. . . the president should. . . the president should. . . Well I have
read the report and where it says the president should, the president will,'
he said yesterday at a White House ceremony to unveil the report.
Other elements, however, would require legislation in Congress; some of them
have been recommended many times before, and large political interests have
prevented their implementation.
Even though Mr Gore avoids attacking some of the politically sensitive
subsidy programmes that the Grace Commission included in its
recommendations, a report that would cut 252,000 jobs is sure to run into
opposition, at least from the civil service trade unions.
White House officials were quick yesterday to emphasise that some of these
jobs are not even filled at the moment, and that most of the cuts could be
achieved through attrition.
Many of Mr Gore's other suggestions will rub against Congress's insistance
that it should have close oversight of the operations of the administration;
he urges, for example, that Congress give agencies broader authority to
spend the money allotted to them, instead of putting in line-by-line
restrictions on their spending, and also asks Congress to reduce the number
of reports it demands from agencies.
Although Senator George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic majority in
the Senate, yesterday said he supported the proposed two-year budget cycle,
the idea is a red rag to congressional bulls such as Senator Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, the chairman of the appropriations committee which controls
spending.
Mr Mitchell acknowledged that other reports had come and gone, but said that
'doesn't mean we should stop trying'.
'The reality is this is a very large enterprise, growing larger, and it has
to be constantly reviewed,' he said yesterday.
On the other side of the political aisle, Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican leader, gave a cautious welcome to the Gore report, while
complaining that his party had not been involved in its preparation.
'We'd like to take a look at it and see how much smoke and mirrors there
are, how much real change there is. And if it's a good change, he'll have a
lot of Republican support,' Mr Dole said in a television interview.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Software and hard feelings: Louise Kehoe and Geof
Wheelwright on rivals Microsoft and Novell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, dubbed the 'bully' of the computer software industry by some
competitors, is crying foul. Under investigation for alleged anti-trust
violations in the US and the EC, the company claims it is the victim of a
smear campaign.
Competitors 'are spreading lies about us', Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman
and chief executive, told industry analysts at the company's Redmond,
Washington, headquarters recently.
Within the software industry he is unlikely to find much sympathy. Microsoft
dominates the world market for personal computer software and is renowned
for its aggressive marketing tactics. For years Microsoft has shrugged off
as mere envy mounting complaints from competitors alleging unfair business
practices.
But now, with the US Justice Department and EC competition authorities
digging through its books, Microsoft is becoming increasingly sensitive to
criticism from competitors, particularly Novell, the leading supplier of PC
networking software, which it views as the instigator of its problems with
anti-trust authorities.
'Novell is trying to make government agencies suspicious of the way we do
business, trying to paint a negative picture of Microsoft,' said Mr Bill
Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel.
Novell played an active role in supplying information to the US Federal
Trade Commission during its three-year anti-trust investigation of
Microsoft. It also promoted the transfer of the case to the US Justice
Department when the FTC reached a deadlock over whether to take action; and
it filed complaints against Microsoft with the EC competition authorities.
Now Novell has revealed details of a previously secret 1992 attempt by
Microsoft to buy its tormentor during the FTC's anti-trust probe, which
shows another dimension to the animosity between the two companies.
According to Novell, Mr Gates contacted Mr Ray Noorda, Novell chairman and
chief executive, in July 1991, days after Novell had announced plans to
acquire Digital Research, a small developer of personal computer operating
systems, to discuss a merger. As an independent company, Digital Research
presented no threat to Microsoft's domination of the PC operating system
market, but as part of Novell it might have become a serious challenger to
Microsoft's cash cow, MS-DOS, the most widely used PC operating system
program.
According to Mr David Bradford, Novell's chief counsel, Mr Gates stipulated
that the newly acquired Digital Research could not be part of any deal.
Taking Microsoft's approach at face value, Novell engaged in negotiations.
And in what turned out to be a critical mistake, it put Digital Research on
the back burner for the duration of the talks, suspending its plans to
promote the company's DR-DOS system in competition with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
In late February 1992, Microsoft presented a written offer to Novell to
acquire the company for more than Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.9bn). The following
month, Microsoft met Novell's board to discuss the offer. A day later,
Novell learned from press reports that Microsoft had announced its
acquisition of another software company, Fox Software. Stunned, Novell
called off the talks and aborted the deal, according to Mr Bradford.
Novell alleges that Microsoft was not negotiating in good faith and that its
ulterior motive may have been to remove the threat of competition in the
operating system market.
Microsoft offers a very different and equally plausible interpretation. At
first, according to Microsoft, Mr Gates saw the potential for a 'win-win'
merger of the largest PC software company with the largest supplier of PC
networking software. Customers would have benefited from improved
compatibility between the companies' software products, which are frequently
used together.
Digital Research had nothing to do with Microsoft's interest in merging with
Novell, Mr Neukom insists. In fact it created a potential impediment to the
deal.
With regard to the Fox Software acquisition, Mr Neukom says that Microsoft
'had no intent to hide anything from Novell', but that the two deals were
quite separate. Fox is a developer of data-base management software that is
only tangentially related to Novell's networking products.
Was Microsoft negotiating in good faith? 'Our letter of intent demonstrated
a certain seriousness of purpose,' Mr Neukom said. Whatever the intent, the
effect of the protracted negotiations was to delay Novell's efforts to bring
a competitive PC operating system, based on Digital Research technology, to
market. Only after the talks ended did Novell begin its efforts to compete
more aggressively with Microsoft, so far with little success.
Novell alleges that the delay, combined with Microsoft's monopolistic
licensing of MS-DOS, has cost it dearly, estimating its damages at Dollars
3bn.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Second crisis in Guatemala
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALA has been plunged into its second political crisis in three months
as a divided congress waits for a ruling from the constitutional court to
determine whether a revolt against the congressional leadership is legal.
The crisis was precipitated on Sunday evening when a session of congress,
called to implement a purge of members accused of corruption, descended into
fistfights and bottle throwing, leading Mr Jose Lobo Dubon, the Christian
Democrat president of congress, to declare the session suspended.
However, a group of 65 members of congress defied the suspension to elect a
new congressional president and directorate after alleging that Mr Lobo had
abandoned his post.
Mr Alfonso Cabrera, secretary general of the Christian Democrats, called the
removal of Mr Lobo and the rest of the 12-member congressional directorate
'a kind of coup d'etat within congress'.
On Monday evening Mr Lobo, who still considers himself president of
congress, clashed with opponents as he headed for his office. One of his
bodyguards allegedly struck a congressman with the butt of his pistol.
Now the congress, bitterly divided over the issue of corruption, finds
itself with two presidents and two directorates. It was not clear which
directorate would preside over the congressional session due to be held
later yesterday, but it was expected to be unruly.
The move for a congressional purge followed a call last month by President
Ramiro de Leon Carpio for the voluntary resignation of all 116 congressmen.
Mr de Leon, formerly a combative human rights ombudsman, was elected by
congress on June 6 after a constitutional crisis triggered by a failed
attempt by former President Jorge Serrano to seize authoritarian powers. Mr
de Leon's election raised hopes that he would promote a clean-up of state
institutions, which are generally perceived to be endemically corrupt.
However, Congress divided into two camps. On one side 75 congressmen are
allied to the Instancia Nacional de Consenso, a coalition of political
parties, private business, and popular organisations which forced a return
to democratic government in June.
The Instancia has produced a list of 16 congressmen whom it considers to be
most in need of purging. The list contains five Christian Democrats,
including Mr Lobo, but does not include any members from the five parties in
the Instancia.

<TEXT>
MR DOMINGO CAVALLO, Argentina's economy minister and architect of one of the
world's most surprising economic miracles, arrives in London this morning
for a three-day visit.
Mr Cavallo, the first Argentine cabinet minister to make an official visit
to Britain since the 1982 Falklands conflict, will meet Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
The visit confirms the rapidly improving ties between the UK and Argentina
since President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western
foreign policies and free market economics. Mr Cavallo became economy
minister in 1991 and rapidly transformed Argentina into one of the world's
fastest-growing economies. However, the unresolved dispute over the
Falklands - which Argentina still claims - means that no date is likely to
be set soon for a visit by Mr Menem.
As well as meeting UK government officials, Mr Cavallo will give a lecture
at the London School of Economics and a speech at the Confederation of
British Industry. He will also chair a seminar with potential investors at
Baring Brothers, the merchant bank with a long, if turbulent, history of
business with Argentina.
Britain has shown growing interest in Latin America as economic reforms
across the continent create new trade and investment opportunities. British
banks and companies, notably British Gas, have been active in Argentina's
privatisation programme.
Mr Cavallo's arrival in London follows a flurry of visits by senior British
ministers. Earlier this year Mr Hurd and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, visited Buenos Aires. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, arrives in Argentina on Saturday for a brief official visit and Mr
Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, will visit London in November.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Brazil plans to curb inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAO PAULO, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is next week expected to introduce further measures aimed at curbing
inflation, now running at an annualised rate of more than 2,000 per cent.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, is due to give a
television address next Tuesday, just over three months after he took over
the job, in which he is expected to give a comparatively upbeat assessment
of Brazil's growth prospects for this year.
He may also confirm some structural changes such as the separation of
accounts between the treasury and central bank, designed to make financial
movements between the two institutions more transparent.
Mr Cardoso has repeatedly claimed he will not launch any economic 'shock'
plans before fiscal reforms are in place to deal with the country's
structural economic problems.
However, some economists believe Mr Cardoso and his economic team are
working on such a package.
Suspicions have been raised by the recent appointment of Mr Andre Lara
Resende as principal foreign debt negotiator and Mr Persio Arida as
president of Brazil's development bank. Both men were involved in the now
discredited 1986 Cruzado plan, which involved a price freeze and the
introduction of a new currency.
The presence of President Carlos Menem of Argentina and Mr Domingo Cavallo,
his economy minister, at Brazil's annual independence celebrations yesterday
has further fuelled the speculation.
Ahead of meeting Mr Cavallo, Mr Cardoso said Brazil would not follow
Argentina and peg the currency to the dollar to curb inflation.
The Brazilian and Argentinian leaders were expected to discuss progress
towards eliminating trade barriers within Mercosul, the regional grouping
which links the two countries with Uruguay and Paraguay.
They will also discuss trade frictions caused by a rapid increase in
Brazilian exports to Argentina. Argentina has accused Brazil of favouring
its companies with covert subsidies and criticised it for failing to
stabilise its economy. Mr Cavallo denies that the Argentinian peso is
seriously overvalued.
Argentina has resorted to an array of mechanisms to slow the onslaught of
Brazilian imports and Brazil has now threatened to retaliate. However,
tension comes against a background of rapidly rising trade between the two.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Rabin firm as protesters try to storm his office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI POLICE in riot gear last night prevented up to 50,000 right-wing
demonstrators, some armed with revolvers, from storming the office of
Israel's prime minister in protest against the proposed Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, dismissed opponents of a deal as
'prattlers and liars' and Israeli and Palestinian officials continued to
insist an historic deal could be signed next Monday.
Protests 'won't budge me at all,' Mr Rabin said hours before 2,500 police
armed with tear gas set up a double cordon around his office in Jerusalem.
Last night the security forces repelled several onslaughts by protesters,
who included Jewish settlers from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
There were no injuries but there were fears the protests could turn more
violent later.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton formally offered to host a signing
ceremony for the agreement in the White House on September 13, if details of
the accord have then been completed.
The sticking point remained final agreement between Israel and the PLO on
the precise terms governing statements of mutual recognition, after which
both sides would be ready to sign the declaration of principles governing
interim Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, in Cairo refused to be drawn on when
this last hurdle might be overcome but a PLO official in Tunis said it could
be 'within 24 hours.'
Israel is seeking commitments from the PLO over its covenant. Palestinian
officials say they are prepared to supply such commitments, but say any
change in the organisation's charter would require the endorsement of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile - something Mr
Arafat and his colleagues wish to finesse to avoid both delay and potential
internal opposition to the accord.
Mr Arafat left Cairo for Oman yesterday. He is due to return to PLO
headquarters in Tunis today for a meeting of the organisation's executive
committee, or cabinet, to discuss the accord.
In spite of yesterday's demonstration - which gathered under the banner
'Israel is in danger, don't give in' - political momentum in Israel
continued to gather behind the deal.
Mr Zalman Shoval, a leading member of the opposition right-wing Likud party,
conceded in an interview that his party had little option but to accept the
agreement and look forward to a general election in 1996. He said: 'It is a
done deal. It is irreversible.'
In Cairo Egypt's foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, seemed in buoyant mood as
he spoke of progress towards a deal in which his country has played a
considerable behind-the-scenes role.
Mr Moussa told the Financial Times that while there were still differences
between the two sides over mutual recognition, he was 'cautiously
optimistic' that the gap could be bridged by the weekend.
'We see good intentions on both sides,' he said. But 'formalities are
formalities, and technicalities are technicalities, so discussions
continue.'
While Mr Moussa did not wish to claim credit for having facilitated
negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Israelis,
there is no doubt that Egypt is assuming crucial importance in helping to
deliver an historic agreement between once bitter foes.
Mr Arafat has visited Egypt three times since details emerged late last
month of a ground-breaking agreement with Israel, using the Egyptian capital
as a staging point for his forays into the wider Arab world.
In Cairo yesterday, he held yet another round of talks with Egyptian
officials, including President Hosni Mubarak, before heading off to Oman in
the Gulf to drum up support.
Mr Arafat had been unwelcome in almost all the Gulf states since his embrace
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91.
Mr Arafat's stance alienated his most important paymasters, the Saudis and
Kuwaitis.
Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel - the two
countries signed their peace agreement in 1979 - is providing the benefit of
its experience in negotiating detailed agreements with the Jewish state.
Interestingly, several officials providing counsel to Mr Arafat were
intimately involved in the Camp David process following late President
Sadat's groundbreaking 1977 visit to Jerusalem.
Among these officials are Mr Moussa himself who was head of the
international department of the Egyptian foreign ministry at the time of
Camp David, and Dr Osama al-Baz, who was a key aide to Mr Sadat and is now
Mr Mubarak's political adviser.
The two men were among a small number of Egyptian officials who were aware
of developments from an early stage of the secret Palestinian-Israel
negotiations in Norway.
Mr Moussa was careful in describing Egypt's role, saying merely: 'The
Palestinians I would say trust our judgment. Our opinion is given honestly
with no ulterior motives. We provide advice when needed.'
While the minister was careful about claiming credit for positive
developments, he was less coy about his own country's interest in a
successful outcome. As the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel,
Egypt is anxious that other Arab countries should join it in making peace
with Israel.
It also believes that peace between Israel and its neighbours is the best
antidote to the worrying spread of Islamic extremism throughout the Arab
world. Egypt itself has been a particular target.
Describing Camp David as the first stage in a long process aimed at calming
the region, the Madrid conference of 1991 as the second, and the proposed
mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO as the third, Mr Moussa said:
'The major instability in this region emanates from this particular problem.
If it is settled it will contribute to the amelioration of the general
climate, and it will militate in favour of a more stable Middle East.'
In Washington yesterday Israel and Syria said they made no progress at
Middle East talks in a crucial meeting to discuss the principle of an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for peace.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Pretoria veto overhangs power sharing: Patti Waldmeir looks
at the implications of yesterday's milestone agreement in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 350 years as a powerless majority, South African blacks have finally
gained their first taste of power in national government with last night's
agreement to establish a multi-racial transitional executive council.
Agreement on the council will lead to the early lifting of international
economic sanctions against South Africa and will send an important signal to
South African blacks and the international community that South Africa's
transition to multi-racial rule is irreversible.
After months of increasingly arcane debate over South Africa's
constitutional future, the council represents the first step toward
multi-racial interim government. But true to form, negotiators have decided
to delay concrete action until later: tortuous negotiations on a new
democratic constitution must be completed before any of the 21 councillors
can take their seats.
The powers of the council, which will include one representative from all
parties to the current constitutional negotiations, including the South
African government and the African National Congress, will be largely
symbolic. Its remit is to 'level the political playing field' and create the
conditions for free elections on April 27 next year; it is far from clear
what that will mean in practice.
Furthermore, government will have what amounts to a veto over the council's
most important power as its decisions must be passed by majorities ranging
from two-thirds to 80 per cent majority. Government officials believe that
Pretoria and its allies will be able to muster the votes necessary to block
TEC decisions, though they argue that the ruling National party would pay a
high political price if it is seen to play a spoiling role.
ANC officials also play down the risk of a government veto, arguing Pretoria
wants to use the TEC to cement the de facto coalition between the two
parties which will govern South Africa after the elections - and that
government will avoid acrimony which could tear that coalition apart. Still,
when it comes to issues of fundamental importance to Pretoria, it is hard to
see government refraining from using that veto.
The council is likely to be further undermined by the fact that the third
big political player, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom
party, is refusing to participate and has said that the government of the
KwaZulu black homeland, which he heads, will not respect its authority.
Other homeland governments and the right-wing Conservative party have also
rejected the TEC, raising the prospect of further bloodshed when it tries to
impose its authority in homeland areas.
Homeland opposition to the council could be reversed, however, if the new
constitution satisfies homeland leaders by providing significant devolution
of power to regional governments. Leaders, including Chief Buthelezi, are
looking for a package deal: if they like the constitution, they will
tolerate the TEC. Their participation is crucial if the council is to have
broad legitimacy.
The council would remain in office until the elections, when it would be
replaced by an elected government of national unity based on multi-racial
power-sharing. However if elections are delayed, it could remain in power
indefinitely, and have its powers extended to become a fully-fledged interim
government.
According to a bill agreed yesterday by negotiators (parliament must still
pass the bill, but the ruling National party's large majority should make
this a formality) the TEC's object is to 'create a climate for free
political participation', foster conditions for free and fair elections,
eliminate impediments to legitimate political activity, prevent
intimidation, ensure parties are free to canvass and campaign and prevent
government from exercising its powers to its own political advantage, or to
prejudice others. Its decisions will be legally enforceable.
In addition, the TEC will play a watchdog role in a wide range of other
areas, including government finance, compelling government to disclose
information and to consult it on certain matters. The full extent of its
powers will depend on how broadly the TEC interprets its mission to create a
climate for free and fair political activity.
The TEC will have seven sub-councils, covering law and order, defence,
intelligence, finance, regional and local government, foreign affairs, and
the status of women. The sub-councils on law and order, defence and
intelligence are likely to prove the most important, providing for limited
joint control of the security forces in the volatile period ahead of next
year's elections. It will be difficult to declare a state of emergency or
period of martial law without its support, though the Police Board and the
Special Electoral Court, respectively, can overrule it in these matters.
South Africa's prospects for holding free and fair elections depend
crucially on the success of the security forces in controlling political
violence, which has recently reached a new pitch of intensity.
Controversially, the TEC will also establish its own security force, the
National Peacekeeping Force, charged with 'maintaining peace and public
order", and to be commanded by a council controlled by the TEC itself. The
force will be comprised of members of all military forces, including the
South African Defence Force, the police, Umkhonto we Sizwe (the ANC military
wing), other liberation armies and homeland forces.
The TEC itself will comprise one member from each political party or
government participating in constitutional negotiations.
The sub-council on finance will have power to investigate and monitor
government finance, to be consulted in the preparation of the 1994-95
budget, and to be informed about negotiations involving international
financial agreements (such as the current debt rescheduling). But its
approval will not be required except in areas where government finance would
affect the elections, and over the creation of new government posts and
retirements.

TAIWAN'S chief negotiator with China said yesterday he would resign after
bitter disputes within the Taiwan government over policy towards Beijing,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
'If I cannot make use of my ability under this environment, it will be a
waste of my time and have a negative impact on improving relations between
the two sides,' said Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation. Local media quoted Mr Chiu as saying he would quit at a
November meeting of the foundation board, which handles talks with China in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
Mr Chiu handled intensive talks between China and Taiwan in Singapore in
April. Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to slow a flood
of investment into China, yesterday formally banned companies from using
issues of stock and convertible bonds to fund mainland projects.
China's economy is likely to grow at 13 per cent again this year despite
measures to prevent overheating, Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier and central
bank governor, told a meeting of business executives in Bali by
video-telephone link, Reuter reports from Nusa Dua, Indonesia.
Mr Zhu said growth in 1993 GDP was likely to average 13 per cent, compared
with close to 14 per cent for the first six months of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LOW turn-out of mourners attended the homecoming yesterday of the body of
Mr Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine strongman who seven years ago
fled to Hawaii after being ousted in a popular revolt against his regime.
The body was in a sealed metal casket that has remained unopened. It will be
seen only as it is laid to rest this weekend in a glass case at the newly
constructed mausoleum at the Marcos residence in Laoag City.
About 3,000 people were at the airport in Laoag City, the capital of Mr
Marcos's home province of Ilocor Norte in the northern Philippines, when the
chartered jet carrying his body landed. About 5,000 attended an hour-long
mass at St William's Cathedral where the casket was brought from the
airport.  It was later placed in front of the provincial capital building.
There were no state honours. A group of 21 retired generals acted as
pall-bearers. They executed a simultaneous salute in lieu of the official
21-gun salute. Mr Marcos's widow Imelda and his two daughters, Imee and
Irene, led the welcoming party at the airport. His son Ferdinand Jr had
fetched the body from Hawaii.
It was the first time since their 1986 escape from Manila that the Marcos
family was together. After their flight, the Marcos children went their
separate ways in other countries while the parents stayed in Hawaii. Even
when Mr Marcos was dying some of the Marcos children avoided travelling to
Hawaii for fear of being arrested in connection with criminal suits filed
against the family in US courts.
Mr Marcos died in September 1989 of cardiac arrest following complications
from kidney, lung and heart ailments. Mrs Marcos returned to the Philippines
in November 1991 and was among the seven candidates in the May 1992
presidential election that was won by Mr Fidel Ramos, former army chief and
defence secretary. Mrs Marcos finished fifth.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Japan admits economy at 'standstill'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S official economic forecaster has downgraded its assessment of the
state of the economy, prompting calls from within the coalition government
for a cut in the official discount rate.
The Economic Planning Agency, which has held a stubbornly sanguine view of
the prospects for recovery this year as most other public and private sector
forecasters have sharply downgraded their expectations, yesterday admitted
that the economy was at a 'standstill' and 'stagnating'.
This indicates serious official concern that the downturn may have to hit
bottom twice before a recovery, though Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, yesterday chided the agency for being too optimistic. The agency
maintained in June that the downturn had hit bottom and two months later
said the economy was at 'somewhat of a standstill'.
Economic problems have quickly overtaken plans to reform Japan's creaking
political system, to occupy 80 per cent of Mr Hosokawa's time, says a
government official.
According to Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, there is no consensus
among cabinet members on when recovery might come. The EPA is nevertheless
sticking to its forecast of 3.3 per cent growth in gross national product
this year. That compares with 1.5 per cent in 1992 and is far more
optimistic than the market consensus of growth between 0.3 per cent and 1.5
per cent for this year.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said there were no clear
signs of recovery. But he refused to be drawn on a widely expected imminent
cut in the official discount rate, already at a post-war low of 2.5 per
cent, beyond saying that the bank was carefully watching the effect of the
yen's rise on business confidence.
The markets believe a rate cut is possible after Friday's release of the
central bank's latest survey of business confidence.
If not, the bank could wait for the basic outline of the government's
forthcoming economic stimulation package, expected around September 20.
Exact details of the package will be the result of tough negotiations among
the seven coalition members, though the government has already announced
that plans to cut official red tape and costly business regulations will
form the centrepiece.
Deregulation has broad coalition support in principle, though the left-wing
Social Democrats, the largest coalition party, is anxious not to upset small
retailers, an important socialist constituency.
Social Democrats are more seriously out of line with the rest of the
coalition on possible income tax cuts, as favoured by Mr Hosokawa. Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, the former LDP powerbroker who exerts a strong behind-the-scenes
influence on the coalition, argues that any income tax cuts must be
compensated by rises in consumption taxes.
The Social Democrats oppose a rise in consumption taxes and are said to be
among the toughest bargainers in a coalition which would lose its
parliamentary majority without them.

FT  08 SEP 93 / SDP poll could ruffle coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Social Democratic party faces a disruptive election for a new
chairman that could destabilise the seven party-coalition government, in
which it is the largest group.
The apparent decision of Mr Sadao Yamahana not to stand for re-election
later this month comes after he has forced the party to adopt a new policy
on South Korea by visiting that country recently.
Until now the SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, has maintained close
ties to totalitarian North Korea. Mr Yamahana was the first SDP leader to
visit Seoul, angering left-wing members of his party.
Mr Yamahana is a member of a moderate faction which has attempted to push
the SDP to reform its policies over the past few years, and he has taken
advantage of his time in the month-old government to make changes in spirit
if not wording to past policies.
If Mr Yamahana is not a candidate, he will back another moderate
representative in a party poll, scheduled for September 18, in the hope of
continuing reforms intended to broaden the party's popularity.
Serving in the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has prompted the
SDP to blunt its past opposition to the use of nuclear energy and even to
suggest that it accepted a foreign policy little changed from that of the
conservative Liberal Democratic party, which ruled for 38 years. However,
the party's growing pragmatism raises the possibility that members loyal to
traditional hard-line policies will split to form a new party - a move which
could bring down the coalition government.
Mr Hosokawa said the dispute within the SDP was an internal matter that did
not directly concern the government, though 'we have to wait and see what
happens'. Other government officials said they were confident that the SDP
would remain a coalition member, regardless of the leadership contest's
outcome.
But the likely departure of Mr Yamahana, who has said he will resign in
order to take responsibility for the party's poor showing in July's general
election, raises doubts over whether he will continue to serve as the
cabinet minister responsible for political reform.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Revenge of Kenya's Arab 'squatters': Leslie Crawford on
trouble in an African paradise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE dhow sailed towards Lamu, an ancient Arab settlement off the Kenyan
coast, the damage of recent riots came into focus: buildings on the
waterfront blackened by fire and exposed to the elements without their
traditional thatched roofs; donkeys scavenging in the rubble; groups of
young men as taut as flintlocks, still defiant after the troubles.
For more than a year, Lamu's 15,000 inhabitants have endured bandit attacks
on the road to Malindi, their main link to the outside world and the
island's economic lifeline. Eight people have been killed, causing bus
companies to suspend services along the route.
One Friday in August, after midday prayers, several hundred Moslems marched
to the town square with the intention of petitioning the district
commissioner for greater police protection on the Malindi road. He refused
to meet them, and ordered police to disperse them.
Nobody will say who started the fire. But the customs building and court
offices were torched, and the strong south-east trade winds swept the flames
over the thatched makote roofs of the Standard Chartered Bank, seafront
restaurants, shops and Petley's Inn, the oldest hotel on the island.
Kanu Hall, headquarters of Kenya's ruling party, was also set ablaze. It was
the greatest destruction Lamu had seen since a war against the rival
city-state of Mombasa in 1810.
Hundreds of tourists were ferried to the relative safety of the mainland.
They have not returned.
'The district commissioner treated us like animals,' says Mr Karim Rajan, a
local guest-house owner. The DC is hated for his heavy-handedness, but even
more so because he is a non-Moslem and a 'foreigner', a political appointee
who comes from Kenya's hinterland. He has taken to sleeping on a navy patrol
boat.
The riots were not only about banditry. All along the coast, Kenya's Swahili
people, Moslems of Arab-African descent, have been nursing a growing litany
of grievances against the government in Nairobi.
'We are treated like third-class citizens just because we have Arab blood,'
says Mr Mohammed Abubakar, the deputy manager at Standard Chartered in Lamu.
Moslems, he says, are barred from holding top government jobs or senior
academic posts. While local government is run by 'up-country' officials, the
coastal provinces have been neglected. Not a single state school has been
built on the coast since independence 30 years ago. And the coastal people
have watched with increasing alarm as their land is parcelled out to
powerful politicians, hotel developers, or resettlement schemes for mainland
tribes.
'We are regarded as squatters, even though we have been here for 1,000
years,' says Mr Abdul Nassir, a soft-spoken carpenter who has emerged as the
leader of Lamu's Moslems. 'All our attempts to get title deeds for our farms
have been rebuffed.'
As resentment grows, the coastal strip from Lamu to Mombasa is becoming
fertile ground for radical Moslem groups. 'The up-country people used to
call us sleeping dogs; now they call us terrorists, fundamentalists,' says
Sheikh Khalid Salim Balala, one of the founding members of the 18-month-old
Islamic Party of Kenya.
Sheikh Balala has endured six spells in prison for his inflammatory speeches
and calls for political strikes in Mombasa. He is a bit of an embarrassment
to Kenya's mainstream Moslem leaders, and while many distrust his motives,
he is winning a growing number of followers with his demands for Moslem
political power.
'We are 8m Moslems in Kenya - one third of the population - but we are a
dead community,' Sheikh Balala says. 'Our leaders have been docile and
incompetent; they have done nothing for us. We deserve a greater presence in
government, in academia, in all walks of life.'
He does not shy away from being called a fundamentalist, but denies his
party is being financed by hardline Islamic groups abroad.
The government in Nairobi thinks otherwise. It has refused to register the
party as a legal organisation, calling it a threat to the established
political order.
Kenya's lawless frontier with Somalia has also become a breeding ground for
radical Moslem groups since the arrival of aid agencies from the Gulf.
Diplomats and government officials say many of these relief organisations
are merely fronts to promote sharia law among the thousands of destitute
refugees in the border camps. The fundamentalist government in Sudan,
recently placed on Washington's list of terrorist states, is also believed
to be involved.
So far, these groups have preached peaceful activism, but the threat of
violence is never far from the surface. 'The government is doing its utmost
to prevent Moslems uniting along the coast,' says Mr Nassir. 'But if there
are no changes, and the government continues to respond to our demands with
weapons, they will be responsible for the consequences.'

'I WANT to assure you that this is a baby for sure, but when it will be born
depends on a lot of things, but born, it will be,' Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's
foreign minister, said yesterday as he spoke of progress towards a
Palestinian-Israeli peace in which his country has played a considerable
behind-the-scenes role.
While Mr Moussa did not wish to claim credit for having facilitated
negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Israelis,
there is no doubt that Egypt is assuming crucial importance in helping to
deliver an historic agreement between once bitter foes.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the Cairo-born Palestine Liberation Organisation leader,
has visited Egypt three times since details emerged late last month of a
ground-breaking agreement with Israel, using the Egyptian capital as a
staging point for his forays into the wider Arab world.
In Cairo yesterday, he held yet another round of talks with Egyptian
officials, including President Hosni Mubarak, before heading off to Oman in
the Gulf to drum up support.
Mr Arafat had been unwelcome in almost all the Gulf states since his embrace
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91.
Mr Arafat's stance alienated his most important paymasters, the Saudis and
Kuwaitis.
Mr Moussa, who had participated in private talks yesterday with Mr Arafat,
said in an interview he was 'cautiously optimistic' that the agreement on
mutual recognition could be concluded by the weekend ready for signature in
Washington next week.
The Americans have nominated next Monday for the signing.
'We see good intentions on both sides,' he said. But 'formalities are
formalities, and technicalities are technicalities, so discussions
continue.'
The Israelis are pressing the Palestinians to give specific undertakings to
revise the PLO charter which, among other things, calls for the elimination
of the State of Israel. Palestinian officials say they will give these
undertakings, but formal revision of the PLO covenant would require approval
of the Palestine National Council, or parliament-in-exile, the PLO's supreme
policymaking body.
Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel - the two
countries signed their peace agreement in 1979 - is providing the benefit of
its experience in negotiating detailed agreements with the Jewish state.
Interestingly, several officials providing counsel to Mr Arafat were
intimately involved in the Camp David process following late President Anwar
Sadat's groundbreaking visit to Jerusalem in 1977.
Among these officials are Mr Moussa himself who was head of the
international department of the Egyptian foreign ministry at the time of
Camp David, and Dr Osama al-Baz, who was a key aide to Mr Sadat and is now
Mr Mubarak's political adviser.
The two men were among a small number of Egyptian officials who were aware
of developments from an early stage of the secret Palestinian-Israel
negotiations in Norway.
Mr Moussa is careful in describing Egypt's role to date, saying merely: 'The
Palestinians I would say trust our judgment. Our opinion is given honestly
with no ulterior motives. We provide advice when needed.'
While the minister is careful about claiming credit for positive
developments, he is less coy about his own country's interest in a
successful outcome. Egypt is anxious that other Arab countries should join
it in making peace with Israel. It also believes that peace between Israel
and its neighbours is the best antidote to the worrying spread of Islamic
extremism throughout the Arab world. Egypt itself has been a particular

Describing Camp David as the first stage in a long process aimed at calming
the region, the Madrid conference of 1991 as the second, and the proposed
mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO as the third, Mr Moussa says:
'The major instability in this region emanates from this particular problem.
If it is settled it will contribute to the amelioration of the general
climate, and it will militate in favour of a more stable Middle East.'

TAIWAN'S chief negotiator with China said yesterday he would resign after
bitter disputes within the Taiwan government over policy towards Beijing,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
'If I cannot make use of my ability under this environment, it will be a
waste of my time and have a negative impact on improving relations between
the two sides,' said Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation.
Local media quoted Mr Chiu as saying that he would quit at a foundation
board meeting in November. The foundation handles talks with China in the
absence of formal diplomatic contact.
Mr Chiu, who became secretary general in March, handled intensive
negotiations at a meeting between China and Taiwan in Singapore in April,
the highest-level contact between the two old rivals since the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949.
He was known for a liberal attitude towards China, pledging to 'tear down
the psychological Berlin Wall' and suggesting Taiwan consider lifting its
ban on official contact.
Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to slow a flood of
investment into China, yesterday formally banned companies from using issues
of stock and convertible bonds to fund mainland projects.

FT  08 SEP 93 / HIV infects 1m women this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIV virus will infect more than 1m women throughout the world during
1993. By the year 2000, 13m women will have been infected and 4m of them
will have died of Aids, according to estimates yesterday by Dr Michael
Merson, head of the World Health Organisation's global programme on Aids.
'A decade ago women and children seemed to be on the periphery of the Aids
epidemic,' Dr Merson said at an international conference in Edinburgh on HIV
in children and mothers. 'Today they are at the centre of our concern.'
As more women become HIV-positive, the number of infections in their babies
rises. WHO says on average a third of infants born to infected mothers are
infected. To date 1m babies have been infected, of whom half developed Aids.
In industrialised countries, HIV transmission is still often through
homosexual contact or drug abuse, but in developing countries heterosexual
transmission has been predominant since the start of the Aids epidemic 10
years ago. Dr Merson said women becoming infected with HIV now outnumbered
men by six to five in sub-Saharan Africa.
He suggested several courses of action to protect women, including 'top
priority' research to develop a safe 'vaginal virucide' - a virus-killing
chemical that would prevent infection during sex.

INDIAN bourses yesterday fell sharply for a second day, in reaction to a
freeze imposed by internal revenue authorities on shareholdings valued at
more than Rs. l5bn (Pounds 31m).
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the country's largest, the index of 30 leading
shares fell sharply by 87.67 points to 2,533,53 making a two-day decline of
130.53 points or 4.9 per cent. Investors stayed clear of making purchases to
avoid being saddled with losses in a falling market.
The income tax authorities at the weekend conducted searches inquiring into
234 people in Bombay, 132 in Calcutta and an unspecified number in other
centres on a tip-off they were trading on behalf of Mr Harshad Mehta, one of
the central figures in the Rs50bn Bombay securities scandal.
Traders fear the stock markets will come to a standstill - recalling the
events in May last year, when the custodian appointed by the government
declared all the shares handled by Mr Mehta as 'tainted'.
The BSE has banned short sales and all sales will have to be against cash. A
15 per cent cash payment has been made obligatory on fresh purchases. The
internal revenue authorities are expected to complete investigations by the
weekend.

<TEXT>
INDIA and China moved yesterday to end a 30-year border dispute, vowing to
cut troops numbers on their frontier and to maintain peace in the region,
Reuter reports from Beijing.
A joint statement hailed the pact as a landmark in relations. But
differences remain over how many soldiers each should withdraw from the
border area where they fought a war in 1962, Indian officials said.
The agreement, signed after two days of talks between Mr PV Narasimha Rao,
the visiting Indian prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, Chinese premier,
prepares the ground for a final settlement of the border issue, the
officials said.
'The two countries have agreed to undertake a series of confidence-building
measures, including the reduction of military forces deployed along the
India-China border,' a joint statement issued by the Indian embassy said.
'Pending a boundary settlement, India and China have agreed to respect and
observe the line of actual control (LAC).' The line has separated the troops
of the two nations since the brief 1962 war.
'This landmark agreement lays down the framework for maintaining peace and
tranquility along the LAC,' the joint statement said.
Indian opposition leaders have given a rare unanimous mandate to Mr Rao to
resolve the dispute along the 4,000km (2,485 mile) border.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S economy is likely to grow at 13 per cent again this year despite
measures to prevent overheating, according to Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier
and central bank governor, Reuter reports from Nusa Dua, Indonesia.
Mr Zhu told a meeting of business executives in Bali by video-telephone link
that the government believed it had been able to withstand and control
changes in the macro-economy.
He said growth in 1993 gross national product was likely to average 13 per
cent, compared with close to 14 per cent for the first six months of the
year and 13 per cent in all of 1992.
According to some newspapers in Beijing, this year's growth target was 10
per cent.
Mr Zhu said macro-economic controls and regulatory measures introduced in
June to provide an environment for sustained high growth appeared to be
working.
The programme was designed to slow down a runaway economy that posted 25.1
per cent growth in industry and 61 per cent growth in fixed asset investment
in the first half of the year.
'Early signs are that these measures are yielding positive results. We
expect to see more good signs in the coming months,' Mr Zhu said.
'In the first half of this year there was an excessive increase in the scale
of investment. This is so because we are in a transition and some of the
defects of the old system have not been eliminated, while some aspects of
the new order are not yet fully implemented.'

FT  08 SEP 93 / Poles' fear of future obscures past: Christopher Bobinski
and Anthony Robinson on support for parties with communist roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH voters seem poised to legitimise the discredited Communist party's
re-named 'social democratic' successors, only four years after the
Solidarity movement inflicted a humiliating electoral defeat on the ruling
Communist party.
If the opinion polls are to be believed, a clutch of left-wing parties with
their roots in the communist past are expected to be the main gainers in
Poland's third post-communist era elections on September 19.
The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, a former
communist who played a key role in negotiations with Solidarity four years
ago, is within sight of overtaking Solidarity's main successor party, the
Democratic Union (UD) as the largest single party.
The SLD's rural equivalent, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), is achieving
similar success in garnering votes from a disgruntled rural population which
still makes up 40 per cent of the Polish electorate.
The strength of the left contrasts with confusion and division among the
anti-communist right and the former Solidarity parties.
The implications for Poland's international standing and economic health
provoked Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the non-party economist widely regarded as
the author of Poland's painful but successful shock therapy reform
programme, to warn this week that Poles should beware 'the parties of
printing easy money' and vote for those who made Poland's private enterprise
revolution possible.
These include the free market Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) led by Jan
Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, which is most threatened by the
leftward shift indicated by the polls.
The renewed attractiveness of the left reflects fears that, despite rising
industrial production and predictions that Poland will achieve the highest
rate of economic growth in Europe this year, unemployment will continue to
rise beyond an already high 15 per cent.
The leftward tilt also comes as memories of past privations under the
communists fade and are replaced by anxiety that the future will bring the
dismantling of the welfare net and limited access to free schooling and
health facilities.
This is all in contrast to the last general elections in 1991 when it was
the fractious right-wing parties, with their populist, reflationary economic
slogans, which won enough of the protest vote to be able to form a
short-lived government led by Mr Jan Olszewski. Now these groups, which are
suspicious of foreign investment and want to purge former communists from
public life, are also struggling - along with their liberal and free market
KLD rivals - to cross the new 5 per cent barrier introduced to limit the
proliferation of small parties which characterised the last parliament.
The strength of the PSL in the countryside underlines one of the ironies of
post-communist Poland. The deeply Roman Catholic and conservative small
farmers who made life so difficult for the communists now look back with
nostalgia to the old days of meat shortages in the shops and guaranteed
prices for farmers: they have suffered a steep fall in income because of
competition from subsidised EC imports.
All this leaves the Democratic Union (UD) as the only mainstream party with
its origins in Solidarity in a position to challenge the regressive trend.
This is partly to do with the personal popularity of Ms Hanna Suchocka, who
emerged from relative political obscurity in July 1992 to become prime
minister. The UD hopes that her popularity will help the party capture about
20 per cent of the votes, the most any party can hope for in Poland's still
fragmented political scene.
The strength of personal support for Ms Suchocka has turned the election
campaign into something of a 'beauty contest' between the outgoing prime
minister and President Lech Walesa, the once charismatic leader of
Solidarity.
Mr Walesa's new bid to secure a strong personal power base by promoting his
so-called 'Non-Party Movement for Reform' (BBWR) does not appear to have
made many converts. The movement, which was formed in July, won an initial
10 per cent support in the polls but appears to have lost momentum.
Much is at stake for the president. If his movement fails to overcome the 5
per cent hurdle (or 8 per cent for coalitions) it would place a question
mark over his chances of re-election in the 1995 presidential race. But,
mindful of the criticism which followed his promise during the presidential
campaign two years ago that privatisation would leave every Pole Dollars
10,000 better off, Mr Walesa is no longer promising miracles.
This unwillingness to make rash promises is indeed a general characteristic
of this campaign, partly at least because many of the politicians taking
part have had the sobering experience of taking part in government over the
past four years. This has given them direct knowledge of the constraints
imposed by powerful external bodies such as the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, and awareness of the dangers inflation would bring if
monetary policies are eased too much.
What is significant is that the broad unspoken consensus in favour of
continuing with market reforms means that the main outlines of the economic
policies of the past four years are not directly challenged by any party.
Even the post communist SLD talks of the need to keep the budget deficit to
around the 5 per cent of gross domestic product required by the IMF,
although the rural PSL and the anti-communist Confederation for an
Independent Poland (PKN), with their suspicion of the EC and foreign
investment, talk of raising the limit to 7 per cent.
Neither of these parties is known for its economic sophistication and it is
questionable whether they or their supporters are aware of the consequences
of such an apparently small deterioration in Poland's hard-won fiscal
rectitude.
No single party will emerge as the clear winner but as the political debate
heats up, the Solidarity-based parties will strive to remind Poles of the
miseries of their recent communist past.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Ex-Soviet republics bow to Moscow over rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE former Soviet republics yesterday pledged to give up their fiscal and
monetary policies as the price for using the Russian rouble as their
currency.
The agreement - signed by Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan,
Armenia and Belarus, which decided to join despite already having its own
currency - marks a retreat, in the face of harsh economic reality, from the
republics' declarations of national sovereignty. The accord has still to be
endorsed by national parliaments.
The republics, pushed to make a decision after Russia invalidated pre-1993
rouble notes in circulation on their territory, are fearful of introducing
their own fully-fledged currencies or at least wish to continue receiving
gifts of cash until they are ready to go it alone.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, said the deal allowed the
retention of a common trading area for producers who could not compete on
western markets. He added a transitional period would show which republics
were genuinely keen to build an economic union and which were simply there
for short-term benefits.
The accord sets a transitional period of several months during which it will
be up to the five republics to adjust their economic legislation to Russia's
and conclude bilateral agreements with Moscow, abiding by its monetary and
fiscal targets. In the meantime republics will use their own surrogate
currencies or receive new rouble banknotes with special markings preventing
them being used inside Russia.
Although the rouble zone agreement is designed to prevent republics from
exporting inflation to Russia, political considerations are likely to impede
Moscow's ability to enforce its rules. Uzbekistan, for instance, has already
received a gift of Rbs50bn of new Russian rouble banknotes in a decision
which Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, yesterday described as illegal. Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime
minister and finance minister, said yesterday Russia was not relying on any
new foreign finance before the end of the year. His announcement follows
indications that the IMF will not be disbursing new credits Russia had hoped
to receive this autumn.

FT  08 SEP 93 / German GDP figure lifts recovery hopes: Rexrodt gives
cautious welcome to upturn
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German economy's downward slide appears to have bottomed out, with the
latest figures for west German gross domestic product showing a 0.5 per cent
recovery in the second quarter.
While the year-on-year figure still shows a decline of 1.9 per cent in GDP
compared with the same period in 1992, the 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter
advance is the first sign of recovery after four periods of negative or zero
growth.
The figure, released by the Economics Ministry yesterday, comes on top of
industrial order figures for German manufacturing industry published on
Monday, which showed a 3 per cent recovery in July compared with June,
reflecting primarily a 4.5 per cent pick-up in domestic orders.
The latest statistics were greeted with cautious optimism yesterday by Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, although he admitted it was 'premature
to interpret the recent slight upward movement as a clear signal that we
have reached an economic turning point.
'It shows that the first rays of light indicating the end of the recession
are now unmistakable,' he said.
Year-on-year, the figures published by the federal statistics office in
Wiesbaden still show some dramatic declines in economic activity. In
constant prices, capital investment was down 17 per cent in the second
quarter, compared with the same period in 1992, and exports of goods and
services fell by 8.3 per cent. In contrast, construction investment advanced
by 1.6 per cent in constant prices.
Mr Rexrodt said caution was still necessary because of the unchecked decline
of both private sector investment and exports.
He warned that the stabilisation would not mean an immediate slowdown in
unemployment growth. Unemployment in west Germany reached 7.5 per cent, or
2.3m, in July.
The latest figures provided welcome relief for the German government to
coincide with the first reading of the 1994 budget in the Bundestag
yesterday. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, launched a strong defence of
his plans for spending cuts of more than DM20bn (Pounds 8bn), to be made in
the DM478.4bn budget.
He said that without strict savings and consolidation the government would
have become unable to defend itself either nationally or internationally. He
pointed to the D-Mark's strengthening since mid-summer as a sign of
international confidence in German fiscal and monetary policy.

FT  08 SEP 93 / Croatia becomes Balkan villain: Zagreb seems destined to
join Belgrade in international isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, has so far avoided punishment for
the violent partition of Bosnia in spite of all the western outcry over the
Bosnian war in recent months. But failing a radical policy shift, Croatia
seems destined soon to join Serbia in international isolation.
As the escalation in fighting in central Bosnia shows, Croatia has fulfilled
all the criteria that earned Serbia its punitive sanctions last year.
Croatian regular army units are backing their Bosnian proxies in a bid to
carve out a Croatian mini-state. Relief officials have accused the Croatian
Defense Unit (HVO), Bosnian Croat forces, of 'ethnically cleansing' Moslems
from villages.
Meanwhile, Mr Tudjman this week reiterated his refusal to hand over
territory to his Moslem adversaries, in defiance of appeals and threats from
the international community to make some concessions to the mainly Moslem
Bosnian republic seeking to revive the Geneva peace talks.
'Moslems are demanding part of the coast which would amount to a territorial
division of Croatia,' said Mr Tudjman, indicating his belief that the Croat
areas of Bosnia were already part of a Croat state.
So far western governments have avoided talking about sanctions against the
Croats too openly, partly because of strong opposition from Germany. But
with the breakdown in talks, the momentum appears to be growing, not least
because sanctions could yet provide an easier option than air strikes to
swallow.
For a western public accustomed to seeing the Serbs as the main villains in
the conflict, Mr Tudjman's intransigence is perhaps surprising. However, his
position is not new. The main difference between Croatian and Serbian
policies towards Bosnia is quantitative. The Serbian army is better armed,
bigger and has seized three times as much territory. But the politics of
destruction have become devastatingly similar.
In March 1991 Serb and Croat leaders met in the Serbian resort of
Karadjordjevo to plot Bosnia's two-way split. Their plans were postponed
three months later when the rebellion of Serbs in Croatia, backed by Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, erupted into full-scale war against Zagreb, leaving Serb
rebels in control of almost one-third of Croatian territory under the
nominal supervision of a 15,000-strong force of UN peacekeepers. However,
his announcement this summer in Geneva of a Serb-Croat plan to partition
Bosnia fuelled concerns among the Moslems in Bosnia, and sparked ire among
Croatian politicians.
Mr Tudjman makes no secret of his assumption the Croat regions in Bosnia
will be part of Croatia, but the Serb declaration of a state in Croatia has
left him in an increasingly difficult position on Bosnia.
Most Croat politicians in Zagreb, except for the powerful 'Hercegovina
lobby', have opposed Mr Tudjman's moves to carve up Bosnia. Some
nationalists have rejected the partition because their vision of a Greater
Croatia includes all of Bosnia. But most fear that the republic's division
sets a dangerous precedent for the similar transformation of Croatia into a
confederation with Serb rebels. While it seems that Greater Croatia is
within his grasp, Mr Tudjman is playing a risky game.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday urged the UN Security Council
in New York to demand an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the
republic by invoking the threat of air strikes, Reuter reports from
Washington. Today Mr Izetbegovic is due to meet President Bill Clinton at
the White House.
