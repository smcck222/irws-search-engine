FT  03 SEP 93 / Personal View: No case for independent central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD HOLTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of an independent central bank has become exceedingly fashionable.
At present it is a sine qua non for taking part in any European Monetary
Union and it is advocated in the UK by a vocal element of the economic
establishment.
The simplest argument in favour is that politicians manipulate monetary
policy to win elections, or are prone to taking the soft option. As all
loose money does is to cause inflation, it is better to take monetary policy
out of party politics. Yet while loose money generally just causes
inflation, too-tight money does more than cause price deflation; it causes
recession with often permanent effects on the economy.
If Mr Paul Volcker, when chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had let US
banks and the government of Mexico go bust in 1982 by maintaining tight
money, are we really to believe the world would have been the same a few
years later except for a lower price level? The belief that monetary policy
is always 'neutral' in the long run, and affects only the price level, is
implausible.
If, nonetheless, monetary policy can be taken out of politics, why not take
fiscal policy out too? In fact, there is much more international evidence of
fiscal policy being manipulated for electoral ends than is the case with
monetary policy. Yet no-one proposes that fiscal policy should be put in the
hands of independent functionaries.
A more subtle argument depends on the idea of credibility. Politicians may
mean to keep inflation down, but other economic agents, especially in
financial markets, know they have an incentive to inflate before elections.
Accordingly inflation expectations, and the costs of controlling inflation,
will be higher than in the case where the monetary authority is not thought
to have any such incentive. An independent central bank will have different
incentives from politicians, so its anti-inflationary policy will be more
credible and less expensive in terms of lost output than that of the
toughest politician.
As an argument that is plausible but how important is it? The Bundesbank,
for all its credibility, has had to induce a substantial recession in
Germany this year in order to reduce inflation.
We are left with the argument that, given an independent central bank,
financial markets would expect lower inflation so nominal and real interest
rates would be lower. What is that worth? In New Zealand the Reserve Bank
was made statutorily independent in 1990 and followed a tough policy,
bringing inflation down to about 1 per cent. Meanwhile, in Australia, the
Reserve Bank, which is not independent, followed an equally tough policy and
brought inflation down below 1 per cent. The 'sacrifice' of output in New
Zealand was no less than in Australia. Indeed, New Zealand GDP is little
higher in real terms than in Australia - and a little higher in real terms
than it was in 1985. Since 1989, however, New Zealand 10-year bond yields
have been generally lower than Australian ones, whether measured in real or
nominal terms. Of course, many other factors have been at work but let us
ascribe the difference to a premium on central bank independence. The
current difference in nominal yields is 40 basis points (0.4 percentage
points), and in real yields about 20 basis points.
So there it is. If you abandon democratic control over monetary policy,
after a year or so you probably get a quarter to half of one per cent off
government bond yields.
If the advantages are so nebulous, why are increasing elements of the
establishment calling for an independent central bank? The reasons have more
to do with political philosophy than with economics. In the liberal
tradition, fear of government tyranny is paramount. People of this
persuasion advocate explicitly limited powers for government. For them, the
evidence for an independent bank does not have to be strong at all.
An alternative tradition stresses the importance of democratic process and
of accountability to the electorate. While not wanting government to be
omni-competent, it prefers a system where elected representatives determine
policies, and are responsible for them with fewer restrictions on the
capacity for radical change. For this tradition, it would need to be clear
beyond doubt that an independent central bank delivered large benefits
before it could approve the weakening of democracy that such independence
implies. The delphic evidence available so far is not remotely enough.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Competition in mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government can take pride in its policy of injecting competition
into the market for mobile communications. The decision to license Vodafone
as a rival to Cellnet, BT's majority-owned subsidiary, in the early 1980s
was largely responsible for the fast take-up of cellular services in the UK
compared with other European Community countries.
Now the prospect of a new rival, Mercury one2one, launching its service
later this month is causing the established duopoly to cut prices. Cellnet
yesterday reduced the standard cost of calls made from London by 25 per cent
and launched a new service which knocks a further 20 per cent off call
charges in the capital. Vodafone made similar moves in June.
One2one is the first of a new breed of personal communications networks.
PCNs, licensed in 1989, are a variation on cellular networks. The
government's original aim in introducing competition to the cellular duopoly
was to drive down prices so that mobile services were affordable to personal
as well as business customers.
While the forthcoming launch of one2one marks a milestone in the
government's pro-competition policy, the overall goal of a mass market for
mobile services is a long way from being reached. Even following the recent
price cuts, mobile services will be beyond the grasp of all but the richest
personal consumers.
This is not because the costs of mobile communications are intrinsically
high, but rather because low costs are not being fully passed through to
customers. Vodafone's fat profit margins - it earned Pounds 322m pre-tax on
sales of Pounds 664m in its last financial year - show the scope for price
cuts. Tariffs could be halved and the company would still be virtually at
break-even.
Careful adjustment
The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the new competition
from one2one will quickly erode those margins. But the situation is more
complicated. What is taking place is not an all-out price war but a
carefully calculated adjustment of the marketplace to absorb a new player.
Although some prices are coming down, others are going up. For example,
customers who subscribe to Cellnet's new service will make calls at 20p a
minute from inside London but pay a punitive 50p a minute - double the
normal rate - if they call from outside the capital.
The reason more vigorous price-cutting has not occurred is hardly a secret.
Mercury has no interest in provoking a price war - at least until it is
better established - and so is not pitching aggressively for the duopoly's
lucrative business customers. Similarly, Vodafone and Cellnet want to keep
their monopoly rents for as long as possible. Their responses to one2one are
designed to segment the market, allowing them to compete for personal
customers and sole traders, while not jeopardising their mainstream business
client base.
Heavy-handed
In such circumstances, it might seem tempting to reduce mobile service
prices by regulatory diktat - through a price cap formula on the lines of
that used to control the charges on BT's fixed network. But such a
temptation should be resisted, at least for the moment, because heavy-handed
regulation would get in the way of a fully competitive market.
There are two reasons for believing that in the long run a competitive
market will develop naturally. First, the cost structure of the new PCNs is
best suited to a mass market. One2one will therefore only be able to earn
sufficient profits to justify its shareholders' investment by cutting prices
to the level where they appeal to ordinary consumers. Second, the launch of
a second PCN service, Microtel, scheduled for early next year, will provide
a new spur.
Waiting for competition to develop naturally will undoubtedly take several
years. But rather than seeking to deliver the fruits to consumers earlier
through price regulation, the government should first see if it can make a
competitive market work even better. The best way of achieving this would be
for ministers to announce that the market was open to any further companies
which wished to enter. Even if none wished to take up the offer in the short
run, the possibility of new entrants would keep established players on their
toes.

The Times' decision to sink its cover price by a third makes the life of
John Dux, managing director of News International but also chairman of the
Newspaper Publishers Association's anti-VAT committee, a little harder.
In the latter position, where of course he speaks for the entire industry,
Dux will have to remain nimble on his feet if he is to persuade the
chancellor that an imposition of up to 17.5 per cent value added tax on the
press at the next budget would be detrimental to circulation when one
newspaper can afford to cut 33 per cent in the race to discomfort the
opposition.

Reassuring news from the Central Statistical Office yesterday, which reveals
that Britain's families were forking out 5.8 per cent more of their
hard-earned pennies in 1992 compared with the previous year, despite all
that recession doom and gloom. But take a look at the price of accessing
this little gem.
The 1992 Family Expenditure Survey report itself costs Pounds 24, a tidy 17
per cent more than last year. Seeing that the latest figure for the retail
prices index, whose weightings are calculated largely from this very survey,
was July's year-on-year increase of 1.4 per cent, the CSO seems to have a
slight statistical anomaly to explain away.

Tell a City trader or analyst that Britain works from 9 to 5 and they will
laugh wearily in your face.
The image of the UK as a nation of late-risers has not been up-to-the-minute
for some time. Just recently, the Central Statistical Office stepped up the
pace by bringing forward the release time for important facts and figures to
9.30 am from 11.30 am. But surely it is the thin end of the wedge when the
Bank of England's directors succumb to the early-bird revolution?
Since the beginning of this week, 'Books', the daily meeting in which Bank
directors discuss events and policy, has been held at 8.45 in the morning
compared with 11 o'clock previously.
There are no prizes for guessing that Eddie George, the Bank's Stakhanovite
new governor, was the moving force behind this change. As a markets man
first and last, he could see the advantage of getting the directors together
just after financial markets have opened and before the Bank's money-market
operations get under way around 10.
The early start marks a big change - Books has been held around elevenses
since time immemorial. But Bank insiders are anxious to dismiss the
impression of bleary-eyed directors struggling out of the shower to make the
meetings.
'Directors have been getting in for that time anyway and now are pleased to
have a clear morning afterwards,' puffed one loyal official yesterday.

When Hong Kong Taipan Simon Murray graduated from the university of life
with first class honours, he could hardly have expected that his barrack
room language would help smooth his passage.
In his youth Murray decided to see the world rather than complete his
A-levels, and joined the Foreign Legion - where the lingo in the barracks
was German.
Subsequently, he shot up the Hong Kong corporate ladder, moving from selling
loo seats for Jardine Matheson to juggling corporate assets as managing
director of the colony's largest conglomerate, Hutchison Whampoa.
Now, after nine years at the top of Hutchison, it appears he is about to
launch himself into the rather more sober world of banking as head of the
entire Asia Pacific operations of Deutsche Bank.
His German - still serving him well, he says - should prove useful on his
frequent commute to Frankfurt. But it is not the only benefit of being a
Legionnaire: 'I have been dining off the Foreign Legion story for a good 30
years.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / A snip at the tangle of red tape: Will Japan's government
succeed in deregulating the economy, ask William Dawkins and Robert Thomson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody wanting to understand the constraints on Japan's economy should try
to open a supermarket. The aspiring retailer must read 17 laws and 45
administrative regulations, fill in 200 pages of application forms and wait
perhaps 18 months for a reply, which could be No because a local small
shopkeeper does not welcome fresh competition.
The cost of this frustration is heavy. Mr Isao Nakauchi, chairman of Daiei,
a retailing group, reckons Y58bn (Pounds 364m) in extra sales could be
generated annually by a relaxation of restrictions on store openings. But
the costs to economic efficiency and to Japanese consumers, denied choice by
over-regulation, are greater.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, has recognised the problem.
His seven-party coalition government has announced a hit list of 60
deregulation proposals, ranging from the easing of controls on new stores to
freeing up satellite broadcasting. If he has his way, the impact on Japan
will be great. Beer will be cheaper, taxi fares will come down, and Japanese
television viewers will have more choice.
The deregulation drive is a Japanese version of the generally successful
campaign against barriers to competition by the European Community and the
US in the 1980s. Mr Hosokawa faces vested corporate interests and the
powerful bureaucracy, which usually blocks changes that weaken its
influence.
A sign of the challenge before the Hosokawa coalition is that the
deregulation list was prepared by these territory-conscious bureaucrats, who
inserted several contentious proposals rejected several times in the past
decade. But Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce half of the measures by
next March.
European and US companies and governments have a stake in the programme. If
successful, it will allow easier entry into markets and remove, in some
industries, a layer or two of a distribution system that increases costs and
restricts the flow of new products.
A final plan will be presented to parliament on September 20, part of a
package to stimulate Japan's flagging economy. A few days later, Mr Hosokawa
addresses the UN assembly and meets US leaders, who will be told of action
to encourage imports and reduce the overall Japanese trade surplus, up 17.6
per cent in the first half to Dollars 57.3bn (Pounds 38bn).
The package includes gas and electricity discounts for big industrial users,
fewer controls on construction material imports and mobile telephone sales,
an easing of restrictions on the freight weight of large trucks, an end to
minimum production limits for brewers, which keep potential small producers
out of the market, and fewer car roadworthiness inspections.
The difficulties of introducing these and other measures were summed up
yesterday by Mr Kiyoshi Ishihara, a Tokyo taxi driver, whose Y600 starting
fare could be Y500 or even Y400 if fares are liberalised: 'Six years ago
they started talking about deregulating taxi fares, and nothing has
happened. We don't want it, and I don't think the Hosokawa coalition will
last long enough to introduce it.'
Mr Ishihara said the 'timing is wrong', as taxi drivers have suffered a fall
in income - in his case, about 30 per cent - with the slowing of the
Japanese economy. Change to the old ways would require some form of
compensation to taxi drivers.
Many of the proposals will meet similar opposition. Car makers have
supported the roadworthiness certificate system, as they benefit from
purchases inspired by the need for old cars to pass a test every two years,
annually for cars more than 13 years old. Car repairers and parts suppliers
have a similar interest.
Ending a cosy cartel and increasing competition means treading on toes, and
toe-treading in Japan is done with shoes off. Affected businesses receive
subsidies to compensate them for bruises, but only after long negotiation
with the bureaucrats responsible and ultimately with the ministry of
finance, which provides the funds.
For example, controls on opening large retail outlets will be relaxed under
the deregulation proposals. In May 1990, Japan responded to US demands to
amend the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which covers stores of 500 sq m or
more. The US idea was that large stores would have increased shelf space for
imported products and new retailers would be less beholden to traditional
suppliers.
To win approval for the changes, which took another year to be introduced,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry put together a Y162.1bn
subsidy package for small retailers, who were able to use the funds for
business promotions, including street fairs and pavement repairs. Three
years later, despite a speeding of approvals for new large stores, small
shopkeepers are still able to put obstacles in the way of ambitious
retailers such as Daiei.
Will Mr Hosokawa be able to side-step the vested interests or will
deregulation be a flop? The consensus among economic and political observers
is that, whatever the outcome of these proposals, the policy debate has been
shifted, giving consumers benefits where producers' interests have long
predominated.
Mr Hosokawa's reputation hangs on the outcome. He is famed for complaining
that, as a provincial governor, he could not move a bus stop without
approval from Tokyo bureaucrats. If he does cut a way through the thicket of
opposition, the next government will be under pressure to follow the path of
deregulation.
'We are at the start of a tremendous transition, even if we do not yet have
a clear vision of what the new system will be about,' says Mr Susumu
Taketomi, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, a long-term
credit bank. 'The post-war system was rational, but no longer matches our
maturing economy.'
One of Mr Hosokawa's difficulties is the fragility of his seven-party
coalition, already divided a month after taking office and expected to split
within a year. The prime minister was told this week by one partner, the
Japan Renewal party, to devote his energies to political reform and not to
be distracted by economic or foreign policies.
Another partner, the Social Democratic party, formerly the Socialist party,
is uncomfortable about deregulation. It has always supported small
shopkeepers in preference to larger retailers, but the latter will profit
from the proposals.
Individual politicians will be under pressure from local lobby groups to
leave the laws unchanged. And it is easy to imagine why Japan's four big
brewers might object to a proposal to end the present 2,000 kilolitre per
year minimum production limit, as this would open the market to small
breweries and foreign makers.
As the taxi driver explained, the economic timing may be wrong. Deregulation
tends to drive up unemployment by killing inefficient companies before
stimulating economic activity, which the EC found when introducing single
market programmes. A senior EC diplomat said then: 'The first thing that
happens when you introduce level playing fields, is that the weak teams get
beaten faster.'
Mr Tom Hill, strategist at S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo, expects
implementation to be slow: 'In the long term, the economic case is
impeccable. But the short-term danger is that deregulation will introduce a
dose of deflation at a time when the economy is already in the grip of
deflationary forces.'
But Mr Hosokawa does have support from Keidanren, the federation of economic
organisations, which is demanding deregulation and has even criticised the
government's proposals as inadequate, producing 30 suggestions of its own.
It wants the removal of import tariffs for car parts, direct rice sales
between growers and shops, cutting out the middlemen, and a reduction in
subsidies for dairy products.
The list reflects the complaints of larger Japanese companies facing higher
costs than foreign, especially Asian, competitors. These companies are
burdened by a strong yen and, under extreme pressure to cut costs, have
concluded the benefits of deregulation outweigh the costs.
Having drafted a package, the government must now carry out the proposals.
Sceptics should remember that the collapse of Liberal Democratic party rule
after four decades came as a surprise to most Japanese. In this giddy
atmosphere, the previously impossible is up for negotiation.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Banks back on the road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE start of the present decade the global banking system looked
uncomfortably shaky. A plague of bad debts in real estate was eating away at
the profits and capital of financial institutions in North America, Japan,
Britain, Scandinavia and Australia. Rescues were multiplying and credit
ratings tumbling. Only in continental Europe were banks largely unbothered
by plunging asset prices and non-performing loans. Questions were raised
about the ability of the banks to finance a global economic recovery.
Today the threat looks remote. Profitability, asset quality and credit
standing are all on the mend in the English-speaking economies, as a
succession of recent results from the banks have underlined. The banking
system of Scandinavia, which came close to total collapse, has been
stabilised. While pockets of trouble remain, the questions for policymakers
are not so much about how to manage financial distress as the avoidance of a
repetition. How can the improvement in bank profitability be secured over
the longer run?
The conventional answer is that governments should maintain a long-term
commitment to anti-inflationary policies, while ensuring appropriate
prudential supervision and regulation at the micro-economic level. Yet this
seems, at first sight, a mildly off-beam response after a disinflationary
decade which left the bond markets ready to be convinced that the
inflationary tiger had been caged. Moreover, the first attempt at global
prudential supervision, in the shape of the Bank for International
Settlements' new capital regime, has initially increased the pressure on
troubled banks. So what, apart from the normal impact on profits of an
economic downturn, was this banking crunch really about?
Permanent diminution
At one level there was a problem of industry structure. The loss of
creditworthy clients to the security markets caused a permanent diminution
in asset quality. At the same time deregulation encouraged the remaining
corporate and personal clients to raise their borrowings. The banks,
meantime, enjoyed new freedom to do business in both product and geographic
areas with which they were unfamiliar. The classic instance was the
Scandinavian banks' suicidal dash into the UK property market at its peak.
Against such a background macro-economic policy shocks were potentially
lethal. The switch to money-supply targeting in the US in 1979 played a
crucial part in bankrupting savings and loan institutions. Similarly,
sterling's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism made a nonsense
of the inflationary assumption on which most buyers in the British property
markets had taken out their loans. Loose monetary policy in Japan after the
Louvre currency agreement caused an unprecedented asset price bubble.
Adverse consequences
The implicit message is that none of the governments concerned had any clear
idea of the potentially adverse consequences of their monetary policies for
the banking system - any more than the ERM member countries intentionally
set out to bolster banks' currency dealing profits when they embarked on
policies that failed to convince the currency markets. There will always be
unintended consequences of large policy shifts. Yet monetary authorities
have also had their successes, notably in the US where the Fed was quick to
recognise the deflationary threat posed by the banking system's troubles and
adjusted the structure of interest rates accordingly.
One challenge for the central banks now is to find a way of reducing the
banks' vulnerability to swings in asset prices. This is most obviously the
case with Japan, where cross-holdings of bank equity leave banking capital
subject to wild stock market fluctuations. But there is a wider need to find
ways of preventing the property market from exerting such a mesmeric
attraction on bankers who seek to expand their loan books with minimal
effort.
But the banks themselves have to recreate a prudential culture capable of
withstanding the strains of a more competitive environment. Rescues create
moral hazard. If they are not to result in greater fiscal damage in future,
bank management must acknowledge a duty to the taxpayer as well as the
shareholder.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Unsavoury recipe for recovery: Germans are being asked to
work harder and expect fewer benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frills are out. White-collar staff at Daimler-Benz learnt this week that
bonuses for having babies, bus and train fare subsidies and cheap personal
loans have all been struck from the company's time-honoured list of employee
benefits. In future they will also have to pay for the frocks and suits
usually worn by their offspring at confirmation or first communion, and
customarily paid for by the company.
As all Germans will officially discover today, with the publication of a
government discussion paper, Securing the Future of Germany's Economic Base,
such challenges to the status quo may not in future be restricted to the
occupants of Daimler's post-modern Stuttgart HQ.
The paper, compiled by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, says
post-unification Germany, in its deepest post-war recession, will be able to
afford fewer luxuries unless the country comes to terms with its economic
and social failings; moreover, its people will have to work harder
regardless.
The core thesis is that Germany - its people, its politicians, its industry
and its institutions - is growing older ungracefully. The Wirtschaftswunder,
the society that created Germany's post-war economic miracle, suffers
increasingly from short-sightedness, sclerosis and isolation from the
realities of life in an increasingly borderless world economy.
What is incontestable is that Germany's population is aging rapidly. At
present there are almost three people of working age for every pensioner. In
about 25 years the ratio will be two to one and then deteriorate rapidly,
the paper says.
Last year federal, state and local government benefits and subsidies
accounted for the equivalent of 50.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
This year, according to the BDI, the federation of German industry, the
proportion will reach a record 52 per cent and, it adds, the country will be
another step down the road towards becoming a state-controlled economy.
The paper says those in employment do not work enough and expect too much
from their employers and the state. Business and society are over-regulated.
The state and its agents are over-involved in business: the death throes of
industries such as coal are eased with subsidies, to the neglect of research
and the country's economic future.
As a cure, the Bonn government prescribes an extraordinary list of
treatments: wholesale privatisation, deregulation, social benefits only for
those in need, free enterprise kindergartens and a new education system. The
labour market should be re-ordered to allow Sunday working, flexible hours
and pay deals, and even, possibly, an end to the government monopoly on
employment agencies. Shops should be allowed to open late. Restrictive
practices in the guild-like trade organisations, which allow a qualified
carpenter to build but not to plumb in a sink unit, must go, the paper says.
It is radical stuff in conservative Germany. But in more typical style, Bonn
first of all wants a debate, appreciating that it has little chance of
implementing changes without a wide-ranging consensus. 'None of these themes
lends itself to quick and conclusive treatment. But it is necessary to
conduct the discussion,' Mr Rexrodt writes.
The paper itself is alternately vague and admonitory and littered with
obvious gaps where government colleagues have fudged or snipped out
sensitive parts (a section proposing the dilution of pension rights, for
example, was excised by labour minister Mr Norbert Blum). The end result is
more an emotional call to arms than a policy statement.
As Chancellor Helmut Kohl is likely to stress at the official launch today,
the best way forward for Germany may be discovered by looking backwards.
'People in Germany were filled with courage and confidence during the
post-war reconstruction. They were prepared to make efforts themselves and
recognise the efforts of others,' the paper says.
'They accepted technical progress which made life and work easier . . . They
understood initiative, the competitive spirit . . . public-mindedness,
solidarity, tolerance and humanity . . . '
With one of several extracts from the dictionary of Thatcherite rhetoric, it
adds: 'They did not only ask 'Who will help me?' but also 'Whom can I help?'
They did not see only their rights but also their duties and
responsibilities.'
The discussion sought by Mr Rexrodt started even before his paper had been
formally rubber-stamped by the cabinet. It was denounced from the left as 'a
declaration of bankruptcy' for Bonn's economic policy. Industry, pleased to
see many of its proposals included, murmured that it was a step in the right
direction.
In truth, steps in the direction indicated have been going on for months.
Industry has had particular success in bending union leaders to accepting
formerly unthinkable deals. Robert Bosch, for example, the electronics-based
group, earlier this year won agreement for Sunday working in a new
semiconductor factory. Its tactics could not have been more direct: either
IG Metall, the union involved, accepted seven-day operations, or the factory
would be built in Scotland.
Adam Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, struck another ground-breaking
bargain with the same union. The pay-off was work for almost 500 making
diesel engines in Kaiserslautern rather than one of half a dozen options
outside Germany. The price was round-the-clock working for five days a week,
with Saturday maintenance work paid at normal rates, and an end to
demarcation.
This week's cut in Daimler's employee benefits was another link in a growing
chain of settlements in which workers have shown themselves prepared to see
benefits eroded in return for job security.
As the 1994 pay round approaches there are already mounting signs that
unions, after accepting an effective real pay cut for this year, will accept
similar deals for next.
In all these instances, the lever applied implicitly or actively against
union resistance has been the threat of rising unemployment. The threat of
job losses will be put to work again in the next few months as wage
negotiations get under way.
The government, too, has not been idle. By clamping down on prescription
limits and raising patient contributions, it has engineered a sharp drop in
the costs of the health service. At current rates, drug companies estimate
spending on prescription drugs this year will fall by DM7bn (Pounds 2.8bn).
Bonn has also announced its so-called budget consolidation programme to take
effect from next January: a combination of cuts in social and unemployment
benefits - previously considered untouchable - and higher taxes, intended to
cut the ballooning federal deficit.
But conditions are changing. The economy is by all accounts past the worst
of the recession. As trade union confidence returns it may not be so easy in
future for employers to tinker with time-honoured agreements, risking
conflict and their company's precarious progress back to financial health.
Obstacles to the government's grand project are already visible. For
instance Bonn talks bravely of privatising all its business interests as
part of its vision of a more deregulated economy. But most nationalised
holdings - in banks, airports, car makers such as Volkswagen, water,
electricity utilities and local transport - are in the hands of state or
local governments, most of which have strong Social Democrat traditions.
Which leaves Chancellor Kohl more or less where he was at the beginning of
the year. It was then, as the recession was biting and the true costs of
unification were striking home, that he launched his programme for a
'solidarity pact' between government, opposition, labour and capital, to
collaborate to resolve the country's dilemmas.
The pact eluded him despite his fine words and good intentions. There is
little reason to suppose that words will be effective this time - even words
which once worked so effectively for Mrs Thatcher.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed reflections on the Bush era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUG HENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It's been remarkable to watch Michael Prowse evolve into an ever more
enthusiastic fan of American orthodoxy. In his two September 1 stories
('Life under Bush better than it seemed' and 'Pace of US economic growth
beats Wall Street forecasts') on the upward revision of 1990-92 GDP figures,
he essentially argues that the 1992 election campaign was fought on premises
now revealed as false: official statistics of the time badly understated the
pace of growth in the year's second half, lending credence to Bill Clinton's
indictment of George Bush's economic policies.
Since we now know that Bush's final year was nowhere near as stagnant as
we'd thought, we have to wonder, Prowse asks, 'why public perceptions of the
economy were so weak'. He answers his question by pointing to 'dashed
expectations' - even with revised figures, the recovery has still been
slower than earlier business cycles.
This will not do. GDP may matter to pundits, but the average American
couldn't tell you whether 2 per cent growth was strong or weak, or what the
average growth rate for the first eight quarters of a recovery are. I'm no
fan of Clinton, but he must be given credit for arguing throughout his
campaign that the problems of the US economy are structural, not cyclical,
and that prominent among these pathologies is the 16 per cent decline in
real hourly wages over the last 20 years, when real GDP has grown 56 per
cent.
The point can be put even more pungently. Since 1973, the time necessary for
a worker paid the average hourly wage to earn the average household's yearly
expenses has grown 43 per cent; to buy the average new house, 45 per cent;
the average new car, 57 per cent; and to pay for a year at Yale or the
University of California, 75 per cent. Clinton seems to have forgotten these
facts; now, he takes his cue from the bond market, where deficit reduction
is revered and wage growth viewed with fear.
Falling real wages, not the course of the statistical fetish known as the
GDP, drive popular perceptions of economic weakness. Were political
discourse in the US not so stunted, not so dominated by what Keynes called
the 'simple-minded maxims . . . one still reads in old-fashioned financial
weeklies', then these issues might be more openly ventilated. New-fashioned
financial dailies should know better.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No proper recognition or advocacy for
UK's scientists/engineers (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to your leader, 'Supply, demand and scientists' (August
31), and speaking as a scientist who has recently hung up his 'test tubes'
after 20 years in favour of a commercial career, I would maintain that
Britain's decline in science and engineering has been taking place over the
last three decades. The reason is a lack of financial rewards and
opportunity for scientists and engineers to reach top positions in British
companies and society. I have witnessed many scientists give up the battle
to pursue a career through creative innovation and application of science.
Job satisfaction doesn't pay the bills, and a society that has been through
Thatcher's get-rich-quick era has left the scientist/engineer demoralised
and disillusioned. The average scientist/engineer has been through a
rigorous training and learning programme and, when less qualified and less
able people are paid substantially more in commercial careers, they ask
themselves 'has it been worth it?'.
Improvements in education are only part of the solution. Britain has to
start to value its technologists by paying them more. Supply and demand laws
do not appear to have worked for the scientist/engineer, possibly because
Britain's technological base has shrunk; we have given it to countries which
have a more enlightened approach about the role of industry in modern
economies.

<BYLINE>
   From Dr NICHOLAS COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I looked at the complex issues involved in John Authers' well-reasoned
article ('Discipline in need of a better chemistry', August 28) wearing
three different hats. I am a chartered engineer with more than a decade's
experience in industry; I have just finished a management doctorate
searching for better ways to support technical innovation; and I am at
present an unemployment statistic finding few people interested in promoting
technical innovation.
Industry seems to care little whether or not its engineers have science
degrees, and even less about their innovative ideas. Those who speak for the
engineering professions, despite some admirable advocacy, still lapse into
complacency at times - witness the Engineering Council's lack of clear
guidance on innovation.
As for government, its chosen solution seems to be to support science by
cutting art - like some manic doctor who tries to increase the patient's red
blood cell count by killing off the white cells that combat disease.
Perhaps the truth is that the rhetoric of blame is easier than the language
of real action. We need to innovate - to promote new products,
organisational changes, and 'lean' manufacturing methods. Neither art nor
science alone can provide the answer - we need the liberal arts to teach us
to spot the rhetoric of inaction, just as we need science to allow us to
replace it with real and effective action.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Up for grabs: Raymond Snoddy on a price-cutting strategy at
The Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public announcement that The Daily Telegraph newspaper was going to
halve its cover price could not have been more unexpected. There had, of
course, been a lively debate within the organisation over such a drastic
step.
Some senior executives pointed to an intractable dilemma. To get a higher
circulation, you might have to alter the content and make the paper less
demanding. Do that and advertisers might not want to pay so much.
But the price-cutters, led by Lord Camrose, got their way. On December 1
1930 The Daily Telegraph reduced its price from 2p to 1p, joining the
popular dailies and leaving The Times at 2p.
The result was phenomenal. In a month, its circulation jumped from 100,000
to 175,000, and two weeks later to 190,000, at least some of the gain coming
from The Times. Thus was the future of the modern Daily Telegraph laid.
It is unlikely that anything so significant will happen on Monday when The
Times cuts its cover price from 45p to 30p - and from 50p to 40p on
Saturdays. Ironically, one of its targets will be The Daily Telegraph, price
48p on weekdays.
The move was personally authorised by Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News
Corporation which owns The Times, who has become convinced that newspapers
may be too expensive. It will herald an autumn of intense competition in the
broadsheet newspaper market in the UK.
The initial industry reaction is that Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The
Times, and Mr Murdoch, must have gone mad. The common wisdom is that the
price of newspapers - particularly broadsheet newspapers - is not a main
factor in the decision to buy.
Mr Harold Lind, the newspaper consultant who has warned of declining
readership, is not so sure. 'I think it (The Times) has a sporting chance.
Cutting the price of The Sun was silly,' he said yesterday. In July, Mr
Murdoch cut the price of his mass-market tabloid Sun from 25p to 20p for the
summer, and has now extended the discount into 1994.
The difference between the two price cuts, in Mr Lind's judgment, lies in
the distinct economics of tabloid and broadsheet newspapers. Only about 30
per cent of the revenues of newspapers like The Times comes from their cover
price, with the rest from advertising. With popular tabloids the ratios are
reversed.
'The Times' price cut amounts to only 8 or 9 per cent of total revenues,' Mr
Lind said.
Nevertheless, the cut is likely to cost News Corporation millions of pounds
in lost revenue, particularly because payments to wholesalers and newsagents
are being held at their old level, based on a cover price of 45p. The extent
of the losses will depend on how many extra copies are sold and whether
advertisers will pay more as a result.
'You get 50,000 copies ahead of the nearest competitor and it doesn't matter
what the total circulation is. You are the cock on the dunghill,' said Mr
Lind.
Official average sales for The Times from February to July this year give
The Times a circulation of 363,799, which represents a 6.5 per cent drop
over the same period last year.
The Independent, price 45p, the closest rival of The Times, fell by 9 per
cent to 343,308, while the left-of-centre Guardian, price 45p, held on to
most of its circulation - 411,981, down 1.16 per cent. The Daily Telegraph
fell 1.6 per cent to 1.2m, with The Financial Times, at 65p, down 0.67 per
cent to 289,826.
Apart from Mr Murdoch's instinct and propensity for rejecting conventional
business wisdom, he has been struck by the success of Lord Camrose in the
1930s. He is also relying on the results of a month-long price-cutting
experiment in the county of Kent, which saw sales of The Times increase by
an average 14 per cent, according to News Corporation.
A check of four representative wholesalers in Kent in the week ending August
15 found that The Times had increased sales by 12.5 per cent compared with
the week ending July 31, when it was still at the old price.
In this check The Independent suffered worst - down 7.2 per cent, followed
by The Guardian, which showed a 5.6 per cent loss. The Telegraph was much
less badly affected, at 2.6 per cent down, and the FT was scarcely hit with
a 0.7 per cent loss.
The number one target of The Times is clearly The Independent, which plans a
relaunch with new sections at the beginning of next month and will almost
certainly have to raise new finance later in the year. The paper reacted
angrily to The Times' move and changed its front page to accuse Mr Murdoch
of trying to put The Independent and the Independent on Sunday out of
business.
The Guardian decided not to comment. The successors of Lord Camrose at The
Daily Telegraph were dismissive and made it clear they had no intention of
getting involved in a price war.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph group, said yesterday: 'We
think it's sad to see a British institution in such an undignified state,
marketing itself not as a paper of record, not for its wide coverage or fine
writing, not even for its integrity but 'Buy Me, I'm Cheap'.'
Mr Murdoch has identified The Telegraph as his prime target over the next
decade because it has so many readers to try to lure away.
The hope at News Corporation is that the price cut will relatively quickly
take the circulation of The Times above 400,000 again by winning back old
Times readers, persuading occasional readers to buy more frequently, and
poaching readers from other titles.
Apart from the other broadsheets, some new sales could come from readers of
middle-market titles such as the Daily Mail and Daily Express, now 2p a day
more expensive than The Times.
The price-cutting strategy was greeted with some scepticism in the City. Ms
Lorna Tilbian, media observer at S G Warburg, the stockbroker, said: 'I
don't understand the policy. What they really ought to do is concentrate on
the quality of the editorial rather than trying to turn a premium product
into a commodity.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Where Mickey Mouse and French culture
clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M PURSHOUSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am surprised that your article on the problems at Euro Disney ('Mr
Grumpy at the door', September 1) concentrates on purely technical reasons
for the company's current difficulties. Although I have yet to visit the
place myself, I have discussed it on several occasions with visiting French
friends and business colleagues, and have been surprised at the consistency
of their antipathy to the venture. What comes across is a strong feeling
that the whole idea is alien to French culture, to the extent that they will
have nothing to do with it. These same people would, I suspect, not hesitate
to visit Disneyland or Disneyworld while en vacances in the US, where both
would be clearly seen as integral parts and manifestations of the indigenous
culture.
I suspect that Euro Disney and its shareholders may have to face the
unpalatable fact that the decision to site Euro Disney in France, a country
with, at best, an ambivalent attitude to the virtues of imported American
culture, was a big strategic error. Perhaps the opening of Eurotunnel next
year will make Euro Disney accessible to sufficient numbers of Anglo-Saxons
to make a real difference to its fortunes. The UK would have provided a far
more congenial home for Mickey Mouse and his relations.

festival, and since the Edinburgh Fringe is in danger of degenerating into a
comic's convention it is a place to tread warily.
Even the winner of the Perrier Award for best cabaret performer, Lee Evans,
could trip up many people with his idea of what makes a laugh. Evans was
born into the entertainment business which might explain why his physical
contortions owe much to Norman Wisdom, and his painfully fractured delivery
is reminiscent of Frankie Howerd. Evans was the clear favourite and a
popular choice. He will transfer well to television and could become a
typical British star comedian, loved by those who find every jerky grimace
side-splitting, hated by those who expect wit from a comic.
The new wave comedians who flock to Edinburgh each Festival rarely tell
jokes: they make quirky observations on the passing scene. Perrier's most
promising newcomer award went to Dominic Holland, who fits neatly into this
category. Holland relies on bags of charm and naivety to win over the
audience. He has worked the London circuit with a 20-minute act which leaves
him looking threadbare filling an hour at Edinburgh, but there is enough
jokey humour to suggest success. Along with Donna McPhail, who managed to
find loads of laughs in lesbianism, he was the pick of the 'funny old world,
innit' school of comedy.
It would be helpful if the organisers of the Perrier Award could spell out
their ambit more clearly. By far the happiest hour at Edinburgh was spent
with Dave Schneider and Armando Iannucci. They are hardly household names
but their On the Hour series for Radio 4 presumably makes them Perrier
non-starters. Schneider throws himself around the stage. He lifts familiar
material - the world's worst magician, Zero Talent, and quick-fire pop
impressions - out of the mundane. Iannucci is more cerebral. He pushes the
possible into the surreal. The sketch of the juggler adapting his act to
take account of Stephen Hawking's theory of the expanding universe is
sublime.
Equally unacceptable to a Perrier judge is another young Radio 4 stalwart,
Richard Herring. Like many comedians he has progressed into situation
comedy: in Ra-Ra-Rasputin he makes the obvious link between the Russian monk
and the German disco group, Boney M, taking in fancy cakes, a pickled penis,
a naked Prince Charles, and plenty of good natured bawdy. This mindless fun
was a welcome relief from stand up comedians determined to wring your
conscience dry.
Not all those grim faces you see at a Fringe event hide bad consciences.
Many represent agents and critics and radio and TV producers checking out
the talent. Sometimes the paying punters seem an insignificant minority and
you worry that the whole carnival is just some gigantic audition, a trade
showcase. For one student production of Much Ado About Nothing the audience
consisted mainly of Richard Eyre, director of the National Theatre, and
Dennis Marks, director of English National Opera: the actors should not get
over excited. The production was directed by Eyre's daughter and there was a
Marks girl in the cast.
But with the Television, Film, Jazz, and Book Festivals happening
co-incidentally Edinburgh inevitably becomes the national arts scene, and
many performers prepare an act which keeps them in genteel poverty for the
rest of the year. The professional reaction at Edinburgh either makes them
or breaks them.
Genteel would be a dangerous description of Kit and the Widow, back in
Edinburgh with a fistful of new songs. They look and sound so respectable
(although Kit's recently shaven head adds an air of menace) but their lyrics
spit out poison capsules. In the past Kit begged not to go to bed with
Madonna; now the unlikely coupling of Virginia Bottomley and Delia Smith has
been added to the list of ladies who need better PR.
Kit and the Widow carry traces of the Western Brothers and Flanders and
Swann but are really very hard indeed. Their strength is contemporary jokes:
wondering whether Michael Jackson could be caught up in blackmail, being so
black-ish and male-ish.
Finally congratulations Emily Woof. Her show Revolver faced two potentially
scuttling setbacks: she was not allowed to use songs from the Beatles album
'Revolver', the basis of her show, and she broke her leg. Woof ignored these
petty handicaps.
Part of the attraction is such a mimsy girl talking dirty but, in spite of
the plaster cast, she brings a stunning physicality into her soliloquy,
which links a planned video based on the songs from 'Revolver', with a
Beatles fan of the 1960s desperate to consumate her love for John Lennon.
Woof makes things complicated by introducing subsidiary characters, which
distract from her central image, a vulnerable woman abandoned in the flat of
a footloose television producer with only the gun in his desk for sinister
company. But the climax is suitably cathartic.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: A minimalist's material - Sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL exhibition space at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, is
occupied by an enormous six metre high tower made out of 21 tons of cinder
blocks. Constructed and installed under the supervision of Sol LeWitt, it is
the culmination of an exhibition of structures from 1963 to the present on
view at the Institute and in the adjoining Leeds City Art Gallery. A large
body of drawings, most of which are an integral part of his sculptural
practice, are also on show.
The very early drawings, from 1958, are copies, or 'transcriptions', as he
prefers to call them, of Old Master paintings, ranging from Piero della
Francesca to Velasquez and Goya. That he should have been attracted to Piero
is interesting, since LeWitt's subsequent work, both sculpture and drawings,
has been rigorously abstract and geometric. Piero was the first early
Renaissance artist to construct his frescoes on geometric principles, and
therefore a timely beacon to the young LeWitt.
In the 1960s LeWitt, along with Donal Judd and Carl Andre, was a founder
member of the minimalist and conceptualist coterie. It was he who, in 1967,
adumbrated the principle that 'in conceptual art the idea or concept is the
most important aspect of the work . . .' The exhibition holds a great number
of explicatory drawings, with texts explaining how LeWitt reached a certain
position intellectually, at which point the structure could be, and was,
fabricated by a technician.
The rigorously pared-down quality of many of the structures is exemplified
in the room populated by 122 Incomplete Open Cubes, 1974, which are painted
wood structures 8 x 8 x 8 inches, mounted on a 12 inch high painted wood
base on the floor; 122 framed photographs and drawings hang like
doppelgangers on the wall. The systematic geometric variations forbid any
figurative associations: 'what you see is what you see', as Frank Stella
declared in 1966.
A historical curiosity is Muybridge II of 1964, which caused a furore as
recently as 1991, when a feminist curator refused to exhibit it at the
National Museum of American Art in Washington DC on the grounds that it was
obscene. This structure consists of a long box with 10 tiny holes containing
frontal photographs of a nude woman, which progressively advance until the
final focus is the navel. Perhaps it makes peeping Toms of us all, but truly
pornography is in the eye of the beholder.
From the mid-1980s LeWitt gave himself permission to enjoy the sensuous
properties of colour. The results are some gorgeously rich gouaches in deep,
Egyptian tomb-painting colours - dark reds, burgundies and ochres - starting
in 1985 with pyramidal shapes progressing to regular horizontal and vertical
bands of colour until, in 1992, he lets rip, painting wavy irregular bands
in luscious tones.
At the Yorkshire Sculpture Park LeWitt has installed another cinder block
piece entitled 123454321. The numbers refer to the stepped blocks which rise
from a small cube at either end to one large cube in the middle. The cinder
blocks, essentially urban materials, unpleasant to the touch and to the
sight, sit uneasily in the lush landscape. It is LeWitt's only structure
sited in the British landscape and I hope it remains so.
The sculptures of Fritz Wotruba (1907-74) are more comfortable inhabitants
of the formal parts of the Sculpture Park. Smaller sculptures, maquettes and
drawings are displayed in the Pavilion Gallery and the newly-opened Bothy
Gallery. Wotruba, who was born in Vienna, was part of the modern movement.
His abiding concern was that the solidity of the material remained with him
throughout his career. During the war, which he spent in exile in
Switzerland, his sculptures became more representational, owing much to the
elongated figures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck.
Perhaps his most enduring monument, represented here by photographs, was his
design for the Church of the Most Holy Trinity, Vienna Mauer. Composed of
rectangular blocks and cubes, it is as uncompromisingly modern as was Gerrit
Rietveld's Schroer House in Utrecht in 1924.
New granite sculptures were made on site by Michael Dan Archer. Archer lived
in Japan for three years, which clearly influenced his attitude to the
physical characteristics of the stone he is working. The abstract shapes are
evocative of ancient architecture and prehistoric menhirs, teasing our
imaginations with their secret histories.
The Sol LeWitt Exhibition is at the Henry Moore Institute and the Leeds City
Gallery until October 16 (telephone: 0532-343158).
Fritz Wotruba Sculptures is at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield
(0924-830302) until October 31.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Caesar in a crowd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST, if obvious, comment on Peter Stein's production of Julius Caesar
is that it is so very, very, German. This has nothing to do with the
language. Shakespeare translates well into a tongue that has much in common
with his own. It is a point about concepts. The Germans have a fatal habit
of becoming hooked on a single big idea.
The big idea in Stein's production is that there should be a very large
crowd. Whereas a normal production of Julius Caesar might have a crowd of
about 50, and often considerably less, Stein goes for a crowd of around 200,
and very impressive it sometimes seems. Yet the size of the crowd
immediately creates new problems. Only a very large space can accommodate
it.
In Edinburgh there are few large spaces available, so the search for
Lebensraum led to the Royal Highland Exhibition Hall in Ingliston.
The inside of the hall looks like a mixture of a huge aircraft hangar and a
shipyard. Again, this may be a bonus. Certainly the crowd in Stein's Julius
Caesar have a close resemblance to the shipyard workers who used to rebel in
Gdansk. They seem the very model of an industrial proletariat. The technique
of having the crowd stream in from all sides works once, possibly twice.
Being German-directed, however, it is a very organised crowd and there is
some danger of repetition. By the time the original crowd was doubling as
helmeted soldiers running backwards and forwards with riot shields I began
to laugh, which presumably is the last reaction Stein is looking for.
There is a more serious objection to designing a play to fit a single
concept. It arose when Robert LePage designed A Midsummer Night's Dream in a
swamp in London last year. It seems a good idea for half an hour or so, but
the trouble is that once you have introduced a swamp to the stage you are
stuck with it to the end.
So it is with Julius Caesar. Some scenes in Julius Caesar - between Caesear
and his wife, for example, - are of great intimacy. They do not need the
vast space created for 200 people. Not even Stein's controlled use of
lighting can conceal the fact that a large part of his space is often
distractingly empty. We are looking at a vacuum.
Besides, the role of the crowd fades in the last third of the play. It
becomes a battleground, but the best scenes are to do with personal
confrontations and griefs, not fighting. Stein's approach seems to be that
if you have 200 extras available, you might as well redeploy them as storm
troopers. There is just a suggestion that this is what happened in the rise
of Nazi Germany, but it does not really fit the rest of the production.
By enlarging the cast list, Stein has diminished the play and also the art
of theatre, which works by suggestion as well as action. A much smaller
crowd, with faces that could be distinguished, would have been far more
menacing - and more menaced.
Martin Benrath's Caesar looks engagingly like Mikhael Gorbachev and there is
a thoroughly tortured Brutus in Thomas Holtzmann. The best moment in the
production is when he finally and reluctantly stabs a Caesar who is coming
to him for support.

Guess the year: it is a Friday in September and the programmes on Britain's
main television channels include Coronation Street, Dad's Army, Alas Smith
And Jones, Bruce Forsyth's Generation Game, What The Papers Say, and
Gardeners' World. No, don't be facetious, there wasn't any television in
1890. The answer, of course, is 1993: the schedule is today's.
As so often in the summer radio is a better bet. That burgeoning broadcaster
Neil Kinnock presents Pick Of The Week on Radio 4 (7.20). Radio 3 provides a
live relay of tonight's BBC Prom in which the Austro-Hungarian Haydn
Orchestra makes its Prom debut. Naturally enough they play a good deal of
Haydn: the chorus from his oratorio 'The Return Of Tobias', the short
cantata 'The Storm', and Symphony No 97 in C (7.30). In Science Now Alun
Lewis reports on the annual meeting of the British Association For The
Advancement Of Science (8.50 Radio 4).
Channel 4 begins another run of Paul Merton - The Series with the star of
'Have I Got News For You' once again installed behind the counter of his
kiosk (10.30).

FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Three hotels - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE HOTELS at the Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn is an import by Jon Robin
Baitz originally written for the American Playhouse series on public
television in America. It is a fine example of what television can give back
to the theatre by enriching its style, and how theatre can take from
television by adopting its acting techniques. There are two actors and three
monologues: it makes compulsive viewing.
The scale of the Tricycle Theatre supports detailed acting. Lindsay Duncan
(GBH) and Peter Egan (Paradise Postponed) who play the married couple in
Three Hotels are fine TV and film performers. The director Jack Gold is also
much more famous in television. Remember the advice to Clint Eastwood:
'Don't just do something, stand there.' Everything is quiet and subtle. They
deliver a pair of fine, focused performances. Their linked monologues have
the same level quality as Alan Bennett's Talking Heads plays for TV in 1987.
The plot settles in three hotels in Tangier, the Virgin Islands and Mexico.
First, Ken Hoyle, Vice President of Iris &amp; Rose, baby formula producers, has
jetted in to Tangier to redeploy the sales force: 'Fire 'em all and start
from scratch.' He looks the part: the button-down shirt, grey suit and red
striped tie make him the American Executive abroad, comfortable on the road:
'I came of age in hotels, I draw comfort from them.' But he has qualms about
selling milk supplements in developing countries: 'How do you go to work
every day when everyone disapproves?'
In the second monologue, Ken's wife, Barbara has just addressed a meeting of
company wives ('They like to be called girls', she confides) about
expatriate life. Getting beyond pancake lessons for the maid, she speaks of
her son's death in Brazil and of her husband's spiritual death: 'Be careful
the company does not turn your husband into something unrecognisable.'
Predictably, in the third monologue, Ken has been fired after Barbara's
outburst to the company wives. But now he is in Mexico, that ideal
alternative America everywhere from Carlos Fuentes to Paul Simon and James
Taylor. It is Ken's honeymoon hotel, his wife has left him, and he is
waiting for her to come back. Here it is easiest to believe that no one,
looking back, wishes they had spent more time in the office.
However, one cavil. The evening exposes a general problem with British
actors using American accents. Another example was on show this week in
another American two-hander, David Mamet's Oleanna (directed by Harold
Pinter at the Oxford Playhouse). Accents seem to come either from Texas or
Brooklyn. The America of Baitz and Mamet has escaped the ear of the dialect
coaches.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Pinnock's tidy Mozart - Prom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS Prom season has played its cards cleverly: the popularity of period
performances has come as a godsend to hard-pressed promoters. The fewer
musicians there are on stage, the more it seems there will be in the
audience.
At the all-Mozart Prom on Wednesday a capacity audience greeted Trevor
Pinnock and his modestly-sized English Concert. This orchestra is larger
than the chamber-sized group that Ton Koopman has brought to London for
Mozart, but Pinnock might still have considered more. First, because the
hungry Royal Albert Hall acoustic devours small bands; and secondly because
we know Mozart performed the 'Paris' Symphony with an orchestral complement
of 56.
Pinnock had 10 less, the shortfall being in the strings. The wind
instruments had to struggle to make themselves heard but brass and timpani
rang out proudly whenever they had a chance. Pinnock's recordings of the
early symphonies had not suggested that he would make such a flamboyant job
of No 31, the 'Paris'.
In the increasingly crowded world of period-instrument conductors Pinnock is
known particularly for light, airy textures, grace, neatness. The English
Concert's opening to the 'Prague' Symphony was scrupulously tidy, but not
much more. Then the main Allegro began, at such a speed that the adrenalin
level could only rise; the finale rocketed along. Pinnock included all the
repeats and finished sooner than conductors in my youth used to without
them.
In between came choral Mozart with the Choir of the English Concert, which
offered neatly clipped diction in the best Pinnock style. Barbara Bonney was
the shining soprano soloist and Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Jamie MacDougall and
Stephen Gadd completed the quartet in the 'Coronation' Mass, a performance
which had spirit but fell short of the joyous punch that this music can
pack.
By chance I caught the encore (the Overture to Figaro) on the car radio,
where the orchestral playing sounded more dramatic by far. As so often
happens in early music Proms, the Radio 3 audience had the best of it.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: Retiring the workhorse - Richard Waters reports
on a uranium producer facing the task of replacing its obsolescent equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US's sole producer of enriched uranium - the fuel which feeds nuclear
power stations - faces one of the classic dilemmas for a technology-based
company.
The US Enrichment Corporation (USEC) produces nearly half of the world's
supply of enriched uranium in two plants which are 40 years old. This old
technology (based on a process known as gas diffusion) is still working
effectively and is in no immediate need of replacement - although
maintenance costs are relatively high. The plants have already been fully
written down, so the company faces no depreciation costs.
Meanwhile, a new generation of technology, known as gas centrifuge, has been
in use by competitors since the mid-1970s. Since gas centrifuge uses far
less power, the fuel produced is generally reckoned to be cheaper on a
marginal-costed basis (though more expensive if the depreciation cost of the
newer plant is added in).
The dilemma: should the USEC scrap its existing plant and make the
multi-billion dollar investment in the next generation of laser-based
technology with which it could leap-frog its competitors? The decision is
complicated by three factors.
First, the world faces a glut of enriched uranium. Only East Asia is
building nuclear power stations at a faster rate than it is retiring them;
the demand for enriched uranium, variously estimated at an annual 30m-35m
swus (separative work units, the standard unit for the fuel), is expected to
rise only marginally over the rest of the decade.
Yet commercial uranium enrichment capacity continues to rise. This reflects
in part a desire by governments to ensure a steady supply of what is in some
countries a strategically important fuel. France, for instance, generates
nearly three quarters of its electricity using nuclear power. In Japan, the
figure is lower, but still significant, at 28 per cent. USEC currently uses
only around two-thirds of the capacity of its two plants.
Adding to this over-supply in the coming years will be fuel which is created
out of old nuclear warheads. The US company is due to receive the 500 tonnes
of weapons-grade uranium which the US has agreed in principle to buy from
Russia. According to some estimates, this uranium would produce enough
commercial-grade fuel to keep all the world's nuclear power stations running
for some eight years.
Weapons-grade material is as high as 97 per cent pure, compared with the 4
per cent purity of the uranium used in nuclear power plants. Breaking down
this highly enriched material is technically far easier than creating
commercial-grade fuel from scratch.
Second, USEC's share of the world market for enriched uranium has fallen
fast in the past decade and may still be shrinking. At the start of the
1980s, it had a monopoly on the process by which the naturally occuring
uranium-235 isotope is 'enriched' to push its concentration up to the 3-5
per cent level at which it can be used in nuclear power plants. Its share of
the annual Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) market for the fuel has now fallen to 46
per cent.
Tim Timbers, an investment banker appointed this year to run the USEC,
blames its falling market share on the fact that, as an arm of the US
Department of Energy, it had not been subjected to commercial disciplines.
The price at which it sells fuel has in the past been published, making it
easy for competitors, he says.
The company has now been given the power to act more commercially. Following
last year's Energy Policy Act, the USEC, which had been an arm of the Energy
Department, was set up as a separate corporation at the beginning of July.
Its brief is to make profits - and it will no longer publish its prices,
says Timbers.
The third complicating factor; the company has been lined up for
privatisation (its Dollars 1.5bn of sales a year will put it among the US's
top 300 companies). Would outside investors put their money into a company
which operates with obsolescent equipment in one of the world's most
technologically advanced industries?
The new technology which could reshape the uranium enrichment process is
based on lasers. Known as atomic vapour laser isotope separation (Avlis), it
would reduce the cost of producing enriched uranium by more than a third,
estimates Timbers.
Others in the industry are more doubtful. Urenco, a joint UK/German/Dutch
company which claims a market share of around 10 per cent, says it has
studied laser enrichment but decided not to proceed with the technique.
'It's extremely complex and difficult - we couldn't see any foreseeable
success,' says the company.
Laser-based technology involves the vapourising of uranium, and then using a
laser to ionise the U-235 atoms in the vapour. The charged atoms can then be
separated from the rest. Enrichment techniques based on lasers have been
under development in the US for 20 years. Only at the end of last year, says
the USEC, did tests establish that the process was practical on a commercial
scale.
Studying the technical and business case for switching technologies is
expected to occupy the company for the rest of this year. Should it decide
to take the leap, plant which has operated since the beginning of the
nuclear age will finally be retired.

FT  03 SEP 93 / People: Manchester Airport picks internal candidate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a Pounds 40,000 trawl round the world by headhunters and a starting
list of 160 potential candidates, Manchester Airport has given the job of
chief executive to Geoff Muirhead, the internal candidate. He will succeed
Sir Gilbert Thompson, the man who spearheaded the airport's explosive recent
growth, who is retiring.
Muirhead, 43, is a civil engineer and currently the airport's director of
development. He was in charge of the new Terminal Two, which was delivered
on time and opened in March. With Manchester the fastest growing airport in
Europe and now approaching a throughput of 15m passengers a year, the job is
regarded as one of the best in the aviation sector. It is also crucial to
northern England, where the airport is proving an important economic
generator.
Muirhead emerged from a short list of three; the other contenders were
Stephen Poster, managing director of Granada's motorway services chain and
hospitality division, and Rod Hoare, managing director of British Airways
regional operations. Poster is understood to have been first choice for the
Pounds 114,000-a-year job, despite his lack of airline or aviation services
management, but turned it down.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: CD films - coming soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of fierce competitors in the consumer electronics industry has
jointly agreed on the basic specifications of a standard-sized compact disc
that contains roughly an hour and a quarter of video and sound.
The new CD will allow most feature-length films to be stored digitally on
two standard CDs.
Philips of the Netherlands, Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial, JVC and
Sony announced in Tokyo that they would co-operate in promoting the new
format, based on an existing sound and pictures CD used for karaoke.
Commodore, the US games computer manufacturer, Samsung and Goldstar of Korea
and JVC have also joined the group.
Philips and Sony co-operated in developing the original audio compact disc,
and most of the companies involved in the new video CD standard have already
signed an agreement on interactive CD, which combines video images, computer
animation and sound in an interactive format for entertainment and games.
But in the marketplace the partners are usually fierce rivals.
Video CD will have roughly the same picture quality as a standard video
cassette and should be on the market in the middle of next year, said the
companies. In common with interactive CDs, video CD uses picture compression
techniques developed by M-Peg, the Moving Picture Experts Group, which was
set up to establish a method of converting pictures into a digital form.
Laserdiscs, another sound and video system, are larger in diameter, use
analogue storage and have a higher picture resolution, 430 lines as against
the 300 lines on the new video CDs. Laserdiscs have proven particularly
popular in Japan, where one in 10 households has a laserdisc player. Unlike
standard video cassettes, neither laserdiscs nor video CD can be used for
making home recordings.
The partners have agreed to use a single logo for the new system to indicate
that it runs on hardware based on the format. Publishers have already
started to use the new format for film, music and education programmes, they
said.

Recent reports on microwave cooking have highlighted the problem of hot
spots - parts of the food can be boiling hot while others remain cold. The
Micromix, developed by Sales Connection Group, of London, stirs the food
during cooking, thereby eliminating the problem.
The gadget has a rigid plastic frame which wedges against the sides of the
oven and from which a spatula is suspended into the bowl of food. A friction
mat between the bowl and the turntable ensures that the bowl turns evenly as
the spatula stirs the food. Sales Connection: UK, 081 902 8800.

Companion Animal Veterinary Associations - has decided to standardise on
chip technology which gives each animal a unique identification code.
The device, developed by the US company Destron, and marketed in the UK by
Animalcare, of York, is a transponder the size of a grain of rice which is
injected into the animal's neck or paw.
When the device is installed the unique number and details of the owner are

The risk of viral transmission, together with a shortage in blood supplies,
has focused attention on the development of human blood substitutes. New
Jersey-based biotechnology company Enzon has now been granted a patent for
its red blood cell substitute which uses bovine (cow) haemoglobin.
The haemoglobin is modified by attaching hair-like strands of the polymer
polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the protein in order to reduce its recognition
by the body's immune system. This PEG-haemoglobin circulates longer in the
body, producing fewer allergic reactions. PEG-haemoglobin also eliminates
the need for blood typing and matching. Enzon: US, 908 980 4500.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: 'Decopier' wipes paper clean - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditional photocopier has contributed more to world deforestation than
most other office machines. Now Japanese manufacturer Ricoh has redressed
the balance with a prototype 'decopier' - technology which removes the toner
from the surface of copied paper.
During the copying process the images are created with toner - resin powder
 -on the surface of the paper. The images are fixed using a hot roller which
melts the resin and applies pressure so that it soaks into the tiny spaces
between the fibres.
The 'decopier' reverses the process, applying a peel-off solution to the
paper to reduce the adhesion. Heat is then applied to fuse the toner while
pressure transfers the molten toner on to the surface of a roller.
The prototype machine can recycle three A4 sheets a minute. Ricoh: Japan, 03

FT  03 SEP 93 / People: Nielsen takes his place in shipping lane
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harland and Wolff, Belfast's famous shipyard which underwent a management
and employee buy-out in 1989, has gained a new chief executive. Per Nielsen,
53, is no stranger to the company, having first joined in 1987.
Danish by birth, Nielsen's career is solidly based in shipbuilding. A
graduate in engineering and a postgraduate in economics, financial control
and electronic data processing, Nielsen (right) was appointed assistant
director of the shipbuilding division at Denmark's Aalborg yard in 1981.
Moving to Harland and Wolff in 1987 he took over as assistant managing
director with control over operations, and became managing director in
September 1989.
Nielsen retains strong links with his home country, though he has lived in
Belfast for the past six years. He is a government-appointed examiner at
Aalborg University and a frequent guest lecturer in strategic planning. A
member of the Danish Naval Architecture University's board and the board of
the Danish Employers' Association, Nielsen also belongs to the Confederation
of British Industry.
Nielsen takes over as chief executive from John Parker (far right), who
first joined the company in 1958 and eventually became chairman and chief
executive in 1983. Parker it was who led the management and employee buy-out
of the company from the state-owned shipyard. He is said to be joining the
board of an international group, the details of which are currently being
kept under wraps.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Management: Business airs a new image - UK companies have
discovered the potential of running their own TV networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clock on the television screen shows 8.15am. An egg is broken into a
frying pan as the credits roll to jaunty music. Smiling presenters on sofas
exchange quips about the cricket score. The familiar run of news snippets,
phone-ins and quizzes begins.
This is breakfast television with a difference. The jugs of orange juice,
the squashy sofas and the relentless cheer are all the same. But the
audience is not a few million casual viewers in their dressing gowns, but a
few hundred suited BMW car salesmen concentrating hard. The questions are
not about show-biz, but about the tax advantages of leasebacks on cars, and
the relative costs of leather upholstery in the latest Rover and Mercedes
models.
Broadcasting information to staff in different locations has been
commonplace in the US for a decade, where there are about 120 private
company networks. But in the UK companies are only slowly discovering the
potential of business television.
BMW, which was among the first to establish its own network in 1990, is
still finding new uses for the medium. Its latest initiative, 'Breakfast
with BMW', was launched this summer to combat the recent decline in sales.
The idea is that salesmen share their hottest sales tips on live television,
and compete with their colleagues to sell more cars and to win a holiday in
Bermuda. The result, according to the BMW 'weatherman' who takes the sales
temperature in different parts of the country, is that the sun is coming out
almost everywhere.
BMW is not the only car company to use television to spread the word to a
far-flung audience. Ford has been broadcasting weekly programmes to around
400 dealers for nearly a year, and more recently Renault has joined the
game.
The car industry has espoused the medium more quickly than others partly
because it is not frightened by technology, but mainly because its success
depends on motivating a loose network of franchised dealers.
However, in the last year large companies in other industries went on the
air for the first time: Texaco, Zeneca and Texas Homecare set up their own
television networks, while Asda launched itself on the radio waves.
These companies hope broadcasting will prove to be a good way of spreading
company news, sales information, product launches and training. According to
Doug Larner of Imagination, which produces programmes for Ford, television
can get across both operational and strategic messages. It is immediate and
involves everyone - it is also flexible, as different people can be talked
to in different voices, he says.
Some companies use their networks as much for international conferences and
meetings as for company news broadcasts. At Zeneca, ICI's pharmaceuticals
offshoot, the satellite link has already reduced the cost of business
travel.
'In the past someone might be out of the office for five days for one day's
meeting in the US and Australia and you'd wonder if they would be fit to
make decisions when they arrived,' says David Burkhill-Howarth of Zeneca.
Business television is also being sold as a means of implementing change
programmes, by communicating boardroom views directly to the workforce.
Pearl Assurance recently borrowed the BMW network to talk to 3,500 salesmen
about the company's new strategic direction in a live programme, followed by
a question-and-answer session in which salesmen could air their views.
Kevin Gavaghan, director of Visage, which makes programmes for both BMW and
Pearl, argues that companies make an enormous effort to communicate with
their customers, but relatively little when it comes to communicating with
staff.
Larner believes that companies tend either to smother staff with information
or not to communicate at all; and for both defects he argues that business
television can be an answer.
When Ford audited its communications three years ago, it found its dealers
were receiving 16,000 pieces of paper every week, 40 per cent of which came
from Ford. Television has replaced some of the paper and has also made it
easier to distinguish between the messages that matter and those which do
not.
But surely the same end could be achieved with video? Television has a magic
that video does not have; and, more importantly, it can transmit messages
immediately. Merrill Lynch found its network in the US paid for itself on
Black Monday 1987 when it was able to issue timely instructions to its
salesforce. Regular television programmes also have their own momentum; each
programme can dip into various subjects without having to tell the whole
thing from beginning to end. Live television has the further advantage in
that it allows the viewer to speak back. Both Ford and BMW have used this to
effect in televising car auctions.
However, one problem with business television is to make sure that people
actually watch the broadcasts. According to Lander, this has been overcome
at Ford. Managers know that vital information may be transmitted at 11am on
Thursday and so they work their diaries around that date. Many even arrange
their management meetings for that time, to be able to discuss the broadcast
afterwards.
The BMW breakfast show solved the problem by getting the presenter to
telephone dealers live to see if they were watching. If they were, they won
the use of a special sports car for the weekend.
Business television is not cheap. To equip each site might cost between
Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 10,000 depending on the quality of the screens,
decoders and satellite dishes, while the air time costs around Pounds 1,500
an hour. While these costs are falling, and will fall further, they are
dwarfed by the main cost, which is producing the programmes.
Visage estimates that each BMW programme costs about Pounds 12,000 on
average to make. Some networks are trying to keep costs down by making the
programmes in house, whereas others fear that unless the programmes have the
professional stamp of an outside production company staff will not take them
seriously.
Many companies are cautious about making the large investment in the
equipment. National Westminster Bank is experimenting with a series of
programmes produced by Imagination every few weeks, but distributed on
video. The videos have a magazine format and include small sections of staff
training and motivation. If they catch on NatWest could be the first
clearing bank on air.
Yet business TV does not suit everyone. Quite apart from the price - which
puts it out of the range of all but the largest companies - it is essential
for audiences to be in the right place at the right time. Business
television experiments for GPs failed because doctors move about too much.
'We are never going to see exponential growth,' says Stuart Baxter of Maxat,
the largest satellite operator. 'Business television is aimed at big,
blue-chip companies. No one is going to create a new budget for it. Instead
they see it as saving money in other areas - communications, travel or
training.'

Are middle managers really obstructive to change?
Nine months ago Ingersoll Engineers, the consulting firm, published a survey
strongly suggesting that they are. It polled top directors of British
manufacturing companies and discovered that 41 per cent found middle
managers resistant, and only 21 per cent believed them supportive.
Now Ingersoll has returned to the same businesses, talked to the
middle-ranking executives themselves, and concluded that there is another
side to the story.
Their apparent truculence stems not, it now seems, from any underlying wish
to oppose change in principle, but from a lack of understanding and from
ineffective, unprofessional, internal communication.
The two surveys show that there is little disagreement between managing
directors and ordinary managers on the need for change and on the priorities
of change programmes.
Both groups lay heavy emphasis on communication and commitment, but
according to managers the communications process itself is often flawed.
The failure, according to the study, appears to lie in what is actually
communicated (the message) and how (the medium). The perception of breakdown
is widespread - with approach, skills and technique all suspect; too often
changes are announced, or initiated with information which is insufficient
or too incomplete for others to be able to understand them.
Communication both upwards and downwards is considered crucial.
'Frequently the downward is there, but the upward falls on deaf ears,'
commented one manager. 'Attempts (to change) without communicating . . .
lead to the suspicion of a hidden agenda,' says another.
'The undeniably good news,' claims Brian Small, Ingersoll Engineers'
managing director, 'is that there are clearly no longer any cultural
barriers to the efficient management of change programmes; the big pitfall
is misunderstanding.
'Communicating a clear plan superlatively well is central to creating the
confidence for successful change.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Management: Time for an action plan - Andrew Baxter stresses
the need for successful product introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE successful introduction of new products is one of the keys to profitable
manufacturing but, for many UK manufacturers, improving the process is still
in its infancy.
This is one of the findings of an updated edition of Manufacturing into the
Late 1990s* - first published in late 1989 - which has been prepared for the
Department of Trade and Industry by Tony Roberts and Mark Smalley at PA
Consulting Group.
The study says recognition of the importance of new product introduction has
continued to grow since the first report was produced. The pool of knowledge
and experience of best practice in this area is now greater - particularly
within leading manufacturers. But Roberts, director of PA's manufacturing
sector, says there is still some way to go.
'Product design often takes years for many engineering-type products,' he
says. 'Some companies have put relatively more effort into 'quick-buck'
initiatives such as changing factory layouts, where you can get benefits in
a few months.'
The complexity of new product introduction means it is less well understood
than other industrial processes. It involves highly-skilled people who are
accustomed to working at their own pace.
'Product design is not deterministic,' Roberts says. 'You cannot predict
that something will take 100 hours to complete. It could be five hours or
five days.'
The study has plenty of advice for managers on how to improve their
manufacturing responses to the challenges in the 1990s. It identifies four
themes. Higher customer expectations. 'Customer power continues to grow and
to compete effectively you must satisfy existing and new customers
profitably.'
Greater business complexity - multi-technologies in the product and the
manufacturing process, a wider product range, customisation and market
niches.
More uncertainty, stemming from a wider range of customers, shorter product
life cycles and more competition. This means greater uncertainty about the
life of products and investment decisions associated with them. Growing
competitive and legislative pressure. 'Legislation such as that concerned
with product liability, health and safety and the environment will place
additional strains on the business.'
The task for manufacturers, says the study, is to 'distil, from all the
external drivers, a competitive strategy based on opportunities, clear
responses to threats and then use your manufacturing capability as a
competitive weapon'.
This is why successful new product introduction is seen as so important.
According to the study key ways to achieve this include getting designers
close to customers; using multi-discipline teams with clear objectives about
delivering the product on time; having the design effort managed by a
product director with clear authority to deliver.
But there are other important ingredients to the manufacturing response.
While many companies feel they have greatly improved factory operations over
the past decade, for many others there is still plenty of scope to reshape
the factory to better serve the needs of the business.
Among the key factors contributing to better factories, the study mentions
selecting flexible, low-inertia processes, ideally suited to the manufacture
of core items and creating flexible factories, with focused units that can
handle mix variations and be reconfigured to cater for short product life
cycles.
While some companies have to try harder, Roberts is encouraged by what has
been happening in manufacturing since the first report. 'There is a much
greater awareness of the need for a strategy - something that makes sense of
all the elements of design and manufacture to produce a competitive and
profitable business,' he says.

FT  03 SEP 93 / House prices up again in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES rose in August according to figures released yesterday by
Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building societies.
The societies differed on the size of the increase. Halifax's seasonally
adjusted figures showed a rise of 0.8 per cent, following a 0.9 per cent
increase in July.
Nationwide, which does not make seasonal adjustments to its figures,
reported a fractional increase of 0.1 per cent after a 0.7 per cent rise the
previous month. Both indices showed that prices were still lower - by just
over 2 per cent - last month compared with August 1992.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'House prices have
increased every month since February and this seems to confirm the general
trend towards greater stability and confidence in the market. Even in
August, a traditionally quiet holiday month, we have seen the gradual
strengthening of the market maintained.' Nationwide expects house prices to
have shown a 'modest' increase by the end of the year compared with the end
of 1992.
Halifax is also cautiously optimistic but it warns that there may yet be
month-on-month falls, repeating a pattern traced by its index in the year to
date. The society reported price falls in the first two months of the year
and then again in May and June.
Halifax said: 'The overall trend in house prices during 1993 has been flat
and the likelihood is that prices will end the year slightly above their
level at the beginning of the year.'
Halifax said prices had fallen by 2.3 per cent in the past 12 months. But it
expects prices to show annual increases within the next few months as the
sharp monthly falls which occurred in September and October last year are
overtaken in annual comparisons.

FT  03 SEP 93 / The sun also rises in Colindale: Neil Buckley finds
philosophy at the heart of Europe's first Japanese shopping mall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not just a range of products from octopus tempura to kimonos that sets
apart the Yaohan Plaza, the first Japanese shopping centre in Europe, from
home-grown competitors.
For the Yaohan Corporation, creators of the Pounds 50m centre which
officially opens today in the somewhat unlikely location of Colindale,
north-west London, claims its business is underpinned by philosophical
teachings.
Mr Kazuo Wada, its chairman, is an adherent of Seicho no ie, or the Human
Enlightenment Movement which espouses beliefs combining elements of
Buddhism, Christianity and Shintoism, and emphasises the infinite potential
of people if they co-operate to create harmony. Yaohan's mission is 'to
serve customers all over the world with gratitude'.
It is certainly aiming to serve the shoppers of north London with products
they may never have seen before.
One part of the complex is a 60,000 sq ft retail development (the size of
the biggest UK food superstores) operated by Yaohan, including a complete
Japanese supermarket, and a 200-seat oriental food court selling everying
from sushi to Chinese dim sum.
For UK customers not sure what to do with miso (fermented bean paste, used
for soups or flavouring), wasabi (strong Japanese horseradish) or daikon
(large white radishes), there are recipe cards in English, and regular
classes in Japanese cuisine.
About 70 per cent of goods will be imported from Japan, although some
Japanese vegetables may be grown in Europe.
The other part of the complex is a 82,000 sq ft mall with units rented out
to tenants including Japanese bookshops, travel agencies, a beauty parlour
and an optician's, a London-Tokyo property agency and the UK's biggest
computer game centre, operated by Sega.
Yaohan's main target is London's 30,000-strong Japanese population. Mr
Toshio Tajima, UK managing director, says research has shown there are
10,000 Japanese families in its target area, each spending about Pounds
3,000 a year on their groceries.
Yaohan aims to pick up 50 per cent of that spending in its supermarket -
Pounds 15m a year. It also expects to pick up a fifth of the estimated
Pounds 30m spent on groceries by London's other Asian and Far Eastern
communities, or Pounds 6m.
The shopping mall is forecast to have an annual turnover of Pounds 19m,
making Pounds 40m for the whole complex.
The company hopes to attract not just the oriental population. 'We do see
ourselves as ambassadors,' Mr Tajima says. 'We want to introduce Japanese
culture to local residents - starting with food.'
Yaohan began in 1930, supplying hotels in the resort town of Atami, near
Tokyo. It started retailing in 1956 but decided in the early 1970s that high
opening costs and intense competition in Japan made it sensible to look
abroad.
A successful Yaohan store in Singapore in 1974 became the foundation to
create the biggest store chain in south-east Asia. It also operates stores
in the US.
If London is successful, it hopes soon to persuade French customers to swap
their crepes for okonomiyaki in Paris, and Germans to swap bratwurst for
sashimi in Dusseldorf.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Cellnet cuts rates to hold off rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CELLNET, the mobile phone operator, will slash its tariffs in the London
area from next month in a bid to contain competition from Vodafone and
One-2-One, the new cellular network about to be launched by Mercury
Communications and US West.
Cellnet intends to cut the price of calls made in the London area by up to
39 per cent for cellular users who sign up for a new tariff package called
'Citytime'. This will offer cheaper calls in the M25 area in return for a
large premium on calls made outside the zone.
One-2-One's service will initially be available only within the M25 area.
Although Cellnet's 'Citytime' call tariff, even after the reductions, will
still be higher than One-2-One's (20p a minute against 16p a minute), the
far lower cost of handsets for the Cellnet system (about Pounds 100 against
Pounds 250-Pounds 300) will make it an attractive option.
Vodafone's 'MetroDigital' service, to be launched in most conurbations next
month, also offers a 20p a minute peak-rate tariff, but handsets will
initially cost about Pounds 400.
The connection charge for 'Citytime' will be Pounds 50 and the monthly
subscription Pounds 20, a reduction of Pounds 5 on the standard tariff.
Calls made by 'Citytime' users outside the M25 area will be charged at 50p a
minute.
Cellnet's standard 'Primetime' tariff will continue, mainly for non-London
users. But the London premium on 'Primetime' will be abolished, making a
national peak-rate tariff of 25p. Vodafone has already discarded the London
premium on its analogue business network.
Cellnet is also cutting tariffs on its low-usage 'Lifetime' service. Monthly
subscriptions will fall from Pounds 15 to Pounds 12.77 and the peak-rate
tariff from 50p a minute to 42.5p.
The new tariffs will give further impetus to an industry that is booming.
Last month Vodafone and Cellnet, a BT and Securicor joint venture, gained
four times as many new subscribers to their networks as in July of last
year, taking the number of UK cellular subscribers to more than 1.6m.
Analysts forecast that the number will rise to about 5m by the year 2000. By
then cellular phones will have made a significant impact on the largely
untapped consumer market.
Vodafone and One-2-One said they would study Cellnet's tariffs before
deciding whether to respond with further cuts.
Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet's managing director, said: 'Our research shows
that many London-based customers make the majority of their calls within the
M25 but that they regularly travel outside the area and do not want the
constraint of a purely regional service.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Labour challenges Patten to oppose VAT 'on learning'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday stepped up its efforts to exploit the government's
budgetary difficulties by challenging Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, to speak out against the extension of value added tax to books
and children's clothes.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the extension of VAT to
books and journals would cost English universities more than Pounds 11m a
year and reduce sales of children's books.
'VAT on books and journals would be a wicked tax on learning, a punitive
measure, at the very time that we need to be making it easier for people to
obtain reading matter,' she said.
'Earlier this year John Patten told parents to read to their children each
day. I challenge him to follow that up now by stating clearly his opposition
to an increase in the price of books.'
Mrs Taylor said ministers were preparing to widen the VAT net in the
November Budget as part of the government's drive to reduce its Pounds 50bn
budget deficit.
Labour's campaign is intended to embarrass the government by drawing
attention to its manifesto promise not to extend VAT. This was broken in the
last Budget when VAT was imposed on heating fuel.
The opposition also hopes to encourage Conservative councillors to oppose
further extensions of VAT.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will not decide whether to increase
indirect taxes until nearer the Budget. However, books and children's
clothing are regarded as unlikely targets.
Labour's attack on VAT is part of a wider campaign to force the government
to focus revenue-raising efforts on eliminating tax breaks such as UK
residence trusts and private health insurance.
Mrs Harriet Harman, a Labour economics spokeswoman, said: 'The government
has chosen to ignore all these things, which would have made the taxation
system fairer and closed these loopholes.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Receiverships still on 'downward trend' despite August rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of businesses going into receivership rose for the third
successive month in August, but remains well down on the same month a year
ago, figures released yesterday by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, show.
There were 252 administration orders and receivership appointments in
August, compared with 321 in the same month last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, insolvency partner at Touche Ross, said the
underlying trend in receiverships was downward. The slight rise last month
was 'entirely due to the increased number of multi-company group failures,
such as the 14 companies in the Dunkfield Clothing Group, most of which were
actually non-trading subsidiaries'.
Regionally, the lowest rate of appointments in August was in the south-west,
with eight appointments, and Wales with two. Failure rates in the Yorkshire
and Humberside region and the north-west were worse than average.
The building and construction sector continues to improve with the month's
figures showing a 40 per cent fall compared with the same month a year ago.
The longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights turning
points in economic activity about 10 months in advance, has flattened in
recent months after rising strongly towards the end of last year.
In July it was virtually unchanged on the previous month with a rise in
share prices broadly offsetting a lower balance on the Confederation of
British Industry's survey of business optimism.
The coincident index, which moves in line with the business cycle, has
maintained steady increases since the spring of 1992, the trough of the
recession.
The Central Statistical Office said the shorter leading indicator, which
highlights turning points four months in advance, has risen since last
autumn.
In July, falls in new car registrations and lower expectations of stock
changes reported in the CBI industrial trends survey broadly offset higher
CBI reports of new orders.
Gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 58m (Pounds 39.1m)
last month, the Treasury reported yesterday.
The dollar value of the existing amount outstanding under the
Ecu-denominated revolving credit facility fell by Dollars 55m as a result of
changes in exchange rates, the Treasury said.
Proceeds from this month's tender of the Ecu Treasury bills amounted to
Dollars 1.165bn while maturing bills totalled Dollars 1.276bn. Total
reserves at the end of the month were Dollars 43.16bn.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Consumer spending rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SPENDING BY consumers
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
particularly on leisure and travel - appears to have increased more strongly
last year than previously believed.
The latest annual survey of family expenditure by the Central Statistical
Office finds that spending by the average household grew by 5.8 per cent to
Pounds 271.83 a week, faster than the 3.7 per cent rise in the retail prices
index last year.
The increase, which follows a 1 per cent drop in the real value of household
spending in 1991, far outstripped the 1.4 per cent growth in average gross
family income to Pounds 343 per week last year. In 1991, family income rose
4.8 per cent.
The fastest growth in spending last year was for fares and travel, which
increased 29 per cent to Pounds 7.20 a week. Some of that may have been due
to higher public transport charges.
The next largest rise, 24 per cent, was for leisure services such as
holidays, hotels, sports events and theatres, on which the average household
spent Pounds 27.56 a week.
However, spending on cinema admissions stagnated, apparently reflecting the
continued growth in the popularity of home video entertainment.
The proportion of households receiving cable television increased to 9 per
cent from 6 per cent in 1991, while 69 per cent own video recorders, up from
65 per cent. Home computer ownership rose slightly to almost one-in-five
households.
But the survey found evidence of cutbacks on other types of non-essential
spending, often by more affluent families.
Households with weekly incomes of more than Pounds 800 - the wealthiest 10
per cent of the population - reduced their alcoholic drinks bill from Pounds
27.99 to Pounds 25.72 a week.
The wealthiest families also spent slightly less last year on household
services such as insurance, telephones, domestic help and laundry. But
spending on these items by other income groups was higher than in 1991 and
more than doubled in the poorest households.
Motoring was another target of economies. Though average motoring
expenditure rose, slightly fewer households reported owning a car.
The number of households with second homes also fell slightly from the
previous year.
By contrast, spending on household goods, notably furniture and soft
furnishings, rose sharply in both the highest and the lowest income groups.
The average household also appears to have become more generous, making
Pounds 7.37 a week in charitable and other donations, twice the 1991 level.
Perhaps that was because some did better on the football pools, which paid
out 4p for every 58p received - slightly better odds than the previous year.
Though households spent only 80p a week to repay debt, their average weekly
savings and investments rose to Pounds 6.18 from Pounds 4.49.
The only big item showing a fall in overall spending was housing. However,
the CSO said last year's figures were not comparable with those for 1991
because it had changed its method of calculating housing expenditure.
Average weekly household expenditure ranged from Pounds 334 in south-east
England to Pounds 235 in the north.
The survey was based on a sample of more than 7,000 households in all parts
of the country. The CSO cautioned that sampling error meant that the
accuracy of its figures for different categories of spending varied
considerably.

FT  03 SEP 93 / 5m workers exceed 48 hours a week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 5m people, one fifth of all men and women in employment, work more
than 48 hours a week, according to research published yesterday.
This ranks the UK third, after Greece and Ireland, in an European Community
league table according to a report in the Employment Gazette, the official
publication of the Department of Employment.
The department is fighting, in the European Court, the proposed EC
working-time directive which proposes that employees work a maximum of 48
hours a week, with a statutory minimum paid annual holiday entitlement.
The research shows that in all EC countries, except the UK, the majority of
those working more than 48 hours are self-employed or work for their
families.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Salaries 'less important'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INCOME of the average family increasingly depends less on full-time
salaried employment and more on a variety of other private and government
sources, the survey says.
In the past 20 years wages and salaries have fallen from more than
three-quarters to less than two-thirds of total family income, while income
from self-employment has grown from 6.2 per cent to 8.6 per cent of the
total.
Self-employment is most common in the most affluent households. In more than
16 per cent of the sample of families with weekly gross incomes exceeding
Pounds 800, the head of household was self-employed.
The importance of investment income has more than doubled in the past 20
years to 6 per cent of the total. The CSO says this is due partly to the
spread of share ownership. The trend also reflects an ageing population. A
quarter of all households surveyed consisted of retired people, and 5.7 per
of total income was pensions and annuities - more than double the proportion
20 years ago.
Although the contribution from social security, at 13.1 per cent, was higher
than in 1972, it is slightly lower than a decade ago.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Tory constituency heads give Fowler a warm welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS early days yet. But if yesterday's enthusiastic reception in
Manchester and Liverpool is repeated elsewhere, then Sir Norman Fowler's
tour of Conservative constituency associations has the makings of a rare
central office success.
A sprinkling of the 60 or so constituency heads who attended yesterday's two
meetings appeared thrilled to bits that the Tory party chairman had taken
the trouble to consult them about their views.
The only hiccup was the hotter than expected weather. 'It is rather warm up
here,' said Mr James Fuke, a regional campaign executive, confiding that
those meeting Sir Norman over tea in west Derby had their jackets off and
'none of the ladies are wearing hats'.
Sir Norman has earmarked much of the next two weeks for what has been billed
as a morale-boosting tour of Tory constituency associations in England and
Wales.
Part of the purpose is to explain what lies behind the sweeping changes in
the party's central organisation that have been set in train over recent
months and to explain aspects of strategy ahead of next year's local and
European parliamentary elections.
But the greater part of the gatherings will be devoted to listening to local
grievances after what is acknowledged to have been a tough year for the
party. Sir Norman's introductory speech to yesterday's meetings  - in a
region where the Tory vote held up well in the last general election -
lasted just 15 minutes.
Constituency heads yesterday were reluctant to go into the detail of what
was discussed but agreed his performance had been impressive.
'We all went away in good heart,' said Mr John Longworth, chairman of the
Altrincham and Sale constituency. 'We had an excellent exchange of views
both ways.'
Ms Lynn Pratt, head of Bury North, said Sir Norman had been 'very willing'
to listen to ideas in what was a 'positive, frank and open' discussion.
According to Mr Fuke, officials expressed 'a cross-section of views' on
whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should impose further tax
increases in November as part of the government's drive to reduce the public
sector deficit, or concentrate on cutting spending.

RECESSION IN Europe has not dented the confidence of British exporters, a
survey disclosed yesterday.
Two-thirds of exporters are optimistic about prospects for business over the
next 12 months and 81 per cent described their order books as either good or
very good, according to Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance group.
The quarterly survey of UK Export Business Prospects, carried out last
month, shows that almost 50 per cent of respondents have increased the
numbers of export customers since the last quarter, while 63 per cent said
sales inquiries had increased over the last quarter.
The findings contrast with the latest news from the Confederation of British
Industry. Its August survey of industrial trends found that export order
books weakened over the summer. It concluded that modest growth in the US
and Japan would be insufficient to mitigate the impact of recession in
Europe on UK exporters.
Trade Indemnity said Middle East, Asian and North American markets were more
buoyant in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter. EC
and other European markets were more sluggish in the latest three months.
The survey showed that exporters fear a rise in bad debt and customer
default in Europe.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Media organisations' reaction to Rupert Murdoch's announcement on Wednesday
of BSkyB's expansion, which involves subscribing to a package of up to 18
satellite TV channels:
The Sun proclaimed on its front page, 'SKY ON A HIGH'. An inside report,
headlined 'Skies of Freedom', quoted without additional comment from Mr
Murdoch's speech. Its choice quote was: 'Today is the first day of a new age
in satellite television.'
Today had a small piece on page nine with the headline 'New Age for TV
viewing'. It reported: 'He threw down the gauntlet to TV chiefs claiming
that 10m UK homes will have satellite TV by the year 2000 . . . insiders
believe advertisers could transfer up to Pounds 50m of business.'
The Times on its front page referred to Mr Murdoch's 'vision of a world in
which national and class barriers are broken down by technological advances
. . .' A second report said: 'At the heart of both the BT agreement and a
batch of others revealed in Mr Murdoch's Banqueting Hall speech last night
is the development of what President Clinton has called the 'digital super
highway of the future'.
On Sky News, a Murdoch TV channel, reporter Alex Crawford said: 'This is
what the industry's been holding its breath for. Rupert Murdoch plans to
shake up the industry like never before . . . The audience was taken through
the whole gamut of his dreams.'
In the ninth item on BBC's Nine O Clock News reporter Nick Higham spoke of
'Rupert Murdoch's ambitious plans to develop his global media empire that
now spans four continents . . . In Britain Mr Murdoch means to stay at the
forefront of satellite television even though he says that media moguls like
himself have very little real power.'
The Daily Telegraph said: 'Yesterday's floorshow - with cowgirls, celebrity
lookalikes and a worrying live boa constrictor - was for the benefit of
journalists and advertisers.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Insurers' database targets illegal claimants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS ARE developing a market-wide database in a bid to track down
illegal claimants whose activities cost the industry about Pounds 400m a
year.
The Association of British Insurers said yesterday that the UK's leading
composite insurers had agreed to support the development of the database,
which will contain extensive details of both proposal forms and claims
submitted by policyholders.
It is intended to launch the scheme by collecting information on household
contents insurance next year, extending to motor insurance by the end of
1994 and subsequently to holiday and creditor policies.
'This is an enormous commitment by the industry,' the association said,
adding that the total cost of the new development could run into millions of
pounds. The ABI has contracted Equifax, a software specialist, to do the
work on the database.
The development will also help the industry answer its critics at the
Consumers' Association, who allege it is not doing enough to combat fraud
and is penalising its customers with steep rate increases to compensate for
past losses, partly because of its own mistakes.
Describing the criticisms as 'nonsense', the association said that insurers
did 'not calculate premiums on the basis of past mistakes'.
The association added that the rates at which claims from subsidence and
theft had increased since 1987, had outstripped the rate of premium
increases.
Figures released yesterday, however, show that the rate of claims incurred
by companies is beginning to tail off. Theft claims fell to Pounds 511.5m in
the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 550.2m in the same period of
last year.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said policyholders
should benefit through 'greater stability of premiums' if the trend
continues in the second half of this year.
'The industry is gradually returning to profitability but rates of return on
capital remain low and there is need for reserves to build up again ready
for unforeseen and unexpected disasters,' said Mr Boleat.
Home theft claims amounted to Pounds 389m, up 10.2 per cent on the second
half of 1992, but down 1.9 per cent compared with the first half of 1992.
The average home burglary claim was for Pounds 900, a rise of 1.5 per cent
compared with the first half of 1992. Fire claims in homes totalled Pounds
114m, 7.5 per cent up on the second half of 1992 but 12.5 per cent down on
the first half of last year.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Murdoch rails at critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, last night responded to a
bitter attack by The Independent newspaper on his plan to cut the price of
The Times to 30p on weekdays.
The Independent changed its front page yesterday to accuse Mr Murdoch of
trying to 'drive this newspaper, The Independent, and The Independent on
Sunday out of business'.
The editorial adds: 'Without any new editorial ideas and without any belief
in The Times as a newspaper, Murdoch has decided to crush his nearest rival
with the power of money.'
The paper said that Mr Murdoch knew the Independent was at 'a turning point'
with advertising starting to pick up after three years of recession.
Mr Murdoch said last night: 'I think it's a bit rich of Andreas Whittam
Smith (The Independent's founder), particularly when he was only able to
launch his paper because of what we did at Wapping. He also closed the
Sunday Correspondent and tried to do the same to The Observer.'
There was also a hostile reaction to The Times price cut plan from other
broadsheet rivals yesterday.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph group, described the
decision as 'the last gasp of a failed editorial policy. The paper has had
five editors since 1991'.
The Daily Telegraph, 48p during the week, would not be responding to the
price cut and would continue, Mr Cooke said, to develop the editorial
quality of the paper and charge the right price for it.
The Guardian declined to comment but it is thought unlikely that it will cut
its 45p cover price. The Financial Times will remain at 65p.
The two main middle market papers - The Daily Mail and the Daily Express -
will now be 2p more expensive than The Times.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Security groups plan prison bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by Michael Howard, home secretary, that the management of a
further 10 prisons is to be contracted out to the private sector won
widespread plaudits yesterday from companies hoping to win a share of the
new business.
Three contracts have so far been put out to tender, with one - for
Strangeways prison in Manchester - being won by the in-house team. That
means that only two prisons are currently managed by the private sector.
The new privatisations were regarded as long overdue by businesses that have
invested significant resources in building up capacity to run prisons and
prison escort services.
Group 4 is spending Pounds 900,000 a year on maintaining a development team
to bid for contracts, according to Mr Jim Harrower, the UK chief executive.
So far the private security company has won the contracts to run the Wolds
remand prison on Humberside and to provide prison escort services in the
east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside.
The company gained notoriety earlier this year after four of its customers
escaped during the first days of the prison escort contract.
Group 4 has done much to prepare for the new prison work. It has recruited
high-ranking staff from the public sector to manage its operations,
including Mr Charles Erickson, a senior executive from the Home Office, Mr
Walter MacGowan, a former governor of Strangeways, and Mr Michael Hirst,
former chief constable of Leicestershire.
The other company running a British prison is UK Detention Services, which
has been managing Blakenhurst, a new medium-security local prison in
Hereford and Worcester, since May. UKDS is a consortium formed by two
construction companies, Sir Robert MacAlpine and John Mowlem, and the
Corrections Corporation of America, the largest provider of private prison
services in the US.
Mr Roger Sainsbury of Mowlem welcomed yesterday's announcement by the home
secretary that the design and building of two future prisons would be put
out to tender with the management.
Another company hoping to win a share of the new contracts is ManCare, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the French company Sodexho, which runs five
prisons in France. ManCare was formed in March to bid for private prison
work in the UK.
Its director of prisons is Mr Roger Kendrick, who served as governor of
several prisons in the UK, including Brixton, Dartmoor and Pentonville. He
was director of security and operations in Northern Ireland during the
1980s.
Securicor, the private security company, plans to form a consortium with a
construction company and merchant bank to bid for contracts to finance,
build and manage prisons.
Construction companies such as Wimpey and Tarmac also said they would be
interested in bidding for the contracts to build future privatised prisons.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Key unions reject TUC's peace formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a bitter row at next week's Trades Union Congress grew closer
yesterday after two unions rejected a peace formula.
This would have smoothed the return of the expelled electricians into the
TUC as part of the AEEU engineering union.
Both the Ucatt construction union and the TGWU general union voted at
yesterday's TUC general council against the plan to deal with alleged union
poaching of construction members. The council had previously endorsed the
plan by 25 votes to 12.
The AEEU executive council agreed yesterday by 12 votes to 8 to accept the
TUC plan. Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said it was 'a step forward for
trade union unity'.
Under the deal, the AEEU has given the TUC an unconditional guarantee to
abide by its rules and procedures; agreed to settle outstanding issues
through TUC conciliation; and accepted all the TUC dispute awards rejected
by the electricians six years ago when they were expelled.
The final decision on whether to accept the formula for their return will
rest with the delegates at the congress. Even if the TUC votes to accept the
electricians, the AEEU must still obtain a 75 per cent majority of its
executive council in order to change its own affiliation rules.
The hardest part of the plan concerns construction. The TUC has told the
AEEU that it must stop recruiting or seeking recognition from employers in
building and civil engineering without consultation with other unions in the
industry.
Ucatt and the TGWU are concerned that under the plan the AEEU will not have
to disband its construction section. Mr John Monks, the TUC's incoming
general secretary, yesterday denied the proposed peace plan could breach the
new employment law.
However, from November 30 individual workers will be legally entitled to
decide which union they want to join. It will be illegal for unions to deny
membership unless their rule books explicitly limit recruitment to
particular sectors.
Employers are still negotiating recognition agreements with unions for
collective bargaining despite the increasingly hostile climate towards trade
unionism, according to a study published today in Labour Research magazine.
A survey among 13 of some of the largest unions shows they have signed 103
such agreements since 1988. These brought nearly 18,500 workers into
recognised trade unions. Forty-two of these, covering 11,320 workers, have
been reached in the past two years.
Over the same period 100,000 workers in 310 companies have lost
representation.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Greenpeace takes on the Goliaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MORNING Greenpeace, the pressure group, will ask the Court of Appeal to
halt radioactive tests at the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria
until September 14, when the High Court will judge whether the tests are
legal.
In a separate action, Greenpeace has taken ICI, the chemicals group, to
court for water pollution. Yesterday that case was adjourned until later in
the month for Greenpeace to assemble more laboratory evidence. The group
regards the ICI action as a test case on water regulation and says that if
it is successful more prosecutions of chemical companies may follow.
The two highly-publicised cases mark a new policy by one of Britain's
largest environmental pressure groups to bring legal actions itself, rather
than wait for government regulatory authorities to do so. Those watching
this drama of David and Goliath may wonder, however, how Greenpeace is
financing the its campaigning strategy.
Its financial muscle has startled some court observers. On Wednesday it told
the court that it would compensate British Nuclear Fuels - possibly several
hundred thousand pounds, on BNF's estimates - if the tests were delayed
until today. The offer was turned down, but it raised questions about the
group's finances.
The answer, according to Lord Peter Melchett, executive director of
Greenpeace UK, is that annual revenue from subscriptions, contributions and
merchandise accommodates the cost of lawyers and research. Although revenue
has suffered from the recession, Greenpeace UK's income in 1992 was Pounds
4.1m net of fund-raising expenses, compared with Pounds 3.8m in 1991.
Greenpeace says that legal costs have been small so far , partly because it
uses an in-house lawyer. Lord Melchett acknowledges however, that 'it's
expensive if you lose'. So far Greenpeace has not lost big cases. But it is
defending a libel action by Rechem, the waste treatment company.
The companies on its target list must wonder whether a court setback could
hamper its ability to bring more prosecutions.

Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, is funding a high profile
campaign against the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, Bronwen
Maddox writes.
The Goldsmith Foundation, controlled by Sir James, has paid for an Pounds
18,000 balloon, in the shape of a white elephant.
It has also put up the finance for the campaign run by WBMG, the
environmental communications group.
Sir James' office said last night that the financier confirmed 'that he has
been funding groups opposed to nuclear power over a number of years and has
been helping groups opposed to Thorp'.
WBMG, whose directors include Mr Pete Wilkinson, former director of
Greenpeace UK, and Mr David Gee, former director of Friends of the Earth,
said yesterday that it 'couldn't deny' the contribution from the Goldsmith
Foundation.
According to Mr Wilkinson, WBMG wants to spread debate about whether Thorp
should be licenced to start operation beyond the 'green' movement.
'We are putting both sides of the argument before the public - the balloon
is a floating question mark' he said.
The elephant, which has been floating over Wiltshire and Kent, will tour up
to October 4, when the current public consultation on Thorp ends.

FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Some
support for broader A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, minister for science, told the British Association he
was sympathetic to the idea of broadening A-levels, Clive Cookson writes.
This would allow candidates to study five or six subjects, including at
least one science, instead of the normal three.
Last month's A-level results disturbed scientists by showing a sharp fall in
those taking science and mathematics.
Mr Waldegrave added, however, that there would be no point in diluting
A-level courses to make room for an extra science subject if it meant having
to add another year to university courses to compensate.
As part of the government's campaign to increase public understanding of
science, Mr Waldegrave announced yesterday a Pounds 265,000 grant for the
British Association to work with the Gatsby Foundation (a charitable arm of
the Sainsbury family) on setting up a network of regional co-ordinators.
Their job will be to 'promote and publicise existing public understanding
activities, and to encourage and develop new ideas'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Trials
on malaria drug show promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BITE of iron may be the answer to drug-resistant malaria, the British
Association meeting heard yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
Professor Robert Hider of King's College, London, described an experimental
new class of anti-malarial drugs called 'iron chelators'. They work by
biting the iron atom out of a vital enzyme in the malaria parasite.
One candidate drug developed by Prof Hider and colleagues has undergone
successful animal trials and is being tested for toxicity before human
trials begin.
Malaria is becoming a more serious health problem worldwide as the parasite
evolves to resist existing drugs. More than 100m people are affected every
year and an estimated 2m die, making malaria the world's second-biggest
infectious killer after tuberculosis.
'A new strategy is needed urgently,' Prof Hider said. His candidate drug
could be taken by mouth for a relatively short period after infection.
It is a simple chemical and, if clinical trials are successful, it could
probably be produced cheaply for use in poorer tropical countries.

of traffic curbs doubted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM measures to reduce urban pollution by restricting traffic have
little or no effect on levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is blamed for the
rapid rise in asthma cases.
During the London smog of December 1991 people were asked not to make
unnecessary journeys. But Mr Derek Elsom, reader in geography at Oxford
Brookes University, said this type of restriction does little to reduce the
pollutant because the limiting factor is ozone, which is at much lower
levels than nitrogen oxides.

THERE ARE a range of new dentistry materials for filling teeth, but although
most of them look better they do not stick well enough to replace
old-fashioned amalgam.
Dr Tim Watson, of Guy's Hospital, London, is carrying out microscopic
investigations of the interface between the filling and the tooth, to trace
the distribution of adhesive components within the tooth. 'This will enable
us to design better materials, and improve cavity preparation to make
fillings last longer,' he said.

FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Bubbly
inspires easy explanation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS can make laymen understand 'unexplainable' physics theories, Mr
William Waldegrave, the classically educated minister for science, proved
yesterday. What helped convince him was an analogy based on Lady Thatcher.
Last April Mr Waldegrave offered a bottle of champagne for the best
explanation of the significance of the Higgs boson in lay terms on a single
side of paper.
The Higgs boson is an elementary particle, which plays a key role in
theories about the structure of matter and the origins of the universe.
Physicists want to spend billions of pounds to prove its existence by
building a new generation of atom smashers.
Yesterday, at the British Association meeting at Keele, Mr Waldegrave
awarded bottles of champagne to five winners - all professional physicists -
from 117 entrants.
The most imaginative winner was Mr David Miller of University College,
Lon-don, who put forward a 'quasi-political explanation'.
'Imagine a cocktail party of political party workers who are uniformly
distributed across the floor, all talking to their nearest neighbours,' Mr
Miller begins. 'The ex-prime minister enters and crosses the room. All the
workers in her neighbourhood are strongly attracted to her and cluster round
her . . . '
The Higgs boson would, in short, provide the mechanism by which particles
acquire mass.
His explanation moved Mr Waldegrave to remark: 'It happens with present
prime ministers, too.'
He added: 'Now I see why it's (the Higgs boson) important.' The competition
had made him more sympathetic to plans to build a new atom smasher at CERN,
the European nuclear research centre near Geneva, Switzerland.
Although he could not guarantee that the UK and other members of CERN would
provide the funds, 'if we cannot find the money - and that's going to be
hard pounding - I will recognise it as a loss'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Firefighters set to hold strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRE BRIGADE union moved nearer industrial action by its 50,000 members
yesterday when its delegate conference overwhelmingly rejected a 1.5 per
cent pay offer from local government employers.
Mr Ken Cameron, the union's general-secretary, said that if the employers
did not honour the 15-year-old fire-fighter's pay formula that links their
pay to the upper quartile of male manual workers' earnings then a strike
ballot would be called. The two sides are due to meet on September 24.
The employers have told the union it will honour the pay formula in 1994 but
cannot do so this year because they must abide by the government's 1.5 per
cent public sector pay limit that expires in November.
However Mr Cameron said: 'We are not interested in jam tomorrow while our
pay agreement is unilaterally ripped up today.'
Delegates at yesterday's conference rejected the 1.5 per cent offer from
employers by 37,563 votes to 4,994. A minority of delegates were keen to
hold a strike ballot at once.
Mr Cameron said that if the September meeting failed to achieve what the
union wanted, a strike ballot of the members would be called three days
later. The result of a ballot would be announced on November 1. If the vote
is for industrial conflict this would start after the seven-day legal
cooling off period.
Union leaders will meet Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, on October 13
to express their concerns.
Employers yesterday pointed out that for this year alone there might be a
'small difference' between what the formula said and what the authorities
can pay.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Declining US surplus fuels Nafta debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE declining US trade surplus with Mexico has become a significant element
of the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US,
Mexico and Canada.
Last year the US manufacturing trade surplus to Mexico rose to Dollars
7.5bn, a feat President Bill Clinton and other Nafta proponents cite as
proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs. But
the growth of US sales to Mexico is slowing. The trade surplus has declined
from Dollars 380m in January to Dollars 120m in June as Mexico sinks towards
recession.
To Ms Thea Lee, an economist in the labour-supported Economic Policy
Institute, the trend is 'going the way we predicted; exports are rising but
imports are rising faster'. Ultimately, she contends, the trade surplus will
be in Mexico's favour, and the US will lose 550,000 jobs.
Mr Manuel Suarez-Mier, a visiting fellow at the Georgetown School of
Business Administration, believes nervousness over Nafta's prospects in
Congress has contributed to the the stagnant trade picture. The slowdown in
the Mexican economy is a consequence of high interest rates, in place partly
to control inflation and partly to offset the 'Nafta jitters'.
But powerful Nafta opponents - followers of Mr Ross Perot, the populist
billionaire, labour and many environmentalists - paint a depressing picture
of the US-Mexican trade relationship. In his new anti-Nafta book, Mr Perot
points out that Dollars 15.5bn of last year's Dollars 40.6bn US exports to
Mexico was capital goods. This, he asserts to the uninitiated, means
factories. He labels 'a myth' the administration's contention that Nafta
will create a lucrative new market.
At the Commerce Department's Mexico Office, where US-Mexico trade is
analysed, the US trade surplus slowdown is seen as 'a temporary pause', due
to slower growth in the Mexican economy.
What has been growing are sales of consumer goods. Giant US retailers are
undergoing an 'enormous expansion' and helping to renovate Mexico's retail
sector. The average Japanese last year spent Dollars 47 on US consumer
products. The average Mexican spent Dollars 49 - spurring sales of US-made
textiles, clothing, carpets, furniture and sporting goods.

US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor yesterday launched an offensive to

rebuttal of assertions in an anti-Nafta book released last week by Mr Ross

opponents of favouring the 'status quo,' which has cost the US jobs by
forcing US companies to move to Mexico to sell their goods.
As Congress returns next week, the administration is seeking votes for
Nafta, but has so far won only a minority of its own Democratic party.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN Air Lines is to take a 10 per cent stake in a Pounds 21m aircraft
servicing plant being built in China, to which it will move some maintenance
work in an attempt to reduce labour costs.
The Taeko servicing plant project was established in June and will become
operational in 1996. It is 51 per cent owned by Hong Kong Aircraft
Maintenance, which does work for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline.
JAL said it intended to transfer some of the maintenance on its Boeing 747
jumbo jets to Taeko and will send its own technical staff to train engineers
in China. Since Chinese labour costs are much lower than those in Japan, the
move could save the Japanese airline about Y200m (Pounds 1.25m) in annual
maintenance costs per jet, which in Japan amount to between Y500m and Y800m.
The Japanese carrier, the country's largest, is under severe pressure to cut
costs quickly. In the year to March it made a Y54.9bn (Pounds 345m) pre-tax
loss and has been carrying out a significant restructuring programme aimed
at cutting Y200bn in costs. Some Y100bn of that will cut from investment.
A key part of its strategy in cutting costs is to increase the ratio of
personnel costs accounted in foreign currencies.
JAL already has some maintenance carried out in Singapore.
Japan's Civil Aviation Board, which oversees aircraft safety, will inspect
the new facility in China before it is given the go-ahead to start
maintenance work for JAL.
Mr Stuart John, Cathay Pacific's engineering director and deputy chairman of
HAECO, the Hong Kong airline's maintenance arm, said his company had been
forced to go into China because of space restrictions at Kai Tak airport,
high inflation and the shortage of labour.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Thai government yesterday opened a Dollars 1bn elevated toll road in
Bangkok, despite complaints by the Japanese-led consortium which built it
that a dispute over the contract was unresolved.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, declined to open the 28km road himself,
apparently aware that foreign investors and bankers are concerned about the
way the government has summarily overruled the objections of the Bangkok
Expressway Company (BECL) consortium.
His place was taken by Mr Chaowas Sudlabha, deputy interior minister, who
maintained that the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA)
had 'fully followed' the contract.
The government's critics, however, claim that the ETA has opened the road
hastily in an attempt to win public acclaim for the authorities by
alleviating Bangkok's increasingly nightmarish traffic jams.
The ETA this week won a court order for the immediate opening of the
completed stretch of motorway after warning of possible violence by
frustrated drivers.
Many Bangkok residents were delighted but investors and bankers were enraged
by what they regard as bullying tactics and said international financing for
some Dollars 30bn of planned Thai infrastructure projects would be
jeopardised.
BECL, led by Kumagai Gumi, has accused the ETA of breaching the contract on
several counts. Yesterday it described the opening of the road, known as the
second-stage expressway, as premature and said there was 'a real danger to
public safety' because construction work has not been completed.
In a statement, BECL's management said the company and the project had been
left 'in an extremely uncertain and precarious position'.

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan cautious on China slowdown - Robert
Thomson on Japanese companies' views of Beijing's economic cold bath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Chinese government has thrown water on an overheated economy,
Japanese companies have generally been drenched. Imports have suddenly
stopped, loan repayments have slowed, and even technology transfers to large
state projects, such as the giant Baoshan steel mill, near Shanghai, have
been halted or delayed.
The current attempt to calm the Chinese economy is part of a cycle of surge
and slowdown during 15 years of reform, but Japanese companies expect fewer
bruises this time around. They say Beijing is more sophisticated in handling
economic policy and has less control over ambitious provincial governments,
which are some of Japan's best customers.
'I think the Chinese government has understood that it made mistakes in the
past. We are fortunate that (vice premier) Zhu Rongji is in charge of
economic policy. His character is different from past leaders'. He
understands how an economy works,' said Mr Kenji Hattori, planning manager
at the the semi-governmental Japan-China Association for Economy and Trade.
Mr Zhu took control of economic policy in early July, lifting interest rates
and attempting to slow an economy expanding more rapidly than the frenetic
13 per cent of last year. The first sign for Japanese companies was an
increase in Chinese customers unable to raise finance, and a slowing of
orders after a 51.2 per cent increase in exports during the first half.
Japanese banks are concerned that their enthusiasm for China could have
prompted lending to projects viable during the good times but vulnerable to
failure if Beijing turns off the flow of foreign exchange. The banks,
burdened by bad loans from their own 'bubble' era during the late 1980s,
were reluctant to lend to international companies and even to domestic
clients, but remained keen to find new customers in China.
'There was a real sense earlier this year that China had entered a period of
endless rapid growth. I think there may be some losses, some cancelled
contracts,' an executive at a Japanese commercial bank said.
With consumer spending and capital investment falling at home, Japanese
manufacturers were delighted to find free-spending consumers and officials
in China taking some of their excess production over the past two years. An
official at the Japan Association of Corporate Executives suggested that the
weak Japanese economy would be even weaker without demand from China,
particularly for consumer electronics, steel and cars.
Japan's steel industry is anxious about twists and turns in China's economic
policies. In 1989, during another slowdown, Chinese buyers cancelled orders,
and a decade earlier, plant contracts for the Baoshan steel mill in Shanghai
were put on hold by a Chinese government short of hard currency.
In the last year, demand was strong for steel used in construction, and
Japanese manufacturers fear that Beijing's new controls on funds will slow
the development projects and steel exports, which doubled in the first half
of this year. However, orders within Japan fell 5.3 per cent during the same
period.
Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel maker, said a fall in sales was
inevitable, but demand in the past two years had been 'unusually high'. In
the longer term, the company said, exports to China should remain steady,
although it was difficult to forecast demand for late this year and next
year.
Japanese car makers have had a similar experience, declining demand at home
and an eightfold increase in passenger car exports to China in the first
half. In June, exports to China were 94 per cent higher than a year earlier,
but in July the year-on-year increase was a relatively modest 54 per cent.
Exports to Europe during the same month were down 32 per cent.
The car makers are most concerned about a suspension of imported car
purchases by Chinese government agencies for the rest of this year. But they
draw comfort from the apparent difficulty Beijing will have in policing this
edict, particularly in southern China.
NEC, the electronics company, said its sales would be generally unaffected
because a large share of orders was for state-sponsored infrastructure
projects likely to be given priority by Beijing.
But attempts to control growth have yet to slow Japanese investment, which
Mr Hattori expects will almost double from the Dollars 1.1bn in the year to
last March. The confidence in longer-term growth, he said, and the belief
that local production provided the best access to the China market, would
encourage companies to expand investment.
'There will be a big delegation of Japanese automobile companies going to
China later this year, companies like Toyota, Nissan and Honda,' Mr Hattori
said. 'They can see foreign car makers have already invested, and they want
to research investment possibilities.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Declining US surplus fuels Nafta debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE declining US trade surplus with Mexico has become a significant element
of the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US,
Mexico and Canada.
Last year the US manufacturing trade surplus to Mexico rose to Dollars
7.5bn, a feat President Bill Clinton and other Nafta proponents cite as
proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs. But
the growth of US sales to Mexico is slowing. The trade surplus has declined
from Dollars 380m in January to Dollars 120m in June as Mexico sinks towards
recession.
To Ms Thea Lee, an economist in the labour-supported Economic Policy
Institute, the trend is 'going the way we predicted; exports are rising but
imports are rising faster'. Ultimately, she contends, the trade surplus will
be in Mexico's favour, and the US will lose 550,000 jobs.
Mr Manuel Suarez-Mier, a visiting fellow at the Georgetown School of
Business Administration, believes nervousness over Nafta's prospects in
Congress has contributed to the the stagnant trade picture. The slowdown in
the Mexican economy is a consequence of high interest rates, in place partly
to control inflation and partly to offset the 'Nafta jitters' in a
securities market worried that Congress will damage the trade pact.
But powerful Nafta opponents - followers of Mr Ross Perot, the populist
billionaire, labour and many environmentalists - paint a depressing picture
of the US-Mexican trade relationship. In his new anti-Nafta book, Mr Perot
points out that Dollars 15.5bn of last year's Dollars 40.6bn US exports to
Mexico was capital goods. This, he asserts to the uninitiated, means
factories.
'When Smith Corona closed its typewriter factory in Cortland, New York, last
year and shipped its manufacturing equipment to Tijuana, Mexico, the
transfer of equipment counted as an 'export' from the US,' he says. 'At this
rate, the US will go bankrupt running up trade surpluses.'
He labels 'a myth' the administration's contention that Nafta will create a
vast, lucrative new market. 'The United States is the market,' he says.
'Mexican consumers do not have the money to buy American or Canadian
exports.'
At the Commerce Department's Mexico Office, where US-Mexico trade is
analysed, the US trade surplus slowdown is seen as 'a temporary pause', due
to slower growth in the Mexican economy and lower demand for imports.
Ms Regina Vargo, the office's director, says Mr Perot is purveying myths of
his own. The US ships a lot of capital goods to Mexico, because that is what
it produces competitively, she says. Capital goods comprise 40 per cent of
US exports worldwide, but only 33 per cent of US exports to Mexico.
What has been growing are sales of consumer goods. Giant US retailers are
undergoing an 'enormous expansion' and helping to renovate Mexico's retail
sector. The average Japanese last year spent Dollars 47 on US consumer
products. The average Mexican spent Dollars 49 - spurring sales of US-made
textiles, clothing, carpets, furniture, musical instruments and sporting
goods.

FT  03 SEP 93 / No red carpet to roll for Aristide: Canute James finds many
Haitians unenthusiastic about a president's return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S new prime minister, Mr Robert Malval, installed his cabinet last
night watched by the military high command, marking another significant step
towards ending the two-year political crisis which began with the overthrow
and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
However, there has been obvious reluctance on the part of Haiti's
legislators, military and supporters of the coup to implement the
UN-brokered agreement preparing the way for the president's return on
October 30. They have been prodded by international pressure in a direction
in which they do not want to go, and rewarded by the lifting of an economic
embargo which has crippled the already impoverished country.
This obvious lack of enthusiasm, and the delicate nature of the remaining
arrangements for the president's return, will make the next eight weeks a
testing time for the new prime minister and the exiled president. Mr
Aristide, who was clearly uncomfortable with parts of the agreement, will
have to walk through a political quagmire which will test his so far
unproven skills in statecraft and diplomacy.
There are sufficient people in Haiti with a strong enough dislike for the
president to make his stay in office uncomfortable. There are rogue elements
in the military which are out of the current leadership's control, and which
will hardly want to take orders from any new commander which the civilian
government will appoint. They have been unhappy with the agreement reached
by Mr Aristide and General Raoul Cedras, who is stepping down as the head of
the army. They claim the accord has given the general a safe escape from the
problem.
Their dislike for President Aristide is hardly likely to be tempered by
assurances that there will be no victimisation after his return. The UN
agreement cannot speak for Mr Aristide's supporters, angry at the coup and
the military's subsequent record of repression and murder. Several military
officers appear convinced that despite all the undertakings, and the
promised protection by an international force, the president will act
against them. Similar fears are shared by affluent Haitians who supported
the coup and denounced the president.
Violence, either state-sponsored or popular, has never been far below the
surface in Haiti. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission reported last
week that at least 50 people had been killed since the agreement in July,
and about 1,500 since the coup. The leaders of the coup may have good reason
to be worried about their safety when civilian rule returns.
There will also be increasing concern on the part of those military officers
who have benefited from the use of Haiti for transshipping narcotics from
South to North America, and who will consider their business threatened.
Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, have said repeatedly that the
anti-Aristide sentiment can be marshalled effectively and viciously by Lt
Col Michel Francois, the chief of the police force, which is a part of the
army; he engineered the coup before handing over to Gen Cedras.
The ranks of Mr Aristide's opponents have been increased by a resurgence of
the Tontons macoutes, the feared and ruthless praetorian guard of the
Duvalier dynasty. Mr Evans Nicolas, the self-styled leader of the revived
macoutes, said he and his faction were ready for 'civil war' to thwart the
return of the president. His support is significant in rural Hait,i where
the military has tolerated the establishment of virtual fiefdoms by the
macoutes, who are collecting taxes and responding brutally to any signs of
support for Mr Aristide.
There is little love lost between Mr Aristide and the Roman Catholic Church.
Cardinal Nicolas Lopez Rodriguez, president of the Latin American Episcopal
Council, said recently that the United Nations had 'blundered' in
reinstating Mr Aristide, whom he described as being 'inexperienced in state
affairs, insensitive and incompetent'.
Behind the considerable and influential efforts of the US to have the coup
overturned and Mr Aristide returned to the presidential palace, there is
latent concern in Washington about the president's willingness, or his
ability, to try to curb his more zealous supporters who might want to have a
go at his detractors. The 1991 coup was preceded by charges from opposition
groups - and which were apparently convincing to some US legislators - that
Mr Aristide was actively inciting his supporters to violence.
The difficulties which threaten an orderly return of the president were
apparent to Mr Dante Caputo, the UN envoy who guided the negotiations. 'In a
country which has had very short periods of democracy,' he concluded when
the negotiations ended, 'it is very difficult for different political
parties to believe that the words that are said in the paper are going to be
respected.'

FT  03 SEP 93 / Attempt to settle civil rights issue in Chile fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chilean government has effectively abandoned its attempt to resolve the
nagging issue of human rights abuses during the previous military regime,
after serious splits emerged within the governing Concertacion coalition.
The government has removed the 'fast-track' status of a bill aimed at
speeding up human rights trials, making it unlikely the bill will be passed
before December's presidential elections. The original aim had been to pass
the bill early this month.
The move will be seen as a political defeat for President Patricio Aylwin,
who only last month presented the bill to the nation in an emotional
address. It also threatens to destabilise the electoral campaign of the
Christian Democrat-dominated Concertacion.
The main sticking point of the 'Aylwin law' was the stipulation that trials
of officials accused of human rights abuses during the military government
of General Augusto Pinochet be held in secret. The purpose of the secrecy
was to persuade military officials to present fresh evidence which might
help to locate the bodies of 'disappeared' people.
Around 200 human rights trials are currently bogged down in Chile's courts.
In most cases there is no intention of punishing military officials, who are
protected by an amnesty promulgated in 1978.
Last month, the secrecy clause of the bill was thrown out by the chamber of
deputies after left-wing members of Concertacion voted against it. Mr Aylwin
argued that the law was unworkable without secret trials.
The human rights issue, which has dogged civilian-military relations since
the handover to democracy in 1990, is set to continue to fester. It will be
up to the new president to try to bring the issue to a close.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORDERS received by US factories fell in July at the sharpest rate for more
than 1 1/2 years, the Commerce Department announced yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington. The principal reason was a fall-off in demand for
cars, aircraft and railway equipment.
The 2.1 per cent decline, to a seasonally adjusted Dollars 250.15bn,
followed a revised 2.9 per cent gain for June. Wall Street economists had
been expecting a 1.7 per cent drop.
It was the sharpest decrease since the 3.6 per cent in December 1991,
department officials said.
Excluding transport goods, factory orders in July rose by 0.2 per cent after
a 1.2 per cent increase in June.
The Commerce Department reported on August 25 that orders for long-lasting
durable goods, which account for about half of total factory business,
dropped sharply in July by 3.8 per cent. It revised that in the orders
report to 3.1 per cent. But orders for non-durable goods also fell in July,
down 1 per cent after rising 1.4 per cent in June.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Call for Guatemalan congress to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S President Ramiro de Leon is winning increasing support for his
call for the resignation of all 116 members of congress and supreme court
magistrates.
The President's move followed weeks of criticism in the media and among
civil organisations which have called for a purge of both organisations,
widely believed to be riddled with corruption. Union leaders and indigenous
groups have backed the President this week.
So far about 70 congressmen have offered their resignations, mostly to the
Instancia Nacional de Consenso, an umbrella group of civic organisations
which was instrumental in restoring democratic government after former
president Jorge Serrano's failed attempt to seize authoritarian powers in
May.
Mr de Leon, formerly Guatemala's highly respected and combative human rights
ombudsman, was elected by congress on June 6, following the constitutional
crisis triggered by Mr Serrano's attempted takeover.
However, Mr de Leon is taking a gamble that popular support will force
congress to resign. He has threatened a referendum on the issue if
congressmen do not stand down. The vote could not be held before November,
and the delay would undermine the President's ability to push through
legislation.
'If he gets the active support of the people he may succeed,' says Mr Emilio
Arroyave, a political analyst at Asies, a local think tank. 'If not we will
have a serious confrontation on our hands which could undermine the
President.'
Mr de Leon called his attempt to clean up congress and the courts 'a
national crusade against impunity and corruption in response to popular
clamour,' in a recent televised address.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Plea bargain waters down BNL charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS JANET RENO, the US Attorney General, yesterday approved an unexpected
plea agreement that throws out nearly all the charges against Mr Christopher
Drogoul, the former Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Atlanta branch manager at the
centre of the long-running Iraqi loans scandal.
Mr Drogoul, who made Dollars 5bn of loans that helped to finance Iraq's
nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, was supposed to stand trial next
Wednesday, accused of a range of conspiracy charges, money laundering and
defrauding the Rome head office of BNL. If convicted, he would have faced a
term of life in prison.
Instead, yesterday, Mr Drogoul was allowed to plead guilty to two counts
involving bank regulatory violations and one count of wire fraud. The
justice department said it would seek a jail sentence of about five years.
Mr Drogoul will have a chance to argue in court at his sentencing hearing in
November that higher authorities, including Rome, knew of his Iraqi loans.
The charges Mr Drogoul agreed to plead guilty to yesterday involve filing
misleading reports to the Federal Reserve Board and accepting a financial
gift from a BNL customer in order to repair his home.
Ms Reno, who personally made the BNL case decision, said yesterday: 'We are
going to continue our efforts to determine if other wrongdoing occurred.'
When asked if that meant the Justice Department would pursue allegations of
criminal wrongdoing by former Bush administration officials, a spokesman for
Ms Reno said: 'Absolutely.' He added: 'The investigation continues and is a
very broad one and includes all the allegations that have been made.'
Mr Drogoul was originally indicted on 347 counts in February 1991. Last
month lawyers for Mr Drogoul issued subpoenas demanding testimony from
former President George Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker,
arguing that the BNL loans were merely part of a larger US covert programme
to aid Iraq. The handling of the BNL case has led to congressional demands
for a special prosecutor.

<TEXT>
THE state of California, a magnet for immigrants since the days of the gold
rush, is experiencing an unprecedented exodus of residents leaving for other
parts of the US, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
Job losses as a result of defence cuts are the driving force behind the
population shift, state officials said in a report published this week by
the state Department of Finance. Most of those leaving the state are from
Southern California. According to the report as many as 600,000 people moved
from California, during the fiscal year ending June 30, producing a net loss
of 150,000 residents in the state.
'The economy is the driving force in these losses,' said Ms Mary Heim, a
Department of Finance demographer. California lost almost 200,000 jobs in
the last fiscal year, according to independent researchers.
Domestic immigration is also down by 15 per cent in 1993, compared to 1992.
However, California's population is expected to continue to grow as a result
of births and immigration from other countries. At least 200,000 legal
immigrants are expected this year, plus an estimated 100,000 illegal
immigrants.

On Wednesday, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its

sector declined in August, the third monthly contraction in a row.
Consumers still lack confidence in the economy's direction, surveys
indicate. This is reflected in a softening of car and retail sales as well
as a relatively tepid pace of new-home sales despite the cheapest interest
rates in decades.
The Clinton administration on Wednesday cut its own estimate of expected
growth in total goods and services output this year to 2 per cent from 3.1
per cent projected last April.
During the second quarter this year, gross domestic product expanded at an
annual rate of only 1.8 per cent after rising by 0.8 per cent in the first

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation is 'a question
of days, if not hours' away, according to Mr Hakam Balawi, a top aide to Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, yesterday.
Mr Balawi said from the PLO headquarters in Tunis that Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators were 'at the final stage before reaching a
compromise for announcing official mutual recognition'. He said an historic
Israeli accord on recognition would be followed immediately by US agreement
to resume contacts with the PLO.
Palestinian leaders in Tunis were yesterday considering the text of an
announcement of recognition which, Palestinian officials in Washington said,
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, had brought back from Tel Aviv
after his visit to Israel on Wednesday.
Senior PLO officials in Cairo said they expected to reach agreement on
recognition before signing the declaration of principles on the accord with
Israel offering limited self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank. This, the
officials said, could be accomplished as soon as next week in Washington.
The Cairo officials said that they hoped to meet Israeli terms for
recognition without making formal amendments to the Palestinian Charter,
something that would require a full meeting of the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile.
'Those raising issues of wanting to change the charter are simply trying to
raise difficulties in the peace process,' said one PLO official. He said
that Mr Arafat's renunciation of terrorism against Israel, made at the
United Nations in 1988, amounted to a de facto renunciation of armed
struggle against the Jewish state.
The next step is likely to be a PLO announcement reiterating its
renunciation of violence and the 'destruction of Israel'. Israel is then
expected to announce its readiness to start open talks with the PLO.
The PLO official said a 'necessary' next step would be a summit meeting
between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister and said
'contacts are being made to arrange this'.
In Casablanca, Mr Arafat told reporters: 'The Palestinian state is within
our grasp. Soon the Palestinian flag will fly on the walls, the minarets and
the cathedrals of Jerusalem.' He was speaking after talks with King Hassan
of Morocco.

THE West Bank and the Gaza Strip will need about Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds
2.8bn) of investment in infrastructure and human resources to get their
economies back on their feet after a peace settlement, according to a study
by the World Bank.
Bank officials said the study showed a need for about Dollars 1.3bn in the
first three years for such priority projects as health, education, sewers,
water supply, roads and housing, with another Dollars 3bn over the next five
years.
The World Bank assessment, contained in a 600-page report on the two
territories' basic needs, has been sent to Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinians for comments and is expected to be finalised in time for
multilateral talks on Middle East regional economic development due to take
place in Copenhagen in November.
Officials said the needs assessment in the Gaza Strip and West Bank -
excluding east Jerusalem - was based only on an economic analysis. About
Dollars 25m could be spent on a full engineering feasibility assessment.
With the emerging possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinians,
US officials have been sounding out other countries for help in financing
the eventual settlement.
The US bore most of the cost of the earlier peace treaty between Israel and
Egypt, but the US hopes for help both from other members of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations and from Arab oil states.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Brussels promises 'full commitment' of aid

THE European Commission yesterday promised 'a full commitment' of aid to the
Palestine peace process, but stopped short of pledging concrete sums of
money, after meeting Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister.
After the meeting, Mr Peres hinted that mutual recognition between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation could be imminent.
Mr Peres met Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, and Mr Hans van den
Broek, EC external affairs commissioner, seeking a substantial EC aid pledge
for the emerging peace settlement, closer EC-Israeli ties, and support for
regional development.
Mr Delors said the EC would move quickly with technical assistance to help
set up the future Palestinian authority in Gaza-Jericho.
Commission officials said it was a priority to establish the local apparatus
through which to channel larger amounts of aid and investment in the future.
'As a first step, we need a relatively small amount of money for technical
assistance to help them start up their institutions,' Mr Delors said,
mentioning a substantial contribution to a multilateral Early Empowerment
Fund worth about Dollars 300m (Pounds 199m).
He said the next priorities would be funneling of funds towards health,
education, and the creation of small to medium-sized enterprises.
'The amount of public money may be relatively small: we need private
investment with the support of financial institutions,' such as the European
Investment Bank, he added.
The EC is the largest supplier of public aid to the occupied territories,
providing some Ecu700m (Pounds 534m) in all, including Ecu60m last year. But
the demands of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and other crises worldwide
have exhausted the Brussels aid budget.
At the Lisbon summit in June last year, EC leaders promised to play 'a major
role' in supporting financially a Palestinian peace agreement, and officials
said it was now up to member states to decide whether to do this through the
Community or bilaterally.
'If the member states want the Commission to do more, they have to provide
the means,' an EC aid official said.
Mr Delors said 'the Commission will seek a full commitment' from the 12
member countries.
Mr Delors also mentioned the longer-term prospect of establishing a Middle
Eastern organisation analogous to the EC's original Coal and Steel
Community, to exploit in common scarce resources such as water.
'There are a number of areas where there is scope for regional integration
and that is where the Community thinks it should concentrate its efforts,'
an aide said.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Keidanren to stem party funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KEIDANREN, Japan's leading business grouping, yesterday endorsed a plan
to stop contributions to political parties from next year.
The decision will cut off funding of more than Y13bn (Pounds 83m) a year to
the Liberal Democratic party, which lost power last month. Mr Gaishi
Hiraiwa, Keidanren chairman, said the move was in response to heightened
public criticism that corporate gifts to political parties led to
corruption.
The Keidanren's move will also affect some parties in the new coalition
government which depend on corporate contributions. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
prime minister, who has pledged to clean up politics by cutting links
between companies and politicians, has been forced to pare this down and is
now calling for a ban in corporate donations in five years' time.
However, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the
Keidanren's decision was inevitable, while Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary
general of the LDP, criticised the move, saying the current system had
contributed to a 'clean' flow of funds.
The Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, has acted as a
conduit of funds from its members to political parties since 1955. The
decision is likely to prompt similar moves by businesses and other industry
associations.
Mr Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman, president of Nippon Steel and
chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said the steel industry
would follow the Keidanren's line. But Mr Yotaro Iida, another Keidanren
vice chairman and chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, said he opposed
an immediate halt of corporate donations.
The Keidanren is calling for the introduction of public subsidies for
political parties and an increase in donations from individuals. Mr Hiraiwa
expressed support for the ruling coalition's plan to use Y60bn a year in
public funds, or Y500 a head, to support the parties.
This plan has run into increasing criticism, and the coalition may be forced
to cut the amount. But Mr Hiraiwa yesterday said ordinary Japanese might be
able to shoulder an even larger amount.
The Keidanren said that it would help the LDP repay loans totalling Y14.5bn
from eight leading Japanese banks. The business group will solicit donations
of Y10bn over the next three years, but it will leave the LDP to repay the
remaining Y4.5bn by itself.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Islam turns S E Asia's secular heads: Several violent
incidents have served as a reminder of growing religious power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE normally peaceful life of southern Thailand, where gilded Buddhist
temples give way to the domes and minarets of mosques amid the rice fields
and rubber plantations, has been rudely disrupted since the beginning of
last month by a series of violent incidents.
They include an ambush that killed two soldiers, an attack on a train in
which a woman died, the throwing of a grenade into a Buddhist temple and
co-ordinated arson attempts on 35 schools.
There is no doubting the seriousness of the attacks, but there is little
agreement about who is to blame.
Thai Moslems say at least some of the incidents have more to do with
domestic Thai politics than with religion, but they have served as an
unwelcome reminder to South-East Asia's secular governments of the growing
power of Islam in the region.
The mood in Thailand's south, in the fundamentalist-led Malaysian state of
Kelantan over the border and in the nearby Indonesian territory of Aceh give
the lie to the conventional wisdom that South-East Asian Moslems practise a
'milder' form of Islam than their co-religionists in the Middle East.
In reality South-East Asia's 200m Moslems are as diverse in their beliefs as
Moslems are in the Arab world or Christians are in Europe.
South-East Asian Moslems include the mystics of Java, the Cham fisherfolk of
Cambodia, and the Libyan-trained guerrillas of the Moro National Liberation
Front in the southern Philippines. The largest populations are in Indonesia
 -the biggest Moslem country in the world  - and Malaysia.
Government officials and businessmen have often said that Islamic
fundamentalism in South-East Asia peaked at the time of the late Ayatollah
Khomeini's control of Iran in the 1980s and has since declined under the
influence of industrialisation and increasing wealth.
But Moslem radicals themselves - and their liberal and feminist opponents -
disagree.
Some Moslems say that Islam is growing stronger because economic growth has
benefited only a privileged minority, and because Islam is a peaceful force
for democracy in conflict with auto-cratic governments. They deplore the
impact of imported western television programmes on Moslem morals.
The killing of Moslems in Bosnia, the Israeli bombardment of Moslem villages
in southern Lebanon, and the persecution of Moslems by the Burmese military
government have also angered Asian Moslems.
'Islam is a growing strength in this part of the world because they
(Moslems) were so frustrated with the past and present system that dominates
them,' said Mr Subky Abdul-Latif, an executive committee member of the Parti
Islam se-Malaysia (PAS), the fundamentalist Malaysian opposition party.
'Moslems are being suppressed all over the world.'
PAS, which has controlled the state government of Kelantan on the Thai
border in a coalition with another Malay party since the 1990 elections, is
attempting to introduce sharia law for all the inhabitants of the state
although this would appear to contravene the Malaysian constitution's
guarantee of religious free-dom.
Thai military officers have accused PAS of harbouring separatist guerrillas
from Thailand in Kelantan. PAS says - ambiguously - that it respects the
international border. 'We don't want to interfere, but we don't want them to
bully the Moslems there,' said Mr Abdul-Latif.
Malaysia's neighbour Indonesia, meanwhile, has long used brutal methods in
its attempts to suppress an Islamic separatist rebellion in Aceh on the
northern tip of Sumatra. According to Amnesty International, the human
rights group, Indonesian troops have summarily killed about 2,000 civilians
there.
On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems attacked several Christian
churches and homes in November and December last year, apparently in
response to a rise in Christian fundamentalist proselytising.
The Indonesian and Malaysian governments, perceiving the growth of Islamic
influence, have - at the same time as trying to crush their opponents or
defeat them politically - attempted to co-opt fundamentalist Moslems by
becoming more Islamic themselves.
President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, have each established Moslem organisations to promote Islam as
something compatible with the technological, social and economic development
they are pursuing.
Both governments are encouraging the development of 'interest-free' Islamic
banking in parallel with conventional banking practices. Only last month,
Malaysian officials said they expected all financial institutions in the
country to offer some kind of Islamic service within a year.
In Kuala Lumpur these days, it is more common than it used to be to see
women wearing Islamic headgear covering their hair and shoulders. Malaysian
Moslems can be, and occasionally are, punished under state sharia laws for
drinking alcohol or for being in close company with someone of the opposite
sex (excluding relatives); even government officials opposed to PAS say they
want to increase the authority of the sharia courts.
The Malaysian capital is still a lively, cosmopolitan city, but some
middle-class Moslems, not to mention the minority Christians of ethnic
Chinese origin, are worried by what they see as an emerging mood of Islamic
orthodoxy.
Although there is little sign of separatist fervour among Thai Moslems, who
are the majority in the south but make up only 4 per cent of Thailand's
population, they resent what they regard as Buddhist domination of their
lives, especially in education.
Islam has grown stronger over the last decade, and devout Thai Moslems say
they want primary as well as secondary school girl pupils to wear the modest
attire known as hijab. They would like an end to compulsory Thai dancing
lessons and factory workers to be allowed time off to pray. And they say
Moslems should have the chance to use Islamic financial institutions.

South Africa's democracy negotiators approved a draft bill yesterday to end
state control of radio and television, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
The bill, setting up an independent broadcasting authority (IBA), is one of
a package of measures intended to ensure that South Africa's first all-race
election in April next year is free and fair. It is planned that the IBA
remain in place after the elections.
The IBA bill and others passed by the 23 groups negotiating the transition
from apartheid to majority rule are due to be passed in parliament later
this month.
Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said the IBA bill would establish a
broadcast industry free from political control and influence. NEWS IN BRIEF

<TEXT>
Taiwan's cabinet yesterday passed an administrative reform plan calling for
stiffer penalties for official misconduct and big rewards for those
informing against corrupt officials, Dennis Engbarth reports from Taipei.
The move follows a series of high-profile corruption cases that have damaged
the ruling Kuomintang's standing. A recent poll of 1,145 respondents by a
leading business monthly showed that over 46 per cent felt the KMT was
'unclean'.
Premier Lien Chan said the anti-corruption effort will reach into all fields
of government.
The government will offer rewards of up to NTDollars 6m (Pounds 147,500) for
information leading to conviction of a corrupt official, pending legislative
approval. Officials at all levels will have to report any non-family gift
worth more than Dollars 75, to the head of their ministry or agency and its
anti-corruption office. The plan also mandates strict supervision and
punishment of officials in 14 categories of public service, including big
public construction projects and procurements by government agencies.

China yesterday claimed victory over the US following a bitter argument
about the cargo on board a Chinese ship bound for the Middle East.
Washington had alleged that the vessel was transporting chemicals to Iran
for weapons production, Tony Walker reports from Beijing.
Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters that a team,
including Chinese and Saudi technical experts had conducted an inspection
and found no evidence of the chemicals on board - thiodyglycol and thionyl
chloride.
The US, whose naval vessels had interrupted the Yin He's passage through the
Gulf, had claimed the Chinese ship was transporting chemical 'precursors' to
the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas for use in the manufacture of mustard and
nerve gas.
Wu said the inspection was conducted at Dammam in Saudi Arabia in the
presence of 'personnel dispatched by the United States' who served as
'technical advisers' to the Saudis.

<TEXT>
BUSINESS and corporate life in Karachi, Pakistan's largest commercial city,
came to a halt yesterday, in response to a strike called by the Pakistan
Islamic Front - a coalition of Islamic political parties, Farhan Bokhari
reports from Islamabad.
Public transport was shut down forcing shopkeepers, labourers and port
workers to stay at home. There was only thin trading at the Karachi Stock
Exchange, Pakistan's leading stock market.
The strike was called to protest at economic reforms announced by Prime
Minister Moeen Qureshi. Islamic leaders claim that the recent devaluation of
the rupee and a 21 per cent petrol price rise this year have 'intensified
miseries for the common man'.
Elsewhere in Pakistan, the response was partial. In Lahore, Pakistan's
second largest city, some shops were closed, but most businesses and public
transport were unaffected. It was not clear last night if yesterday's events
would encourage the Islamic leaders to step up their campaign.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party yesterday published proposals for electoral
reforms after having lost its parliamentary majority in an election prompted
because it refused to reform a scandal-prone electoral system, writes Robert
Thomson in Tokyo.
The proposals by the LDP, which had ruled for four decades, are similar to
those of the seven-party coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who
wants a blend of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation
to replace the present multi-seat constituency system.
However, the coalition wants 250 representatives to be chosen by each method
for a total of 500 MPs in the lower house, compared with the present 511.
The LDP suggests that 300 representatives come from the constituencies and
171 from proportional representation.
Another difference in the drafts is that the coalition supports a two-vote
system, one for the constituency and one for proportional representation
candidates, while the LDP wants only one vote, believing larger parties will
profit from this system.
The LDP, along with the coalition, suggests that public subsidies be used to
cover campaigning costs, though LDP members oppose a ban on corporate
donations, which was initially promised by the coalition but is now under
review.
Under the LDP proposal, each citizen will be asked to pay Y250 (Pounds
1.57), creating a pool of Y30bn (Pounds 188m) in election funds. The
coalition has suggested that the charge be Y500, doubling the size of the
pool.
The proposals will be debated at a parliamentary session expected to begin
in the middle of this month. The LDP, which has been belligerent in
opposition, is unlikely to give way easily to the Hosokawa coalition,
knowing that the seven parties are yet to settle their own differences on
the details of reform.

   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S state-owned steelworks, the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company
(Zisco), is threatened with closure for both financial and technical
reasons. The more immediate challenge is financial.
Zisco, sub-Saharan Africa's largest steelworks outside South Africa, owes
the government-controlled coal producer, Wankie Colliery, ZDollars 78m
(Pounds 8m) and the National Railways of Zimbabwe, also a parastatal,
ZDollars 100m. Wankie, which supplies Zisco with about 600,000 tonnes of
coal a year, is refusing to supply any more, while the NRZ is demanding
immediate payment of ZDollars 25m.
Zisco has appealed to the government for help and was granted a subsidy of
ZDollars 100m in the 1993-94 budget, but this is inadequate to meet its
existing debts, let alone fund its cash flow deficit.
One blast furnace, closed early this year for rebuilding, remains in limbo
with no decision yet on how to finance the rehabilitation. The remaining
furnace, which broke down temporarily last week, is unlikely to last much
beyond the end of this year.
The plant is at present operating at about 35 per cent of capacity. The
government wants to sell it but huge debts are likely to put off buyers.

OPPOSITION to a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians yesterday
started to crystallise around extremist Islamic fundamentalist groups and
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
However, fears of a strong challenge from the Israeli right wing appeared to
be diminishing yesterday as opposition Likud party officials expressed
concern about divisions on the right, financial problems and a lack of
public response to protest calls.
Among Palestinians it became clearer that strong opposition to the deal is
felt in areas of the West Bank, such as Ramallah and Jenin, which will have
a lesser form of self rule than the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho.
An opinion poll of 750 Palestinians published in yesterday's East Jerusalem
Arabic newspaper Al-Nahar showed a slim majority of 52.8 per cent in favour
of the accord, with over 41 per cent against. In Gaza and Jericho, support
for the agreement was more than 70 per cent but almost three-quarters of
those interviewed in Ramallah and Jenin were against the peace deal.
Mr Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian political figure, continued
meeting opposition movements yesterday to plead against violent action.
However, it was clear that fundamentalist Islamic groups such as Hamas and
Jihad Islamiya in alliance with splinter factions of the PLO were determined
to wreck a deal they label as 'treachery'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S oil workers are to stay on strike until Monday despite the return
to work announced yesterday by the rest of the labour movement. The
blue-collar oil workers' union, NUPENG, angrily rejected the agreement by
the Nigeria Labour Congress to call off the three-day general strike in
return for a suspension of last week's 10-fold increase in the price of
petrol.
Although the oil workers' strike has not stopped the production of crude
oil, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of export earnings, it has
halted public transport and kept fuel stations dry in many parts of Nigeria
this week. In the big cities in the south, available reserves of fuel are
disappearing. The biggest hospital in Nigeria, in Lagos, has run out of fuel
and fear of reprisals is preventing tanker drivers from strike-breaking.
The oil workers' strike keeps the pressure on Mr Ernest Shonekan's interim
government to reach a compromise with pro-democracy groups and the deposed
winner of the June presidential elections, Mr Moshood Abiola.
A meeting between labour congress leaders and the government on Wednesday
failed to resolve their differences over the June election results.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday the US was ready to order air strikes
in Bosnia if humanitarian aid efforts were hampered following the breakdown
of peace talks.
The warning came amid signs that US officials were stepping up pressure on
the Serbs and Croats, who rejected Moslem demands in Geneva for further
territorial concessions.
Washington officials said the US supported the three principal demands made
by the Bosnian Moslem government of President Alia Izetbegovic for changes
to the division of territory proposed in Geneva: a sea outlet for the Moslem
territory at Neum, an enlargement of the Moslem enclave around Bihac in
north-western Bosnia, and a land corridor linking the enclaves in eastern
Bosnia to the main Moslem territory.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said the Serbs and Croats
should show greater flexibility to achieve the adjustments the Bosnian
government had asked for.
Mr Clinton said he believed the peace talks had stalled rather than
collapsed and the US would 'do everything it can in the next few days to get
the parties to resume the talks in good faith'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said air strikes remained a
possibility if the Bosnian Serbs or Croats attacked UN forces or resumed the
bombardment of Sarajevo.

THE US yesterday urged the three sides in the Bosnian conflict to go back to
the negotiating table, but placed the blame for the breakdown in talks
firmly on the 'stubbornness and intransigence' of the Serbs and Croats.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said the Serbs and Croats
'should show greater flexibility in working to achieve the adjustments that
the Bosnian government has asked for in order to find a more equitable
settlement'.
Officials in Washington said the US supported the three principal demands of
the Bosnian Moslem government for changes to the division of territory
proposed in Geneva: a sea outlet for the Moslems at Neum, enlargement of the
Moslem enclave around Bihac in north-western Bosnia, and a land corridor
linking the eastern enclaves to the main Moslem territory.
The US is keeping open the options of lifting the Bosnia arms embargo or
carrying out air strikes against Serb or Croat militias. But Mr Christopher
said the first priority should be resumption of negotiations, with tougher
action available for 'future consideration'.
'It's our evaluation that with the parties close to settlement and with the
winter coming on it would be especially tragic if they don't grasp the
opportunity to contain the settlement that seems to be within reach,' he
said.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Bosnian foes peer into the abyss: Karadzic warns Moslems
former Yugoslav republic could be carved into two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday warned the Moslems
that Bosnia could be divided in two following the collapse of peace talks on
Wednesday.
'Carving up Bosnia in two pieces would never happen by our intention but it
may happen by the events,' he said in Geneva shortly before the Bosnian
Serbs and Moslems prepared to leave the negotiations.
Mr Karadzic said the Serbs had offered the Moslems a 3km corridor linking
enclaves in Serb-held eastern Bosnia, meeting one of Bosnian President Alia
Izetbegovic's three territorial demands.
'The Moslems accepted the concession but they wanted more,' he said, but
added that the Serbs would never yield Moslem towns they conquered in the
west of Bosnia as Mr Izetbegovic wanted.
Mr Karadzic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman both said they had
expected a deal until the last moment.
'I was surprised in a way because very important circles were convinced Alia
Izetbegovic would agree to the plan,' Mr Tudjman told Croatian radio on his
return to Zagreb.
Breakdown of the talks has led to mounting concern over the threat of
renewed fighting in central Bosnia and signs that the US would step up
pressure on the Serbs and Croats for a settlement.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations' special envoy, said the
breakdown of negotiations had been 'a great tragedy', since the parties had
come so near an agreement.
'I fear more war and more suffering, more people being killed, which is an
awful result,' he said. International mediator Lord Owen had earlier warned
of 'fragmentation, anarchy, warlords and chaos' in Bosnia - and indicated
that part of the blame for the breakdown lay in the lack of support the
agreement had received from western countries.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, yesterday met Mr
Stoltenberg to discuss the crisis. Mr Boutros Ghali is to issue a report to
the Security Council warning of the potentially 'devastating' effect on the
civilian population.
A senior US official in Geneva yesterday held out the hope that the three
leaders would have a change of heart because the remaining differences were
'small'. The three sides in the conflict said they still believed a peace
deal would be possible, and pledged to try to broker a ceasefire.
However, Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN special envoy, said in Zagreb there
was a 'real possibility' of fighting continuing throughout the winter,
particularly in central Bosnia, where Moslem and Croat forces have engaged
in skirmishes in recent days.
A UN protection force spokesman in Zagreb yesterday confirmed that sporadic
clashes were continuing in central Bosnia, although not on a scale that
suggested that either the Croats or Moslems had yet launched a serious
assault.
But, in another sign of the rising tensions in the region, UN officials in
Sarajevo accused Bosnian Croat forces of forcing more than 3,000 Moslem
women and children from their homes in recent days.
Croat leaders denied the charges and claimed that Moslem forces were
harassing the small Croat enclaves in central Bosnia.
Amid signs that the western world remained deeply devided over what action
to take, diplomatic sources yesterday said that the threat of air strikes or
sanctions against Croatia was now likely to re-emerge in the coming days.
Both British and German officials however yesterday stressed that a
negotiated settlement remained the only solution to the Bosnian settlement.
Some British and US officials are understood to favour extending economic
sanctions to Croatia, in an effort to force the Croats to lift their siege
of Mostar and possibly make new concessions in the negotiations. However Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, indicated at a meeting with Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary in Germany on Wednesday that he
remained opposed to this, preferring to use his diplomatic influence over
the Croats.
The breakdown of the Geneva conference came almost one year after its
launch. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatia's President
Tudjman were livid with rage on Wednesday night as Mr Izetbegovic sat
impassively in Geneva's Palais des Nations.
Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, yesterday defended his decision to hold out for
further territorial concessions in spite of warnings about the imminent
danger of an upsurge in violence.
'The signing of this plan would be tantamount to a collective suicide for
the Moslems,' he said before leaving Geneva for talks with Mr Suleiman
Demirel, the president of Turkey who is one of Bosnia's main backers.
'Either we get a viable state, or no deal,' he said. Mr Izetbegovic plans to
address the Security Council in New York on Monday.
Mr Izetbegovic appeared to dismiss the threat of more war, saying that
Sarajevo could survive another winter. Both sides said they would respect a
ceasefire agreement.
Mr Izetbegovic had reluctantly agreed to Bosnia's partition into a union of
three 'ethnic' republics. Under intense pressure and faced with Serb and
Croat military victories, on Wednesday he scaled down his demands to a
'minimum of minimums' of 34 per cent.
'I did not understand,' said Mr Karadzic when asked why the talks broke
down. 'I cannot believe the Moslems are refusing this offer, which is honest
and fair.' But the senior US official yesterday made clear that Serbs and
Croats are now expected to hand over more territory.

Bosnia-Hercegovina: fears grow of an intensified war
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid-summer
As the Geneva peace talks started up in July, the alliance between
Croat and Moslem allies had long broken down: the Moslem-lead Bosnian
army had pushed back Croat forces in central Bosnia, Croat forces
stepped up the assault on Mostar's Moslem sector, and the Serbs
continued the assualt on other Moslem enclaves, cutting off Goradze
from Sarajevo, isolating Tesanj and surrounding Sarajevo, prompting
Nato in early August to threaten the Serbs with air strikes.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now
By the time the talks stalled this week, Moslem forces had made
considerable gains, while the Croats had succeeded in beseiging Mostar.
After taking Bugojno, Moslem forces are now attacking Konjic and appear
to be preparing an assault on the Makljen ridge. Croat forces are
reportedly being reinforced and preparing an assault to defend their
enclaves in central Bosnia. Despite Serb threats of a new assault, Serb
lines have remained fairly static, though fighting continues around
Brcko.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The proposed partition
The Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the land and have achieved most
of their military aims, would see their portion reduced to 52 per cent.
The Bosnian Moslems, who control 10 per cent, would receive 28 per
cent, though losing some recently conquered land and have only tenuous
access to the Adriatic and their eastern enclaves. Some Moslem
commanders hope to wrest more land, though, in practice, their forces
would be little match for a Serb assault or reinforced Bosnian Croats.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's conference on the protection of war victims called by the
International Committee of the Red Cross demonstrated the gap between good
intentions and political realities.
The 160 or so countries taking part declared they would take stronger action
to enforce rules protecting civilians in wartime. But there must remain
doubts as to how the declaration will be translated into practice.
Before the conference Mr Cornelio Sommaruga, the ICRC president, urged the
US, Britain and France to ratify the 1977 protocols which outlaw methods of
warfare that cause unnecessary suffering and to extend the rules on
protection of non-combatants to civil conflicts. None of the three said it
would.
Similarly, there is a general recognition that better ways have to be found
to make humanitarian law effective in civil conflicts, where the fighting
may be done not by disciplined troops but by armed bands, and where
civilians are all too often deliberate targets rather than accidental
victims.
The general rules laid down in the Geneva Conventions and the later
protocols apply to internal wars but getting them to stick is another
matter.
The conference agreed to ask the Swiss government to convene a group of
experts to study 'practical means' of promoting full compliance with
international humanitarian law, but this is unlikely to produce results for
a year or so.
The declaration contained a specific call to outlaw anti-personnel mines,
some 85m of which remain uncleared around the world, inflicting a daily toll
of innocent victims.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank can still meet its target for money supply growth for 1993,
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the German central bank, said
yesterday.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks, combined with an optimistic assessment of the
outlook for inflation in Germany, may serve to revive hopes of further
reductions in short-term rates when the Bundesbank policy-making council
meets again next week.
The rate of growth in broad money M3 was 7.5 per cent in July on an
annualised, seasonally adjusted basis, compared to a target range of 4.5 to
6.5 per cent.
Driven up by high bank lending and the impact of the Bundesbank's currency
market intervention, the growth in M3 is restricting the central bank's
freedom to cut interest rates. This was acknowledged last week by Mr Otmar
Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and member of its policy making
council, who said that the growth in money supply had made it impossible to
cut rates last Thursday. Mr Schlesinger said that while the current level of
inflation - running at annual rate of over 4 per cent - was unsatisfactory,
there were signs that price pressures were calming down.

Environmental talks on reducing sulphur emissions are due to end today, with
no agreement on target cuts, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
A week of negotiations has failed to bridge the gap between nations seeking
big reductions by the end of the decade, such as Germany and the Nordic
countries, and those, including Britain, which want less demanding targets
over a longer period. The 30-nation talks are aimed at hammering out a new
sulphur protocol on long-range air pollution.

RUSSIA and the US signed wide-ranging agreements on technology yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
President Bill Clinton hailed a Russian agreement to adhere to international
guidelines on exporting missile technology as clearing the way for a new era
of high-technology co-operation. Visiting Russian prime minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Vice President Al Gore signed an agreement opening the
international commercial space launch market to Russia. The pact spells out
basic rules on subsidies and obligates Russia to charge launch service fees
comparable to western prices. Previously, the market was limited to US,
European and Chinese launch providers.
The two also signed a joint statement spelling out a phased approach to
co-operation on human space flight which is expected to lead to Russian
participation in an international space station.
Also signed by US and Russian officials were joint statements on
environmental monitoring and aeronautics which both sides said would lead to
broad co-operation in those fields.

FT  03 SEP 93 / D-Mark continues to strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark strengthened sharply against most currencies yesterday, amid
increasing concern about the pace of US economic recovery and a growing
belief that Germany will lower short-term interest rates more slowly than
had been expected.
In recent days, there has been consistent buying of D-Marks in the
international currency market, following the Bundesbank decision last week
not to reduce its discount rate. Yesterday, the pressure on the dollar
intensified, pushing it well below last year's peak for the dollar/ D-Mark
exchange rate.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6490 from a previous DM1.6595, and eased
to DM1.6450 in New York. Dealers have bought the D-Mark and sold the dollar
in the belief that central banks need to do the same to help balance their
reserves after Bundesbank intervention in the exchange rate mechanism last
month.
The French franc dropped from FFr3.507 to close at FFr3.522 against the
D-Mark. The Danish krone dropped from DKr4.11 to DKr4.14. Sterling dropped
from DM2.5025 to DM2.4750. The ERM grid was at its most strained since last
month's widening of the system's bands.

HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewing giant which was last week forced to recall 3.4m
beer bottles after the discovery of flaws, was yesterday at pains to stress
that damage to its sales, profits and brand name would be strictly limited.
Immediate costs of the recall, which was triggered by fears that a
production fault in the bottleneck could cause small glass chips to fall
into the beer, would be limited to 'several tens of millions of guilders',
managers said. It added this sum was likely to be recovered by year's end.
In Paris BSN, which is the French parent of the Dutch company which produced
the bottles, said that no legal action had been taken against it, or its
Dutch bottling subsidiary.
BSN added that discussions were being held with Heineken to determine what
compensation might be paid. The French company said that in any event the
bottling factory and BSN were covered by insurance.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Belgium raises interest rates to defend franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian central bank yesterday raised its central interest rate from 9.5
to 10.5 per cent and intervened on the currency markets to support the
Belgian franc.
The bank's action followed a week of speculation against the currency, and
backed up statements by Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the bank governor, that
Belgium would not abandon its 'franc fort' policy.
The bank also increased its other interest rates by one percentage point.
The franc closed yesterday at BFr21.49 to the D-Mark, against a close of
BFr21.31 on Wednesday.
The tightening of monetary policy came on the same day that the country's
national statistics institute announced a rise in unemployment from 13.5 per
cent in July to 14.1 per cent in August. The latest figure compares to 12.1
per cent in August 1992. Some analysts believe pressure on the currency
could increase before next month's negotiations between the government,
trade unions and employers.
The talks will try to decide how to improve the waning competitiveness of
Belgian business, without undermining state finances. Analysts believe a
successful growth pact would relieve pressure on the franc, but belligerent
press statements by different participants have fuelled worries about the
outcome, particularly abroad.
Failure to agree a growth pact at next month's talks would badly damage
Belgium's centre-left government, headed by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene. Attempts to
tinker with the social security system, and to limit index-linked wage
rises, nearly brought down the fragile coalition in March.
The latest burst of currency speculation began last week when 14 influential
Flemish economists urged the authorities to stimulate growth by lowering
interest rates and abandoning the three-year-old link between the franc and
the D-Mark. Belgian government bonds fell sharply as many investors were
surprised by the rise in interest rates, adds Peter John in London.
There was a rush of selling at the start of the dealing session, with
three-year Belgian debt prices down by up two percentage points yesterday.
One London trader said: 'The market just collapsed. There was a complete
lack of confidence.'
The Belgian futures and options exchange experienced record volatility in
its debt markets in high turnover.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Iranian troops gathering on Azeri border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IRANIAN troops were last night reported by the Turkish government to be
massed on the border of Azerbaijan as Azeri forces continue to cede
territory to Armenian units in the south-west of the country.
However, the Azeris have denied reports by Russian news media that the
Iranian government - which, like Turkey's, has vehemently protested against
the Armenian attacks - has already sent troops into Azerbaijan itself.
A spokesman for the Turkish government said after a cabinet meeting that
'the continuation of Armenia's occupation (of parts of Azerbaijan)' and
Iran's build-up towards the Azeri border 'are the first concern of Turkey'.
Mr Yildirim Aktuna, quoted by the Turkish Anatolian agency, said that Iran
was setting up a 20km security zone on the Azeri-Iranian border to contain
the Azeri refugees who are reported to be flooding into the area.
Iran forms all of the southern border of Azerbaijan except for a small strip
of Turkey.
Forces from the Armenian-dominated Nagorno Karabakh region within
Azerbaijan, which has declared independence from the former Soviet republic
and has since been fighting to claim it, have taken a great swathe of
territory to the west of the republic, which has resulted in a de facto
attachment of Karabakh to Armenia.
In the past few days, the Azeri troops have surrendered the towns of
Cebrayil and Kubatli - leaving only the town of Zangelan, in the extreme
south-west tip, still in Azeri hands.
These reverses in the face of Armenian-Karabakh forces which have advanced
steadily on all fronts for three months appears to have played into the
hands of Mr Gaidar Aliev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan, who deposed
President Abulfaz Elchibey in June.
Mr Aliev, a veteran former first secretary of the Azeri Communist party, may
attempt to use negotiations to stop the haemorrhage of his territory.
The Armenians may be willing to negotiate independent status for Karabakh on
the return of land, or may now be prepared to defend their gains against the
obviously reluctant fighters of Azerbaijan.
The people of Karabakh yesterday celebrated 'independence day' - two years
since the day the independence of the enclave, and its 'reunification' with
Armenia. A Karabakh spokesman told Interfax that, in five years of conflict
with the Azeris, the area had lost 70 per cent of its basic industries, two
thirds of its crops and 90 per cent of its cattle. Nearly one third of its
population are refugees or homeless.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Poles queue to get their share: Christopher Bobinski on how
ordinary people's savings have fuelled the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ARTUR Nagorka, one of many Poles attracted to the Warsaw Stock Exchange
by several months of apparently endless share price increases, breathed a
sigh of relief yesterday as prices resumed their upward march after a
dizzying 20 per cent fall at the beginning of the week.
It was only last week that the 27-year-old Mr Nagorka, who works as a bulk
cargo forwarder for a western company, brought a wad of zloty notes worth
the equivalent of Dollars 1,500 into the broking office of Warsaw's Food
Economy Bank (BGZ). He invested the lot in shares in Wedel, the
confectionery producer controlled by PepsiCo Foods International.
Like thousands of ordinary Poles whose savings have been fuelling a
six-month boom on Warsaw's two-year-old stock exchange, he took the decision
to risk his entire savings after noticing the money that others were making.
'I did not come in before because I don't think I really have a gift for
this kind of thing,' he said last week. 'But with the banks only offering 3
per cent a year for hard currency deposits and 30 per cent on zloty savings
accounts it seems a sensible gamble to invest when stocks are rising by 30
per cent a week.'
Last Thursday, the day Mr Nagorka bought his shares, the stock exchange's
WIG index hit a new high of 7471.1 after rising 550 per cent since the boom
began just before Easter. Turnover that day hit a record 1,227bn zlotys
(Pounds 41m) for the 19 stocks quoted.
At the next session, on Monday this week, turnover stayed high at 1,003bn
zlotys, but most stocks fell to within a whisker of the 10 per cent maximum
decline allowed under the WSE trading rules.
The plunge continued on Tuesday and it was only yesterday that all but one
stock bounced back close to the 10 per cent ceiling. This 'yo-yo' effect,
says Mr Nagorka, is worrying him, but he's holding on to his stock and other
new investors are continuing to bring their savings into the front offices
of Poland's 30 licensed brokers.
Mr Tadeusz Gacyk, the deputy head of the BGZ's broking office says his bank
alone is registering more than 300 new investors a day and 'doubling the
number of our clients every three weeks'. Overall, at the end of July there
were 102,000 investors in the country with the number growing by 5,000 a
month.
Share investment under these circumstances has spawned some novel assessment
techniques. 'I shall sell when I see the daily queue of new investors
outside a nearby broker disappear,' says one investor who has long abandoned
more traditional methods such as studying price earnings ratios, which now
stand at around 18.
The boom started when the banks lowered interest rates earlier this year and
people began to look elsewhere for a home for at least some of their Dollars
14.3bn worth of household savings. At the same time foreign investors,
including investment and pension funds as well as banks such as
Creditanstalt, began to purchase shares, setting the upward escalator in
motion.
Official estimates put foreign ownership of stock at about 30 per cent of
the WSE's current Dollars 1.5bn capitalisation. But small domestic savers
have been providing the real momentum behind the market. The Polish
authorities have even been asking foreign investors to hold off their
purchases. 'We want them to wait and then come in when prices start coming
down to stabilise the market,' says one senior financial official.
The government, meanwhile, has failed to take advantage of the growth in
demand for shares on the WSE to speed up the privatisation of state-owned
enterprises. It has offered no more than a handful for sale through a public
offering in the past six months. But private sector companies have been
equally slow in coming to the market to raise funds through fresh equity
issues.
This reticence is partly caused by the time consuming application
formalities of the Securities Commission, admits its chairman, Mr Leslaw
Paga. But the main cause for hesitation is the reluctance of both foreign
and domestic companies to subject their finances to public scrutiny, or
suffer the partial loss of control a flotation implies.
As for Mr Nagorka, the last few days have made him more fully aware of the
risks. Last week he was confident of making a profit. This week's spin on
the WSE's roller coaster has dented that belief: 'Originally I'd been
planning to sell the shares when I'd doubled my investment, now I think I
may sell sooner,' he says.

The association representing the 90 airlines using Germany's airports has
lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission's competition
directorate over alleged anti-competitive practices at Hamburg airport,
writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The complaint from the Board of Airline Representatives in Germany (Barig)
follows a complaint from seven EC airlines about alleged abuse of
ground-handling monopolies at Milan, Frankfurt and a number of Spanish
airports.
The move is designed to highlight the lack of competition in ground-handling
services at Germany's airports as a whole.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Brussels turning against welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is swinging in favour of recommending that some EC
welfare policies be cut back because they discourage job creation.
Accounts emerging of a closed 'seminar' commissioners held on Wednesday, to
prepare a White Paper on EC competitiveness, growth and unemployment,
indicate that the free-market element in the Commission is starting to seize
the initiative.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, who at a meeting of French
Socialists last weekend called for a European social pact to fight
unemployment, contributed little to the debate, according to officials.
But Mr Martin Bangemann, the German liberal in charge of industry, Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, the German Christian Democrat responsible for the EC budget,
Sir Leon Brittan, the British Conservative commissioner for trade, and Mr
Abel Matutes, the Spanish conservative in charge of energy and transport
policy, all pushed hard for a strategy based on cutting EC social security
costs, keeping down wages, and labour market flexibility.
They found substantial support, officials say.
Mr Bangemann urged more short-term employment contracts, arguing that the
crisis was driving Europe back to 'tribal politics'. Mr Schmidhuber and Mr
Matutes said Europe's welfare system discouraged people from working, while
Sir Leon said there was nothing wrong with lower wages, the official said.
Only Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian Socialist competition commissioner, and
Mr Padraig Flynn, commissioner for social and employment policy from
Ireland's Fianna Fail party, took issue with this.
Mr Van Miert warned that cutting wages and social wages in real terms would
reduce demand. Mr Flynn argued that with three-quarters of EC jobs in
sectors not subject to international competition, there was little profit to
be had from reducing the earning power of those who held them.

FT  03 SEP 93 / German health care system in recovery: Insurance surplus
after spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S loss-making health care system has recorded a rare surplus
following strict curbs on health spending introduced earlier this year, Mr
Horst Seehofer, the federal health minister, announced yesterday.
State-subsidised health insurance schemes, which finance health care for 90
per cent of Germans, recorded a DM2.6bn (Pounds 1.04bn) surplus in the first
six months of the year after reporting a DM9bn loss last year.
Health spending per person covered by the schemes decreased by 2.7 per cent
for the period after increasing in 1992 by 9.2 per cent.
'The health insurance system is now healthy again. We have succeeded in
changing the behaviour of everyone involved in the health care system and in
proving that genuine structural changes are possible,' Mr Seehofer said at a
press conference.
Expenses for general medical treatment fell by 2.1 per cent in the first
half of the year while spending on dental care dropped by 2 per cent.
More than 20 per cent less was spent on medicines. Spending on auxiliary
health treatment such as massages went down by 10.2 per cent. The health
minister hailed the decreases as the result of a hard-fought reform of the
German health care system which came into effect last January.
He said that he was hopeful that reforms would result in targeted savings in
state subsidies of DM10bn.
Steady increases in health care spending in recent years prompted German
politicians to unite in a rare show of cross-party support last year and
introduce unpopular reforms of the system.
The reforms include severe budget ceilings for medicines and treatment
prescribed by doctors and hospitals. Expenses incurred above those levels
must be borne by patients, although heavy fines can be imposed upon doctors
prescribing superfluous treatment.
The reforms have been attacked by the whole medical profession, including
the country's dentists who have had to reduce their expenses by 35 per cent
this year, partly as a result of the reform eliminating treatment 'not
necessary to health care'.
The German federation of dentists yesterday said that patients were merely
holding back from obtaining needed treatment because they feared having to
pay for it.
The dentists also warned that the reduction in health spending was only
temporary.
The reforms, which also list drugs which can no longer be covered by the
national health system, have infuriated the German pharmaceutical industry.
The industry claims that the policies being followed by the government in
Bonn are largely responsible for the drastic decline in their revenues this
year.

FT  03 SEP 93 / British Gas faces curb on expansion: Ofgas says UK customers
must not pay for any losses abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS'S ambitious overseas expansion programme would be severely
curtailed under controversial plans put forward by the industry regulator.
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, wants to put a 'ring-fence' around the
Pounds 1.2bn profits that British Gas makes from supplying household
customers to protect them from any costs associated with high-risk overseas
projects.
The regulator, which has presented draft proposals to the company, is
worried that UK domestic customers could end up paying for project failures
abroad. 'Rather than success abroad keeping the home fires burning, we're
worried that disaster abroad could put the home fires out,' said Mr Greg
McGregor, director of competition and tariffs at Ofgas, echoing British
Gas's current advertising campaign.
But Mr McGregor stressed that he had no reason to believe British Gas's
overseas projects would fail.
If agreed by the government, the move would deal a significant blow to the
company, which has looked to growth abroad as a way of increasing its
profits at a time when its UK business is being eroded by increased
competition.
The company has invested Pounds 1.5bn in other countries since its
privatisation in 1986 and plans to spend a similar amount over the next few
years.
British Gas said recently that the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry would force the company to put greater emphasis on its
overseas interests. The commission recommended in its conclusions last month
that the company sell off its trading arm by 1997 and lose its monopoly over
household supply by 2002.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said he had not seen any
Ofgas proposals. 'But if they're saying the whole of our UK cashflow should
be ring-fenced that would be the cause of grave concern to us,' he said. The
issue is likely to exacerbate the already tense relationship between British
Gas and Ofgas which resulted in the monopolies inquiry last year.
The publication of the monopolies commission's full 2,000 page report on
Monday will show that British Gas called for a complete revamp of
regulation.
Ofgas says its ring-fence plans, which were presented to British Gas in
draft form at the end of last week, are a direct result of the monopolies
commission report.
The commission recommended that the company separate all 'treasury
functions' between its respective divisions.
Mr McGregor said the company had nothing to fear from the ring-fence
proposals as long as its projects overseas were on a secure and viable
footing.
British Gas could continue to invest in overseas businesses if Ofgas's
proposals were adopted but it would need to fund more investment on a
project finance basis which could involve taking on more debt.
British Gas is involved in negotiating a giant gas project in Kazakhstan
which would involve investment of Dollars 3bn over 10 years. Mr Rogerson
said the company's overall cash exposure would be less than Dollars 3bn and
expected it could be provided on a project finance basis.

FT  03 SEP 93 / German recovery plan urges return to traditional values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will today appeal for popular support for government
plans to protect Germany's future prosperity through a return to the more
diligent values and attitudes which helped the country recover after the
second world war.
Proposals for privatisation, de-regulation and reform of the costly social
security system are the main features of a 96-page discussion document,
approved by the coalition cabinet yesterday.
'The virtues of public-spiritedness, solidarity and acceptance of technical
progress appear not to have the importance they once had in German
thinking,' it says. Germans 'have lost their readiness to accept change and
renewal. The postwar generation did not concentrate only on their rights but
also on their responsibilities'.
The paper, prepared by the economics ministry, calls for a shake-out of
virtually all the country's economic and social institutions. It identifies
weaknesses in the education system, an overstaffed civil service, and rigid
pay and conditions structures which bar the unemployed from returning to
work.
It also calls for an end to over-restrictive planning controls on industrial
plant construction and for reform of laws limiting shop-opening hours.
Mr Kohl will endorse the programme at a press conference in Bonn today.
The widely leaked document, 'Securing the future of Germany's economic
base', was attacked by the Social Democrat opposition as a declaration of
the bankruptcy of the government's economic policy. The OTV public services
union said whoever followed its recommendations was heading for a 'fiasco'.
'Yesterday's recipes' were no help in mastering Germany's current problems,
said the DAG white-collar union.
The paper is the government's latest attempt to get to grips with the
structural weaknesses exposed first by unification with the former East
Germany and latterly by the onset of recession.
This year federal, state and local government spending is expected to
account for 52 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 48 per cent
before unification.
Proposals include the targeting of social benefits on those most in need,
tenancy law reforms to encourage private investment in housing, and a
shortening of time at school from 13 to 12 years.
Subsidies to fading industries such as coal mining should be progressively
reduced or stopped five years from now.
The state should also withdraw from services where the private sector can
perform better: transport, water, power, rubbish collection and housing.

FT  03 SEP 93 / PLO seeks joint Arab signing of peace accords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PALESTINE Liberation Organisation said yesterday it wanted Syria, Jordan
and Lebanon to sign preliminary peace agreements with Israel at the same
time as its own accord on interim self-rule.
The move is an attempt to assuage anger among the other Arab participants to
the Middle East peace talks at having been bypassed in secret negotiations
which led to the PLO-Israeli accord.
Mr Hakam Balawi, a close aide of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in
Tunis: 'We are making efforts for the agreements to be signed at the same
time.' PLO and Israeli officials have said they hoped to sign a joint
declaration of principles - governing Palestinian self-rule and providing
for Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho
 -in Washington as early as next week.
The PLO's call came after King Hussein, the Jordanian ruler, called for an
Arab summit to discuss the imminent PLO-Israeli deal and co-ordinate an Arab
response. In a television interview broadcast in Jordan last night, the king
expressed deep disappointment at having not been consulted before the
PLO-Israel deal, and said: 'We in Jordan do not accept the imposition of any
agreement . . . we are not a party to.'
Jordan is particularly worried about potential security implications of the
deal, fearing that any violent opposition to it could spark an influx of
Palestinians from the West Bank. 'If things deteriorate among the various
Palestinian groups over what to do with Gaza-Jericho, then people will seek
refuge in Jordan, which we cannot accept,' a senior official said in Amman.
There was no immediate response to the king's call for a summit yesterday,
which follows his departure for urgent talks in Damascus on hearing of the
PLO-Israeli breakthrough. But diplomats said Lebanon and Syria share the
king's anger at being bypassed in the PLO-Israeli talks and that all three
states will want to digest both the details of the accord and the extent of
Palestinian opposition to it before taking any further steps in the resumed
Washington peace talks.
Mr Fares Bouez, Lebanon's foreign minister, held talks in Damascus with Mr
Farouk al-Sharaa, his Syrian counterpart, after which he said they had
agreed 'on the importance of continued, deepened and higher co-ordination'.
Syrian officials refused to comment on either the PLO-Israeli deal or King
Hussein's call for a meeting.
But while diplomats said Lebanon, Jordan and Syria were likely to try to
forge a united front on the agreement, most believed the trio would have
little choice but to join the strong momentum Israel and the PLO have
created behind their accord.
Jordan and Syria are close to agreeing on texts for declarations of
principle to guide their own negotiations with Israel. Jordanian officials
said this week they could foresee signing a joint 'agenda' with Israel
during the present session of the Washington talks.
Syrian negotiators in Washington said they hoped they could reach
preliminary agreement with Israel next week.
Meanwhile, in a sign of the potential for violence in the occupied
territories, Palestinian gunmen yesterday shot dead an Israeli soldier and
slightly wounded another in the West Bank town of Hebron.
Israeli officials blamed the attack on fundamentalist Islamic militants who
have branded the peace agreement as a betrayal of the Palestinian struggle.

FT  03 SEP 93 / Howard ready to privatise 10 more prisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 10 prisons in England and Wales are to be run by the private
sector to complete the first phase of the government's privatisation
programme, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced yesterday.
With two prisons privately managed already, this would bring to 12 the
number of prisons run by the private sector. Prisons of all types -
including maximum security prisons holding terrorists - will be included in
the programme.
Mr Howard said his aim in the first phase was to have around 10 per cent of
the 132 prisons run by private companies. This would create a viable private
sector of three or four companies competing with directly managed
establishments.
The government is also to investigate using private finance to build new
prisons. The Prison Service will invite bids from the private sector to
finance, design, build and manage a new prison on Merseyside and another in
south Wales. This will be one of the first fruits of the private finance
initiative launched last year to attract private capital for public sector
projects.
The announcement drew renewed attacks from the opposition, prison staff and
penal reformers. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, described the plans
as 'a diversion of time and energy from the real task of penal reform and
fighting crime'.
The Prison Officers Association, representing more than 25,000 officers,
warned of possible industrial action because of overcrowding and inadequate
staff as a result of government policies. One action being considered is to
refuse to accept new inmates into prisons, forcing their detention in police
cells.
The Howard League for Penal Reform said that commercialising prison
management weakened accountability to parliament. Mr Brendan O'Friel,
chairman of the Prison Governors' Association, said there were serious
doubts about the success of private sector involvement.
However, the announcement was welcomed by companies in the fledgling private
prison sector. Mr Jim Harrower of Group 4, which runs the Wolds remand
prison on Humberside, said the opportunity to win further contracts would
give the company 'critical mass' in the field.
The first five privately managed prisons will be newly built. The Wolds
prison and Blakenhurst prison in Hereford and Worcester have already opened
under private management. The contract to run the new Doncaster prison goes
out to tender later this month and the contracts for the Merseyside and
south Wales prisons will be let next year.

FT  02 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Dixon Motors runs ahead of
projections with Pounds 642,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 3rd September 1993) appended to this article.
DIXON MOTORS, the Hull-based motor retailer which joined the USM via a
reversal into Plateau Mining earlier this year, returned pro forma pre-tax
profits of Pounds 642,000 for the half year ended June 30.
The figure was ahead of the directors' expectations and came on turnover of
Pounds 29m, up from Pounds 20.4m.
They said the advance reflected an improved performance in all areas of the
business, with total car sales for the period ahead by 62 per cent at 3,449
units.
The group's year-end has been changed to December 31. Consolidated results
for the nine months ended June 30 showed profits at Pounds 77,000.
The directors said these figures were not particularly meaningful and
comprised nine months contribution from Plateau and five weeks from Dixon.
As forecast, an interim dividend of 0.75p is being paid subject to High
Court approval of a capital restructuring.
The second half of the year had started well, with July and August ahead of
management projections. The group is to raise about Pounds 1.69m of
additional working capital via an issue of new ordinary shares.
Plateau Mining was formerly a natural resources group which had been
fighting a hostile bid.
CORRECTION
Dixon Motors raised Pounds 1.69m in a share placing in May. Yesterday's
edition incorrectly reported it was to raise the sum.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Thai road plan dispute worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR TAKAO Ninomiya knew his Dollars 1bn elevated motorway project was in
trouble when he received more than three weeks' notice from the police of a
demonstration against his company by angry motorists.
A dispute between Thailand's Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA)
and the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) - the Japanese-led contractors'
consortium of which Mr Ninomiya is managing director - came to a head this
week when the ETA, citing the possibility of violence by frustrated drivers,
won a court order for the immediate opening of the completed stretch of
motorway.
Many residents of Bangkok, believing the new 20km road would relieve the
city's notorious traffic congestion, were delighted.
But investors and bankers were enraged by what they regard as bullying
tactics by the Thai authorities, and said international financing for some
Dollars 30bn of planned Thai infrastructure projects would be jeopardised.
BECL and its main shareholder Kumagai Gumi did not want the motorway opened
until the dispute over revenue-sharing and other matters was resolved.
BECL's advisers say the road, which could be opened today by Mr Chuan
Leekpai, prime minister, has not even been officially certified as safe.
Behind the posturing lies a fundamental dispute over the contract, which
BECL believed to be a 30-year build-operate-transfer deal (although Mr
Sukavich Rangsitpol, ETA governor, insists BECL should transfer legal
control to the ETA immediately).
BECL is concerned about the late delivery of land for future parts of the
road by the ETA, and about who will collect toll fees and handle the cash,
although a dispute over the level of the tolls themselves appears to have
been resolved after the cabinet agreed to the 30 baht (Dollars 1.20) per car
fee established in the contract.

Mr Freeh, 43, a former FBI agent who later served as a federal prosecutor
and judge in New York City, was nominated by President Bill Clinton in July
to replace Mr William Sessions, who had been appointed by former President
George Bush. Mr Sessions was fired by Mr Clinton for weak leadership and
abusing the privileges of his office.
Mr Clinton said he hoped the FBI in the 1990s would become best known for
cracking down on drug lords and terrorists.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela's suspended president, said yesterday he
would appeal to the Supreme Court against Congress's decision to block him
from returning to office even if he is acquitted on corruption charges,
writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
A joint session of the Congress voted on Tuesday night to make permanent
last May's suspension of Mr Perez from the presidency following allegations
of embezzlement and misuse of public funds. Congress also voted to ratify
the interim chief executive, Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez as interim president,
and authorised him to serve out the remaining five months of Mr Perez's
term. Earlier in the day the high command of the Venezuelan armed forces
restated their support for President Velasquez.
Mr Perez, who began his five-year term as president in February 1989, was
suspended from office on May 21 after the Supreme Court and the Senate voted
that there was just cause to try him for alleged mishandling of Dollars 17m
in funds from a secret government account used for security and defence
operations. Mr Velasquez took over as interim president on June 5.
Tuesday's voting broke down along party lines, with Mr Perez's Democratic
Action party (AD) voting against the move. A group of small political
parties joined forces with the Christian Democrat party (Copei) to oust Mr
Perez, who must still face the corruption charges.
The unprecedented congressional action raised questions about the
constitutionality of permanently removing an elected president from office
before judicial proceedings against him are completed, and could set a
precedent for a similar action in the future. Supporters of Mr Perez called
the congressional decision unconstitutional and an act of political revenge.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco has become embroiled in a growing row with
Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, governor of Brazil's most important state, Sao
Paulo, and a senior figure in the PMDB party, the government's biggest
backer in Congress.
The argument started when the president sacked one of Mr Fleury's political
allies last week, after an internal squabble at the country's development
bank. On Tuesday another supporter of Mr Fleury, Mr Jose Antonio Barros
Munhoz, resigned as agriculture minister in sympathy, raising fears that the
PMDB, with five ministers in the president's cabinet, would withdraw its
support.
Party leaders appeared yesterday to be trying to avoid confrontation, saying
they would decide at their national convention in 10 days' time whether to
continue supporting the government. Some PMDB members have said their
support would depend on being given a more active role in formulating
economic policy. Withdrawal of PMDB support would leave the government
without a working majority in Congress.

FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed worries about profit margins and pricing, and the competitive
onslaught from rivals Mercury and Cellnet, were only some of the reasons
behind the latest steep fall in Vodafone yesterday.
The shares, which have risen virtually in a straight line from 434p in July
to a record 585p only last week, dropped 23 1/2 to 547 1/2 p yesterday,
having touched 544p at one stage, for a two-day loss of 31 1/2 p. Turnover
was a strong 9.6m shares.
Telecoms specialists said the latest tumble in the shares came as SG Warburg
shifted its stance on the stock to hold, triggering a flurry of US selling.
US investors have been the main buyers of Vodafone stock this year, boosting
their holding from well below the 20 per cent mark to well above 25 per
cent. 'With the US buying drying up, and with UK institutions sellers for
the last six weeks or so, the shares were bound to fall,' said one dealer.
There was also plenty of downward pressure on the share price following some
aggressive activity in the traded options market, where Vodafone was the
fifth most active stock option with 919 contracts traded. One of the big US
houses was said to have been a big buyer of put options.
Active buying ahead of today's interim figures boosted aero-engine
manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The shares added 6 at 163 1/2 p on good volume of
5.2m. There were vague whispers late in the session that today's results may
be accompanied by a rights issue.
NatWest Securities predicts profits of Pounds 35m, against Pounds 20m a year
earlier, and expects the company to rebase the dividend, paying 1.95p at the
interim stage and 3.55p at the finals to make a total of 5.5p.
Provident Financial was up 9 at 452p, after 460p, following the almost
doubled profits and sharply increased dividend.
HSBC suffered a belated reaction to the interim results, with a number of
bank analysts shaving their profits forecasts. NatWest Securities, telling
clients to reduce weightings, lowered their 1993 forecast from Pounds 2.44bn
to Pounds 2.325bn and that for 1994 from Pounds 2.77bn to Pounds 2.55bn.
Lehman Brothers reduced its 1994 estimate from Pounds 2.55bn to Pounds 2.5bn
and said Standard Chartered 'looks better value'. HSBC dipped 7 1/2 to 726
1/2 p while Standard Chartered rose 8 to 938p.
Schroders, reporting interims tomorrow, was the pick of a generally firm
merchant banking sector, the ordinary shares settling 47 up at 1315p and the
non-voting stock 70 higher at 1283p.
Composite insurances were broadly lower with the exception of Sun Alliance,
which improved 2 to 387p on talk of good news accompanying the interim
figures this morning. Sun Alliance shares have been weakened in recent weeks
by suggestions that the group may be seeking to raise capital via a rights
issue.
Poor results from Invergordon, the whisky distiller, saw the shares drift
back, although hopes of the long awaited return of Whyte &amp; McKay as a
predator kept the fall to a minimum. The US drinks group has a 41 per cent
stake in Invergordon following a failed bid two years ago.
'Today's results will do nothing to put off Whyte,' said one analyst, adding
that the US group will probably wait in the hope that the Invergordon price
will fall back before mounting a fresh attack. The shares retreated 9 to
286p.
Whitbread was at the centre of good two-way action as Smith New Court and
UBS were both said to have downgraded the drink and retail group. Kleinwort
Benson had issued a strong buy recommendation on Tuesday. Yesterday, the 'A'
shares dropped but later rallied to close just 2 off at 542p.
Among leisure stocks, Rank Organisation announced that it had sold off more
of its hotels, analysts putting a figure of Pounds 27m on the deal, or
around Pounds 50,000 a room. The shares steadied on the news, closing a net
11 off at 785p. Owners Abroad appointed a new chairman to succeed Mr Howard
Klein, who resigned after the recent profits warning. The shares rose 3 to
87p.
Textile group Courtaulds recovered from a 17p fall to close 5 down at 559p.
The company was upbeat about trading prospects, and was behind a 6 1/2 rise
in Marks and Spencer to 383 1/2 p, according to dealers.
Renewed talk of a price war in the food retail sector was said to be
responsible for the poor performance of the leading stocks yesterday. Argyll
Group lost 9 to 332p, Kwik Save 6 to 741p, J. Sainsbury 6 to 507p and Tesco
7 to 230p. Asda was helped by a buy recommendation and upgrade from NatWest
Securities, the broker believing that improving trading will be reflected in
better figures. It is forecasting Pounds 199m for the current year, up
Pounds 13m from its previous estimate, and Pounds 216m, up Pounds 9m, for
1994. The shares shaded just a quarter to 65 3/4 p.
Worries of further rationalisation in the bakery industry, together with a
broker sell recommendation, was said to have undone Associated British
Foods, off 7 at 511p.
Strong US buying was said to be behind the rise in both Glaxo, up 20 at
614p, and Zeneca, ahead 13 at 727p. SmithKline Beecham was under pressure
from a profits downgrade in London, said by dealers to be from NatWest, and
the shares lost 7 to 437p.
Suggestions that cuts in UK defence spending may halt plans for the mid-life
update of the Tornado aircraft returned to the market, weakening British
Aerospace, which is due to carry out the programme. The shares gave up 10 to
436p.
Higher interim profits helped Senior Engineering harden 3 to 119 1/2 p.
Half-time losses of Pounds 52.6m at Simon Engineering and passing of the
dividend left the shares down 15 at 58p.

FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: BPB setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of the resignation of BPB's chief executive, Mr John Maxwell, after
less than a year in office was badly received in the City and was followed
by a steep decline in BPB shares.
Dealers said Mr Maxwell's resignation, 'by mutual agreement', according to
the company, had come as a bolt from the blue and had been interpreted as
very bearish news by the market. 'It seems the company has lost direction,'
said one leading building sector analyst.
He added that Mr Maxwell was viewed by the big institutions as 'a breath of
fresh air' at BPB, and much more concerned with making profits rather than
opening new plants. 'There is a very real worry that BPB will embark on a
campaign to increase market share, with all that entails,' he said.
Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman, formerly chairman and chief executive until
succeeded by Mr Maxwell last year, will reassume the joint role until a
successor to Mr Maxwell is found. Analysts said it was likely that having
unsuccessfully tried an external appointment to the chief executive post it
was likely the position would be filled internally.
BPB ended 16, or 6.5 per cent, down at 232p, after touching 229p. Earlier
this month the shares reached their highest level, 252 1/2 p, since
late-1989. Turnover was a heavy 4.8m.

FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Upset for Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROFITS warning from Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweetener group, produced
a sharp reversal in the shares, which finished the session as the worst
performing Footsie listed stock. The company blamed tight margins in the US
sweetener business as the primary reason for the warning, which prompted an
immediate swathe of profits downgrades from food manufactur-ing analysts.
Most cut their forecasts by Pounds 20m for the current year to around Pounds
220m. For 1993-94, the market range is Pounds 245m to Pounds 255m, about 8
per cent down from the previous figures. The downgrades were accompanied by
most brokers turning cautious on the stock, with the feeling among analysts
that the shares will be vulnerable to further falls as they undergo a
rerating.
There was also some consternation at the volatile run the shares have had in
recent sessions - including the biggest ever recorded daily turnover last
week with over 10m shares traded. Yesterday, volume was a very hefty 6.6m,
with the shares tumbling 25 to 375p.

FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING in the derivatives, the first signs of which was seen on
Tuesday, gathered momentum yesterday sending the futures contract into
retreat, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,102 turned
out to be lower than many traders had predicted, setting the tone for the
rest of the morning.
Continuous selling mainly from independent traders saw September not only
test the 3,096 resistance level, but to actually break through it to fall to
a day's low of 3,078.
However, during the afternoon, a firm Wall Street helped dealers turn more
positive and sporadic buying from some of the larger institutions helped
September reduce earlier losses, and pull the under lying cash market
higher.
It finished at 3,094, 14 lower than its previous close and about 7 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Volume in September was 9,465,
while that in the December contract was just over 2,000 contracts.
The traded options had a lacklustre session in which volume declined to
21,602, against Tuesday's 29,659. Around half of the day's total was dealt
in the index options with 8,151 in the FT-SE 100 and a more modest 2,181
lots done in the Euro FT-SE 100.
Ladbroke was the busiest stock option ahead of today's figures, trading
2,181 contracts.

FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses halved in late recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTED shakeout in the UK stock market got under way yesterday after
the first round of trading news from this week's company reporting list gave
the signal for increased profit-taking. Falls in share prices were
emphasised by the readiness of marketmakers to strike prices lower in the
hope of picking up cheap stock, and by the absence of the US buyers who
provided the impetus for last week's rise to an all-time peak on the FT-SE
100 Index.
Traders were not pleased by reports on trading progress at Tate &amp; Lyle, and
the shares fell sharply. The departure of the chief executive of BPB
Industries was also taken badly by the stock market. The market was soon
sliding lower and by mid-session, the Footsie showed a fall of nearly 30
points to the 3,070 area. The loss of the 3,100 mark had been widely seen as
a distinct possibility but traders were glad to see a recovery set in
yesterday afternoon. The rally was helped by good performances from a
handful of blue chip stocks.
The recovery was encouraged by a rally in UK government bonds which replaced
early losses with very small gains at the longer end of the market. Strongly
rising prices for UK bonds have provided support for equities, as fund
managers have watched bond yields fall.
By the close, the FT-SE had virtually halved its early loss to show a final
reading of 3,085.1, a net 14.9 off on the session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index,
at 3,495.7, lost 16.5.
The late rally in equities was accompanied by a heartening increase in
trading volumes, which had been low when prices were falling. The day's Seaq
total of 612.2m shares compared with only 476.2m on Tuesday when the London
market was making a slow return from its three-day Bank Holiday weekend.
Tuesday's retail business was worth only Pounds 1.06bn, at the low end of
recent daily averages.
'It looked as if the US funds decided to let a bit of steam out of the
London market,' commented the head trader of a leading US securities broker
which acts for a number of transatlantic clients.
There was significant profit-taking in a number of the stocks recently
favoured by US investors, including Vodafone, the portable phone
manufacturer. A US firm was understood to be particularly active on the put
side of the London traded options market in Vodafone.
With a number of important companies reporting progress this week, sector
analysts were busy changing forecasts and urging investment moves across the
range of the stock market. The weakness in Tate &amp; Lyle raised new queries
over the decisions likely to be made at the next meeting of the FT-SE Index
committee which advises on additions and deletions from the 100 stocks
comprising the Index.
However, the final picture was more mixed than the fall in the Footsie
suggested. ICI benefited strongly from brokerage recommendation and there
were several firm features among the interest-related stocks.
Equity strategists were prepared to wait and see how far the market
correction will run. Mr Robin Aspinall, chart specialist at Panmure Gordon,
warned that 'even a bullish technical analyst' would expect a correction to
carry the Footsie back to 2,850.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores further falls in
bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended mostly flat to lower yesterday, in spite of further
declines in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.15 down at 3,645.10. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.41 to 463.15, while the American
SE composite edged up 0.37 to 458.97. Once again the Nasdaq composite
outperformed other indices, rising 3.31 to a record 746.15. Trading volume
on the New York SE totalled 246.6m shares.
Trading remained directionless for the third straight day, with dealers
blaming the subdued mood on an unwillingness among investors to become
involved ahead of the long holiday weekend, although some were reported to
be readjusting their portfolios for the start of the new month.
Falls in foreign markets, and early declines in bond prices, set the tone
for a downbeat opening. The day's economic news also failed to lift
sentiment - the National Association of Purchasing Management's August
report showed that manufacturing activity stalled last month. Analysts were
particularly worried by the decline in the NAPM's employment index, which
led some to revise downwards their expectations for August payrolls, which
will be unveiled in tomorrow's monthly employment report.
The day's other economic news - in July personal income fell 0.2 per cent,
personal spending rose 0.4 per cent and construction spending declined 0.5
per cent - provided contradictory evidence of the state of the economy, and
was largely ignored. Although bond prices rallied later in the day, sending
yields to new record lows, equities did not react, and remained trapped in a
narrow trading range just below opening values.
Honeywell dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 in volume of 1.5m shares
and Litton Industries put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 67 as investors reacted
to Tuesday's late news that a California jury had ordered Honeywell to pay
Dollars 1.2bn to Litton for patent violation. Honeywell later said it would
appeal.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 on reports
that it was considering spinning off three of its divisions into separate
companies. The stock later succumbed to selling, however, and ended down
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 66 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed. Microsoft
advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 76 3/4 and Sun Microsystems added Dollars
 7/8 at Dollars 27 1/8 , but Apple declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 26.
Internet Communications forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 5/8 after
announcing a big improvement in second-quarter earnings.
Canada
THE Toronto market opened lower but gradually improved through the day to
close with a small gain.
The TSE 300 index was finally 6.2 up at 4,143.7 as rises led falls by 372 to
348. Volume came to 51.2m shares. Most of the sub-groups showed little
movement, with seven higher and seven lower.
Federal Industries said it will sell 7m 'A' shares at CDollars 6.65 a share
to underwriters. The underwriters have an option for a further 700,000
shares at the same price. The 'A' stock slipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 6
7/8.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Poor results punished as
bourses take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking was the theme of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Tuesday's post-bourse fall as the DAX index dropped
26.31, or 1.4 per cent to 1,918.58.
Turnover fell from DM11bn to DM8.5n. Company results were punished again as
Linde, the engineer, fell DM31, or 3.7 per cent to DM810 after Tuesday's
interim report and Linotype, the printing machinery maker, dropped another
DM16 to DM358, down DM52 since Monday's half year loss.
Profit-taking hit most shares. Daimler, down DM15.50 at DM739.50 was said to
be additionally unsettled following news that its car making subsidiary,
Mercedes-Benz, was currently showing an internal operating loss.
Meanwhile the electricals leader, Siemens, attracted high trading volume and
a large buy order which pushed it up by DM5.50 to DM677.50 early in the day,
compared with its previous post-bourse close. But the rise did not stick,
and the shares closed DM4.50 lower on the official session, still relatively
strong, at DM672.50.
PARIS, beginning to grow a little impatient at the absence of a cut in
domestic interest rates, retreated 1 per cent as the CAC-40 index closed off
24.56 at 2,191.93. Turnover dropped from FFr4.7bn to FFr3.2bn.
While profit-taking was much in evidence, a 2.3 per cent fall in Elf
Aquitaine, which has a heavy weighting in the index, also depressed investor
confidence. The oil group's shares slipped FFr10.20 to FFr435.70 following
Tuesday's disappointing first half figures.
Club Mediterranee, the holiday group, attracted strong selling after warning
of second half losses, although some analysts remarked that there was an
element of over-reaction to the news, given the known difficulties currently
being experienced in the European leisure sector. The shares ended FFr31, or
7 per cent lower at FFr405.10.
LVMH and Schneider went against the trend with respective gains of FFr16 and
FFr10 to FFr4,340 and FFr799, the first on rumours of a possible
restructuring and the latter on possible index reweighting.
ZURICH gave a positive reception to flat half-year profits at Ciba-Geigy,
although analysts were not exactly impressed. The certificates rose SFr6 to
SFr704 although the SMI index was 19.8 down at 2,470.4 with Roche
certificates, the most active stock of the day, down SFr65 at SFr5,095.
Ascom, the telecoms equipment maker, continued to fall following Monday's
first-half-loss, ending SFr60 down at SFr1,070 for a drop of 19 per cent on
the week so far.
AMSTERDAM retreated in line with the trend elsewhere on the continent, the
CBS Tendency index closing 1.3, or almost 1 per cent down at 130.1.
Food and drink defied the falling market, with Heineken picking up 10 cents
to Fl 187.60, Bols Wessanen 40 cents to Fl 44.30 and CSM Fl 1.80 to FL
64.00. However, among the internationals, Unilever shed Fl 1.50 to Fl
202.40.
MARDID was as volatile on the downgrade as it was on the way up, the general
index dropping 8.03, or 2.6 per cent to 295.09. Turnover stayed high at
around Pta32bn.
Profit-taking was heavier than expected and hit banks and construction
shares most severely, Argentaria losing Pta300 to Pta5,900 and Uralita Pta
90, or more than 8 per cent to Pta1,000.
MILAN's foreign investors, in particular, decided that the time had come to
sell. The Comit index closed down 6.17 at 625.67: since the market's current
rally began in the middle of June the index has gained 23 per cent.
Brokers noted that the fall appeared to have been triggered by heavy selling
of Fiat stock late in the session, as the shares closed off L271 at L6,972.
Ferruzzi picked up L18.90 to L280 following Tuesday's approval by
shareholders of its capital restructuring plans.
STOCKHOLM offered a savage response to steep first half losses, a rights
issue and the planned disposal of a materials handling stake at Trelleborg,
the metals and industrial group, whose B shares fell by SKr5, or 8.5 per
cent to SKr53.50 as the Affarsvarlden General index dropped 19.30 to
1,262.10.
Turnover was high at Skr1.30bn. The bank and insurance sector index fell a
sharp 4.3 per cent on worries over the possibility of continued weakness in
the Swedish crown, which could dash hopes of interest rate cuts.
Handelsbanken A lost SKr8 at SKr125.
ISTANBUL ended a 12-day sequence of consecutive gains, the composite index
closing down 185.3 at 12,171.7 in turnover of TL1,100bn.
TEL AVIV rallied on peace hopes for the third day in succession, the blue
chip index putting on 4.64, or 2.2 per cent to 213.40 in turnover of
Shk332m.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim scores five
new highs as Nikkei declines

WEAK industrial production figures discouraged investors, and share prices
lost ground on profit-taking by financial institutions and index-linked
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average receded 73.30 to 20,953.30, its first decline in seven
trading days. It saw a day's low of 20,837.48 in the early afternoon, and a
high of 20,968.00 just before the close.
Volume eased from 377m shares to 367m. Declines led rises by 575 to 422,
with 176 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 3.68 to 1,689.41. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.17 up at
1,294.92.
Tuesday's industrial production data showed a fall of 0.3 per cent in July
from the previous month, down for a record 22nd time in succession. Rumours
that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut the official discount rate also
dampened sentiment.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, yesterday laid out steps to
deregulate Japanese industries, but investors do not expect the measures to
have an immediate impact; they were also disappointed by the lack of
concrete measures to boost the economy.
Financial institutions placed sell orders around the 21,000 level. However,
traders said foreign investors remained active buyers and that index-linked
buying by investment trusts was also supporting share prices.
Interest rate-sensitive banks were lower on profit-taking, Sumitomo Bank
losing Y20 at Y2,450. Telecommunications-related stocks were among the
gainers. Oki Electric moved ahead Y13 to Y569 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone advanced Y10,000 to Y970,000.
Mr Hosokawa's list of measures included assistance to home buyers,
encouraging purchases of housing shares. Shokusan Jutaku Sogo rose Y12 to
Y725 and Misawa Homes gained Y20 at Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 1.39 to 22,880.08 in volume of 50.2m shares.
Machineries and textiles were lower but regional banks and housing-related
issues firmed.
Roundup
FIVE equity markets in the region set new closing highs.
MANILA hit a new peak following a jump in Philippine Long Distance Telephone
(PLDT) on Wall Street. It rose Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 there,
followed by a 70 pesos gain to 1,270 at home, inspiring the composite index
to close 46.41, or 2.6 per cent, higher at 1,827.20.
Volume soared to 12.47bn shares from 1.81bn because of a special block sale
of Unioil Exploration. Turnover more than doubled, from 380.4m to 789.6m
pesos.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index set a new high, 14.9 ahead at 1,977.1, on a
takeover bid and good results. Turnover more than doubled, from ADollars
268.6m to ADollars 642.2m.
Gas producer Sagasco rose 21 cents, or 6 per cent, to ADollars 3.55 on the
Boral takeover bid. Santos, which owns 20 per cent of Sagasco, added 12
cents at ADollars 4.07 and Boral moved forward 11 cents to ADollars 3.56.
KUALA LUMPUR peaked again, the composite index rising 12.55 to 821.04 on
strong institutional buying of blue chips. The market heavyweights, Telekom
Malaysia, Tanjong, Genting and Tenaga Nasional, firmed between 20 and 50
cents each.
Promet again led activity, with 81.7m shares traded, accounting for 15 per
cent of the day's total volume. Rerated on its move into the oil and gas
sector, Promet closed 28 cents up at MDollars 2.17 after touching a high of
MDollars 2.34.
SINGAPORE inched to a new closing high of 2,012.78, up 4.12, on selective
buying. Brokers said activity was focused more on second-liners and
Malaysian shares traded on the OTC. JAKARTA peaked again and, while Astra
International stayed under pressure, the shares were unchanged at Rp17,000
as the JKSE index rose 5.52 to 422.83.
SEOUL rose late in the day on unconfirmed rumours that the South Korean
government would announce market-boosting measures, including an easing of
the 10 per cent limit on foreign share ownership.
The composite index rose 9.98 to 674.86. After hours, the government
announced a tax-cutting budget for 1994.
BANGKOK saw action in banks and property as the SET index advanced 15.73, or
1.6 per cent, to 978.91 in heavy turnover of Bt9.98bn.
Bangkok Bank rose Bt4 to Bt133 on foreign domestic buying and was the most
active stock, followed by Bangkok Land, Bt6 stronger at Bt109.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index fell 7.54 to 7,542.19 after some weakness in the
banking sector, where HSBC lost 50 cents to HKDollars 83.50 after interim
results late on Tuesday. In SHANGHAI, the Standard Chartered Securities B
Share index rose 2.73, or 4.7 per cent, to 61.43, up 9.5 per cent in four
straight gains, while Shenzhen B was down 0.38 at 61.15.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Divergences among emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were some wide fluctuations in performances among the world's emerging
markets last week, with South Korea losing all of the previous week's rise
and Indonesia once again doing well.
Among the Latin American markets, Brazil and Venezuela stood out, with
respective rises and falls, according to data supplied by the IFC, an
affiliate of the World Bank.
Indonesia is the third best performer in dollar terms among the markets
reviewed, and has recently been registering record highs in the local index,
helped by reasonably good interim reports and continuing foreign buying.
An uncertain economic outlook for South Korea has been affecting investor
sentiment there; while disappointment over the government's delay in
detailing proposals to boost market activity also contributed to the
market's depression last week.
Daiwa's latest Asian equity strategy review comments that the country's
export sector has been losing momentum, and the strike at Hyundai group
companies, which was finally settled late last month after 10 weeks of
disputes, has also had a negative effect on investment prospects.
Brazil's strong run came amid hopes for further fiscal reforms and built on
satisfaction over recent approval of the government's wages policy which, it
is hoped, will contain inflation. The situation in Venezuela, however,
remains negative, with investors unsettled by the current terrorist bombing
campaign, now in its sixth week.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Still tight in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS IN the sterling money market remained extremely illiquid
yesterday, with discount houses and clearing banks failing to offer bills to
the Bank of England in the earlier rounds of trading, writes James Blitz.
For the second day running, the overnight rate for lending sterling in the
wholesale cash market came close to 8 per cent as liquidity in the system
remained tight. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, but by
lunchtime yesterday less than half of this shortage had been removed.
In the afternoon, Pounds 983m was removed via the provision of band 1 and 2
bills at the prevailing rates. But the Bank of England provided dealers with
an unusually large level of late assistance - or emergency funding - to the
tune of Pounds 700m.
The shortages that the market has experienced lately are nothing new. They
are partly due to the draining of wholesale funds that accom-panied the Bank
of England's recent gilt auctions. The authorities have returned some of
these funds in their regular operations, but it will take time for the
def-icit to be completely removed.
However, one market dealer yesterday reiterated a long-standing complaint of
London dealers: that the system is increasingly dominated by one or two
clearing banks who have built up a large stock of eligible bills in recent
years.
He said these banks can sometimes hold back from offering bills to the
authorities with the aim of pushing up the cost of overnight lending and
improving the state of their balance sheets.
For the time being, the Bank of England continues to stand by the advantages
of a system in which commercial banks are far more deregulated than they are
on the Continent
In Europe, the focus of attention was on the fall in French franc interest
rate futures as dealers took the view that French rates would not come down
quickly. The December Pibor contract ended 18 basis points down at 92.83.
The March 1994 contract shed 15 points to 94.02.
In the German market, call money declined sharply as the new month started.
It dropped from Tuesday's level of 7.75 per cent to as low as 6.85 per cent
yesterday after the Bundesbank allocated DM56.8bn of liquidity into the
market, against DM48.9bn of expiring facilities.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar undermined by data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday after a spate of poor data raised new questions about the state of
the US economy, writes James Blitz.
The US currency was weakened after the White House revised down its forecast
for growth in the US economy in 1993 to 2.0 per cent from the 2.8 per cent
estimate given in April.
Compounding the gloom was a slight fall in the National Association of
Purchasing Managers Index, which slipped from July's 49.5 to 49.3 in August.
Personal income figures also showed a surprise 0.2 per cent dip, the first
month-on-month decline since 1954.
By contrast, the outlook for the German economy looked somewhat better, with
industrial production rising 0.5 per cent in July against forecasts of a
decline of 0.1 per cent. For those investors seeking a return on short-term
investments, German interest rates have remained on hold this week, with the
repo rate re-established at 6.80 per cent.
The overall impact of all this data was to push the dollar down to a low of
DM1.6560 in Europe, having opened at DM1.6680. Against the yen, the dollar
was more robust, closing at Y105.70 from a previous Y104.70. New York
trading ended with the dollar standing at DM1.6590 and Y105.35.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said the
dollar had probably seen its high for 1993 in last month's DM1.7480 level.
He believes that DM1.6490 is the next key chart point for the dollar. 'If it
breaks through that level, we should go down to DM1.59,' he added.
On the dollar/yen rate, Mr MacKinnon is far more upbeat on the US side,
suggesting that the Japanese currency has peaked. 'We should enter a trading
range of Y110 to Y115 before the end of the year,' he said.
However, the Japanese authorities announced yesterday that their foreign
exchange reserves had risen by some Dollars 8.79bn in August, the highest
monthly increase ever. The Japanese authorities will join the growing list
of central banks who have to sell dollars to rebalance reserves, keeping a
cap on the US currency.
In Europe, the D-Mark was somewhat stronger against most European currencies
as the Bundesbank appeared to be keeping interest rates on hold.
The French franc weakened to a close of FFr3.507 against the D-Mark from a
previous FFr3.495, but sterling finished at DM2.5025, up  3/4 pfennig on the
day.
The Belgian franc came under heavy pressure again after strong speculation
that its link with the D-Mark was to be further undermined and that foreign
exchange intervention would be suspended.
The currency dropped as low as BFr21.55 against the D-Mark at one stage. But
the Belgian central bank twice announced that it would maintain its strong
franc policy and the Belgian franc closed at BFr21.49.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE may relaunch raw sugar
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Commodity Exchange board will discuss the reintroduction of raw
sugar futures tomorrow following calls from some traders for a product to
replace the contract that was withdrawn in April.
The exchange's sugar futures market committee met yesterday to discuss the
possible launch of a new contract, which would be designed to trade at a
premium over New York's raw sugar futures .
Support for listing raw sugar futures in London has increased following a
dispute in the New York market over the delivery of Brazilian crystal sugar
as raw sugar. The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange decided to allow crystal
sugar to be delivered although many traders do not consider it to be raw
sugar.
'A lot of people in London would love to see another raw sugar contract, but
it would take a great deal of push to convince the rest of the world to use
it,' said Mr Chris Pack, sugar analyst at C. Czarnikow, the London trade
house.
Some traders fear that the LCE has lost the initiative by de-listing its
previous raw futures contract and that a new one will be hard to get off the
ground.
But by cashing in on disaffection in the New York market, the LCE could
garner international support for the new product. The previous raw futures
contract was withdrawn after it failed to make the transition back from
screen to floor trading and volume steadily dropped off.

<TEXT>
London robusta COFFEE futures fought their way back into the plus column by
the close of trading yesterday after sustaining another sharp decline in the
morning. The November position slipped to Dollars 1,245 a tonne at on stage,
repeating Tuesday's Dollars 20 fall, before ending at Dollars 1,263, up
Dollars 2 on the day. The rally was attributed to a steadier performance in
the New York arabica market and continuing concern about availability of
good quality beans for immediate delivery. The latter factor was reflected
in the widening of the September/November premium by Dollars 7 to Dollars 75
a tonne. COCOA prices also ended off the lows, but still down on the day.
Stronger sterling was putting pressure on the market as the December
position fell to Pounds 824 a tonne. Later the price rallied to Pounds 829 a
tonne, down Pounds 3 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange the three
months delivery ZINC price slid below the Dollars 890-a-tonne mark on
speculative selling, but then held relatively stable. It closed Dollars 2,25
down at Dollars 887.25 a tonne. The GOLD price failed to hold yesterday's
move above Dollars 370 a troy ounce, closing in London at Dollars 369.75 an
ounce, down Dollars 1.55 on the day.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile in two minds over copper
projects - David Pilling reports on differing official attitudes to a pair
of 'world class' mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING BETTER illustrates the tough decisions facing Codelco, Chile's huge
state-owned copper corporation, than the contrasting fortunes of its two
most prestigious development projects. While foreign companies are falling
over themselves to invest in El Abra mine, potentially the sixth largest in
the world, plans for Radomiro Tomic, which is at least as big, have been
indefinitely shelved.
The difference between the two mines is one of status. El Abra is considered
a new project, allowing Codelco, under legislation passed last year, to
develop it as a joint venture with foreign companies. Radomiro Tomic, on the
other hand, which lies close to the world's largest copper mine,
Chuquicamata, is classified as a replacement mine, and as such is
disqualified from joint-venture development, leaving Codelco with the
problem of finding the estimated Dollars 450m start-up cost. The chances of
this happening soon were severely dented in May when the finance ministry,
which directly controls Codelco's investment budget, refused to grant
sufficient funds.
Today, while executives attached to Radomiro Tomic twiddle their thumbs,
those involved in El Abra are frantically preparing bids in time for the 20
September deadline. 'El Abra has become Codelco's great hope now that
Radomiro Tomic has been snatched away,' says Mr Jason Webb, a Santiago-based
mining journalist.
There are 17 companies, including most of the big multinationals, competing
for the prize, which executives describe as the biggest copper mine for sale
in the world. The winner will take a 51 per cent stake in the project and is
expected to invest about Dollars 450m.
A pre-feasibility study carried out by Codelco found at least 500m tonnes of
oxide reserves and estimated annual production at around 120,000 tonnes of
copper cathodes over 20 years. Recently, the idea has been floated of
doubling the annual production and halving the mine's life, a strategy that
would involve a heftier initial investment.
Codelco, which intends to award the contract within two months of receiving
bids, hopes to start production by 1998. Once companies have been judged
technically proficient the contract will go to the highest bidder, according
to Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice president for development.
Mr Colin Sinclair, general manager of the Chilean division of Australia's
North Broken Hill Peko - which is bidding for the contract in partnership
with local Sociedad Minera Pudahuel - believes that Codelco will benefit
considerably from joint ventures of this type, in terms of both the
financial muscle and the technical knowledge brought in by the private
sector. 'The point of the joint venture is to get the copper industry moving
again, to get them back in the big league for which they need foreign
expertise,' says Mr Sinclair.
Mr Bande agrees that private-sector participation has an important role to
play in Codelco's future. 'The joint venture (in El Abra) will enable us to
develop a major project which had been sleeping in Codelco's hands owing to
our financial restrictions,' he says. Working alongside an established
foreign mining company 'can only enrich our experience and knowhow'.
Apart from El Abra, Codelco is negotiating exploration joint ventures for
six of its mining prospects and, according to Mr Bande, expects to open
negotiations for further joint ventures over the next few months. Foreign
interest remains high. 'Chile is elephant country,' says Mr Sinclair
referring to the quality and quantity of Chile's copper mines. 'If you want
to find an elephant, this is where you come.'
But, for the moment at least, one elephant, Radomiro Tomic, is safe from the
hunter's gun. The government's decision to withhold start-up funds - seen by
observers as a political, not a financial, decision - means that the mine,
described by officials as 'world class', cannot leave the drawing board.
It is understood that the government's refusal to authorise funds for
Radomiro Tomic stemmed from an unwillingness to pour money into new projects
until Codelco, which is far less efficient than its private-sector
counterparts, has demonstrated greater success in tightening its flabby
operations.
The administration's stalling tactics have triggered a debate about the
possible restructuring of Codelco to enable it to develop new mines. One
proposal was to break it up into autonomous divisions which would be allowed
to raise start-up capital as they saw fit. Another idea was to let Codelco
sell off its non-core businesses, such as the Tocopilla power station,
raising cash which could be reinvested in new operations.
Such proposals, seen by many as a form of privatisation by stealth, have met
stiff opposition from Codelco's strong unions and from politicians sensitive
to public opinion. Not even former President Augusto Pinochet dared to
privatise Codelco, which is viewed as a symbol of national pride.
Any immediate change in direction seems increasingly less likely as
December's presidential elections draw nearer. Even more improbable is fresh
legislation to extend joint-venture status to replacement mines such as
Radomiro Tomic.
In spite of the contrasting fates of El Abra and Radomiro Tomic, Mr Bande
insists that joint ventures are not necessarily the only way forward. 'The
ideal way to develop Codelco in the long term is to combine its wholly-owned
projects with those in which it has a joint venture partner,' he says. The
two strategies 'are not contradictory, but complementary'.
Observers say it is vital that Radomiro Tomic should not be 'permanently
paralysed' and that a decision is taken as quickly as possible. According to
one commentator: 'For every day lost, the project loses a little bit more of
its economic value'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minera Escondida expects proven
ore reserves to double

<TEXT>
Minera Escondida, owner of the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile, is
confident that the mine's proven ore reserves will double in the next year
to more than 1.3bn tonnes, according to its president, Mr John Hannah,
reports Reuter from Melbourne.
Mr Hannah said yesterday he expected drilling near the mine to prove enough
reserves to maintain its life at about 52 years in spite of a USDollars 276m
programme now under way to lift annual output.
Escondida, the world's third largest copper mine, is owned by Broken Hill
Proprietary of Australia (57.5 per cent), RTZ Corporation of the UK (30 per
cent), JECO, the Japanese smelter consortium, (10 per cent) and the
International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent).
Mr Hannah estimated that the production boost would cut the mine's original
life of 52 years by about half if no new reserves were found. 'In a general
way, our objective is to maintain a mine life of that order,' he said after
addressing a conference on South American mining.
But he was confident that drilling, which has started on the Colorado Grande
mountain near Escondida, would prove more of the 1.8bn tonnes resource,
which is graded 1.6 per cent copper.
Proven reserves at Escondida were now about 665m tonnes graded at 2.1 per
cent copper, he said, and results of the new drillings were expected to be
known some time next year.
He earlier told the conference that annual output at Escondida would be
expanded to 400,000 tonnes of refined copper a year by September this year
from 340,000 in the year to May 31, and then to 480,000 tonnes by September
1994.
Mr Hannah declined to comment on a study forecasting that Escondida's annual
output would rise to 618,000 tonnes by the year 2000. The study was
conducted by three officials of Codelco, the state-owned copper corporation.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper's day of reckoning
deferred

<TEXT>
A POTENTIALLY critical time in the London Metal Exchange's copper market -
when September traded options were declared - passed quietly yesterday but
traders suggested that a looming technical 'squeeze' had been rolled forward
to the October/December period.
'There is still the potential for mayhem in the market,' said Mr Wiktor
Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group. 'All
the big players (involved in the squeeze) appear to have rolled their
options positions into October, and some into December. And these situations
tend not to unwind themselves without doing some damage to some players.'
The LME board has voiced its concern about possible manipulation of its
'flagship' copper market to boost the price by twice giving warnings that it
has the authority to take any necessary action to maintain an orderly
market.
The situation is reminiscent of the technical squeeze in December, 1991,
which resulted in the LME board taking the unprecedented step of limiting
the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) to Pounds 25 a
tonne a day - until recently LME copper was quoted in sterling.
Last night the backwardation was Dollars 35.50 a tonne with cash metal
closing at Dollars 1,971 a tonne, down 50 cents, while three-month metal was
down Dollars 3 at Dollars 1,935.50.
Unusual activity has kept the copper market in turmoil for much of this
year. The price fell by one quarter in only five weeks, culminating in a 5
1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,705 a tonne in May. Several LME trading houses
suffered huge losses because of that collapse.
Traders suggest that Sumitomo, the Japanese group which is one of the
world's biggest traders in physical copper, now controls most of the
available LME copper stocks via option activity, even though stocks are at
their highest level for 15 years. But Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the senior manager
responsible for Sumitomo's copper trading operations, has denied any
manipulation is going on. He said the acute supply tightness was highly
technical and could be traced to the sharp fall in prices in May from which
there had to be some reaction.

KAZAKHSTAN MAY have to halt this year's harvest campaign because of severe
fuel shortages, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the deputy head of
Kaznefteprodukt state oil company as saying, reports Reuter from Moscow.
Mr Igor Medvedev, an official at the Russian energy ministry confirmed that
big Russian oil companies had refused to send oil to Kazakhstan because of
debts of about Rbs87bn (Pounds 60m).
Kazakhstan expects a grain harvest of about 30m tonnes this year, down from
last year's record 32m. The republic had harvested 5.76m tonnes of grain by
August 27, up from 5.16m a year earlier.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US dairymen turn against
marketing board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US DAIRY farmers, fighting a rearguard action against the introduction of
bovine somatotropin (BST), a genetically engineered hormone that increases
milk production, have turned their wrath on another target: the National
Dairy Board, which promotes the sale of the sector's products.
A Dairy Board drive to 'educate' the US public about the safe use of BST
infuriated whole groups of American producers. Already concerned that they
were not getting sufficient returns from the Dollars 75m they were paying
the board each year, they launched an angry campaign to 'Dump the Dairy
Board'.
After receiving a 16,000-signature petition from dairy farmers across the
country, Mr Mike Espy, the US Agriculture Secretary, called a referendum on
the Board's future for August 16. The result will be known some time this
month.
The Dairy Board was proposed by congress in 1983 and approved in a national
referendum of dairy farmers. Producers pay a 15 cent assessment on every
hundred-weight of milk sold - one-third funds the board's activities and
two-thirds goes to regional and state dairy associations.
According to the Economic Research Service in the US Agriculture Department,
advertising activities conducted by the board for the eight years of the
programme increased fluid milk sales by about 4.3 per cent over expected
sales
The results have been less impressive for cheese. Sales increased by an
average 2.4 per cent over expectations, despite an estimated Dollars 288m
poured into advertising.
'We all felt the National Dairy Board was squandering money on poorly
designed advertising campaigns and excessive salaries,' says Mr Francis
Goodman, one of the leaders of the opposition. 'It wasn't providing farmers
with better income.'
A board official says, however, that executive salaries are consistent with
other salaries in farm trade associations. These can run well into the six
figures.
Mr Goodman sees the attack on the board as another skirmish in a war for
control of agriculture. Individual farmers have long been losing control of
their programmes to agribusiness and large corporate interests.
Milk co-operatives, formed to help farmers get higher prices for their milk,
are now viewed by many dairymen as part of agribusiness and opposed to the
higher prices the producers need to survive. They have launched a court
battle against a USDA ruling that allows co-operatives to vote on behalf of
their members. Eight-six co-operatives announced that they would cast 70,866
votes - nearly half of the eligible voters.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some Australian wool sale reports are a little brighter this week, but
improved buying interest is confined mainly to Western Europe and China,
with Japan, normally in the lead, only providing support. Prices are
generally unchanged with occasional instances of slight easing, and some
higher prices paid for carding wools which a few days ago were appreciably
cheaper to buy. Traders in wool remain highly cautious in considering the
chance of price rises, as long as the Australian stockpile overhangs the
market. The AWC market indicator on September 1 stood at 411c/kg, the same
as a week earlier.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese selling sends tin
prices to 20-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE TIN exports were creating havoc in western tin markets, analysts
suggested yesterday, after the metal's price dropped to fresh 20-year lows
on the London Metal Exchange.
At one point the three months delivery tin price touched Dollars 4,660 a
tonne, well below the western world average cost of production, following an
overnight fall to its lowest-ever price in the Far East. At the LME close
last night the price was down Dollars 50 at Dollars 4,677.50 a tonne.
The surge in Chinese exports has almost completely nullified attempts by the
Association of Tin Producing Countries to bring some stability back to the
market by fixing export quotas.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst at the Commodities Research Unit consultancy
group, pointed out that, according to official statistics, China's tin
exports reached 30,200 tonnes last year - equivalent to more than 15 per
cent of western world demand. Exports continued at record levels in the
first half of this year, jumping by 20 per cent from the 1991 level to
15,000 tonnes.
Therefore, despite substantial cuts in output by other tin producing
countries, the market was likely to show only a small supply deficit this
year, he said. Consumers were living from hand to mouth and waiting for
prices to drift even lower because there was so much metal available.
The ATPC estimates that world-wide tin stocks are between 38,000 and 40,000
tonnes or about 11 weeks of consumption.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said: 'The prospects for tin remain decidedly
uninspiring for the near to medium term. Production looks set to fall still
further this year but the still-huge stock overhang and poor demand outlook
will ensure that the fundamental outlook for this market will remain bleak'.
Billiton forecasts that western tin production this year will fall by 5 per
cent from an already-depressed 142,000 tonnes in 1992 to 135,000 tonnes,
while demand will be down by 2 per cent from 178,000 to 174,000 tonnes.

DEERE and Company, the Illinois-based agricultural and lawn equipment
manufacturer, is planning to issue 7m new shares of its common stock in an
international offering late this month. Deere currently has about 77m shares
of common stock outstanding.
Merrill Lynch will be lead manager in the share offering, while Goldman
Sachs will be co-manager. Deere said the company had not yet determined how
much of the offering would be placed overseas, and a date for the offering
has yet to be set.
Proceeds of the share sale will be added to the company's general funds and
will be used for working capital and other purposes, including the possible
reduction of debt.
If the offering is oversubscribed, the company has the option of issuing
another 15 per cent of the shares offered. Deere obtained a shelf
registration to issue the shares from the Securities and Exchange Commission
in July.
Deere's common stock is listed on the New York, Chicago, and Frankfurt stock
exchanges.
The company reported a strong rebound in sales in the third quarter, to
Dollars 2.04bn. About one-quarter of Deere's sales are outside the US.
In New York yesterday. Deere's shares were Dollars 2 1/2 lower at Dollars 70

FT  02 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Spate of European auctions gives rise to
groundswell of concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of European bond auctions this week was starting to give rise to a
groundswell of concern yesterday as investment houses began to wonder if the
climate was still ripe for issues.
With no prospect of lower rates to drive prices higher, most bond markets
backed off in the face of profit-taking with the higher yielding markets,
Spain and Italy, experiencing the greatest falls.
France was also weak, as 10-year French bond yields moved above German
yields for the first time since the European exchange rate mechanism bands
were widened a month ago.
The Bank of France is to issue FFr18bn to FFr20bn of 10-year and 30-year
bonds today. Previous French auctions have sold like hot croissants,
especially the Balladur privatisation bond, which was aimed at the private
investor and raised FFr110bn in July, three times its target.
However, recent issues have come within the context of rapidly falling
rates.
Now that the intervention rate is stuck at 6.75 per cent, with no immediate
prospects that Germany will signal a further easing by cutting its discount
rate, there is a feeling that the pace of easing might be slowing. Dealers
yesterday were hedging their positions against the possibility that France
will today cut its five to 10-day ceiling rate from its present 10 per cent.
French 8.5 per cent bonds due 2003 fell  1/4 point to 116.47, due to worries
about the impending auction.
HIGH-yielding Mediterranean countries also saw their bond markets held back
by auction worries. Spain is to auction a range of three, five and 10-year
paper today and some estimates put the supply at around Pta1,000bn. Spanish
10-year bonds, which have risen sharply on hopes that a wage agreement with
the unions would be announced today, fell and the September futures contract
closed 66 basis points lower 100.15.
Italy also slipped in early trading after disappointing short and
medium-dated auctions led to nervousness over the most recent auction of
10-year paper. There was a feeling that overseas investors had had enough
but domestic buyers took up the slack and shortly before the close of
trading, it was announced that the L3,000bn auction was covered 1.98 times
at a price of 105.90. The September BTP future closed slightly higher.
THE UK gilts market was strong in early trading after some encouraging
purchasing data. However, the rally tailed off and the futures market hit a
low of 113.17. Then buyers returned tolift the December contract - now the
most actively traded futures contract, to above 114.
GERMAN debt prices were marginally firmer although the weekly repurchase
agreement gave no signals of impending shifts in monetary policy. The 6.8
per cent repo added some liquidity to the system, sometimes a hint that
policy on rates might be easing. However, yesterday's boost to bank
liquidity was merely technical, reflecting the recent use of other methods
of injecting cash into the system.
LONGER-DATED US Treasuries edged higher on hopes that tomorrow's August
employment report will reveal continued weakness in domestic labour markets.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/8 at 102 7/32 yielding
6.086 per cent. The two-year was unchanged at 100, to yield 3.858 per cent.
Traders and investors have their eyes fixed on tomorrow's employment
figures, and news from the National Association of Purchasing Management
that employment declined last month raised expectations that the jobs data
will be bullish for bonds. Analysts expect August non-farm payrolls to have
risen by around 150,000.
The long end was also aided by overseas demand. News that July personal
income fell 0.2 per cent and personal spending rose 0.4 per cent had little
impact on sentiment.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Mediterranean markets top
performance charts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDITERRANEAN govern-ment debt markets topped international bond performance
charts for August, reflecting expectations that high interest rates in Spain
and Italy will continue to fall.
Italy showed the strongest performance in local currency terms for the third
month in a row, with a gain of 5.54 per cent last month, according to J. P.
Morgan's government bond index monitor.
Spain, which has seen 10-year bond yields slashed by a third since last
October, came in with a market return of 4.35 per cent in August as
investors bought on the expectation that the Spanish government would manage
to hammer out a wage agreement with the unions.
'In Spain, bond prices rose, shrugging off disappointment that key interest
rates were not reduced rapidly once the peseta's ERM bands had been
widened,' says J. P. Morgan.
Investors continue to believe that the trend in interest rate and inflation
is downwards, whatever the setbacks and delays prompted by the refusal of
Germany to reduce its key discount rate.
Overseas buyers have pledged their faith in the UK, particularly in the
belief that the economy offers the double benefit of growth with low
inflation. Gilts were the third strongest performing debt market, with a
local currency return of 3.58 per cent.
At the other end of the European scale, Germany's resolve to maintain firm
rates in the face of high money supply was behind a return of 1.55 per cent.
And Belgium languished at the bottom of the table of principal international
bond markets. It provided a return of only 0.61 per cent as investors
remained concerned about the central bank's commitment to pegging rates at
German levels in spite of the high level of Belgian public debt.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Exim boosts Euroyen sector with Y75bn
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROYEN sector of the international bond market was given a significant
boost yesterday by the launch of a Y75bn Eurobond offering from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan.
Bankers said that Exim's 10-year issue paved the way for other Japanese
government-guaranteed entities to tap this sector of the Euromarket. In the
past, the finance ministry had discouraged them from raising yen-denominated
funds outside the domestic market. However, the ministry has changed its
stance in recent years.
So far, the Japanese Development Bank has been the only
government-guaranteed entity to issue in Euroyen. It has launched two such
offerings in the past two years, and it is thought to be considering a
third, of the same size and maturity as Exim's.
Exim's bonds, which carry a coupon of 4 3/8 per cent, were priced to yield
25 basis points over the 10-year Japanese government bond No 157.
The yield on the issue offers a pick-up of six basis points over the World
Bank's yen global bond due 2003, but is four basis points below the yield on
the European Investment Bank's 10-year Euroyen issue.
An official at Nomura International, the lead manager, said that Exim's
issue was aimed at satisfying demand from European investors for liquid
Euroyen bonds. He added that the size of the offering should ensure that the
bonds would remain liquid in the future.
About half of the bonds were placed in Europe, with the other half finding a
home in the Middle East and Asia. When the bonds were freed to trade, they
rose from their issue price of 99.73 to 99.92 bid.
Exim, which needs dollar-based funding, was also attracted to the Euroyen
sector by the favourable arbitrage opportunities. The borrower is thought to
have swapped the proceeds of the issue into dollars, achieving an all-in
cost of 20 basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Elsewhere, Rabobank, the triple-A rated bank, launched a L500bn zero-coupon
offering, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating-rate dollars.
The market has been expecting a zero-coupon Eurolira bond for some time, but
its launch was delayed by volatile swap levels, said an official at IMI
Bank, the lead manager.
The bonds, which yield 8.27 per cent, were placed with institutional and
retail investors in the Benelux countries, Germany and Switzerland, where
the issuer has a strong following.
Two emerging-market borrowers also launched new issues yesterday. Hemaraj
Land and Development, a Thai real estate company which is developing the
Eastern Seaboard area south of Bangkok in collaboration with the government,
raised Dollars 60m through a 10-year convertible Eurobond.
An official at the lead manager, Jardine Fleming, said that the aim of this
deal, and of the three previous convertible Eurobonds from Thailand, was to
widen the ownership of Thai shares.
Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company, raised Dollars 200m through an
offering of three-year Eurobonds. The bonds will be used to refinance the 10
per cent Eurobonds due 1996 which the issuer has called.
The bonds are due to be priced today to yield 335 basis points over the 4
3/8 per cent US Treasuries of August 1996, at the top end of the indicated
spread.
A fall in the three-year Treasury yield in August from 4.50 per cent to 4.18
per cent has worked in Petrobras's favour but the issuer was keen to offer a
sufficiently wide spread to compensate for the decline in yields.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cargill earnings fall 20% to
Dollars 348m

CARGILL, the Minneapolis-based international commodities merchandising firm,
reported a 20 per cent slide in fiscal year 1993 earnings, to Dollars 348m.
Sales for the year rose slightly to Dollars 47bn, while cash flow, at
Dollars 1.01bn, dropped slightly.
The secretive and closely-held company only began reporting results last
year, when it initiated a employee stock ownership programme.
Cargill said despite the earnings decline, fiscal 1993 was its third-best
year in its 130-year history.
Mr Robert Lumpkins, Cargill senior vice-president and chief financial
officer, said operations within the US recorded their strongest-ever
performance.
However, activity outside North America was adversely affected by reduced
acreage in the EC, currency fluctuations, political instability within parts
of South America, and continuing credit problems confronting Cargill's
leading customers, including the former Soviet Union.
'Many of the economic and other factors negatively influencing the global
busi-ness environment had been anticipated,' Mr Lumpkins said.
'We expected to see pressure on margins, and we did. We weren't surprised by
our inability to match what was clearly an exceptional year in 1992,' he
added.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Delta warns it may cut routes

<TEXT>
DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, yesterday said the
performance of its loss-making transatlantic routes had improved
dramatically over the summer but warned that it may cancel unprofitable
routes.
Mr Ron Allen, chairman, admitted that the company's foray into Europe had
been more difficult than expected. Delta was essentially a domestic carrier
until it bought Pan Am's transatlantic routes two years ago. 'We have had
lower market share, poorer economic conditions, higher structural costs and
greater start-up costs than anticipated over the north Atlantic,' Mr Allen
said. 'Pan Am had a name that was known around the world. Delta's name is
not that well known around the world,' he added.
Mr Allen said Delta's transatlantic performance had improved between June
and August, with its load factor rising to 73 per cent from 70 per cent and
revenues at its Frankfurt hub up about 50 per cent. He would not say whether
the routes had been profitable over summer, but said 'If we can keep on the
present trends, then I think it (the transatlantic routes) can be a
profitable contributor in 1994.'
The carrier has already cancelled some of its German routes. Although Mr
Allen said 'we will do more of this as we look at our summer results and
decide which routes cannot be profitable,' and that some routes may be
consolidated, he added that Delta has no plans to leave any markets
entirely, nor is it planning a radical restructuring.
The company, which has already slashed about 6,000 jobs, expects to cut
another 3,000 by the end of the year, bringing the number of employees to
about 70,000.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Seagram gains from Du Pont
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, one of the world's top drinks groups, posted a 56 per cent gain in
second quarter profit mainly because its shares of earnings at Du Pont, the
US chemicals giant, returned to normal after the negative accounting changes
of 1992.
The drinks business met difficult conditions in many markets because of poor
economic conditions 'and at this point it will be difficult for the spirits
and wine group in fiscal 1994 to match last year's record results,' said Mr
Edgar Bronfman Jr, president.
Seagram's net income for the quarter ended July was USDollars 170m, or 46
cents a share, up from Dollars 109m, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.
For the first half, net income was Dollars 332m, or 89 cents a share,
against Dollars 262m, or 70 cents a share.
Last year Seagram made significant accounting changes and included its share
of a Du Pont special charge. This year Seagram received Dollars 74m in Du
Pont dividends, against Dollars 72m. Its share of Du Pont's unremitted
earnings was Dollars 51m against a negative Dollars 6m in 1992.
Sales from the global drinks business rose 2 per cent in the second quarter
to Dollars 1.44bn. The gain was spread across sprits and wine operations and
Tropicana, the fruit juice unit. Operating income was Dollars 158m against
Dollars 156m, with spirits and wine up 8 per cent to Dollars 132m and
Tropicana also up 8 per cent to Dollars 28m.
Mr Bronfman said spirits and wine operations benefited from timing factors,
including purchases in advance of a French excise tax increase and
comparison with a very slow 1992 second quarter in Germany.
Last month Seagram filed a Dollars 500m shelf offering of debt securities,
raising speculation it may increase its 5.8 per cent holding in Time Warner,
media and entertainment giant.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: CRA bucks prices trend with
advance to ADollars 379m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining company, has traded against the trend of falling
commodity prices to increase net profit to ADollars 379.6m (USDollars
256.40m) from ADollars 128.1m for the first half of 1993.
The result was achieved on a 12.2 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 2.79bn
and allows CRA to double its dividend to 30 cents a share. Directors said
the result was helped by a weaker Australian dollar and higher sales volumes
for iron ore.
These factors more than offset the negative impact of weaker prices for
aluminium, iron ore, zinc, lead and coal.
The biggest after-tax contribution came from iron ore, up at ADollars 191.0m
from ADollars 161.0m, coal earnings jumped from ADollars 34.5m to ADollars
119.5m, boosted by the acquisition of Coal and Allied Industries, and profit
on diamonds was ADollars 41.4m, up from ADollars 36.9m.
Other significant earnings contributions came from copper/gold, up from
ADollars 3m to ADollars 34.7m, and aluminium, improving from ADollars 12.1m
to ADollars 27.8m.
The overall result included some non-trading items, chiefly a ADollars 37.7m
surplus on the superannuation fund (compared with a ADollars 55.4m deficit
previously) and a ADollars 91.5m positive tax adjustment. Capital
expenditure rose from ADollars 254.4m to ADollars 436.3m. Gross borrowings
at the end of June totalled ADollars 1.44bn, against ADollars 1.2bn a year
ago.
Renison and Pasminco, the large Australian mining companies, report
continuing losses for the June year following lower commodity prices and
heavy asset write downs. Pasminco's net loss increased to ADollars 86.9m
from ADollars 58.6m. Renison's net loss rose to ADollars 24.4m from ADollars
10.1m.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Burns Philp increases payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNS Philp, the Australian food technology group, has raised its dividend
to 17 cents from 15.5 cents a share following a 20 per cent increase in net
earnings to ADollars 110.1m (USDollars 74m) for the six months ended June.
Directors said the result, achieved on a 19 per cent sales rise to ADollars
2.68bn, reflected higher earnings in 14 of the group's 16 divisions, despite
slow trading in most markets.
The company's biggest profit earner was the food and fermentation division,
which lifted its net contribution from ADollars 62.3m to ADollars 86.6m. The
hardware side improved earnings from ADollars 22.9m to ADollars 23.4m and
investment division profit rose from ADollars 19.1m to ADollars 26.5m.
Mayne Nickless, the diversified transport and security group, has reported a
steep fall in profits for the year ended June. After-tax profit fell 66.6
per cent to ADollars 58.8m on a 2 per cent slide in total operating revenue
to ADollars 2.84m. The dividend is down from 35 cents to 30 cents a share.
The result included a ADollars 47.1m abnormal loss on write-downs at the
European transport operations. In the previous year a ADollars 77.6m
abnormal profit had been taken in, mainly on the sale of shares in Amcor.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Boral makes bid for energy group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORAL, the Australian building products group, has accelerated its
diversification into energy with a ADollars 759m (USDollars 512.8m) takeover
bid for Sagasco, the South Australian petroleum group.
Announcing the bid yesterday, Mr Bruce Kean, managing director, said Boral's
net earnings for the year ended June had jumped 50.6 per cent to ADollars
228.9m on a 14 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 4.22bn. The dividend is
set to rise to 18 cents from 16 cents a share.
Mr Kean said Boral had paid ADollars 146.8m to acquire a 19.9 per cent stake
in Sagasco from the government-controlled South Australian Government
Financing Authority (Safa) and would bid ADollars 3.50 cash a share for the
remainder.
The bid is substantially in excess of the ADollars 2.70 a share offer which
Santos, a rival South Australian petroleum group, made for Sagasco last
year. The Santos bid failed to gain clearance from the Trade Practices
Commission.
Mr Kean stressed yesterday that he had been advised that Boral would have no
problem in this area.
Safa and Santos own 31.9 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively of Sagasco.
Both indicated last night that they had yet to make a decision on the bid.
Mr Lynn Arnold, premier of South Australia, said his government's eventual
response would take account of the employment implications for the state.
Boral directors said yesterday they did not expect to push through any
rationalisation of Sagasco should the bid succeed. The acquisition of
Sagasco would mean that about one-third of Boral's gross earnings would come
from energy.
Boral's earnings statement showed it spent ADollars 500m on acquisitions and
capital expenditure last year. Mr Kean said the Sagasco purchase would be
funded through debt and the flotation of Sagasco's manufacturing operations.
AGL, another Australian energy group, indicated yesterday that it would be
interested in some Sagasco assets if the Boral bid was successful.
Mr Len Bleasel, AGL managing director, announced a 71 per cent increase to
ADollars 70.6m in AGL's net earnings for the year ended June.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Litton wins round in Dollars
1.2bn patent infringement case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LOS Angeles jury has awarded Litton Industries, the Californian high
technology group, Dollars 1.2bn for the alleged infringement of a patent by
Honeywell, the Minnesota-based controls company.
Honeywell insisted that the case was far from over, however, pointing out
that the judge was continuing to hear evidence in the case.
Trading in the shares of both companies was halted on Tuesday ahead of the
award announcement. Honeywell's shares fell sharply yesterday morning when
trading resumed on the New York Stock Exchange. In early trading, Honeywell
stood at Dollars 35 7/8 , down Dollars 3, while Litton rose Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 68.
The case centres on ring laser gyroscopes, a device used in aircraft
navigation, which Honeywell pioneered in the 1960s.
Litton alleges that Honeywell infringed its patents, which it took out in
1979 and 1989, for a process to coat mirrors used as part of the gyroscope's
measuring system.
Honeywell argues that Litton's patents are invalid and that its coating
process is anyway different from that of Litton.
Mr Edward Grayson, Honeywell's general counsel, said the company was
'disappointed and outraged' at the verdict, but he added that it was 'only
one stage of this trial and Honeywell believes it will have no independent
value'.
Honeywell said the presiding Judge Mariana Pfaelzer still had to consider
two issues which could reduce or eliminate the jury's ver-dict.
These are Honeywell's argument that Litton failed to follow the correct
procedures in obtaining its patents and that the reissuing of its patents in
1989 invalidated those it claimed in 1979.
Litton's lawsuit, filed in 1990, alleges that Honeywell tried to monopolise
the ring laser gyroscope market, but no trial date has been set for this
anti-trust portion of the case.
Honeywell has counter-sued, accusing Litton of attempted monopoly.

four months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DAF TRUCKS made a profit of Fl 1.8m (Dollars 950,000) in its first four
months after being resurrected in slimmed-down form following the Dutch
truck maker's financial collapse at the start of this year.
The figure was achieved after tax, interest and an allocation for
development costs. The profit at operating level was Fl 6.2m, achieved on
turnover of Fl 367m.
The results are roughly as forecast by the company after it was formed with
the aid of Fl 451.7m in equity and loans from the Dutch and Flemish regional
governments, banks and institutional investors.
They cover the period from March 2 to June 21, putting Daf Trucks in
position to make a conventional second-half report for a financial year
ending December 31.
The company yesterday said that it expected a 'significantly higher positive
result' for the whole year, with a projected turnover of Fl 1.4bn.
The results coincided with an announcement by Leyland Daf Trucks, the Dutch
company's wholly-owned UK sales arm, that it had won its largest
post-receivership order in the UK, for 152 trucks worth Pounds 7.5m.

EAST Asiatic, the Danish trading company with substantial interests in

DKr42m for the six months ended June, against a loss of DKr17m a year

However, the net result, after the costs of discontinued operations and
income from divestments, was a loss of DKr97m compared with an DKr18m loss
in 1992. The group sold several operations during the half year, notably
container shipping and Plumrose food processing operations.
The disposals strengthened group finances, with net interest bearing debt
falling to DKr4.30bn at end June from DKr5.95bn at end December.

<TEXT>
BALTICA, the Danish insurance company, has swung into loss for the six
months ended June running up a deficit of DKr60m (Dollars 8.734m) compared
with a profit of DKr256m a year earlier, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
Mr Hans Ejvind Hansen, chief executive, said that a 10 per cent cut in staff
is planned for the next two years. Employee numbers have fallen from 3,600
to 3,324 over the past 12 months.
Baltica increased earnings from financial investments in the half year to
DKr307m from DKr255m, but it made a loss on the insurance account of DKr193m
compared with a profit of DKr36m last year.
The insurance loss reflected a shortfall of DKr275m on credit reinsurance, a
business being discontinued. Premium income was little changed at DKr1.68bn,
while claims rose to DKr1.40bn from DKr1.05bn.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, one of Sweden's two leading insurers, swung back into the black in
the first half, due largely to rising asset values and exchange rate
movements.
The group made an operating profit of SKr734m (Dollars 89.81m), against a
SKr344m loss in the same period of 1992. If changes in the surplus value of
assets are included, it turned a SKr636m loss into a SKr1.6bn profit.
The insurance business also showed an improving trend, with profits rising
to SKr241m from SKr195m. Gross premiums rose 23 per cent to SKr21.4bn,
mainly due to the weaker Swedish krona.
The group saw another strong performance from its Nordic insurance unit,
Skandia Norden, where insurance profits reached SKr404m.
It is also benefiting from a decision to reduce its exposure to the non-life
reinsurance sector and place increased emphasis on life insurance and
savings products.
Net asset value stood at SKr13.2bn at June 30, and by mid-August had reached
SKr14.2bn, said Skandia. This compares with SKr11.4bn at the end of 1992
when the group decided for the first time to scrap its dividend.
Skandia has gained a more stable ownership base after 40 per cent of its
shares held by the Norwegian insurer Uni Storebrand and Hafnia, the Danish
insurance group, were placed with international investors in June for
SKr3.2bn.

CARNAUDMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group, has acquired Zeller
Plastik Group, a private German company which manufactures closures and
dispensing systems for household and beauty products, writes John Ridding.
The acquisition price was not disclosed. But CarnaudMetalBox said that
Zeller was profitable and achieved sales of FFr600m (Dollars 102m) last
year.
CarnaudMetalBox said that Zeller's range of mechanisms to close and dispense
household products would complement its packaging activities.

VNU, the largest publishing group in the Netherlands, yesterday reported a
10 per cent rise in first-half net profit from Fl 54m to Fl 59.6m (Dollars
31.6m), on sales of Fl 1.05bn, and predicted a comparable rate of increase
for earnings during the second half.
The result, which has been adjusted to reflect the sale in April of its
printing division, has been achieved in spite of a considerable decline in
advertising revenue within its newspaper and trade press operations, a trend
which is expected to worsen in the course of this year.
However, other activities, including magazines and educational publishing,
distribution, electronic media and commercial television, continue to
generate healthy and growing profits, VNU said.
'Provided economic circumstances do not further deteriorate,' the company
said, 'the percentage increase in 1993 net profit and net profit per share
will be of the same order of magnitude as during the first half.' Net profit
per share rose by 3 per cent to Fl 6.81.
Among the group's most vigorously growing activities are electronic
publishing in the US where VNU is a leading supplier of on-line consumer
demographic information as well as financial analysis of bourse-listed
companies.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ciba earnings slide 8% as
chairman issues warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CIBA, the diversified Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has
reported an 8 per cent slide in net income from ordinary activities in the
first half to SFr1.4bn (Dollars 946m).
Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, said in his letter to shareholders: 'We knew that
1993 would not be an easy year.' He forecast the net income in the full year
would be higher than last year's level, but warned that the growth would be
limited 'by the present unfavourable conditions of our business
environment'.
The Ciba interim results were significantly weaker than those reported by
its two Basle-based neighbours, Roche and Sandoz. To a large extent, this
reflects the greater proportion of recession hit agricultural and industrial
chemical businesses in Ciba than in the other two.
Group sales were down 4 per cent to SFr11.85bn, with all divisions but the
relatively small self-medication, diagnostics and optical businesses
reporting declines. Operating profit fell 10 per cent to SFr1.9bn but an
improved financial result meant the pre-tax profit was down only 6 per cent
to SFr2.03bn.
After an extraordinary SFr120m gain last year on the sale of an additives
business, net income was flat.
Sales in the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for about a quarter of
total turnover, were down 6 per cent to SFr3.07bn, depressed by healthcare
reforms in Germany and Italy and the prospect of reforms elsewhere.
Also, the comparative figure was inflated by the spectacular introduction of
the nicotine patch, Habitrol, in the US. Habitrol sales in the first half of
last year were more than SFr400m, but settled to SFr40m in the first half of
this year.
Ciba is the world's largest producer of agricultural chemicals, and sales of
its farm related businesses account for a further quarter of group turnover.
These sales fell 7 per cent to SFr3.09bn in the first half, largely because
of pressures on European Community farmers to grow less and to use fewer
chemicals.
The group's industrial companies - mainly involved in dyes, pigments and
related chemicals - suffered a 5 per cent slide in sales to SFr4.4bn.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nissan's Spanish unit plunges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN Motor Iberica, the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of the Japanese
carmaker, plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pta23,084bn (Dollars 172m) in the
first half of the year from a loss of Pta2.7bn in the same period a year
ago.
The heavy losses are expected to force Nissan to inject more equity capital
later this year into the troubled Spanish group, in which it currently holds
a 70.3 per cent stake.
Nissan injected Pta5bn in July, but the company has indicated that it may
have to put in a further Pta10bn in two tranches in order to bolster the
Spanish group's balance sheet.
Nissan Motor Iberica's sales volume fell by 7 per cent to 46,424 vehicles
from 49,840 a year earlier, while group turnover declined by 8.2 per cent to
Pta79.1bn (Pta86.3bn).
The company's finances have come under acute pressure under the impact of
the sharp fall in new vehicle sales in Spain and across Europe, which has
coincided with heavy capital investments by the Japanese vehicle maker in
Spain in new production capacity and in the development of new models.
Nissan, which is in loss worldwide, is seeking to transform its Spanish
operations from their traditional role as a maker of light and medium duty
commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market into a producer of niche
passenger vehicles - the Serena multi-purpose vehicle and the Terrano
II/Ford Maverick four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle - to be sold
across Europe.
The Terrano II was only launched in May, and overall Nissan Motor Iberica
production fell in the first half of the year by 13.5 per cent to 36,007
from 41,607 in the same period a year ago.
By the end of June the workforce had been cut to 7,005 from 7,228 a year
earlier.

shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROUSSEL Uclaf of France and its parent, Hoechst of Germany, yesterday
announced a reorganisation of their pharmaceuticals management and increased
specialisation of drugs research within the companies.
The moves follow the sale last month of Rhone Poulenc's 35 per cent stake in
Roussel Uclaf and represent part of a restructuring plan aimed at increasing
efficiency and responding to increasingly competitive markets.
Under the terms of the management reorganisation, Mr Ernst-Guenter Afting,
head of Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division, will become chairman of
Roussel-Uclaf from January 1.
In turn, Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, a member of Roussel Uclaf's current
management board, is to replace Mr Afting at Hoechst. Both cases represent
the first time that foreigners have held the respective posts.
'It is something of a cultural revolution' said Roussel Uclaf, adding that
the two companies were implementing a broader exchange of staff.
Mr Edouard Sakiz, Roussel Uclaf's current chairman, who will retire at the
end of the year, said yesterday that the two companies would gradually
reshuffle their drug specialisations. Research into antibiotics, for
example, will be centred at Roussel Uclaf, while cardiovascular drugs will
be centred under Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division.
A spokesman for the group said that the moves were aimed at reducing
duplication, but added that both companies would continue their existing
fields of research.
A broader restructuring of Hoechst and Roussel Uclaf will take place from
the beginning of next year. Hoechst will transfer its French pharmaceuticals
laboratories and some of its German laboratories to Roussel Uclaf.
The shift should effectively equalise the turnover of the pharmaceuticals
activities of the two groups.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: BBL chief says recovery under
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three biggest banks, yesterday
claimed to have laid the foundations for recovery after recording net
non-consolidated profits of BFr2.46bn (Dollars 69m) for the first half of
the year.
Announcing the interim results yesterday, Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, who
took over as chief executive last December, said: 'Fundamentally the bank
that you have here is a better bank, a more solid bank than it was six
months ago.'
The non-consolidated profit was twice the equivalent figure of BFr1.23bn for
1992, but direct comparison is difficult because BBL has changed its
year-end. The group calculated an artificial half-year equivalent from the
group's 15-month figures for 1991-1992.
Consolidated profits rose from the restated six-month figure of BFr1.46bn to
BFr3.06bn after tax, and BBL said it hoped to double net profit for the
year.
Mr Cardon also hinted that BBL might be ready to return to a more generous
dividend policy, following last year's dividend cut.
In 1992, BBL had to make extensive provisions against bad loans, which
reduced net consolidated profits from BFr4.5bn in the year to the end of
September 1991, to BFr3.6bn in the following 15 months.
Meanwhile, an attempt to link up with Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the
Dutch financial services group, fell through. Mr Cardon was appointed
following the unexpected resignation of Mr Theo Peeters, who, together with
most of the BBL management, had backed the ill-fated plan for an ING bid.
Mr Cardon said an 8 per cent increase in customers' deposits in the first
six months of 1993 - from BFr1,126bn to BFr1,214bn - showed that 'the new
BBL' had retained its credibility following the ING affair. He also pointed
out that net interest income of BFr18.8bn, against BFr17.3bn, now more than
covered recurring overheads.
ING retains an 11 per cent stake in BBL, but the bank has decided to pursue
insurance links with two other insurer-investors, Royale Belge of Belgium
and Winterthur of Switzerland.
Winterthur increased its stake in BBL to 7.2 per cent two weeks ago and Mr
Cardon said yesterday that the Swiss company would continue to buy BBL
shares, but 'at the right moment and at the right price'.

<TEXT>
INCENTIVE, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the Wallenberg family,
is set to become the world's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling
equipment after agreeing to buy MacGregor- Navire from Kone, the Finnish
elevators group.
The acquisition will strengthen the position of Incentive's materials
handling company, Hagglunds Marine, and create a unit with annual sales of
more than SKr2bn (Dollars 245m). Payment is in the region of SKr500m,
although exact details are not being disclosed.
Hagglunds is the world's leading supplier of shipboard cranes. Acquiring
MacGregor will expand its product range to include hatch covers, marine
elevators, roll-on, roll-off equipment and cargo lashing equipment.
It will have a market share of between 50 and 60 per cent, according to Mr
Mikael Lilius, Incentive president.
Mr Lilius said: 'We think it is a good time to buy as the order books of
both companies are growing, and they are benefiting from the devaluation of
the Finnish and Swedish currencies.'
He added that MacGregor-Navire's international network of 50 offices in 24
countries would greatly enhance Hagglund's own sales and service network.
This is Incentive's most significant purchase since it gained a stock market
listing in 1991. In two years of rationalisation, it has raised Dollars 400m
from selling businesses and cut net debt by SKr3bn.

FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Lenzing loss worsens to Sch66m
in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENZING, the world's largest viscose fibre producer, said its loss worsened
in the first half, reaching Sch66m (Dollars 5.58m), compared with a loss of
Sch54m in the whole of last year, due to fierce price competition in world
fibre markets and heavy interest charges.
The Austrian group forecast that its full-year 1993 loss would be higher
than last year's.
Sales rose 9.2 per cent to Sch4.24bn but operating profits tumbled from
Sch130m to Sch48m. Lenzing said fibre sales prices were 15 per cent lower on
average than in the same period of last year.
Following interest charges inflated by the group's heavy investments in
pollution control systems, the pre-tax loss was Sch50m compared with a
profit of Sch88m in the first half of last year.
Lenzing said it had agreed a Dollars 100m joint venture with Industrias
Klabin de Papel e Celulose of Brazil to build a 120,000 tonnes a year
chemical pulp mill.
The output would supply Lenzing viscose plants in the US and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday
announced a FM768m (Dollars 130m) loss for the first seven months of 1993, a
sharp reduction on losses of FM2.3bn in the 1992 period.
It said the figures showed it was on target to halve last year's FM3.7bn
deficit during the full year.
It is the first indication that the bank has turned the corner to better
times, as its figures for the first four months of the year showed a
worsening trend.
The bank is likely to have taken the unusual step of issuing January to July
figures to win investor confidence for its plans to raise up to FM3bn in new
capital through share and debt issues.
Its capital adequacy ratio had fallen to near the 8 per cent international
minimum at the end of August.
The bank is aiming to raise FM750m in new equity through an issue of up to
67m shares in the next two months, according to Reuters news agency. Around
50m shares will be offered to international investors.
It is also planning a perpetual subordinated debenture to be launched this
month, which will increase its capital adequacy ratio by 0.6 percentage
points.
The aim is to have a capital adequacy ratio of around 10-11 per cent by the
time the bank expects to return to the black in 1995.

THE ISLE of Man Steam Packet Company is considering a reduction of passenger
services to the island in response to plans by the Isle of Man government to
build new facilities in Douglas harbour which would be open to competitors.
However, Mr Juan Kelly, chairman, reported along with the interim results
that talks were taking place with the government. He said the company was
willing to guarantee a level of services similar to the present in return
for a degree of protection from competition.
In the six months to end-June pre-tax profits for the company, in which Sea
Containers controls 41.97 per cent, advanced 56 per cent to Pounds 1.91m
(Pounds 1.23m) on turnover ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 11.3m).
The result was helped by the lack of exceptional items against Pounds
145,000 last time.
Earnings per share were 10.8p (7.1p) and the interim dividend is raised from
3p to 3.5p gross.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Government programme boosts Serco to Pounds
4.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERCO, the facilities and project management company, said the growing
momentum of the government's programme of putting services out to contract
would help to maintain its record of profits growth.
Pre-tax profits increased 28 per cent to Pounds 4.35m in the six months to
June 30 on turnover of Pounds 82.3m, up 27 per cent. The shares, which have
enjoyed a strong run recently, rose a further 5p to Pounds 10.90p.
Mr George Gray, chairman, said the government's market testing programme had
afforded excellent business opportunities in the first six months of the
year and would lead to an increasing number of bid opportunities.
Serco said its profits increase was due to substantial organic growth in
businesses both owned by and associated with the company, together with a
strong six-months contribution from International Aeradio Limited, the civil
aviation specialist acquired from BT for Pounds 12.3m in April 1992.
The civil aviation services market continued to develop well, with new
contracts including consultancy work in central and eastern Europe. The
company is now operating the Scatsta air terminal in Shetland for BP
Exploration's Sullom Voe terminal.
In July Serco paid Pounds 3.5m for BM Scotland, part of the the Property
Services Agency, the government body responsible for property management.
The company said this deal brought a further 278 contracts with existing
government customers, which considerably strengthened its core business.
Mr Richard White, managing director, said the successful rationalisation and
integration of IAL boded well for the future of BM Scotland, which would
enhance Serco's position in the Scottish market.
The engineering services side, relating to the provision of automatic test
systems, had also been boosted by the award of a contract, worth Pounds 40m
over five years, to tests the avionics of the Royal Navy's Merlin EH101
helicopter.
On the international side, the group won a share of the management contract
for Diego Garcia, the US naval base in the Indian Ocean. Serco was awarded
20 per cent of the contract, worth Dollars 160m (Pounds 108m) over seven
years.
Mr Gray said: 'The outlook for the remainder of 1993 remains good, based on
firm business and the securing of new contracts both with current and new
customers. The group's cashflow remains strong.'
The interim dividend goes up 18 per cent to 5.3p (4.5p), payable from
earnings per share ahead 29 per cent to 22.5p (17.4p).

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon declines to Pounds 11m -
Overstocking and weak demand take toll on mature whisky prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly a decade of uninterrupted growth, Invergordon Distillers, the
independent Scotch whisky producer, reported a 23 per cent decline in first
half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 11.3m.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said the result reflected a fall of 10-15
per cent in the price of mature whisky because of weak demand and
overstocking in the industry.
'There are indications, including lower stocks of grain whisky, that trading
conditions have stabilised,' he said. 'Although we do not expect to match
1992's profit in the full year, we believe that the impact has been taken in
the first half.'
Earnings per share in the six months to June 30 dropped to 6p (7.7p) but the
interim dividend goes up to 2.9p (2.8p).
Operating profit was 27 per cent lower at Pounds 11.8m on turnover down 8
per cent to Pounds 36.8m. Gross margins were reduced from 53.6 per cent to
48.9 per cent, their level in 1990.
In the UK turnover increased from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 23.1m because of
the resilience of the own-label supermarket sector.
Overall volumes were maintained at the record levels achieved in the first
half of 1992. A 3 per cent reduction in Scotch was offset by increased
volumes of gin and vodka. Bottled-in-Scotland whisky volumes were 17 per
cent ahead.
Total production was reduced by 4 per cent. Though the grain distillery
continued to operate at more than 90 per cent capacity, output of malt
whisky was cut by 21 per cent and the company's four distilleries were
operating at 50 per cent capacity.
COMMENT
Invergordon's own stocks of lower-cost mature whisky and the resilience of
its supermarket customers have enabled it to weather adverse trading
conditions longer than most others in the industry. It has also made good
use of the three years since flotation to strengthen its balance sheet;
doubling net assets to Pounds 64m, and reducing borrowings from Pounds 46m
to Pounds 22m, and gearing from 143 per cent to 35 per cent. Market
pressures have now begun to take their toll, however. Analysts have cut
their forecasts of full year profits to about Pounds 27m compared to last
year's Pounds 32.5m and recovery is not expected before 1995. Whyte &amp;
Mackay, which holds a 41 per cent stake, can afford to wait and watch the
effects on the share price before renewing its bid, but the prospects of
securing it for a bargain price seem slim. The shares lost 9p to close at
286p yesterday, still above the 275p offered by W&amp;M two years ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH &amp; Overseas Properties returned pre-tax profits amounting to Pounds
12,000 for the six months ended June 30 1993.
This compared with losses of Pounds 438,000 last time after an exceptional
debit of Pounds 659,000.
Turnover of the company, which provides development, project and asset
management services, doubled to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 792,000).
Mr Jim Clark, chairman and chief executive, stated that market conditions in
the first half of the current year had shown an improvement 'for the first
time in three years'.
During the period the company acquired a portfolio of small investment
properties - a new strategy for the company - and secured lettings on all
but 5 per cent of available space.
Mr Clark stated that a number of acquisitions had been considered but the
directors had been unable to agree terms acceptable to the company.
He added that he was hopeful 'we will be able to undertake a transaction in
the near future which will enable the company to make a quantum step forward
with a return to acceptable levels of profitability in the medium term'.
Earnings per share were 0.05p, compared with losses of 1.88p.

Pounds 410,000
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS of Instem, the USM-quoted electronics and information
systems group, fell from Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 410,000 in the six months
ended July 31.
The shares dropped 19p to 142p.
However, the directors were encouraged by a record order intake. On balance,
the performance was in line with their plans for the period.
The business segments concerned with electricity transmission and
distribution, power generation and nuclear fuel processing moved forward
broadly in line with plans.
Also the performance of the electronics manufacturing operation recovered,
in part due to the result of increased business from the merger of the
mining equipment business of Dobson Park Industries with Meco International.
Datatox F1 software product did not achieve satisfactory performance in a
number of site trials. That resulted in management changes and a delay in
the next release to early 1994.
Turnover rose from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 9.5m. Interest charges were Pounds
11,000 (Pounds 3,000 received). Earnings per share were 6.01p (7.96p) but
the interim is held at 1.3p.

Calderburn, the office furniture group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.41m for the first half of 1993, a 36 per cent fall on the comparable
Pounds 2.21m.
The company said the fall had been expected. Mr James Blyth Currie,

but there were now signs of a recovery.
Turnover fell 13 per cent to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 14.9m). Earnings per share

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON FARRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER CHARGING a Pounds 3.49m loss on discontinued operations Osprey
Communications incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 4.25m in the 12 months
ended May 31.
The period is part of the new accounting year, which now ends on September
30. In the comparative period the loss was Pounds 336,000 after exceptionals
of Pounds 355,000.
During the period the group, which provides advertising and associated
services, sold the marketing services division to management for Pounds
2.1m, bought SMS Communications for Pounds 1.63m in cash and shares, and
raised Pounds 1.3m net via a rights issue.
On completion of those transactions Mr John French resigned as chairman and
chief executive and was succeeded by Mr Jack Rubins.
The new chairman said yesterday that negotiations were in hand for the
disposal of Rayner Holdings and Acute-Marketing and Communications, two of
the small regional subsidiaries, to their managements.
Provision had been made for the release of goodwill in the accounts.
Mr Rubins said despite the greater than expected trading loss - Pounds
384,000 from turnover of Pounds 21.9m - the balance sheet had been
substantially enhanced by the disposals and rights issue. At May 31 a pro
forma statement showed net assets of Pounds 636,000 - in the balance sheet
there were negative assets of Pounds 950,000.
The group was profitable in June and July, with the performance of SMS being
'particularly encouraging'. Mr Rubins said the group was beginning to make
progress.
Losses per share were 28.6p (2.03p) of which exceptionals accounted for
24.95p. To preserve trustee status an interim dividend of 0.1p is declared.

</HEADLINE>

In the first half of 1993 Anglo Pacific Resources, the mineral exploration
and coal producing group, returned to profitability with Pounds 119,000
pre-tax.
That compared with losses of Pounds 147,000 in 1992, which had increased to
Pounds 670,000 by that year-end.
Turnover rose from Pounds 948,000 to Pounds 1.83m. Earnings per share were
0.15p (losses 0.19p).
Operating results at Fife Silica Sands and Anglo Tulloch Minerals showed
considerable improvement. Initial royalty contributions were received from
the Gordonstone coal project; the income should increase considerably in the
second half as production rises to planned levels.
The group is entitled to royalties on a significant portion of the coal to
be produced from the Crinum undergroundmine. Production should commence
towards the end of 1994 with a planned capacity of 2.5m tonnes a year in
1996.

turnround

SILVERMINES, the Dublin-based electrical and property group, announced a
turnround in the six months to June 30 from losses of IPounds 479,000 to
pre-tax profits of IPounds 251,000 (Pounds 235,000). There were losses of
IPounds 3.23m for 1992 as a whole.
The result was achieved on reduced turnover of IPounds 12.3m (IPounds
20.8m).
Mr Bob Morton, chairman, said the policy of tight control over costs and
overheads was enabling the group to trade more profitably. He added that the
anticipated improvement from the electrical division was being realised.
Norcroft Dynamics had been added to that division in June and other
acquisition opportunities were under review.
There was also an improvement in property profits arising from upward rent
reviews and lower interest charges. The directors have decided to dispose of
all the group's investment properties and financial investments when market
conditions permitted.
Earnings per share were 0.32p (2.13p losses). There is no interim dividend
(1p). But the directors are seeking approval to reduce the share premium
account to eliminate the deficit on reserves and allow the resumption of
dividends.

higher tea prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LINTON PARK, the diversified tea coffee and fruit producer and food trader
ultimately controlled by Lawrie Group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.32m for the six months to June 30.
The outcome, achieved after reduced interest charges of Pounds 684,000
(Pounds 1.05m) was a 'significant improvement' on the comparable Pounds
2.17m, according to Mr Keith FitzGerald, chairman.
He said the improvement reflected better tea prices and increased production
on the group's Kenyan estates which have now recovered from the drought
early in 1992.
In Malawi, however, the rains came too late to have a material impact on the
current year.
Turnover on continuing operations, taking Kakuzi, a long-time associate, as
a subsidiary from March 1, amounted to Pounds 62m (Pounds 58.7m).
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p, payable from earnings of 13p
(6.4p) per share.

CONTINUING tight cost controls and the contribution from acquisitions helped
Johnston Press increase interim pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds
6.02m in a difficult market.
The increase from the previous Pounds 4.85m was achieved on sales up 23 per

The Edinburgh-based newspaper publishing group is raising the interim

The share price added 5p yesterday to 578p.
Mr Fred Johnston, executive chairman, said that in the newspaper publishing
division, TR Beckett recorded an encouraging performance in its first full
half-year within the group.
The West Sussex County Times achieved a significant profits increase, aided
by the Worthing Guardian, acquired at the end of 1992.
The printing market continued to suffer from recession and Wood Westworth at
St Helens and Yorkshire Communication Group at Wakefield suffered losses.
Both operations are under review.
At the end of the half-year the cash balance had risen to Pounds 5.37m.

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WATERFORD Wedgwood yesterday reported its first interim profit in six years
as the long and painful rationalisation of its luxury crystal business in
Ireland began finally to bear fruit.
For the six months to end-June the group swung from losses of IPounds 5.8m
to profits of IPounds 400,000 (Pounds 374,000) at the pre-tax level.
Since 1987 the group, created by the merger of the Wedgwood fine china and
Waterford crystal businesses, has suffered accumulated losses in the region
of IPounds 85m.
First-half turnover rose just 3.7 per cent to IPounds 135.4m. The group said
profit growth had been achieved 'through cost reduction rather than volume
growth'.
The Waterford crystal division reported operating profits of IPounds 1.6m
against a previous deficit of IPounds 3.3m.
In January this year trade unions representing the 1,600 workforce at the
Waterford Crystal division agreed to a rescue plan involving 200 voluntary
redundancies, pay cuts of up to 25 per cent, and a three-year no-strike
agreement.
Waterford's sales in the first half rose 24 per cent to IPounds 38.7m,
largely a result of growing success with the new outsourced Marquis range of
crystalware in a more buoyant US market, as well as a 150-strong new product
range introduced in the company's Classic range of crystalware.
Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of Waterford, said: 'We are much stronger
now than we were a year ago, with improved volumes and increased market
share.
'An operating profit of IPounds 1.6m is still not enough though and there
are further non-labour cost savings we are working on.'
He said that the Marquis range, which is aimed at the middle-income sector
of the market, 'has carved out its own place in the sun. There was concern
that it might cannibalise the upper end of the market but this has not
happened. There has been growth in both markets with sales in Marquis well
up on last year'.
The Wedgwood fine china division had a particularly tough year, with sales
down 2.6 per cent to IPounds 96.7m.
Mr Kneale Ashwell, the division's chairman and chief executive, said the
Japanese market had suffered through a downturn in consumer spending 'but we
are doing better, not only than our competitors in picking up market share,
but better than the luxury goods sector as a whole'.
He said that rationalisation measures begun last year 'should be largely
complete by the year-end'.
Like the crystal division, he said Wedgwood was also 'now looking at
worldwide outsourcing of new products', which are not currently manufactured
by the company but which will be introduced under the Wedgwood brand name.
Mr Richard Barnes, group chief financial officer, said that although net
debt had grown to IPounds 72.6m (IPounds 63m) this was largely due to
exchange rate fluctuations, and should return to about IPounds 60m by
year-end.
He said no exceptional items were anticipated in the current year's results,
and that 'on existing capacity-demand relationships no further
rationalisations should be necessary'.
Earnings per share were 0.02p (losses of 0.91p).

Pounds 5.96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANTSBROOK, the funeral services group that has undergone extensive
reorganisation, boosted interim pre-tax profits by 21 per cent, from Pounds
4.91m to Pounds 5.96m.
Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, attributed the rise to continued emphasis
on client care and service, stringent cost controls and tight management.
'Our market share remains stable and we are optimistic that our recent
acquisitions and new sites will enhance our overall performance', he said.
The group has just under 9 per cent of the UK funeral market, and reported
turnover just ahead at Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 26.2m).
Dignity in Destiny, the previously loss-making pre-paid funeral scheme, was
now contributing to profits, said Mr Hindley.
In the past 18 months the group had reduced costs by closing 80 branches.
During the first half it acquired three businesses for Pounds 1.8m and
opened five new branches, taking the total to 330.
Net interest payable fell to Pounds 334,000 (Pounds 1.3m).
Gearing, which reached 415 per cent two years ago, had been reduced to 28
per cent compared with 75 per cent a year earlier.
The group, which raised Pounds 10.5m through a rights issue in March last
year, made a Pounds 2m placement in December and a further Pounds 2m
placement in May.
Mr Hindley said the group had repaid Pounds 3.6m of hire purchase debt at 10
per cent on its vehicles, and reduced its debtors by Pounds 1m in the
period.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 3.83p (4.31p). The interim dividend is
raised to 1.1p (1p).
Mr James Brown and Mr Graham Barber, both operational directors, were
yesterday appointed to the board.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong US performance helps Senior to
Pounds 11.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance in the US helped Senior Engineering Group, the tubing,
ductwork and thermal engineering company, increase pre-tax profits by 14 per
cent to Pounds 11.4m in the six months to June 30.
Sales rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 181.4m. For the first time North America
accounted for more than half of group operating profits, which improved 19
per cent to Pounds 11.8m.
Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said this performance had been achieved in spite
of continuing poor conditions in the UK, which accounted for only 40 per
cent of operating profits during the period - down from 60 per cent a year
ago.
He said: 'The group's order book is very healthy, particularly in the US,
which should ensure that the year's result will demonstrate a period of very
satisfactory progress. There are some signs of the long awaited recovery in
the UK and as this develops we should see further benefits for the group.'
Mr John Bell, chief executive, said he was delighted with the performance of
Flexonics, the US manufacturer of flexible hose and expansion joints, which
the group bought for Dollars 40m in February last year.
Mr Bell added that Flexonics was now a leading supplier of flexible
couplings to the US and British automotive industry and was winning more
orders from Japanese and European car makers.
A greenfield development for Flexonics Automotive in Wales will begin
trading in the second half of the year.
Engineered products accounted for 46 per cent of group sales, up from 42 per
cent. The depressed construction services division was responsible for 17
per cent of sales (20 per cent).
The thermal engineering division's contribution was steady at 37 per cent of
sales, against 38 per cent, with substantial growth in the US offsetting
reduced activity in the UK. Earnings per share rose to 3.33p (3.07p). The
interim dividend is lifted 5 per cent to 1.26p (1.2p).
COMMENT
Senior's exit from the mining equipment industry and the closure of its
large power contracting business look well-timed, even if FRS 3 meant that
the full-year results for 1992 took a knock. These figures highlight another
good piece of timing by the group - its purchase and then heavy investment
in Flexonics, which has given it a strong and growing position in the
automotive industry. With gearing standing at a comfortable 26 per cent,
Senior is likely to increase its Flexonics presence in Germany by
acquisition. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 23m put the shares, up 3p
to 119 1/2 p, on a prospective multiple of 18. That is not unreasonable for
a company that has weathered the recession better than most other
engineering stocks.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant car sales put Henlys Pounds 3.22m
back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT car sales, particularly to fleet buyers, lower interest costs and a
turnround in the bus and coach building business helped Henlys Group bounce
back into profit in the first half.
Henlys, which fought off a hostile takeover bid from its rival T Cowie last
year, achieved Pounds 3.22m pre-tax in the six months to June 30. Losses of
Pounds 898,000 a year ago were after reorganisation costs of Pounds 950,000.
Earnings per share were 6.6p (losses 2.7p) and the interim dividend is
lifted 50 per cent to 1.5p.
Based on the continuing high level of activity in both the motor division
and coach manufacturing and sales division the board said it also intended
recommending a 50 per cent increase in the final dividend to 3p.
Turnover increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 188.2m (Pounds 166.5m) led by a
20 per cent gain in the motor division where turnover rose to Pounds 154.5m
(Pounds 128.8m).
Operating profits in the motor division, jumped by 17.7 per cent to Pounds
3.83m as the group outpaced the market with a 24 per cent increase in new
car sales - including a 34 per cent gain in fleet sales - and a good
performance in service and after-sales activities.
The coach manufacturing and sales division managed to turn a Pounds 1.02m
operating loss into a Pounds 438,000 profit despite a decline in turnover to
Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 37.6m).
Group profits were also boosted by lower interest costs of Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 2.35m) reflecting lower interest rates and a reduction in borrowings
which stood at Pounds 23.9m at the end of June, down Pounds 6m, representing
gearing of 51 per cent. The shares closed at 233p, up 11p.
COMMENT
Shareholders who backed Henlys during last year's takeover battle have been
rewarded. Based on current share prices they are now 35 per cent better off
than they would have been accepting the Cowie offer. By targeting fleet
buyers Henlys' new car sales are running well ahead of the underlying market
growth of 9 per cent. Meanwhile, the struggling bus and coach business
appears to have finally turned the corner. Production will be about 25 per
cent higher in 1993 and is expected to rise again next year. Analysts were
upgrading their profit forecasts yesterday and, based on cautious estimates,
the group should achieve pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6.1m this year,
equivalent to earnings of 12.6p per share, and is trading on a prospective
p/e of 18.6.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Provident doubles to Pounds 21.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVIDENT Financial, the consumer credit and insurance company, nearly
doubled pre-tax profits in the first half of the year helped by a modest
rise in demand for loans among its niche market of poorer customers.
Provident, which sold its banking operations last year and has stopped
retail merchandising linked to consumer credit, raised profits to Pounds
21.9m, against Pounds 11.6m, reduced by Pounds 1.21m from the reported
figure as a result of FRS 3.
It raised its interim dividend from 3.7p to 4.75p from earnings per share of
11.05p, against 6.05p adjusted for the 5-for-2 share split.
The home collected credit division, which makes cash loans with repayments
collected weekly by agents paid by commission, increased its Pounds 400m
loan book by 9 per cent, a third through higher demand and two thirds by
adding new customers.
The company managed to convert 100,000 customers of its retail merchandising
operations to weekly collected credit. The level of provisions against bad
debt rose by 4 per cent, although Provident does not disclose provisions
figure.
Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said its customers appeared to be
'feeling slightly more confident about the economic conditions'.
The group has also added to the numbers by promotions through its network of
agents.
Mr van Kuffeler said that about half the 44 per cent rise in home collected
credit profits had come through cutting costs. It had reduced branches from
360 to 277 over the year, and was experimenting with branchless operations.
The insurance division, which comprises its Halifax Insurance motor business
and Colonnade Insurance Brokers, increased profits to Pounds 5.3m. Halifax
moved from a Pounds 400,000 loss to Pounds 3.9m profit, helped by a large
growth in policyholders.
Mr van Kuffeler said that policies had risen from 400,000 at the year end to
540,000 by the end of June. He said that this growth was likely to level off
in the second half after strong promotion of the business in the first half.
The shares rose 9p at 452p.
COMMENT
Provident has reaped gains from the focusing of the business and stringent
cost-cutting. It can expect full-year earnings of 30p per share, giving a
prospective multiple of about 15. That seems demanding in the long term
unless it finds a means of sustaining earnings. It may be able to eke some
more from its income streams, but cost-cutting will eventually run its
course. That suggests an acquisition in the insurance field, in which case
much will depend how much it pays. There is a little more in the shares, but
not a huge amount.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cray bid values P-E at Pounds 16.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAY Electronics Holdings, the data communications and software systems
group, yesterday launched a recommended all-share offer for P-E
International which values the management and computer consultancy group -
one of Europe's oldest - at about Pounds 16.24m.
The planned acquisition will represent a further significant expansion of
Cray's existing computer services business and highlight the continuing
process of reshaping under way in the computer services and management
consultancy sectors in the face of mounting competition.
The deal also represents Cray's second sizeable acquisition in 12 months.
The Berkshire-based group, which operates through three divisions, acquired
the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m in August
last year.
Cray is offering one new share for every two P-E shares valuing the group at
74 1/4 p per share.
Yesterday P-E shares closed up 10p at 75p while Cray, which was reported to
be active in the market picking up at least one institutional shareholder's
entire holding, closed 1p lower at 148p.
The company has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from
P-E's directors and its largest shareholder, the Merchant Navy Officers
Pension Fund, who together hold about 16 per cent of the issued share
capital.
If completed the deal will double the size of Cray's systems division, which
comprised 19 per cent of continuing group turnover last year, and create a
combined business with annual revenues of about Pounds 70m.
Mr Roger Holland, Cray's chairman, said: 'The acquisition of P-E will
consolidate Cray's computer systems and software products business as a
major participant in its markets and enable it to provide a wider range of
software products from a more efficient base.'
Mr Holland said he had first approached P-E about a merger two years ago,
but at that stage his advances were firmly rejected.
For P-E, which yesterday also announced a Pounds 896,000 pre-tax loss
(Pounds 515,000 profit) on turnover of Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 35.3m) for the
six months to June 30, the deal represents an opportunity to tie-up with a
financially strong partner.
P-E, which omitted its final dividend last year after profits tumbled to
just over the break-even level and is also omitting its interim dividend,
has been struggling to cut costs and reorganise its management while also
investing in new business areas over the past 15 months since Mr George Cox
stepped in as chairman.
Although he acknowledged that P-E might have needed to tap the market for
additional funds to continue with its reorganisation and expand into new
business areas, he firmly rejected suggestions that the deal represented a
'rescue'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles slips to Pounds 13.7m -
Martin Taylor prepares his departure with a strong second half recovery in
prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A man who appears to get most things right Mr Martin Taylor's timing
does not look good.
The chief executive and chairman of Courtaulds Textiles yesterday announced
a 16.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m for the half year to
end-June.
The company is expected to recover strongly over the next six months, but by
then Mr Taylor will have already moved on to his new job as chief executive
of Barclays.
At the mere mention of his departure Mr Taylor tries to anticipate the
follow-up question. 'Am I sorry that I am leaving Courtaulds? Yes, it is
earlier than I would have liked. But do I think it is reckless? No, the
company is in great shape.'
If Mr Taylor's timing is in doubt his natural ability for public relations
is not.
His ability to charm shareholders, analysts and journalists alike partly
explains his success at Courtaulds. A big feature of his tenure at the
company has been its ability to generate cash.
When it was demerged three years ago it had borrowings of more than Pounds
70m. After reducing net debt in 1991 by Pounds 39m, a further reduction of
Pounds 33m was achieved last year. By the year end the company will
effectively be ungeared.
However, the price has been high. He has closed 20 out of the company's 23
UK spinning mills, axing thousands of jobs. The City was delighted. But
there are still critics who believe he contributed to the decimation of the
British textiles industry.
Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about his tenure at Courtaulds is that
there was never a bigger row over his rationalisation programme.
'I could never understand,' says one textile analyst, 'why there was not an
uproar among the trade unions or in the press when Mr Taylor wielded the
knife.' By way of an explanation Mr Taylor says he has always believed in
the personal touch. 'It is much harder to be nasty about someone if you have
met them first.'
Internally, Mr Taylor did away with hierarchies. He once told a merchant
banker: 'I cannot manage without talking to everyone.' Externally, he did
much the same. An analyst who talked somewhat critically to one of
Courtaulds' institutional shareholders remembers being surprised to receive
a call from Mr Taylor the next day inviting him for lunch.
Having got through the difficult period of rationalisation, Mr Taylor can
take satisfaction that he all but eliminated borrowings during one of the
worst recessions.
He has not, however, been able to achieve the same results with the profit
and loss account, which is one of the reasons why he would have preferred
the Barclays job to have come up later.
After stripping out the effects of lower interest receivable because of the
fall in UK interest rates and the decline in the contribution from the
pension fund surplus the profits and earnings per share were broadly flat.
'Not a particularly beautiful set of results,' explains Mr Taylor. Analysts
are forecasting full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 45m.
Mr Taylor is careful not to make too many predictions about the future. He
says the last thing he wants to do is leave his successor, Mr Noel Jervis,
with albatrosses around his neck.
But in the longer-term Mr Taylor is bullish about the group's prospects.
'If the trends had not been in the right direction I would not have raised
the dividend by almost 7 per cent,' he says. He also believes he has left
the company in a good position to make further acquisitions.
If Courtaulds' future profits match expectations further praise will
probably be lavished on Mr Taylor. If profits are disappointing it will be
Mr Jervis who will be forced to give an explanation.
Perhaps Mr Taylor's timing is good after all.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wickes calls for Pounds 58.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WICKES, the DIY and timber retailer that came close to collapse two years
ago, yesterday announced a Pounds 58.1m rights issue to fund an aggressive
programme of expansion, including doubling the number of its UK stores to
150.
The money will initially be used to reduce borrowings, which were a net
Pounds 70.6m at the halfway stage in June, giving gearing of 88 per cent.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said: 'The group's level of debt has been a
constraint on its ability to expand.
'As a result of the rights issue, Wickes will have the financial resources
to take advantage of the attractive opportunities currently available at
this stage of the economic cycle.'
The 2-for-9 issue of 67.9m new shares at 88p each is fully underwritten by
SG Warburg and SG Warburg Securities is the broker.
In the current year the company plans to open 18 stores at an average cost
of Pounds 600,000.
Mr Sweetbaum said the company had taken over the leases on about six or
seven sites of the loss-making Do It All chain, which is a joint venture
between WH Smith and Boots, and a similar number from Texas, part of
Ladbrokes.
Wickes is also planning further expansion of the 36 stores in Belgium,
France and the Netherlands, as well as accelerating the expansion of
Builders Mate, the discount builders merchant.
Mr Sweetbaum believes that the DIY market in the UK is not yet 'saturated'.
He thought the market could 'easily support' 150 Wickes stores, compared
with the current 77.
There was also room for more than 200 Builders Mate stores.
COMMENT
Tactical, if a little tactless, was the verdict on Wickes' latest call on
its investors and the shares closed down 4p at 102p. Wickes only returned to
the dividend list two weeks ago after a two-year absence while management
tackled its disastrous foray into the timber market. Rights issues funded
both the foray and the subsequent rescue. Not surprisingly, the market
wonders how management will cope with the strain of the ambitious programme
at home and abroad. Against this, the funds will go to Wickes' core stores
business, which has been profitable throughout the recession, and the new
trade business, Builders Mate, which is breaking even. Pre-tax profit
forecasts have been revised upwards by Pounds 1m to about Pounds 19m, but
show earnings diluted at 4.2p (4.3p) and a fairly demanding multiple of 24.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rank sells eight more hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent

<TEXT>
THE RANK Organisation has sold eight provincial hotels to the privately
owned Macdonald Hotels group.
Rank would not reveal the price paid, but it is thought to be about Pounds
26m.
Of the 22 hotels put up for sale in April 1992, Rank has now sold 14. It has
since decided to retain the Alvaston Hall hotel in Nantwich, Cheshire, as
part of its Warner holiday business.
The group said it was talking to prospective buyers of the remaining hotels,
which include the Royal Garden and Royal Lancaster hotels in London.
Mr Angus Chrichton-Miller, managing director of Rank's hotels division,
expected the remaining seven hotels to be sold by next April.
Among the hotels sold yesterday were the Last Drop in Bolton and the Tickled
Trout, near Preston.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale behind advance at Persimmon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED purchases by housing associations helped lift unit sales at
Persimmon, the York-based housebuilder, by 30 per cent to 1,462 in the half
year to June 30 1993.
However, lower average selling prices and margins held back profits.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 7.25m to Pounds 9.72m helped by a
Pounds 2.36m profit on the sale of a non-trading subsidiary with surplus
advance corporation tax and lower interest charges of Pounds 1.32m, compared
with Pounds 1.98m.
At the operating level profits came out lower at Pounds 8.68m, against
Pounds 9.23m.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'House prices are starting to move.
There is a stronger secondhand market. Confidence and fear of unemployment
are still holding back the housing market.'
Turnover increased to Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 71.5m). The company said 300 of
its total sales were to housing associations at an average selling price of
about Pounds 45,000, compared with Pounds 65,000 for each speculative house
sale. Operating margins fell to 10.2 per cent, against 12.9 per cent.
The landbank stood at a stable 13,350 units with planning consent. Persimmon
also owns, or has options on, 2,700 acres for which it is seeking planning
permission.
Mr Mike Allen, deputy chairman, said the company was reducing expensive
incentives: 'Part exchange sales are costing us less than they did six or
seven months ago. Last year each sale cost Pounds 5,500 compared with Pounds
1,500 in 1988.'
At the end of the period borrowings were Pounds 23m giving gearing of 16 per
cent.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.8p. Earnings per share were 7.6p
(5.2p).
COMMENT
Shares in Persimmon yesterday closed up 5p at 289p indicating some caution
over the ripeness of the profits. Better sales volume and headline pre-tax
profits have more to do with windfall gains than a good climate for housing.
The government's cash injection of Pounds 750m, which lifted sales to
housing associations, is unlikely to be repeated. But the company could
realise a further Pounds 4.5m by 1995 from ACT-related disposals.
Exceptional gains apart, sales completed or in the pipeline since mid-year
already match the total for the first half and on higher margins. As land
prices improve, the company should benefit from its long landbank. However,
Persimmon owns only two thirds of its landbank with the remainder held in
joint ventures, a form of off-balance sheet financing which proposed
accounting rules could shortly outlaw. The company's own calculations are
that this would almost double gearing. Stripping out exceptional gains,
forecasts are for full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.5m, giving earnings
up to 12.4p. A prospective p/e of 25 is average for a sound builder but
investors are paying more for others in the sector offering more sparkling
prospects.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Multitrust net asset value rises to 48.6p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value per share of Multitrust increased from 33.2p to 48.6p over
the 12 months to June 30. At end-December 1992 the value was 35.25p.
For the year to end-June basic earnings per share were 2.17p (1.5p) and
available revenue increased from Pounds 65,124 to Pounds 93,972.
The proposed final dividend of 1.2p makes a 2.7p (2.5p) total.
Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman, said that having seen the increased value that
could be attributed to a company by an acquisition, he would be 'forced to
consider any serious proposals that appeared to be capable of giving
significant added value to all shareholders'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hanson spells out cost of US strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US coal miners strike affecting some of Hanson's US coal mines could cut
the Anglo-American conglomerate's profits by between Pounds 60m and Pounds
80m in the fourth quarter of its current financial year which ends this
month. The cost would continue at a similar rate as long as the strike
continues at its current intensity, it emerged yesterday.
The forecast appeared in a letter to shareholders of Quantum Chemical
Corporation, the US group which has agreed to a bid from Hanson worth
Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.22bn), including the assumption of Dollars 2.5m of
debt.
The letter calls for a special meeting of Quantum shareholders for September
30 (Hanson's year end) to vote on the merger. The vote requires a two thirds
majority of shares in issue.
In the letter Hanson said the strike, which had hit 20 of its Peabody
subsidiary's 22 mines and facilities, had cut profits by Pounds 29m in the
third quarter of its year.
It said talks between the coal operators association and the union had
recommenced on August 11, but there was no guarantee that these would lead
to an agreement by any particular date.
The letter also shows that if Quantum accepts a higher offer from another
bidder it would have to pay Hanson a Dollars 50m fee. This could deter other
potential buyers, the letter said.
Further, it says that nine officers of Quantum would share a lump sum
payment of Dollars 18.7m if the merger goes through. An option scheme would
be worth Dollars 11.9m to Quantum's executive officers and Dollars 1.64m to
its non-employee directors.
In the letter Quantum, which makes polyethylene and other chemicals, gives a
forecast of operating profits for 1993 to 1997, although warning that the
numbers could vary materially.
The profit projection shows operating profits of Dollars 105.3m in 1993
rising to Dollars 546m by 1997, with net income moving from a loss of
Dollars 102m in 1993 to a profit of Dollars 186.1m in 1997.
The projection is based on forecasts of polyethylene volumes and prices,
annual cost savings rising to Dollars 66m in 1997, and other factors
including the receipt of a Dollars 32.1m insurance claim by the end of 1993.
Hanson's shares fell 2 1/4 p to 257 1/2 p yesterday, although it has risen
from 222 1/2 p since June 30 when the merger with Quantum was announced.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle issues profits warning: Tate shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Tate &amp; Lyle fell 25p to 375p yesterday after the sugar and
sweeteners group said profits for the year to September 25 would 'fall short
of the 1991 level'.
Analysts cut profit forecasts from around Pounds 235m to about Pounds 220m
pre-tax following the announcement. Some also cut forecasts for 1994.
Tate said this year's results would still show 'a marked improvement over
those achieved last year', when it suffered its first trading reverse for 14
years.
In 1992 pre-tax profits dropped to Pounds 189.5m from Pounds 230.8m in 1991.
Analysts had expected a rebound above the 1991 figure in the current year, a
view reinforced by interim pre-tax profits up 20 per cent to Pounds 107.6m.
Tate said trading in its North American sweeteners businesses had been less
buoyant than expected in the second half of the year.
In North America, Western Sugar, which processes sugar beet, had
difficulties at a new molasses desugarisation plant. US government quotas,
introduced to reduce the amount of sugar on the market, had forced it to
hold higher stocks.
Low sugar prices hit margins at Tate's Domino sugar subsidiary, which
refines sugar cane.
AE Staley, which makes high fructose sweetener from corn, had recovered some
of the volume it lost in 1992, but prices had not risen as hoped, Tate said,
and margins fell. The industrial dispute at Staley was yet to be resolved
but would not have a material effect on profits. Floods in the mid-west had
cut production from some rivals but this was too late to benefit the 1993
figures.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said the announcement had been made because
the group was seeing analysts later this week before annual results are
published in November.
Tate thought market forecasts were too high and decided to make a public
statement, following the London Stock Exchange's censure of London
International Group after it guided analysts to cut profit forecasts without
making a formal announcement.
Mr Lewis, who appeared surprised by the London stock market reaction, said
the statement represented a 'slight modification' to expectations, which
would not affect dividend policy.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Club Med sails close to the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUMMER holidays have come to an abrupt end for Club Mediterranee, one of
France's largest leisure and travel groups.
Club Med warned yesterday that the effects of recession and political
problems in some of its resorts could cause a pre-tax loss in the second
half, which started at the end of April. The share price fell FFr31 to close
at FFr405.10.
'They are in a risky business,' said one Paris-based industry analyst.
'It is not just the economic environment they have to contend with but the
threats of civil war, terrorism and political turmoil too.'
He forecast the group would now incur a loss for the full year of about
FFr50m (Pounds 5.75m) before exceptional items.
Club Med blamed the downturn in business prospects on several factors.
Recession in Europe had prompted severe competition and a price war between
tour operators, which had cut profit margins.
Some important destinations had to be closed, and others suffered a sharp
reduction in bookings. A holiday village in Israel, near the Lebanese
border, was closed temporarily as a result of conflict in the region. Two
resorts in Senegal had not been opened because of political unrest.
In Turkey and Egypt, two of the company's most sought-after destinations,
bookings had been disappointing.
Kidnapping of western tourists in the former and terrorist attacks by
Islamic fundamentalists in the latter led to a big fall in reservations.
Yesterday's warning was made in a statement to Balo, an official publication
which records quarterly results of French companies.
The statement outlined the group's performance in the first half of its
financial year, confirming that net profits had fallen to FFr2.15m from
FFr20.3m in the same period of 1992.
Industry analysts said first-half results had been buoyed by an accounting
change which extended the depreciation of group assets and had a favourable
impact of about FFr49m.
The results also benefited from a strong contribution from the group's US
and Asian operations, which made a pre-tax profit of about Dollars 32m
(Pounds 22m) during the period. But the group's activities in these regions
are traditionally much stronger in the first half and are unlikely to
compensate for problems in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second
six months.
'The problem they face is that they have a high level of fixed costs and a
low level of revenues,' said one analyst in Paris. 'This will create strong
pressure on their finances in the remainder of the year.'
Club Med said it would maintain its investment plans at a level 'necessary
to ensure clients a good level of service', but that the difficult
environment meant it would have to make economies and reduce costs. But the
company said that planned projects, such as a 700-bed holiday village on the
Chinese island of Hainan, due to open in 1995, would not be affected.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Bank launches Ecu settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday launched an Ecu securities settlements system,
designed to improve the market's liquidity and secure London's position as
an Ecu trading centre.
The Bank estimates that around 80 per cent of Ecu bond turnover is based in
London. However, volume has plummeted since hopes of imminent European
monetary union, with the Ecu as a single European currency, have receded. In
the second quarter of this year, Ecu bond trading volume reached the
equivalent of only Pounds 157bn, nearly a 50 per cent drop from the same
period last year. In addition, London lost the battle for dominance of the
Ecu bond futures market to Paris.
Mr Ian Plenderleith, an associate director of the Bank, said: 'The European
Settlements Office (ESO) builds on a series of initiatives by the Bank to
broaden the Ecu market infrastructure in London by providing real-time
settlement for the professional market.'
The ESO offers same-day settlement for Ecu bonds and money market
instruments, with electronic bridges for transferring bonds from Euroclear
and Cedel, the international bond clearing houses. They have five-day
settlement, although there are proposals to reduce it to two or three days.
With this technology in place, based on its gilts clearing operation, the
Bank could consider offering clearing services for bonds in other
currencies.
Same-day settlement is also intended to aid the development of an Ecu 'repo'
market. A repo, or repurchase agreement to sell and then buy back bonds at a
set price and time, allows traders to finance bond holdings more cheaply.
'The impact on the market will not be immediately noticeable, but it is a
statement of confidence in the Ecu market,' said Mr Jonathan Davies, senior
bond analyst at UBS.
For many traders, Euroclear and Cedel will remain more attractive, because
they settle all Eurobonds and most European government bonds, allowing
traders to switch between markets. The range will soon be extended to
include gilts.
'I do not really see the need for another clearing system, at a time when
the Ecu market is returning to its roots as a retail bond market,' one
trader said.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Simon loses Pounds 53m in first half: Simon passes dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear,
plunged into the red in the first half, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m.
It also announced yesterday it was passing its interim dividend and talking
to its bankers. The group, which has breached one of its covenants, was
confident of securing facilities through to the end of next year.
The deficit marks the culmination of more than two years of bad news from
the group, which has suffered from an ill-fated diversification into
environmental engineering, loss-making plant contracts, the recession and
rising debts. Mr Michael Davies, who became chairman last month, described
the results as 'extremely poor'.
Mr Maurice Dixson, who took over as chief executive yesterday, said his main
priority would be to reduce net debt to less than Pounds 100m from its
current Pounds 143m. Further businesses and properties would be sold. He
planned then to identify the strong remaining elements to establish a base
for future profits.
The first-half loss compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.16m a year
earlier when the interim dividend was 5p. Turnover fell from Pounds 242.3m
to Pounds 190.8m, including Pounds 5.4m from discontinued activities.
Shares slid 15 1/2 p yesterday to close at 57 1/2 p. They have tumbled from
nearly 400p in early 1991.
Mr Davies said the first half should be seen in three parts. First the group
incurred an operating loss of Pounds 6.9m, including Pounds 5.9m of trading
losses from businesses now sold. Second, it had made exceptional provisions
of Pounds 28.9m for further cost reductions, debt refinancing, potential
legal expenses and property write-downs. Third, exceptional charges of
Pounds 12.3m had arisen from the disposal of loss-making businesses.
In spite of the sale of most of the group's environmental division at the
beginning of the year, net borrowings rose to Pounds 133.9m - gearing of 195
per cent - at the end of June because of increased working capital
requirements, continuing poor trading and payment of the 1992 dividend.
The loss per share was 54.8p, compared with earnings per share of 3.6p. The
company, which does not expect to pay a final dividend, made a transfer from
reserves of Pounds 55.1m.
The powered access equipment division was expected to improve. Parts of the
industrial services division were generating both cash and profits.

FT  02 SEP 93 / FT-SE falls on gloomy statements: UK market unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market yesterday turned back from last week's peak levels
following discouraging trading statements from companies such as Tate &amp;
Lyle, Courtaulds and BPB.
The FT-SE 100 Index abandoned the 3,100 territory captured so triumphantly
on Friday, falling 14.9 points to 3,085.1. However, equities drew some
comfort in late dealings from a rally in the bond market.
Dealers noted an absence of buying support in London from the US investment
funds which had been driving share prices ahead. Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, has advised fund managers to favour equity investment in
France and Spain and on other continental bourses.
With the Bundesbank council not due to meet this week, hopes for early cuts
in interest rates have been put on hold, leaving the London stock market
vulnerable to bad news from company boardrooms.
A reaction from last week's UK equity peaks was not unexpected and market
strategists have not changed predictions for their FT-SE Index year-end
targets. These range from 2,900 at SG Warburg to 3,500 at Nomura
International. However, some analysts predict a downwards correction in the
short term, perhaps to FT-SE 3,030 or lower.
Securities firms are taking a cautious stance while awaiting further trading
reports from UK companies today. They are also aware of the likelihood of
further rights issues.

HIGHER than expected interest costs adversely affected Courtaulds Textiles,
which reported a 16.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m in
the first half.
The drop in net interest payable, from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.8m, was less
than analysts had expected.
Mr Martin Taylor, chairman and chief executive, said analysts had made 'an
error' in not realising the impact on interest income of the fall in UK
interest rates. Courtaulds keeps most of its cash in sterling deposits.
Borrowings declined from Pounds 64.6m to Pounds 53.2m. However, Mr Taylor
said the group would be effectively degeared by the year-end when debt
should fall back by around Pounds 50m.
Profit before interest in the UK rose from Pounds 9m to Pounds 10.6m, while
the US edged up to Pounds 4.5m, against Pounds 4.4m. In the rest of Europe,
however, profits collapsed from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 400,000.
Mr Taylor said: 'The continent is hell. Profits have fallen for five
half-years running and that hurts. The outlook is not good.'
The contribution from the pension fund surplus fell from Pounds 2.4m to
Pounds 700,000.
Profits before interest slipped from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 15.3m on
increased turnover of Pounds 422.5m (from Pounds 394.9m). It was the first
rise in sales since the demerger from Courtaulds Chemicals three years ago.
Mr Taylor said: 'Last year we reported big profit increases but were bearish
about the UK economy. This time profits have fallen but we are basically
bullish about the British recovery.'
A change in boardroom responsibilities follows Mr Taylor's appointment as
chief executive of Barclays Bank, which he starts in January. Mr Noel
Jervis, managing director, will replace Mr Taylor as chief executive.
Earnings per share fell to 10.4p from 12.2p. The interim dividend is raised
from 4.4p to 4.7p.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK calls for reform of EC social security systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is calling on European Community member states to
reform their social security systems to cut the cost of employment, and for
a radical review of all existing and proposed EC social legislation in the
light of its impact on job creation.
The proposals are contained in a UK Treasury and Department of Employment
document submitted to the European Commission. The Copenhagen summit of EC
leaders in June mandated Brussels to produce a white paper on growth,
competitiveness and jobs for the Brussels summit this December, and the
Commission yesterday began formal discussion on the subject in closed
session.
The UK call comes as EC countries including Germany, France and Belgium
search for ways to lighten the cost to business of taking on workers. These
are also the countries in the forefront of defending the EC's social charter
 -signed by all except the UK in 1989 - and the Maastricht treaty's social
chapter, from which Britain negotiated an opt-out.
The UK document reminds its EC partners and Brussels that 'the world does
not owe us a living'. EC treaty objectives of a 'high level of employment
and social protection have to be earned; they are aspirations, not
entitlements', it says.
Although it insists repeatedly that 'there is no question of abandoning
social protection', it argues that public social security and healthcare
expenditure - at twice Japanese levels and 60 per cent more than in the US -
have to be cut by more careful targeting of benefits, which should be scaled
to price people into jobs.
The document points out that in every economic cycle of the past three
decades, the underlying level of EC unemployment has increased, in line with
rising social security outlays. Labour markets are too rigid and are being
made more so by EC social legislation, it argues.

FT  02 SEP 93 / US targets regional conflicts in revamp of defence forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration has unveiled a strategic defence plan aimed at US
forces being able to win two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts as the
country moves from its cold war goal of defeating the Warsaw Pact.
The plan, which follows a five month 'bottom-up review' ordered by Mr Les
Aspin, the defence secretary, would reduce US troop strengths by about
150,000 to 1.4m by 1999, and would cancel weapons development programmes
such as the Navy's A/FX bomber and the Air Force's future multi-role
fighter.
The review proposes keeping about 100,000 troops in Europe and 100,000 in
Asia for the foreseeable future.
Mr Aspin said the new force structure, including 10 active Army divisions,
11 Navy aircraft carrier groups with one reserve carrier, and 13 active Air
Force fighter wings, had been dictated mainly by the need to prepare for
regional contingencies such as the Gulf war or a potential conflict with
North Korea.
'The regional danger is the main thing that drove the size of the defence
establishment that we are presenting,' Mr Aspin said, adding that enhanced
mobility and improved weaponry would also make US forces better adapted to
this kind of conflict.
The review recommends keeping enough troops to handle two regional conflicts
at the same time, but economises on transport, expecting that the US will
not need to lift more than one army at a time into war zones.
Mr Aspin declined to detail the budget implications of the review until next
week, but defence analysts said it would result in only small savings from
the earlier Base Force plan developed under former president George Bush.
The Washington Post reported this month that the plan would cost about
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) more over the next five years than President Bill
Clinton has budgeted for.
The Aspin plan, approved by Mr Clinton this week, would retain two fewer
active army divisions than the Bush proposals, but keep more marines. It
would keep the same number of carrier battle groups and just over two fewer
air wings.
The review had been widely expected to recommend the cancellation of the
A/FX and the MRF. Congress may, however, take issue with some of the other
elements in the plan.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Israel-PLO pact could be signed 'within days'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was
last night battling to persuade his senior colleagues in Tunis to sign an
unprecedented mutual recognition accord with Israel.
According to a Palestinian source, the PLO was studying a revised draft,
conveyed to them by Egypt, of a statement announcing that Israel and the PLO
recognise each other.
Jordan, meanwhile, said it would sign a preliminary peace agreement with
Israel in Washington.
At PLO headquarters in Tunis, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, an executive committee
member, said the accord could be signed within days and would be agreed
before the signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, shared the optimism and said
Israel was ready to sign a recognition agreement immediately the PLO agreed
to annul its charter calling for the annihilation of the Jewish state.
Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby EC officials for aid to
Palestinians, said the accord was separate and independent from a peace deal
with Palestinians on interim self-rule.
He said the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on self-rule for
1.9m Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, including
Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho,
'stands on its own legs'.
In Amman, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, the Jordanian prime minister, said he
expected a Jordanian-Israeli declaration of principles to be signed during
the current round of Middle East peace negotiations in Washington. 'Aside
from certain matters concerning language, we are likely to agree on an
agenda this time round,' he said.
The agenda - which contains the framework for a peace agreement - is
believed to include the return by Israel of two strips of land and increased
Jordanian water rights from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. It also outlines
the right of return of an estimated 100,000 Palestinian refugees who fled to
Jordan after the 1967 war.
In Jerusalem, Mr Peres said a Jordanian agreement could be signed
'tomorrow'.
King Hussein, however, reflecting Jordanian disquiet with lack of
consultation by Palestinians, urged Arabs in a TV interview to be broadcast
today to convene a summit to face dangers confronting them.
The rapidly developing Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian breakthrough showed
signs of triggering possible progress in the two other tracks of the Middle
East peace process - the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks.
A PLO official said Spain was hosting secret talks among the three parties
and that a draft Israeli-Syrian agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace was close to completion.
However, Israel and Syria denied the claim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About the only piece of encouraging news amid the red ink is that Simon
Engineering has finally stopped leaking cash. A cash outflow of Pounds 80m
over the last 18 months - more but for recent asset sales - cannot be blamed
on poor markets alone.
The shame is that it took a breach of banking covenants and a change of
management to bring about effective action. While additional cash might be
squeezed by reducing working capital, the sheer scale of indebtedness now
demands further disposals.
The promised refinancing agreement contains a timetable for repayment,
leaving the banks with the whip hand. Shedding surplus property and
loss-making subsidiaries is unlikely to suffice. The recovery potential of
what is left will not be clear until that process is complete.

<TEXT>
The departure of Mr John Maxwell after only nine months as chief executive
of BPB provokes explanations both mundane and Machiavellian. On the one hand
the bromide issued by the company to explain his removal seems both a little
thin and self-serving. BPB had six months to evaluate Mr Maxwell's
performance before promoting him, so any concerns might have been expected
to come to light earlier.
If there were worries about his performance, then he was given precious
little time to rectify them in a period of comparative calm in the
plasterboard market.
The temptation is thus to look deeper for potential policy disagreements.
While there is much to be said for concentrating on areas of expertise,
BPB's heavy dependence on a single product with such a violent cycle is
something few managers would freely choose. If Mr Maxwell wanted to
diversify he might well have met resistance, since the company has failed
here before. Perhaps the appointment of his successor will offer clues to
the course of such internal debates.

FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Ciba
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Ciba is further down the road towards restructuring than most of its
continental European rivals, yesterday's half-year results underline that it
cannot afford to relax. The 10 per cent fall in operating profits would have
been worse but for cost-cutting measures already taken. The expiry of the US
patent of Voltarin, its largest selling drug, at the end of this year will
be a further test of resolve. The target set in 1991 was to reduce costs in
relation to sales by three percentage points over three years. The question
is whether management will stick to its guns should sales growth prove
elusive.
By cutting 700 jobs from its US pharmaceuticals business, Ciba has taken
pre-emptive action ahead of the patent expiry. The hope must be that its
interests outside pharmaceuticals will be showing decent sales growth by the
time Voltarin starts to decline. Yesterday's statement was surprisingly
positive in respect of both industrial chemicals and agrochemicals, despite
the dual impact of recession and Common Agricultural Policy reforms.
But that may not be enough to stir enthusiasm among investors. The immediate
prospects for Ciba's pharmaceuticals look uninspiring in comparison with
Roche or Astra. Yet the scope for cyclical recovery in agrochemicals is -
for those prepared to take an optimistic view - no match for bulk chemicals
companies such as BASF.

FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor's farewell to Courtaulds Textiles was bound to be
bittersweet. Despite the upturn in the UK market, the lead times in textiles
are such that the chairman will not be there to enjoy the full fruits of his
labours. Indeed, in the three years since Courtaulds Textiles was demerged,
sales of continuing operations are up modestly, profits and earnings are
flat and return on capital employed is down. True, that performance leant on
pension credits above the line on the one hand and extraordinary
bloodletting below on the other. But then the company has had to deal with
the horrors of recession and the ERM. Fund managers, meanwhile, have had the
cash generation and strengthening balance sheet to help them keep the faith.
In the second half, and more particularly next year, the recovery should
start to show through more strongly. The replacement management team may
thus count itself fortunate since, somewhat unfairly, institutional patience
may wear thinner once Mr Taylor's presentational panache is put to work
elsewhere. Dropping the pilot this early in the upswing also gives several
board members a chance to become more seasoned in their functional
responsibilities before they have to face serious navigational hazards.

FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tate turns sour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever one thinks of Tate &amp; Lyle's profit warning, the company deserves
some credit for the way in which it was announced. A formal statement is
more honest and open than dribbling out the information selectively to
analysts, even if it does mean more abrupt swings in share prices. The 6 per
cent fall in Tate's share price looks excessive when profits growth will
still be in the mid-teens this year and the dividend is unaffected. It has a
certain logic just the same.
Tate is rapidly acquiring a reputation for not delivering on promises. Its
failure to recover as quickly as expected from last year's setback in the US
fructose market follows earlier disappointment with two high value-added
products, Sucralose and Stellar, and the unexpected departure of Mr Stephen
Brown as chief executive in March.
Tate's strategy of focusing on its basic commodity business has two
significant drawbacks. It is forcing the company into markets like eastern
Europe where pay-back periods are long, and it subjects profits to the whims
of politicians. The US fructose market would be less crowded if ethanol were
allowed as a petrol additive and the North American Free Trade Agreement
ratified, though the latter provides for only a gradual reduction in Mexican
import tariffs. But one cannot count on these developments. Tate's historic
yield of 4 per cent is only limited compensation for the uncertainty;
Dalgety and United Biscuits offer more.

FT  02 SEP 93 / UK calls for review of EC social legislation: Reforms needed
to cut cost of employment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is calling on European Community member states to
reform their social security systems to cut the cost of employment, and for
a radical review of all existing and proposed EC social legislation in the
light of its impact on job creation.
The proposals are contained in a UK Treasury and Department of Employment
document submitted to the European Commission. The Copenhagen summit of EC
leaders in June mandated Brussels to produce a white paper on growth,
competitiveness and jobs for the Brussels summit this December, and the
Commission yesterday began formal discussion on the subject in closed
session.
The UK call comes as EC countries including Germany, France and Belgium
search for ways to lighten the cost to business of taking on workers. These
are also the countries in the forefront of defending the EC's social charter
 -signed by all except the UK in 1989 - and the Maastricht treaty's social
chapter, from which Britain negotiated an opt-out.
The UK document starts by reminding its EC partners and Brussels that 'the
world does not owe us a living'. EC treaty objectives of a 'high level of
employment and social protection have to be earned; they are aspirations,
not entitlements,' it says.
Although it insists repeatedly that 'there is no question of abandoning
social protection', it argues that public social security and healthcare
expenditure - at twice Japanese levels and 60 per cent more than in the US -
have to be cut by more careful targeting of benefits, which should be scaled
to price people into jobs.
The document points out that in every economic cycle of the last three
decades, the underlying level of EC unemployment has increased, in line with
rising social security outlays. Labour markets are too rigid and are being
made more so by EC social legislation, it argues.
The UK calls for 'early proposals for lightening the burden of Community
rules,' and a Commission task force to re-examine EC social legislation. It
wants the Commission to 'introduce a system of cost-benefit analysis' for
its proposals.
Ironically, the UK was offered such an audit system at the December 1991
Maastricht summit, as part of a compromise whereby Britain would accept a
watered-down social chapter, but Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
refused.
The UK now senses that the tide is turning in its favour in the debate on
social policy. 'There clearly is a link between high levels of social
protection and rising unemployment,' one UK official aid yesterday. 'This is
a door which is giving, and we've been pushing at it for a long time now,'
he added.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Leading Article: A message in the Sky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH was in cocky form yesterday, launching Sky TV's latest
assault on the UK market, and not without reason. Sky's 14-channel satellite
pay-TV service may represent a turning point in British broadcasting.
Within four years, Mr Murdoch has moved from no stake in British television,
to running a company delivering 10 more channels than his earth-bound
competitors put together. According to a report by consultants Booze Allen
and Hamilton for the terrestrial ITV companies, commissioned as part of
ITV's submission to the government's green paper on the BBC, BSkyB (Sky's
parent company) may well have revenues greater than the entire ITV system by
1996. By 2000, it is forecast to be solidly ahead.
Having approached financial disaster three years ago, Mr Murdoch can again
lay claim to visionary status. His conviction is that five industries -
telecommunications, computers, entertainment, publishing and consumer
electronics - are converging and that News Corp can establish itself as one
of a handful of master salesmen along this global highway.
This may all seem a great distance from the issues preoccupying British
broadcasting policymakers, but it is surely worth them reflecting upon Mr
Murdoch's meteoric ascent.
Perhaps their first thought should be that this has occurred in spite of,
not because of, government policy. It was policy to license a single,
private-sector monopoly, British Satellite Broadcasting. Mr Murdoch,
technologically opportunistic, challenged that monopoly from a base outside
the UK regulatory framework, fought BSB to a bloody standstill and merged
the two companies.
BSkyB's regulatory status remains hazy, with the company exempt from many of
the constraints which affect terrestrial competitors. These include
programme schedules (see this week's renewed argument over the future of
ITV's News at Ten) and rules on national origin of programmes, which allow
Sky more freedom to use cheap American material.
To this, there are two possible policy responses: to deregulate all
commercial broadcasters or to bring BSkyB within the terrestrial regulatory
regime. Naturally, the terrestrial broadcasters prefer the latter, for them
safer, option.
As they consider this, policymakers should, however, note another point
about Sky's new service, namely the extent to which it is an alliance of
many broadcasting companies, including even the BBC, which is a major
shareholder in one of the new Sky channels, much to ITV's annoyance. At the
same time, few have noticed that Mr Murdoch's recent purchase of Star TV in
Hong Kong makes him the Asian distributor of BBC World Service TV.
In broadcasting, the corporate and geographical boundaries are well and
truly down. It must be asked whether a regulatory model based upon
assumptions of limited air space and state regulation of programmes might
not have had its day.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Reforming Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEREGULATION package proposed yesterday by the new government in Tokyo
is the clearest sign yet that the reformist ambitions of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, prime minister, stretch beyond the political system into the
character of Japan's economy. Even though Japan has fiercely competitive
markets in international industries such as cars and electronics, many
largely domestic areas such as retailing and distribution are encrusted by
regulations. These accumulated during the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year
reign, which ended in July, as it offered small businesses, retailers and
farmers protection from competition in return for their votes. The myriad
hurdles put in the way of a new shop opening, for instance, make it
difficult for new entrants to set up in business, whether they are foreign
or Japanese. As a result, competition is constrained and prices stay higher
than they need be.
The international ramifications go further. Japan's trade surplus is a
reflection of its high savings rate. A sustained shift towards consumption
to reduce savings, and so the trade surplus, will require a relaxation of
planning laws to make it easier for retailers to build shops and consumers
to buy houses, for which they will buy goods. Japanese consumption is
severely constrained by limits on housing development imposed by regulations
to protect farmers.
Sceptics will caution that the Hosokawa coalition will face fierce
opposition from the bureaucracy and business lobbies which could break it
apart. Indeed, there are already signs of serious dissension over whether
the government's mandate extends to thoroughgoing economic reform or is
confined to enacting changes in the political system. Japan stands to
benefit most if Mr Hosokawa is bold: his tentative step towards deregulation
is a hint of how much a reformist government could achieve with several
years in power, backed by powerful constituencies in favour of
liberalisation, not least urban consumers.
The Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance support deregulation as a means of
heading off US pressure for further stimulus to boost the still sluggish
economy and cut the trade surplus. The truth is there is still room and need
for a further cut in interest rates and a tax-cutting package this autumn.
But the promise of deregulation also suggests a change of approach is needed
on the part of Japan's partners, in particular the Clinton administration.
It has sought to justify its call for managed trade agreements with Tokyo on
the grounds that efforts to open up markets are rebuffed by bureaucratic
resistance and political inertia. The US is now dealing with a government
which is prepared to deregulate in the name of competition and the consumer.
The Hosokawa government represents a chance for Japan to break with the
past, and should be embraced by the Clinton administration as such.

FT  02 SEP 93 / 'Social tasks of business': The following is a digest of
Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British Association
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A couple of developments in business thinking, logically separable but often
linked together, need probing. The first is the idea of the 'social
responsibility of business'. An organisation entitled Business in the
Community, which has the Prince of Wales as president and with which several
business leaders are associated, has said in one of its documents that it
means 'companies using some of their people, their expertise, their surplus
product, premises and equipment, and sometimes cash to help tackle problems
like urban deprivation, school-business links, job creation and
environmental improvements'.
The second is the fashionable cult of the businessman as the person to run
and advise on everything. Both the Thatcher and the Major governments have
attempted to recruit corporate leaders to run industrial training, manage
schools, reorganise Whitehall, run the health service, and heaven knows what
else. What the two developments have in common is that they are attempts to
achieve public policy objectives on the cheap and on the side and are thus
unlikely to be too successful.
The cult of the businessman is less objectionable when executives spend a
spell working full time in the public policy area. But it is difficult for a
good manager just to take a couple of years off to work for a public
authority and then return to his old career; and retired directors are a
variable asset.
The big objection is to corporate executives being expected to undertake a
large burden of public duties in their own or their companies' time. I often
wonder how the favoured executives can manage their own organisations if
they are also supposed to sit on hospital boards, run numerous other quangos
and have a chance of normal family life and leisure.
People function best if they have specific responsibilities. If a
businessman is partly responsible for government policy, and an official
regards himself as responsible for the profitability of companies, then
everyone is responsible for everything, and no one is responsible for
anything in particular.
The advocates of 'socially responsible' business make very large claims; and
their slogan writers regard any questioning of their rationale as an attack
on objectives such as urban renewal, support of the arts or employee welfare
facilities. If one is not careful they will insinuate that one is to the
right of Genghis Khan, not to speak of 'monetarist'.
There is a systematic ambiguity. Do the proponents claim that the extra
activities will indeed help a business's long-term profitability? Or do they
assert that a business should follow different objectives? Too often they
try to have it both ways.
'Corporate responsibility' lacks the legitimacy of either the market or the
political process. It is not for managers to set themselves up as taxing
authorities over funds which belong to shareholders - who may be their own
employees or other workers investing through pension funds.
The 'constitutionalist' opponent does not have to be starry-eyed about real
world markets. He is saying that if there are market failures or
inadequacies, it is up to the government to set up incentives for people to
behave differently, by taxes or subsidies or, if necessary, by regulation or
financing public services. Income can be redistributed via the tax and
social security system. The government can intervene to improve incentives
for training or for letting homes. But it is not for corporations to take on
a pseudo-governmental role.
The weakness of the constitutionalist position is that it falls into the
trap of supposing that flesh-and-blood government will conform to some
textbook model. But of course official programmes will be driven or
distorted by interest groups, or by the self-interest of the providers of
public services. Education, training and environmental programmes will often
be very different from those that would help most. As corporate executives
may have readily tapped dispersed local information, why not make use of
their know-how? So the argument is not as clear-cut as readers of Milton
Friedman might suppose.
In the last analysis, however, even our imperfectly enfranchised
shareholders will ensure that companies do not devote more than a modest
proportion of their resources to non-bottom line activities; so both the
business enthusiast and the government are deceiving themselves if they
expect 'socially responsible companies' to carry the public policy load.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Private prisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRATEGY for future private-sector involvement in the UK prison service
will be launched today by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary. The
opposition, prison officers and penal reformers have issued noisy warnings
against any further privatisation of prisons. Mr Howard should not, however,
be defensive about the merits of more competition in the prison system.
So far the management of only three prisons has been put out to tender.
Private sector companies now run two of them: the Wolds on Humberside and
Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester. But the benefits of competition can
be seen best at Strangeways prison in Manchester, where the contract was
awarded to the in-house team. Staff agreed to drop restrictive practices to
submit a bid 20 per cent below the average cost of directly-managed prisons.
The tendering process will need to continue if such savings are to be
extended throughout the prison service.
The beneficial effects of privatisation are not limited to greater
flexibility in the management of prisons. Privately-run jails can also bring
innovation in the prison regime, as Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector
of prisons, stated in last week's report on the Wolds prison. He was fulsome
in his praise for the facilities, the staff and the treatment of inmates.
Before further prisons are privatised, however, attention needs to be given
to the Judge's criticisms of the Wolds. While inmates were allowed out of
their cells for much of the day, too little was done to encourage them to
use the time usefully. The result was 'a degree of lethargy which can be
corrupting', an unfortunate finding at a time when the home secretary is
reported to be concerned that prison life is not austere enough.
There are special circumstances at the Wolds, which is the only prison
devoted wholly to prisoners on remand. Since they have not been convicted,
they cannot be compelled to work. But as Judge Tumim pointed out, the regime
could provide inmates with incentives to make more productive use of their
time, through work, education and training. Yet Group 4, the company running
the Wolds, is not required to offer such opportunities by the contract under
which the prison is managed.
The judge found other deficiencies in the contract. There was a lack of
clarity over the responsibility for the care and discipline of prisoners.
Responsibility was unclear for many items of expenditure, including utility
charges, damage through vandalism and maintenance. There was an absence of
systems for checking financial aspects of the contract.
The judge concluded that weaknesses in the contract made it impossible to
determine the value for money of privatising the Wolds. The contractual
arrangements must therefore be urgently reviewed before further prisons are
privatised.

Guido Rossi, the former stock market watchdog and left-wing politician
parachuted in by anxious creditor banks to chair Italy's troubled Ferruzzi
group, has been showing his teeth.
His patience sorely tested during a mammoth seven-hour annual meeting this
week, Rossi finally lashed out at one of the small 'shareholders', whose
interminable interventions have become a feature of many such Italian
meetings.
For years, observers have scratched their heads as to why a number of
important companies managed to escape entirely the attentions of these
persistent questioners. Could Rossi have revealed the answer?
Even the most long-suffering chairmen have been known to wilt when the
infamous Marco Bava raises his hand to request the floor. The new broom at
Ferruzzi, however, proved more than a match for him.
Traditionally silent at the meetings of Italy's second biggest private
company, Bava had this time engaged the audience for a full two hours.
But no sooner had he sat down than Rossi drew out a pile of records his
accountants had helpfully unearthed detailing 'consultancy' fees paid by
Ferruzzi to Bava in years
gone by.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The poor Trabant. Affectionately or otherwise known as the Trabby, it was
quickly traded in by east Germans as soon as they could exchange their old
marks with the new hard D-Mark.
Nobody wanted to be seen spluttering along Unter den Linden with the
two-stroke engine. A fast Porsche would do nicely instead.
Now it turns out that the Trabby is the most stolen car in Germany. It is
true that the locking and security devices in the plastic-carriage Trabby
are not what you would call fail-safe. But why should anyone try to steal a
Trabby and think they could get away with it by speeding up the autobahn?
Cynics have the answer. The Trabby is not an environmentally friendly car.
Hence the insurance is set specially high in order to encourage owners to
upgrade style and engine.
What better way of getting rid of it than by arranging for it to disappear?
If not recovered, the owner can claim some DM1,771. Not bad, when you can
pick one up second-hand for about DM400 in Berlin.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Observer: Wicks' next trick?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, though Jean-Claude Trichet's move from the French treasury to the
governorship of the Bank of France has yet to be confirmed, it has not
hindered whisperings concerning Trichet's replacement as chairman of the
EC's secretive but influential monetary committee.
This assembly of top officials from EC finance ministries and central banks
is habitually headed by a treasury hand, rather than a central banker, from
one of the larger EC economies. So the face of Sir Nigel Wicks, the second
permanent secretary at the UK Treasury responsible for international
affairs, who has been tipped by a number of European monetary officials as a
likely candidate, would certainly fit.
Normally a two-year stint, the chairmanship has rarely been in British
hands, though Sir Nigel's predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Littler, held the
position in 1987 and 1988. The Treasury is saying nothing, but Wicks is
well-qualified. Long famous in Whitehall for an over-full agenda, he has
been shedding some of his many duties in recent months and so presumably
could find time.
He might, of course, run into some opposition from Euro-enthusiasts. Wicks
was one of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher's favourite civil servants and, in his
rapid ascent to the top of UK monetary diplomacy, was a robust advocate of
British interests.
But he earned high marks from EC colleagues for his part in negotiating the
Maastricht treaty. 'He was much better than Norman Lamont,' said a senior
continental central banker yesterday.

More proof, if such were needed, that French monetary policy is still in
disarray after August's European currency upset.
Bank of France governor Jacques de Larosiere has abruptly withdrawn his
contribution to a book, The European Currency Crisis: One Year On, to be
published later this month. His action contrasts with that of other
distinguished contributors such as Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank
boss, who cheerfully amended their offerings to take account of last month's
upheavals.
That de Larosiere might be in a fix is understandable. His piece was to be
entitled 'The experience of defending the franc' and would presumably have
needed to be rewritten to reflect the recent discomfiture of the currency.
No doubt he has his hands full moving from his gilded Parisian office to the
president's desk at the equally opulent, if more modern, headquarters of the
EBRD.
But Paul Temperton, the book's editor at Probus Europe, is a bit miffed that
no French official has been prepared to step into the breach. Despite
repeated badgering, there has also been silence as to whether de Larosiere
or another official will join the book's authors and speak at the London
launch later this month. 'We've tried everything,' cries Temperton, who
would still be prepared to make space for a French contribution in any
second edition.

FT  02 SEP 93 / How economics is linked to ethics: The following is a digest
of Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British
Association
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The relation between economics and ethics is very much in the air. I had
already suggested it for the theme of the economic section at the annual
conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which
has been taking place this week in Keele, Staffordshire, when an
authoritative survey article appeared in the most accessible of all academic
journals, the Journal of Economic Literature, entitled Taking Ethics
Seriously: Economics and Contemporary Moral Philosophy*.
The UK journal, The Political Quarterly, is presenting a special issue this
September entitled Ethics and Markets; and there are many more such
offerings in the pipeline. There is, in addition, the profitable
sub-discipline, known as Business Ethics, linking the fringes of the
corporate and the academic world.
These developments have many origins. The self-proclaimed role of the
financier, George Soros, in toppling Britain from the exchange rate
mechanism in 1992 made people ask whether such speculation is an immoral
undermining of government policies or a praiseworthy acceleration of the
overdue destruction of unrealistic parities and currency systems. Headline
business scandals suggest the need to make more explicit the constraints
within which profit-making should be pursued; and events in the former
Soviet Union have underlined the difference between Mafia capitalism and the
more respectable variety.
Much of the debate in the last two centuries has consisted of attacks on the
morality of markets by self-proclaimed prophets, such as Carlyle or Ruskin,
and less than completely convincing replies. My own presidential address to
Section F (Economics) tried to ask a different question: how do the moral
beliefs of economic actors, such as businessmen, workers or consumers,
affect their behaviour and thus economic performance? A belief in a 'fair
wage' or a 'fair profit' can affect the response to government economic
programmes, just as much as more tangible forces, such as minimum pay laws
and social security systems. In the ex-Communist countries, questions such
as the range of permissible actions against competitors, or conventions
governing the treatment of property, have proved much more relevant than the
supposedly hard-edged mathematical relationships which preoccupy many
top-grade western economists.
Debate is beginning on these issues; but much of it has been bogged down in
a dispute on whether 'man' is a predominantly altruistic or self-interested
animal, a topic on which biology should have the last word. Less has been
written on the specific effects of particular beliefs; and I had to proceed
very much by example.
The debate has also been held back by the now-fading superstition, taught in
many textbooks, that economic practitioners can only talk about means, and
that attitudes towards, say, economic growth versus income equalisation are
like tastes for strawberry or vanilla ice cream about which no argument is
possible.
There are two general points to make:
The influence of so-called moral beliefs is not always for the good. Cynics
and hard-headed realists may do less harm than a Grand Inquisitor prepared
to torture and sacrifice human life for his own idea of the greatest good.
People do not have to be especially selfish to play the market game. Even
altruists can justifiably buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest
if this helps to reveal information about tastes, needs and know-how and to
co-ordinate dispersed human efforts. Indeed an altruist may put more effort
into profit-making than citizens with normal mixed motives, because he wants
the largest possible earnings to devote to philanthropic activities.
But, irrespective of motive, the market game has to be played within rules
and constraints which need explicit discussion and analysis. The following
are examples where great confusion exists.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Market's role still baffles: The following is a digest of
Monday's presidential address by Samuel Brittan at the British Association
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market is only part of a well-functioning economic system; and many
surrounding policies, practices and habits of mind are required to obtain
good value from the market system. Yet a functioning market core is still
indispensable.
Matthew Parris, in one of his excellent tongue-in-cheek columns in The
Times, has reminded us that most people do not accept the market system.
Parris writes of an aunt of his who believes that there is such a thing as a
fair price or wage that can be determined by contemplation rather than the
state of the market. 'To my aunt - who votes Conservative, takes the Daily
Telegraph and regards socialism as the work of the devil - a fair price is
what will secure a reasonable profit after paying employees a decent wage.'
It is not that most people are egalitarians. Many people can understand the
incentive role of pay and profits. They also accept - if anything, too
readily - the hierarchies and financial differentials of modern life. But
the elementary demonstration of the role of relative prices in allocating
resources and reducing queues has little meaning, even for the educated
public. As Parris says: 'Our morality does not mesh with our economic
system; but because we need both they cohabit in an awkward marriage based
on silence.'
The area where popular morality clashes most with market requirements is in
the labour market. Examples include minimum pay levels enforced by
legislation or collective agreements - or other kinds of costs imposed on
employers by measures of a 'European social charter' kind. Such policies are
supported by the popular belief that it is wrong to encourage anything that
smacks of undercutting by workers bidding for a job, or by employers trying
to obtain workers on the cheap.
How reasonable is this anti-undercutting mentality? The one near-certainty
to hold on to is that, if the loosening of minimum pay laws or their
equivalents increases total employment, then the income of the whole
community is higher.
There are unfortunately likely to be low-income losers. Even if newly
taken-on workers are no worse off, their entry is likely to shake out the
wages structure and worsen the pay of the less well-paid already in work.
Thus a reasonable condition for eliminating minimum wages is that those
priced into work should not receive less than they now receive on social
security. This can be done with the aid of a top-up like the present UK
family benefit, provided it can be extended to families without children and
to single people, and the conditions for drawing it made less restrictive.
The more difficult people to compensate are those now in work earning above,
but not too much above, the social security minimum. Some softening of the
blow would be desirable. A basic or minimum income with a high cut-off rate,
or implicit marginal tax rate, is the most likely bet. This could be
achieved by adjusting existing social security payments and need not involve
a vast new scheme. The more selective social security becomes, the more
generous governments can be with top-up payments.
There is a still more difficult hornets' nest, which I can only stir and not
really tackle. This is the high unemployment in OECD countries and
particularly in Europe that prevails over the average of business cycles and
even in boom periods. For it is now possible that quite a big fall in
average real pay would be required to price into work enough people to
satisfy even a modest definition of full employment.
It is possible that more than 100 per cent of the national income increase
would accrue to owners of capital and land. Some extra tax on capital or
income from capital could surely be justified to cushion the shock, although
not so much as to kill the labour-using investment required.
I make the suggestion, not as a cure-all but to indicate the impasse which
we have reached as a result of the collision between popular attitudes
towards just rewards, and the requirements of high employment.
What is needed is more critical scrutiny of widely accepted moral beliefs
and the moral implications of widely advocated economic policies. The idea
of technocratic value-free economics has had its day.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing parasitic about satellite TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ELSTEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was pleasantly surprising to find Christopher Dunkley - in a
newspaper which studiously ignores satellite TV listings - devoting his
entire column last week to the Sky multi-channel launch (August 25). I wish,
though, his tone had been less dismissive of a service which satellite
viewers consistently find more attractive than ITV or the BBC.
Is satellite television essentially 'parasitical' as Mr Dunkley asserts?
Before satellite, was there a dedicated children's channel, or a movie
channel, or a sports channel, or 24-hour news? Is the 11,000 hours of
original programming supplied by Sky each year of no consequence? And even
with re-run channels (UK Gold, Bravo, Discovery, etc), if there is strong
audience demand for such material, why deride it? Last weekend, these three
channels out-performed Channel 4 in satellite homes. Arts programming is
perhaps the prime example of the potential benefit of satellite re-run: huge
volumes of eminently repeatable programmes currently gather dust on the
shelves of terrestrial channels. Only the viewer suffers from the artificial
restrictions of terrestrial spectrum scarcity.
As for paying Sky for what viewers previously watched without charge, that
only applies to the minority of satellite homes that, until now, took none
of the premium channels; and, even for these homes, there are seven brand
new channels to add to their available choice. For the 70 per cent of
satellite homes which already take movies and sport, all the new channels
are a free bonus. By creating a basic pay tier for the first time, Sky
allows into the market-place an array of niche channels competitive with its
own services which could not survive solely on advertising income.
This deliberate stimulation of new satellite channels is not entirely
selfless: Sky's premium channels stand to benefit from the increasing
attractiveness of the satellite proposition, given that a high percentage of
new installers can be expected to subscribe to movies and sport. Already,
the surge in dish sales since the multi-channel package was announced is
evidence that consumers find the package inviting and the cost affordable.
It is clear that the audience values choice, and chooses value. If, as Mr
Dunkley concludes, it is 'the programmes we watch', perhaps he should now
reflect on why those with satellite seem willing to spend so much of their
time watching the 'parasite' channels rather than the terrestrials.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Channel rail link contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From The Earl of Caithness
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing to set the record straight over the article 'German bid
invited for Channel rail link contract' (August 11).
The Department of Transport has not invited Hochtief, or indeed anyone else,
to form a consortium or to bid for such a contract. We sent a copy of our
consultation paper to Hochtief and a great many other organisations, mainly
in the UK but also a few abroad, in view of the scale of the project; but
that is all.
Ministers are now considering the results of the consultation exercise.
Initial independent advice came from Samuel Montagu, and Hill Samuel will
provide further advice before any decisions are taken.
We shall announce in due course our consultations; only after that will
there be any question of inviting bids for the project.
Caithness,
minister for aviation and
shipping,

THE PURSUIT OF REASON: THE ECONOMIST 1843-1993 By Ruth Dudley Edwards
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 30. 1,020 pages
One hundred and fifty years ago today James Wilson produced the first
edition of The Economist. Wilson was a quintessential early Victorian: an
indomitable, self-made, self-educated Scot with an energy, didacticism and
dedication to business that verged on monomania (His dying words were: 'Take
care of my income tax.'). He was a passionate advocate of laissez-faire and
founded his paper with the express purpose of preaching the gospel of free
trade and, in particular, the need to abolish the Corn Laws.
Ruth Dudley Edwards, in an absorbing and exceptionally well-written official
anniversary history of the paper, suggests many of Wilson's characteristics
were taken on by The Economist and have made it 'respected, successful, but
often disliked'. She says of Wilson: 'He was clever, well-informed and he
radiated absolute belief in the correctness of his views.'
Other qualities he bequeathed to his paper included a strong belief in civil
liberties; the courage to stand by well-argued but unpopular opinions; but
also a propensity occasionally to follow deductive logic from abstract first
principles to the bitter end, regardless of the complex social realities on
which the deductions have to bear.
Edwards has juxtaposed throughout her book early and later treatments of
similar themes. There has been an admirably consistent opposition to capital
punishment. Indeed there has been a willingness to take up unpopular
positions - on the Irish famine, against the suffragettes, against the Boer
war and the first world war until 1916, and against the Suez intervention.
She notes that two weeks after founding the paper, Wilson, who opposed
slavery, argued against restricting imports from countries which employed
slave labour, on similar grounds to those deployed by the paper in the
mid-1980s when it opposed sanctions against South Africa. On the other hand,
Wilson argued passionately against the Factory Acts - with impeccable logic
and fundamental foolishness.
A subsequent and more famous editor, Wilson's son-in-law, Walter Bagehot,
argued it would be better - for the slaves and for everybody else - if the
south won the American civil war.
Echoes of this tendency can still be found in the modern Economist: in much
of the writing of Norman Macrae, including an article in 1966 against equal
pay. It resonates in the uncompromising stance taken under the editorship of
Rupert Pennant-Rea ('a Robespierre among economists') towards the
maintenance of sterling's ERM exchange rate right up to the debacle.
During the 19th century The Economist was a small circulation paper (about
3,000 a week) written by businessmen for businessmen. Bagehot, its most
famous editor, expanded its influence, teaching the Bank of England how to
be a central bank, advising both Liberal and Conservative chancellors and
explaining the constitution to the middle-classes.
The paper began to change in the 20th century under editors such as Francis
Hirst (1907-16) and Walter Layton (1922-38), who were more interested in
politics and ideas than business. From Geoffrey Crowther (1938-56), those
recruited to write for the paper were increasingly taken on for their brains
and writing ability, and tended to have no experience other than
journalistic.
Throughout, The Economist has enjoyed outstanding editorial independence.
From Wilson's death in 1860 to 1928, the paper was owned by his widow and
six daughters, who were usually supportive of its editors. Then in 1928,
Walter Layton turned the paper into a limited company and secured perhaps
the most water-tight guarantee of editorial independence in journalism. The
magazine is now 50 per cent owned by the FT. Apart from Geoffrey Crowther,
who as editor once or twice gave in to pressure from trustees and later, as
managing director, tried (unsuccessfully) to pressurise his editors,
everyone appears to have behaved well.
This is Layton's main claim to gratitude from writers and readers. He was an
otherwise unsatisfactory editor: an insider concerned not to rock the boat.
This meant much failure of nerve. He was renowned for adding late on
Thursday nights at the end of copy he found too strong: 'Time alone will
show'. Since Layton there has been none of that.
Geoffrey Crowther, who gets alpha for brains and gamma for character from
Edwards, expanded the employment of women, though for the somewhat
politically incorrect reason that 'I can get a first-class woman for the
price of a second-class man'. Since the war there have been lots of clever,
strong-minded women in senior positions but, despite big changes in
circulation (now more than 500,000, 80 per cent of it abroad), few women
readers. It is to the credit of The Economist and Edwards that she shows few
inhibitions when it comes to the successes, failures, and internecine
warfare of people still active on the magazine. The fight over policy
towards the Vietnam war, the struggles between editorial and non-editorial
departments and the debacle of the Latin American edition are well
chronicled.
The treatment of the paper's developing views on big issues for the postwar
period, however, is skimpy: only 12 pages on post-war inflation and the
paper's views; only scraps on industrial development and policies; and no
systematic treatment of the paper's views of Britain and the Common Market -
of how, like the rest of us, it has struggled to develop a satisfactory
political attitude to the EC, while inveighing against the detestable common
agricultural policy.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Obituary: FT editor with a European vision - Fredy Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Henry Fisher, known invariably as 'Fredy', who died on Sunday at the age
of 71, was editor of this newspaper for eight years from 1973 to 1980. He
spent a total of 23 years working on the staff - years which coincided with
the great growth period of the Financial Times.
Fredy was a member of that select band of UK citizens forced by the Nazis to
flee prewar Germany. He wanted to succeed in his adopted country and he
wanted to be accepted by it. He achieved both those objectives, to the
considerable benefit of this newspaper. He brought to journalism a
well-trained and finely tuned mind. But it is for his restless energy and
combative personality that Fredy is most remembered by colleagues who worked
with him at Bracken House, the FT's former offices by St Paul's cathedral.
He loved talking and arguing, sometimes (one suspected) for its own sake.
This combination of qualities served him well as a journalist. As foreign
editor and subsequently as editor, he guided the second important stage of
the Financial Times's development. His predecessor, Sir Gordon Newton, had
taken over what was essentially a stock market news sheet and turned it in
15 years into the UK's leading journal of business information. Under
Fisher, the FT was launched on its development as a European journal of
information and opinion. That was an advance bearing very much his own
personal stamp, for he was by background and deep conviction a European, and
by ability and training an intellectual.
He was born in 1922 in Berlin, where he lived for the first 13 years of his
life, of a German father and a Russian mother and, until he was 3 1/2 , his
first language was Russian. His father subsequently remarried a
French-Swiss, and Fredy grew up bilingual in French and German.
After Hitler's accession to power, his family embarked on the disrupted life
of all German Jews of the period. His father moved first to Switzerland,
then to Italy and, at the outbreak of war, back to Switzerland. Fredy, who
had been sent to school at Rencomb College in Gloucestershire, was cut off
by the outbreak of war and did not see his family again until 1945.
Though still in his teens, Fredy was interned at the outbreak of war under
the deplorable Regulation 18B as an enemy alien and subsequently sent to a
camp in Australia - an experience which, he liked to recall, at least gave
him time to learn to play a good game of bridge. In 1942 official policy
changed, and Fredy and others in his position were released. He returned,
volunteered for the army, and thus began his life as an acknowledged
Englishman.
His army career started with the Pioneer Corps, took him to Normandy as a
trooper in the 8th Kings Irish Hussars, and ended with him as
interpreter-Sergeant with the investigations branch of the Military Police.
He then returned to civilian life and started his first chosen career as an
academic. He won first-class honours in modern history in a short degree
course at Lincoln College, Oxford, and after a few months of postgraduate
work he was appointed by the Foreign Office as one of the team of three
editors of documents on German foreign policy from Versailles to 1945, a
task which was to last seven years.
In May 1956 he went to Melbourne University as a visiting lecturer in
diplomatic history. But he became disillusioned with the academic life and,
in March 1957, at the relatively mature age of 34, he joined Gordon Newton's
team of first-class brains at the Financial Times.
It was Newton's policy to staff his rapidly growing paper with writers of
high academic attainment, regardless of background, and give them their
heads. Fisher joined a team which was, to say the least, lively. It included
Nigel Lawson, Shirley Williams and Jock Bruce-Gardyne - who all became UK
government ministers in later years; William Rees-Mogg, Robert Heller,
Michael Shanks and Samuel Brittan.
The birth of what subsequently became known as Fredy's foreign empire was in
characteristic style. Newton simply remarked one day: 'You speak foreign
languages - you'd better join the foreign side' (which at that time filled
one half page, with a staff of two at Bracken House and three foreign
correspondents).
He worked with characteristic intensity as a reporter, securing an important
scoop when he gave the first news of Britain's initiative in launching the
European Free Trade area, and covering the subsequent negotiations and those
concerned with Britain's first attempt to join the European Community as far
as he could single-handed, commuting to Brussels.
He subsequently became foreign editor, launching the expansion of FT foreign
coverage; assistant editor on the home side - a period which saw a
significant expansion of industrial coverage and the launch of the
Management Page, and, in 1971, deputy editor.
When he became editor in 1973, he was driven both by inclination and
temperament to change the style in which the newspaper was run. The carefree
recruiting of untrained graduates had fallen foul of the industry's unions,
and more of the intellectual direction had to come from the top; he also
wished to develop the consistency and trust to make the paper an influential
journal of opinion.
The editorials became more incisive, and were more widely noticed - not
always favourably. For example, a sustained attack on official monetary
tactics in 1976 led, for the first time in the paper's history, to a
distinct chilliness between the FT at Bracken House and the Bank of England
at Threadneedle Street. However, the paper continued largely to avoid
party-political attitudes, as it still does.
There was an internal price to pay for this change of style. Some members of
the staff found the new approach difficult to accept.
Such problems caused Fredy episodes of distress in a term of office which he
otherwise hugely enjoyed; he was temperamentally ill-fitted to handle them.
His turbulent childhood had left him, in some senses, acutely lacking in
self-confidence, despite his sometimes authoritarian exterior. He would turn
to one or two intimates repeatedly for advice. With others, he sometimes
seemed a bad listener, though staff members in any real trouble would find a
warm, tireless sympathiser and supporter.
In 1980 he felt, after the launch of the Frankfurt edition, that he had
completed his planned contribution to the development of the Financial
Times, and decided at the age of 58 to launch on a third career as a
director of S G Warburg, the merchant bank - which proved in some ways the
happiest epoch of his working life.
He was able to deploy his talent for analysis and negotiation, and his
streak of real charm, in the cause of clients, a role which suited him so
well that he cheerfully worked far too hard. With typical sensitivity, he
refrained from any interference or even comment on the policies of his
successors at the FT, but he continued as a warm friend to many who would
have valued his advice.
One constant theme illuminated the last 30 years of this often stressful
life - his total devotion, once memorably confessed on the air, to his
Australian wife, Rosemary, and his family of two sons and a daughter. He had
a lifelong passion for music and the arts. From the point of view of his
friends, this left all too little time for the good bridge and chess, and
confessedly bad golf, which he so enjoyed.

   From Dr J D PLACKETT

<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to comment from a teacher's point of view on the current
debate over the fall in the number of students opting for science at A-level
('Discipline in need of a better chemistry', August 28).
During most of the 1980s, secondary teachers had the freedom to choose
whether to offer students separate sciences, ie biology, chemistry and
physics, or combined/balanced science courses, which contained aspects of
all three. Pressure groups within the teaching profession pushed for the
adoption of the balanced science courses in place of separate subjects. The
introduction of the national curriculum allowed the imposition of these
courses in many schools against the wishes of the science teachers who
previously taught separate sciences. This was one of the reasons why I left
teaching in secondary schools after 15 years.
If society is concerned about the number and quality of science students, it
might do worse than consider the teachers and what they teach. While many
are committed to balanced science courses, others - who studied a particular
science because they enjoyed it - would like to continue to teach the
individual subject. For some, having to teach, say, physics or biology when
they are chemistry enthusiasts is as disheartening as expecting a history
graduate to teach French or geography.
If science teachers were again allowed the freedom to choose the approach
they prefer, their enthusiasm for the subject would probably increase, and
this would hopefully encourage more students to choose scientific courses.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lift taxing burden from companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK A COGGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the letter from Mr Malcolm Bacchus, 'Companies
still weighed down by burden of tax regulations' (August 24). Mr Bacchus
pointed out that the Manchester Business School has estimated that an
average business spent 20 per cent of its pre-tax profits dealing with
company and tax regulations.
The question is, will the Treasury react in a positive way to the crusade
against red tape which the Department of Trade and Industry, under the
guidance of Mr Michael Heseltine, is conducting? From details of the recent
Finance Act mentioned by Mr Bacchus this seems a remote possibility.
The problem is that the Treasury does not pay for the consequences of its
actions; business does. The way to overcome this problem is to give
businesses tax rebates on the cost of collecting taxes, based on the results
of surveys such as those mentioned above.
It is unlikely that the response of the Treasury will be positive until it
has to pay for the consequences of its own excesses in the production of red
tape.

PASSION FISH (15) John Sayles
SLIVER (18) Phillip Noyce
THE VOYAGE (12) Fernando Solanas
ERASERHEAD (18) David Lynch
NOBODY LOVES the disabled more than a screenwriter. And it is not because
people who write movies are so charitable and big-hearted. Rather, the
simple truth is that crippled people are easy on the author. With someone of
sound mind or body, it takes a lot of time and effort to uncover their inner
demons and desires. However, slap some shades and a stick on a character,
plop him in a wheelchair or a mental institution, and you get instant
crisis. Four of the five last actors who won the Oscar played disabled men.
So it is worrying that the first scene of Passion Fish takes place in an
intensive care unit, where a soap opera star, May-Alice (Mary McDonnell),
has just learned she has been made paraplegic in a car accident. But within
a few moments it is clear this is not your basic wheelchair weepie. For the
most part, writer / director John Sayles refuses to indulge in the short
cuts inherent in the genre, providing us with a drama that allows us to feel
good without feeling bad about it.
The story is strong and simple - a bitter May-Alice returns to her ancestral
home in Louisiana, attended only by a series of nurses whom she alienates
with her self-pitying behaviour. She winds up with Chantelle (Alfre
Woodard), a strong-willed young black woman fleeing a troubled past in
Chicago. After the obligatory pyrotechnics, the two form a friendship that
provides the backbone of the film.
It is an old tale, and Sayles the writer does not have much that is new to
add to it. What he does provide is a lively and largely cliche -free script
that gives his two leads plenty of elbow room. Woodard is particularly fine,
displaying the smouldering dignity for which she is rapidly becoming famous.
McDonnell makes the trek from self-pitying 'bitch on wheels' to noble
heroine smoothly, helped by a strong sense of irony that allows her to make
the most of lines like 'I was the best voider in my rehab group'.
Sayles's direction has never been better. It is only at th e film's end,
when May-Alice nobly turns down an offer to exploit her disability by
appearing both legless and blind in her old soap, that Sayles succumbs to
the sort of murky righteousness to which films about the disabled are so
often liable.
If Passion Fish is a lesson in how cinema can respectfully make viewers feel
good, then Sliver has to serve as some sort of standard as to how to
disrespectfully make them feel bad. Trying to pass itself off as an erotic
thriller, it is instead nothing more than a boring and confused mile of
celluloid, a rock video in which there is no song.
The story concerns a book editor (Sharon Stone) who moves to a high rise
'sliver' in midtown Manhattan after the break-up of her marriage. She soon
learns that her apartment was previously inhabited by a woman who looked
like her and committed suicide for no apparent reason. Undaunted, Stone hops
in bed with a creepy neighbour (William Baldwin) as well as bantering with
creep number two (Tom Berenger). It is only when the woman next door is
murdered that Stone twigs that her own life is in peril.
The movie's main liability is its woeful script, written by Joe Eszterhas,
who penned Basic Instinct, which at least possessed a certain tawdry
momentum. No such luck here. Scenes are cobbled together without concern for
pace or structuring; the mystery is solved and then unsolved without regard
for logic or the viewer's intelligence; the dialogue seems to have been
translated from another language. The film's greatest mystery is that
Eszterhas is the highest paid screenwriter.
Given the poverty of the script it is hard to assess the actors, though
Berenger has never been more unpleasant and Baldwin's attempts to summon the
ghost of Tony Perkins are misjudged. Stone comes off worst. She is one of
the few actresses around who can shine at the bottom of a flesh pile, though
this has always depended on her steely toughness. Here, vulnerable,
confused, her nether lip aquiver, she is just another bimbo in a film which
tries to make bimbos of us all.
Most teenagers think they are stuck at the end of the world, but Martin
Nunque has good reason for thinking he is in Nowheresville: his home town is
Tierra del Fuego. His girlfriend is pregnant, his school has run out of
heating fuel and his stepfather is a bullying bore. So Martin decides to run
away, setting out on his bicycle in search of his long lost father, a
journey that takes him up the entire South American continent.
Argentinian writer / director Fernando Solanas has a reputation for
political controversy - he was recently wounded by a masked gunman the day
after criticising President Menem. With The Voyages, his polemics gets the
better of him. What starts out as a pleasantly wacky view of teenage angst
gradually turns into a rant against the victimisation of Latin America.
Solanas's imagery is bold but hardly subtle - Buenos Aires is covered in two
feet of sewage, Peru is menaced by vans collecting tax daily. The climax
comes when Martin arrives in Mexico, where Latin American leaders are
hosting the US President at a reception in which they must all move about on
their knees. By then, Martin's quest has long slipped from the viewer's
mind, numbed by Solanas's relentless, often clumsy pamphleteering.
David Lynch's Eraserhead, has been re-released after 16 years. The only
thing that has changed is the soundtrack, which has been cleaned up a bit,
though it remains one of the most abrasive in memory. There is no reason to
relate the plot; it still does not make any sense. What does make sense is
the unsettling mastery of film imagery Lynch mustered at such an early point
in his career.
Eraserhead makes fascinating viewing, showing how the director's resolutely
art house talent was able to blossom into the big time without (until,
perhaps, recently) losing its street cred. For those like me who saw it when
it first came out what is striking is its enduring familiarity. Henry's
eraser haircut, his baby that just might be human, the tiny man-made roasted
chickens, the visionary radiator, the tap dancer with her swollen glands -
the imagery is as fresh as last night's dream. It established Lynch as one
of those rare film-makers who is able to put our collective nightmares on
the screen.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: The mysterious Lenz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Jakob Lenz died in mysterious circumstances in Moscow in 1792, an
obituarist noted that he would be 'mourned by few and missed by none'. Most
of his old acquaintances had assumed he was long since dead.
It was a sad end for a man who had once been a youthful protege of Goethe.
He was born in 1751 and produced his best-known works, including a homage to
Shakespearean drama, in his early twenties.
'Best-known' is a relative term, not until this year's Edinburgh Festival
has a collection of his plays been published in English, though some readers
will know Lenz indirectly because The Soldiers led to Buchner's Woyzeck.
If - and the Festival still has to prove it - Lenz has a lasting claim to
fame as a dramatist, it is on the grounds that he was Brechtian before
Brecht and politically Marxist before Marx. He writes about the exploitation
of ordinary people and their readiness to be exploited. Social class and
male domination play a heavy role in The Soldiers which opened at the Royal
Lyceum Theatre on Tuesday.
This was the era of mercenaries and endless small wars. The officers picked
up women wherever they could and, as often as not the women would fall for
them. There is no reason to think that Lenz gives an inaccurate account of
his times. The striking fact is the extent of his social criticism. Lenz
appears to condemn the tradesman father of the girl who is seduced as much
as the officer who does the deed. Gerard Murphy who plays the tradesman
bears more than a passing resemblance to the Reverend Ian Paisley.
On the credit side, Lenz shows his debt to Shakespeare by ignoring the
dramatic unities. The Soldiers lasts for only 90 minutes, yet it has 34
scenes, a few of them only a line or two long. Nothing is wasted, indeed a
great deal is gained, by passing quickly and naturally from one scene to
another. Parts remind one of the rapid scene changes in The Tempest and
Macbeth.
More dubious is a passion for melodrama. Had he survived to 105 Lenz could
have had a career on the Victorian boards. We shall pass over the little
girl lost and poisoning scenes.
Like David Mamet's Oleanna, The Soldiers has alternative endings. The
original version has the commanding officer saying that so many troubles
could be avoided if the king would provide the army with concubines who
would follow the wars wherever they went. The rather grand Countess de la
Roche agrees: 'Oh, if only someone could be found to promote the idea at
court] It would benefit the whole nation.'
Subsequently Lenz changed the ending on the grounds that it was unlikely
that of the countess's rank would go along with such heresy. This production
is by the Glasgow Citizens Company directed by Philip Prowse. I made a bet
with myself which ending they would choose and was glad to be wrong. Prowse
goes for the later, gentler version and Jane Bertish as the Countess does it
well.
Prowse also designed the sets, which look splendid at the beginning and end,
but the play as a whole is made for a smaller stage and a smaller theatre.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Queen's Hall Recital - Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORNING recitals at the Queen's Hall are the bread and butter of
Edinburgh's concert programme. On those occasions when (as Richard Fairman
complained in these columns last weekend) the outlines of festival planning
have been blurred by less-than-festival-standard executants, bread and
butter can seem plain fare. But when a recitalist of the quality of the
American soprano Dawn Upshaw enchants an Edinburgh morning audience with her
smilingly candid platform demeanour and frank, forceful artistic
personality, bread and butter becomes ambrosia.
In the style of her first entrance Miss Upshaw states her whole approach: no
swank, no varnish, no prima-donna airs and graces. She essays a line in
'hello and welcome' chat - and, later, encore introduction - which could
become sticky were it not so warmly welcoming in intention.
But in any case, the conjunction of singer, song and voice changes the mood,
and brings the exhilaration: this is an artist ready to explore darker as
well as lighter modes of audience address, capable of deep seriousness no
less than winning brightness. Her voice, a clean, clear, well-schooled
instrument apparently without sharply individual characteristics, becomes
just such a vehicle for 'personal' expressiveness through the forward,
risk-taking manner of her delivery.
She seizes words and lives them, lives in them. Copland's 12 Emily Dickinson
songs served for a marvellous display of native idioms, tones of voice, all
caught with the shining sincerity that brings this plain-spoken music alive.
A group of Schumann, Wolf and Schubert Lieder achieved a similar bold
simplicity of shape and focus - Gretchen at her spinning wheel, with the
excellent pianist Margo Garrett in pinpoint support, rarely seems so
youthfully tragic. A long stretch of early Debussy songs afforded perhaps
more intermittent delights: Miss Upshaw's French is more a lesson learnt,
less a language freely spoken, than her German.
On the whole, though, this was two hours of cloudless happiness. The day
before, in a Schubert-Janacek chamber concert that ideally embodied this
year's central thematic pairing, the Gaudier Ensemble had offered something
similar. Janacek's late wind sextet Youth and Concertino, nuggety,
hard-edged, joyful, were set in a new and thought-provoking perspective by
the Schubert Octet. The Gaudier, a crack collection of virtuosos from
various orchestras (including the Chamber Orchestra of Europe), avoids
laying on the charm - which is mostly a great virtue but sometimes, in
Schubert particularly, a slight fault.
In the Usher Hall the two Edinburgh concerts of the South West German Radio
Symphony Orchestra under Michael Gielen, its venerable chief conductor, have
proved more of a mixed bag. The orchestra, a sound, solid, no-nonsense
ensemble of exactly the type suggested by their name, was not well suited to
the first programme - music by Rakhmaninov, Schnittke and Suk requiring much
stronger infusions of colour and drama.
But the second, Schoenberg's Piano Concerto (with Alfred Brendel in
sovereign command) and the Mahler Seventh Symphony, found Gielen, a
tough-minded, intellectually searching musician, on much surer ground.
Mahler and Schoenberg: a future Edinburgh thematic coupling, anyone?

FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra - Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Germany was divided, some of the country's most venerable musical
institutions were left on the other side of the iron curtain. As they take
their place again on the world stage, it is becoming increasingly clear how
conscientiously traditions in musical life there were upheld.
The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is celebrating its 250th anniversary this
year. That means it is older than most of the music which it plays  - a
remarkable thought. The orchestra's conductors have included Mendelssohn,
Wagner, Mahler and Richard Strauss. It never disappeared from sight during
its four decades in the Eastern bloc, but reunification has enabled the
orchestra to promote itself internationally and win the profile which its
reputation would seem to demand.
There have been several visits to Britain recently, not all great successes.
Two years ago the orchestra gave a Brahms symphony cycle at the Barbican
under Kurt Masur, its Music Director since 1970, and all its wealth of
tradition was not enough to make up for drab performances dominated by the
strings (the wind and brass players might as well have been left behind at
the airport).
This pair of Proms, in the Royal Albert Hall's more open acoustic, presented
a different picture. The solo wind playing was one of the main pleasures at
Monday's concert. Masur takes a sober view of Schubert's Unfinished
Symphony, slicing up the endless thread of Schubertian melody into regular,
four-square phrases; but when the solo oboe or clarinet played over hushed
strings, the audience held its breath.
The same effect opened Bruckner's Fourth Symphony - solo horn this time,
sensitive, unwobbly, a magical opening to a symphony that makes romantic
horn calls through a woodland of rustling strings its main motif. Masur had
the brass blocked together in the middle at the back. From there they
produced a well-contained sound, rather than an all-embracing peroration at
the end. But that was the only drawback in a warm-hearted and approachable
performance, Bruckner with a touch of the early romantic.
That is the period of music at which the Leipzig players excel. In Tuesday's
programme a selection of music from Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream
smiled genially, the strings with a lightness of touch, the wind with a
puckish grin, though brass and timpani were again not much in evidence.
Masur has the warmth and affection for the music; the players supplied the
sparkle of the ensemble.
Earlier, in Brahms's Second Piano Concerto, there had been little sign of a
spark at all. The soloist and conductor seemed to bring out the worst in
each other. John Lill takes few risks, not so much technically (he has all
the notes) as in expression, making this autumnal music fall like dead
leaves to the ground; Masur responded by suppressing the orchestral part's
impulse and fire. Not a golden autumn this, but damp, dank, grey. The
Leipzig tradition may go back two-and-a-half centuries, but it seems to have
lost Brahms somewhere along the way.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Stars of American Ballet - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STELLAR is, we believe, as stellar does. The 'stars' of American Ballet in
Britain on a brief visit, and at Northampton's admirable Derngate Theatre
this week, are principals and soloists with American Ballet Theatre and New
York City Ballet, though not quite those originally scheduled. (Admirers of
Darci Kistler should note that this wonderful dancer is not with the group).
There was something resolutely unstellar about the fare at Tuesday's
opening, and even more so about the presentation. A round of applause for
the only design element - a silhouette of the New York skyline - is a sure
sign that we are in starvation corner, where the rule is black drapes and
dreary outfits.
The evening was not a happy one. It is, indeed, one of those occasions when
you wonder 'Can it get worse?', and the reply from the stage is a determined
'Yes'. The opening Apollo - Robert LaFosse, with Susan Jaffe, Melissa
Podcassy, Sandra Brown - was respectable enough, I suppose, but LaFosse is
altogether too winning in manner for my taste (the young god as head waiter)
and the Muses breezed through their solos without looking very closely at
them. This Apollo, and the succeeding Some Assembly Required, a serious, if
neurotic, duet by Clark Tippet which ABT showed us a couple of years ago,
were the only valid matters of the evening. What followed defied belief,
defied the idea of ballet as a serious art, and, I suppose, defied us to
start throwing ripe fruit.
In Come Unto Me Bruce Padgett, got up like Michael Jackson as Captain Hook,
bayed some rock music (of his own confection) while three chaps and a girl
trudged through his dances amid dry ice and relentless noise. The men were,
I think, trying to develop their pectorals. The girl, with the erotic frenzy
characteristic of Olive Oyl, offered herself to the lads. Nonsense reigned.
Johann Renvall's version of the Romeo and Juliet balcony pas de deux was
cliche-time in Old Verona: everything you have ever seen about two lovers in
this situation, and hoped never to sit through again. LaFosse's Spring Break
was soaked in dew, as three girls and four men were ecstatic, too youthful,
and gorge-risingly cute. The score, by Martin Stock, could have been
composed by Mendelssohn's aunt. So could the choreography. The costumes made
the dancers look bulgy. The dances made them look foolish. The last moments
of this degringolade were concerned with LaFosse's A Salute to Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers in which five couples dashed inelegantly about while gems
from Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin et al, were nailed to the floor in
four-square and mushy piano arrangements. The title, is, of course, wrong.
It is a salute to Fred Rogers and Ginger Astaire - looking at it, you knew
why you'd never heard of them before. And never wanted to again.
Stars of American Ballet are at The Derngate Theatre, Northampton, until 4
September.

TELEVISION has often portrayed modern farming methods as hostile to
wildlife. We see ancient hedges ripped out, copses destroyed, and ponds
drained to create vast plains of corn or rape with no shelter for animal
life. Survival paints a different picture. According to this programme (7.30
ITV) 'Modern crops have offered new opportunities and many creatures have
altered their ways to take advantage of the seeds of change'.
BBC2 screens the first of six half-hour documentaries called Plain Tales
From Northern Ireland, a parody title which unfortunately lacks the point of
Kipling's original pun. Today's programme is about the Nelsons, a farming
family whose children were held hostage by the IRA (8.00).
In Witness Ludovic Kennedy presents the case for 'the good death': voluntary
euthanasia. He talks to those in favour, including Dirk Bogarde, and those
against, including Cicely Saunders, founder of the hospice movement (9.00
C4). Pandora's Box ends its repeat run with the story of the rise and fall
of nuclear power (9.30 BBC2). Not the merriest night, though BBC2 does also
repeat A Bit Of Fry And Laurie (9.00).

FT  02 SEP 93 / Technology: Coke and chips - of the silicon kind - Malcolm
Wheatley looks at the brand valuation of Intel, the semiconductor group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's league table of brand valuations, published last month by the US
magazine Financial World, contained a relatively unremarked upon surprise.
Ahead of all but two of the world's leading brands was semiconductor giant
Intel - straight in at number three, with a brand valuation of Dollars
17.8bn (Pounds 12bn). This places it behind the magazine's estimated value
of the world's biggest brand, Marlboro, worth Dollars 39bn and second-place
Coca-Cola, worth Dollars 33.4bn - but in front of long-standing leaders such
as Nestle, Kelloggs and Kodak.
The company is only the second electronics company to make the list of 111
brands, the other being chip competitor Motorola, placed 14th with a value
of Dollars 4.1bn. The result reflects several years of hard work by the
company to promote its brand. Although given a big boost by being selected
as the chip to power the first IBM PCs - and therefore most of those that
followed - users generally remained ignorant of the company and its
products. That changed when competitors, such as Cyrix and AMD, arrived on
the scene. A blitz of law suits demonstrated Intel's determination to keep
its lucrative patch to itself. Intel also launched a multi-media advertising
campaign, 'Intel Inside', to persuade PC buyers and specifiers to stipulate
PCs powered by Intel chips.
But other companies advertise just as much - if not more. What has Intel got
that brands such as Nestle, Kelloggs and Kodak have not? The answer emerges
from a look at how the figures are calculated. Financial World says it
follows an approach similar to that employed by London-based Interbrand, a
branding consultancy. First, gross operating profits are determined. Then an
amount equivalent to what an unbranded, generic producer of the same product
would have achieved is deducted, based on a net return on capital employed
of 5 per cent. After a provision for taxes, the balance is assumed to be
brand-related profits, to which are applied a 'brand strength' multiple.
This reflects seven factors, including the brand's leadership, its
communication effectiveness and the degree of legal protection it has.
Quite apart from growing scepticism about brand values generally, last
year's valuation would have caught several of these on a high. After years
of wrangling in the California courts, Intel's patent infringement suits
still rumble on - but are fast becoming an argument over yesterday's
technology. Competitors will in future design from the ground up, to avoid
the very legal protection that has boosted this year's brand valuation. The
communication effectiveness factor was also strong this year, thanks to the
'Intel Inside' campaign's bolstering of the brand. The strength of the
leadership factor may not remain at its present level either: Motorola is
working closely with IBM and Apple to launch the PowerPC chip range, hoping
to bring about wholesale defections from the Intel camp. This threat was
reinforced last week when rumours circulated that IBM was to clone, under
'patent beating' clean room conditions, its own version of the 'microcode'
software that drives chips. This would mean that the PowerPC range would
emulate Intel chips so closely that users would not know nor care what type
of chip was in their computers.
Publicly, Intel remains sanguine. 'Consistency over time is a brand strength
too,' argues worldwide marketing vice-president Dennis L Carter.
Carter denies the company is seeking to lobby Washington to allow brand
valuations to be reflected on balance sheets, as they can in the UK. In
launching its low-power range of microprocessors last month, the company had
trumpeted its influence with the Clinton administration in getting Energy
Star-compliant computers mandated in government procurement policy.
Indeed, what is surprising is Intel's apparent indifference to the
opportunities to exploit brand value. Carter claims the new Pentium chip is
identified closely enough with the Intel name and says it is 'too soon' to
decide whether the name of the sixth-generation chip should attempt to
capitalise on the the company's brand strength. Likewise, he adds, there are
no plans to extend radically the relatively small range of consumer-oriented
retail products, such as add-on cards, modems and plug-in 'Overdrive' chips,
in order to win more business from consumers who are more likely than PC
manufacturers to be influenced by brand-strength factors.

FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Sir Len Peach moves into Coutts Consulting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coutts Consulting, the career consultancy, outplacement and residential
training group, (formerly DC Gardner), has appointed Sir Len Peach as a
non-executive director.
Sir Len has an extensive background in the field known as human resource
management. In his 30 years with IBM between 1972-92 he held a host of posts
in the personnel and corporate affairs fields, including running the
company's European, African and Middle East personnel affairs from Paris in
the mid-1970s.
Latterly he has shifted more towards the public sector. In 1992 he became
chairman of the embattled Police Complaints Authority. He had been chief
executive of the National Health Service's management board between 1986-89.
His experience helping staff go through rough times will be useful at Coutts
itself. Not only is the group in open dispute with Barry Topple, its former
chief executive, over the amount of compensation he received for having his
contract terminated in 1992; Coutts also made pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.24m
for the first half of its current financial year.

FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Turner replaces Maxwell at BPB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BPB Industries has said goodbye to John Maxwell, its chief executive. He
first joined the company on April 1 1992 as finance director and chief
executive designate.
Maxwell finally moved up to the chief executive post on November 25. His
precipitate resignation has come after the company's chairman, Alan Turner,
began to feel that 'his appointment was not proving suitable . . .although
he was very popular'.
Turner is once again taking up the newly vacated chief executive spot,
having originally been appointed chief executive in 1978 and having held the
same post from 1985 up to Maxwell's elevation.
BPB Industries, predominantly known as a manufacturer of plasterboard, is
facing tougher times in Europe, particularly in the important French,
Italian and Spanish markets.
'Historically a monopoly company, it's now having to embrace a new
competitive atmosphere on the continent of Europe,' says one analyst, who
sees the departure of Maxwell as a reflection of disagreements over how best
to tackle the price war now raging on the continent for BPB's types of
product.
'There was no personality clash and nothing has happened which is going to
affect the next set of results. As finance director, Maxwell did a wonderful
job,' said a spokesman for BPB.
Does Turner plan on staying on as chief executive for long, or is the
company looking for a swift replacement? 'It's three years since we went
outside for a chief executive and in that time the group's been through one
hell of a rationalisation programme in the middle of a recession, in the
face of intense competition and a price war. We have come through that and
the management we have is pretty battle-hardened . . .I hope that we will
find someone internally,' he says.

FT  02 SEP 93 / People: Frost retires from NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The passing of a management generation at National Westminster Bank was
formally completed yesterday with the announcement of the retirement of Tom
Frost, the bank's deputy chairman and its former chief executive.
Frost retired on reaching the age of 60, the bank's official retirement age.
He became deputy chairman last year in order to devote time to clearing his
name of misleading a government inquiry into the Blue Arrow affair.
NatWest has no plans to appoint another deputy to Lord Alexander, its
full-time chairman, who oversaw the appointment of 45-year-old Derek Wanless
to succeed Frost as chief executive last year. That appointment installed a
new generation at the bank.
Frost became a director of NatWest in 1984 after becoming the first chief
executive of its US retail bank operation. He was appointed group chief
executive in 1987 before the bank becoming entangled in the Blue Arrow
affair.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Management: Forced to plough new furrows - As competition
increases UK farmers must sharpen up their sales skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a story that would make Popeye green with envy.
An old, established farming family sets out to transform the popular image
of spinach as a bitter-tasting vegetable covered in soil, which turns to
gritty slime when cooked and is only forced down because it does you good.
The family cuts the young leaves above ground level to avoid the dirt and
packs them in oxygen-filled, perforated bags to increase their supermarket
shelf life from a few hours to three days.
Britons subsequently develop a taste for American-style spinach salads and
the family company raises its share of the UK fresh spinach market from 20
per cent to 75 per cent in four years.
John and William Emmett's vision won them an award from Adas, the British
government's agricultural development service. It says they provide a
shining example of what can be achieved through successful marketing, a
technique under-used by farmers in the UK.
This deficiency in marketing skills is part of the reason for Britain's
Pounds 5.9bn trade deficit in food and drink, nearly half of last year's
total deficit. In comparison, most of Britain's north European competitors,
with similar climates and types of agriculture, have food trading surpluses.
This difference in performance has prompted a serious bout of
soul-searching, including the personal intervention of Prime Minister John
Major. He has set up an Initiative on Food Marketing, chaired by David
Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, and brings together senior
representatives of the food industry.
Industry leaders in Britain believe that more than half of the country's
food trade gap could be filled with home-grown produce.
To find out why retailers and processors import food rather than purchase
home-grown produce, Adas conducted an anonymous survey of 100 leading food
buyers, published this summer. Their answer was that British farmers
excelled in producing clean, fresh, flavoursome food, but fell down badly on
effective marketing and responsiveness to customers' needs.
'If I ask British producers for something different, or a slight alteration
to their product, it's like coming up against a brick wall,' said one
respondent.
Another complained: 'If I want to source cauliflowers in the UK, I have to
rush about for hours trying to find a suitable supplier. By making one phone
call to the Netherlands, I can get a fax back within the hour, specifying
availability, prices, delivery and everything else I need to know.'
The survey produced indignant protests from UK farmers. Adas, however, is
unrepentant in pressing home its message that more market-orientation is
needed now than ever before. With the European single market, the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy and the chances of a successful outcome to
the Gatt talks, it believes the writing is on the wall for farmers who
refuse to adapt.
'They can't be blamed for ignoring marketing in the past, because high
support prices under the CAP have encouraged the sale of commodities into
intervention stores,' says Chris Bourchier, head of agricultural development
at Adas.
'But times are changing. With increasing competition and the prospect of
reduced subsidies, our producers will have to provide not only a competitive
product but a competitive service too, every bit as good as producers
abroad.'
North European marketing success has been built on the work of
co-operatives. These have brought together large numbers of small farmers,
ensuring supplies throughout the year to the standards demanded by the
increasingly concentrated and powerful food manufacturers and retailers.
They have successfully produced a closer relationship between the growers,
processors and retailers.
Co-operatives sell 55 per cent of agricultural output in the Netherlands and
50 per cent in France, compared with only 10 per cent in the UK, according
to Food from Britain, the promotional agency set up in 1983.
Earlier this year, a government-funded study of food marketing in Britain
and the Netherlands - which has a Pounds 10bn trade surplus in food and
agricultural products - found that Dutch farmers take a longer-term view of
their markets and show greater innovation.
The report, by Wye agricultural college, urged British farmers to show
greater understanding of the changing needs of their final customers - and
the big food buyers.
'These are not trite phrases, they are fundamental to attaining marketing
success and too few UK agricultural businesses have come to terms with
them,' it said.
There are some highly successful co-operatives in the UK, especially in
sectors that have not been swaddled by EC farm supports. Kentish Garden, for
example, has captured 40 per cent of supermarket soft-fruit sales by
extending the growing season and improving presentation. From 15 members and
turnover of Pounds 160,000 in 1970, it now comprises 58 growers and expects
sales this year of Pounds 14m.
Some co-operatives have collapsed and others have been ineffective, partly
because of farmer interference in their management and marketing efforts.
This has discouraged an industry known to prefer tried and tested ways. It
also seems that in general British farmers, being bigger and more
independent than their continental counterparts, have felt less need for
collaboration.
Operating in isolation from each other has meant being isolated from some
parts of the food supply chain. And the success of the big supermarkets has
resulted in resentment from some sections of the farming community. Out of
the Pounds 70bn spent by consumers on food in the UK last year, farmers
received just Pounds 14bn.
Moves to improve communications within the food chain are under way. The
Strathclyde project, set up by Safeway in 1991 and managed by Strathclyde
University, aims to do just this by bringing together producers,
manufacturers, retailers and caterers.
Teresa Wickham, Safeway's director of corporate affairs, is optimistic. 'The
British producer is waking up to the fact that you have got to have export
quality produce on the home market,' she says. But she accepts that 'people
can't switch their whole attitude overnight'.
Safeway now buys 82 per cent of its produce in Britain and hopes to raise
this to 85 per cent by 1995.
At the producer end, the National Union of Farmers has been trying to open
up export opportunities and improve the image of British food abroad with
its Food from the Countryside campaign.
Marketing efforts have done little in the past to reduce the food trade gap,
but many in the industry believe these new projects will be more successful.
The reason for this optimism is that economic circumstances have changed and
farmers must therefore change too.
Market forces are, for example, being imposed on farmers almost overnight in
the dairy sector, with the ending of the Milk Marketing Board's monopoly
next year.
Government intervention of this kind has an important role, according to the
Wye college report, but change has to come from within. 'It is farmers,
collectively and individually, that must instigate improved marketing
performance, driven by desire for economic survival and financial gain.'
That cultural change, if it happens, will be led by producers such as the
Emmetts. Recognising a market for their spinach all year round, they have
forged links with Spanish and Italian producers to supply them with produce
of the same quality in the winter months when home-grown spinach is not
available.
The company is now investing Pounds 300,000 in new machinery to double
production to 8m packs a year. Chris Kersley, sales and marketing director,
says they have the Dutch and Scandinavian markets in their sights and plan
to 'export with a vengeance'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Technology: Ship-shape cruising - Designing liners has
become more complex as demand for bigger vessels increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took six men three days to reassemble the 500-year-old fountain which
forms the centre-piece of the dining room on the Maasdam, one of the biggest
cruise liners under construction.
Its sister ship, the Statendam, already sailing the Caribbean for Holland
America Line, boasts a three-storey atrium. The Costa Classica has 350
tonnes of marble among its luxury fittings, on a liner which has 53,700
gross registered tonnes.
Building cruise ships has become big business as interest in cruises has
surged. Whereas the job was once largely a matter of converting former ocean
liners, purpose-built vessels are now one of the fastest-growing sectors of
the world shipbuilding industry.
The building of cruise ships has become more complex as operators have
demanded what are, in effect, vast floating hotels. As the size and content
have increased so has the cost. A 77,000 grt ship, such as P&amp;O's Sun
Princess, currently the biggest cruise vessel under construction, costs
around Dollars 300m (Pounds 202m). Within the next four years, it will be
dwarfed by a new 95,000 grt 'mega ship', carrying 4,400 passengers and crew,
being designed by Italy's state-owned Fincantieri yard.
The operators have sought larger vessels to achieve economies of scale and
maximise profits. However, the shift poses challenges for the handful of
naval architects and yards capable of building them.
'A normal merchant ship has about 100kg of outfitting for every tonne of
steel,' says Fincantieri's Gianfranco Bertaglia, one of the pioneer naval
architects of the new vessels. 'Today, we have to reckon with about one
tonne of outfitting - glass, marble, leather and electronics  - for every
tonne of steel.'
To keep the high cost of new vessel construction down has meant borrowing
heavily from military technology. Rather than the traditional 15mm-thick
steel plate used for merchant shipping, they have the 5mm plate found in
battleships.
Thin plate processing lowers hull weights, allowing owners to fit less
powerful, cheaper, engines and save fuel. However, it is considerably more
difficult than conventional shipbuilding. Making a hull in thin steel,
however, takes almost twice as long as building a traditional merchant
vessel. 'It's something between traditional shipbuilding and aircraft
industry precision,' says Bertaglia.
Electric engines, fed by big diesel generators, have become standard to
reduce noise and vibration; stabilisation systems are increasingly
sophisticated. Big ships operating from the US west coast to Alaska boast
silent propulsion systems, seldom used on vessels other than battle
submarines, to avoid scaring away the whales which many passengers want to
see.
Increased complexity means that only four yards specialise in the big cruise
ships of today - Kvaerner-Masa of Finland, Chantiers de l'Atlantique, owned
by France's Alsthom engineering group, Meyer Werft of Germany and Italy's
Fincantieri.
The number of clients has also shrunk. Carnival Cruises of the US (owner of
Holland America), the biggest, has ordered the 'mega ship'; Royal Caribbean
Cruise Lines, also US-based, operates the Sovereign of the Seas, the biggest
of the new generation cruise ships afloat; Scandinavia's Kloster group owns
the even bigger Norway. Britain's P&amp;O group and Italy's Costa Crociere
complete the handful.
It is the overall design, rather than individual details, of the new boats
which marks the biggest break with the past. Much of a naval architect's
time is now spent on space utilisation and layout.
'We have to provide the maximum comfort and amusement in a very limited
space,' says Maurizio Cergol, the Fincantieri architect designing the new
'mega ship'. 'We must offer what only the biggest hotels can give, with the
difference that ours have to be packaged into something shaped like a ship
and which can float.'
That means creating an environment capable of negotiating extreme weather,
lists of up to 6 per cent and the noise and vibrations of engines of up to
50,000hp, which is also appealing to passengers.
The yards are facing an ever-moving target. Cut-throat competition among
cruise operators means each new ship has to be 'more special' than anything
before. The exotic names, such as Sensation and Fantasy chosen by Carnival
for a new range of ships, indicate the sort of atmosphere operators are
trying to market to attract custom.
Each vessel also faces increasingly stringent safety standards. 'Just to
meet changing fire and smoke prevention rules on a ship of up to 12 decks is
a task in itself,' says Cergol. Waste disposal is another challenge. A ship
carrying 4,000 passengers and crew produces large amounts of waste, which
can no longer be dumped at sea.
And after the terrorist attack on the Achille Lauro cruise ship in the
Mediterranean, even anti-terrorist precautions have to be included to
protect the bridge and engine room from potential hijackers.
The new requirements have led to radical design changes. Moving lifeboats
from their traditional position on the top deck, where they were suspended
outwards, to an indented location lower down has made the new ships more
stable and reduced the distance between the lifeboats and the water line.
The pressure to maximise space means the profile of modern cruise ships is
also instantly distinguishable from those of even 15 years ago. The
superstructure now starts very soon after the bow and stretches up to the
stern. The emphasis on maximising internal space reflects the fact that most
amenities, such as shopping centres and casinos, are indoors.
The changes are also geared to the new clientele taking a cruise,
increasingly elderly. One liner plying the Caribbean expects to have about
40, elderly, wheelchair-bound people per cruise.
But the biggest design changes are hidden, say the architects. 'The
challenge is to make sure everything interconnects properly. It's all a
matter of flows,' explains Cergol.
Take the galley, which to meet stringent US hygiene standards now resembles
a cross between a normal kitchen and an operating theatre, with
easy-to-clean tiled surfaces and stainless steel appliances everywhere. 'The
galley has to be carefully positioned. It must be next to the main
restaurant. But it also needs easy access to refrigerated food stores, and
should be readily accessible when embarking fresh food in port,' he
explains.
Passengers paying thousands of dollars for a cruise do not want to have such
mundane functions intruding on their enjoyment. The same applies to the
essential, but often forgotten services such as the laundry or crew lifts.
'It's like a chess game. Say the cruise line wants to feature the restaurant
at the stern; that affects a string of other factors such as lifts and
stores,' says Cergol. 'Each ship is potentially very different.'
Computer-aided design helps, but the architects have little opportunity to
rectify mistakes. Most boats are built one-off; even with a rare contract
for three sister ships, production deadlines are so tight that it is usually
too late to alter the second on the basis of experience gained with the
first.
'We have learned there are now some basic relationships that must be
observed,' says Bertaglia. 'Putting a large pillar-free space, such as a
restaurant, in a central location on a lower deck obviously affects
calculations for distributing the weight of the thousands of tonnes of
superstructure above.'
While design and technology have changed so rapidly, Fincantieri's
architects think innovation may now be reaching its limits. Although the
'mega ship' will have about 1,300 cabins, they think a figure of around 800
cabins is likely to remain the norm. Few operators are big enough to want or
afford larger ships. 'It's not so much the physical limits as the business
risk,' explains Corrado Antonini, Fincantieri's managing director. 'Cruise
lines don't want to put too many of their eggs in one basket.' Demand for
cruising seems to be satisfied at about the current sizes. And just berthing
bigger vessels could cause difficulties at many ports of call.
Bertaglia forecasts cruise ships will likely turn into floating
entertainment complexes while cruising will decline. 'The future is to
develop an artificial life inside one huge bubble. That implies deck space
will be reduced even further.' For a keen sailor in the Adriatic off
Fincantieri's base in Trieste, it is an unappealing prospect. 'A ship must
be a ship, not an enormous, artificial, atoll, just floating around and
hardly moving,' he says.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Technology: Development in common - Andrew Fisher on
countries planning technological expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do composite materials in Malaysia, solar energy in Botswana,
telecommunications in Malta and packaging technology in Cyprus have in
common? The answer is twofold: these countries are all keen to develop
industries based on advanced technologies and they are all in the
Commonwealth.
Helping these and other countries try to move their economies deeper into
the modern industrial age is the Commonwealth Consultative Group on
Technology Management. In February, it launched its Private Sector
Partnership aimed at linking industry with the often complicated process of
technology transfer.
Much of the impetus for the partnership approach has come from Malaysia
which has embarked on an ambitious Vision 2020 programme to transform it
into a fully developed country. 'We cannot be in the front line of modern
technology,' said Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister announcing
the country's programme two years ago. 'But we must always try to catch up
at least in those fields where we may have certain advantages.'
One area Malaysia is trying to build up is products using composite
materials, as in the Eagle XTS light aircraft being developed with
Australia. With CCGTM's help, Malaysia is keen to use its knowledge of
composites to make aircraft components and other products such as sporting
equipment. It intends to set up a zone in the Malacca region for joint
ventures in composites.
'Other countries are looking to see what Malaysia is doing,' says Michaela
Smith, manager of CCGTM. Three Malaysian companies, YTL (construction and
power), Sapura (communications equipment) and Globe Silk Store, have joined
the Private Sector Partnership. UK members include Cable &amp; Wireless,
GEC-Marconi, Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, Short Brothers and Shell
International.
However, membership is not restricted to the Commonwealth. Non-Commonwealth
nations can become involved in individual projects or advisory programmes
set up through the partnership; CCGTM has contacted France, Denmark and
Germany about possible involvement. The partnership functions by drawing
together the skills, contacts and resources of its members and using these
to help countries upgrade their technological base.
In Botswana, solar energy, telecommunications and coating of diamonds for
industrial use are areas in which partnership members are involved. Cyprus,
helped by CCGTM in the area of quality management, is keen to develop in the
textile and packaging sectors, possibly with help from Malaysian industry.
As part of its drive to become a telecommunications hub in the Mediterranean
region, Malta has called on the help of the CCGTM partnership to involve
international interests. Those showing interest include Mercury (the UK
operation of Cable &amp; Wireless), Hong Kong and Malaysian telecommunications
interests, and Hong Kong shipping and banking concerns.
The Private Sector Partnership has responded to around 100 separate requests
for advice. The concept has also sparked interest outside the 50-member
Commonwealth. Next week, Smith and colleagues will be in Washington to talk
to the Organisation of American States (OAS) about the partnership
programme's relevance for South America. She hopes CCGTM and the OAS could
eventually work together on technology transfer projects. Jonathan Solomon,
executive director for strategy and corporate business development at Cable
&amp; Wireless, believes the CCGTM's partnership - soon to be set up as a
UK-based company - could become a model for other organisations.
The benefits from the CCGTM's efforts will take time to show through,
however. 'We want to help countries galvanise their own people,' says Omar
Abdul Rahman, scientific adviser to the Malaysian prime minister. 'We want
more Commonwealth companies to be involved.'

FT  02 SEP 93 / Accountancy: How companies have painted themselves into a
corner - FN Arfin looks at the state of annual reports and asks if there is
a better way of getting value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FN ARFIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN now and the late spring of 1994, millions of pounds will be spent on
books nobody wants to write and hardly anyone really relishes reading. The
annual report season is upon us.
As August 31 year-enders put the finishing touches to their documents,
December 31 year-enders begin to assign responsibilities and select
suppliers for their annual reports. All over the corporate world, managers
brace themselves for an unpopular and expensive chore.
Why? The easy answer is that they have to. But no law, regulation or
established industry standard requires the elaborate documents that will
disappear into institutional libraries and line office rubbish bins for the
next several months.
The truth is, having enthusiastically adopted the colourful, American-style
annual report in the 1980s, most companies have painted themselves into a
corner. While recognising that, as they are now constituted, annual reports
have limited use, managers believe they have little choice.
When a company has produced glamorous annual reports for years, a U-turn to
sobriety is unsettling for shareholders. Particularly as we appear to be
emerging from prolonged recession, no company director wants to raise
unwarranted questions and concerns.
Very large sums are at stake in the production of annual reports. Companies
with large share registers enjoy economies of scale, making an average cost
difficult to determine - but between Pounds 4 and Pounds 5 each, including
postage, is not uncommon. Medium sized companies, publishing more modest
reports can easily spend Pounds 150,000 in total. A large share register and
a management taste for expensive presentation can bring the bill to Pounds
250,000 or more. The privatised companies, with their massive share
registers, have become adept at reducing unit cost - to as low as 10p a copy
 -but their staggering postage bills make them substantial spenders.
A few brave companies have opted out of the money trap. When the Companies
Act was amended to allow a summary financial report in a short form annual
report, British Airways stopped producing a recognisable annual report
altogether. Instead, BA publishes an undecorated report and accounts for
investment professionals, a user-friendly, semi-annual newspaper for private
shareholders, an annual fact book for analysts and professionals and an
annual corporate magazine. The company estimates this highly segmented
approach saves it about Pounds 450,000 a year.
In the US, McDonald's accompanied its most recent - and inexpensively
produced - document with a videotape. The 16-minute programme set out the
company's medium-term strategy. Although the concept may seem flashy and
expensive to some, the cost of reproducing more than 300,000 short,
lightweight tape cassettes probably compares favourably to the cost of
publishing a similar number of glossy documents. As a way of exposing
resistant professionals to the non-financial communications messages, the
McDonald's approach is decidedly clever; who can resist at least a peek?
Admittedly, few companies can follow the examples set by BA and McDonald's.
The illustrated and designed annual report remains the most common approach.
The design and public relations communities experienced some criticism
during the recession for establishing this standard. Yet consultants, who
sold the idea of reaching audiences with carefully framed messages carried
by themed texts and illustrations, were not wholly wrong. The problem is
that for most British companies, the audience remains too narrowly defined.
British annual reports address the City and its mix of analysts, fund
managers, bankers and journalists: a group resistant if not hostile to
annual report embellishments. But anyone who reads a magazine or newspaper,
watches a documentary or listens to factual radio programmes is bound to be
influenced by subtle communications techniques to a degree.
American companies have long addressed their annual reports to wider
audiences. It is common to attribute the style of American annual reports to
the higher proportion of private shareholders in the US, where institutions
control about 50 per cent of equity as opposed to around 80 per cent in
Britain.
However, the better American reports recognise that shareholders, whether
private or institutional, are not the only readers. They set out annually to
deliver a persuasive case to any intelligent reader. And the financial
community, despite its primary focus on the numbers, is interested more
often than not.
The review section of the typical British annual report is a sop for the
poor private investors, who more than make up in numbers what they lack
equity. Private investors are regularly under-estimated. They are seen as
unsophisticated; happy with photo essays and fat captions.
The illustrations may be beautiful, but texts range from pedestrian to
indigestible. The level of useful information is virtually nil. What after
all, does such typical annual report-speak as 'satisfactory sales',
'significant improvement', 'substantial reduction', or 'poised for recovery'
really mean without sufficient context?
One active private investor, with holdings in about 20 companies, says: 'The
text gives you some idea about what kind of company it is. Not putting an
effort in the front says something very negative about the business. If they
can't be bothered to be imaginative about the front, one is safe to assume
that they have a similar attitude to a lot of their business.'
Corporate executives responsible for annual reports need to reconsider their
view of private investors. ProShare, the organisation formed to represent
the interests of private investors, publishes a bulletin that is full of
letters about earnings per share, gearing, market capitalisation and similar
topics from so-called unsophisticated private shareholders.
The paradox is that most of the money wasted on annual reports is in
addressing private investors in the wrong way. Yet corporations have
travelled this route so long that eliminating design, illustration and
photography is unthinkable.
If annual reports are going to continue to be costly, perhaps the solution
lies in making every pound work harder. This can only come about if
corporate directors stop under-estimating the intelligence of the
non-professional reader. To be effective, the quality of information content
needs to be improved. As much attention ought to be devoted to text as
visual content so that the two work more effectively together.
Lively, information-rich content aimed at a reasonably well educated reader
makes an annual report more useful. As long as the numbers add up, the
investment community is not likely to be put off. Most analysts and fund
managers seem to be fairly neutral about non-financial material. Despite
their protestations, they are often subtly influenced by interesting,
readable information.
In 1992, the US company HJ Heinz reported on a large acquisition in the food
service industry. One objective of the annual report was to direct the
attention of the financial community to Heinz' substantial turnover in this
sector. The details and ramifications of the acquisition were presented
without illustrations. But the front of the book was devoted to a
magazine-style essay on the company's behind the scenes activities. Every
City analyst shown the report reacted to that essay. 'I never realised food
service was such a big part of their business,' was a typical response.
Heinz, in effect, steered the agenda for professional discussion while
addressing a more general audience.
Annual reports cost a lot of money - that is a fact. But given thought, they
don't have to waste it.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Bifu opts against strike at Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE UNION Bifu today decided against launching industrial action over a
pay freeze and proposals for performance-related pay by Lloyds Bank.
Bifu members in Lloyds voted narrowly in favour of a series of one-day
strikes in a ballot that ran through August.
But the turnout was so low that union officials felt unable to authorise
industrial action.
Mr Rob O'Neill, assistant secretary, said: 'The message to the bank is
clear. Many staff are not happy with the bank's proposals, but are not
prepared to take industrial action. Rather than vote no in the ballot and
give the bank the impression that they are happy, they have stayed away.
He added: 'We are very disappointed. Lloyds are the most profitable high
street bank, yet they have imposed a pay freeze on staff.
'There is widespread concern in Lloyds over pay and that will not go away.
We're not ruling out another ballot in the future once Lloyds' plans on pay
become clearer.'
As well as a pay freeze this year, Lloyds says it wants to scrap
across-the-board increases and link future pay to staff performance.
A separate Bifu dispute over shift working at Lloyds London computer centre
continues.

FT  02 SEP 93 / TUC urges Pounds 3bn training cash rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should spend an extra Pounds 3.2bn on training and job
creation measures in its November Budget to cut unemployment, says the
Trades Union Congress in its submission to the chancellor published
yesterday.
In its proposals, under the catch phrase 'investing in all our people', the
TUC recommends that the government's training for work scheme should be
expanded by 180,000 to 500,000 places at a cost of Pounds 2bn in the next
financial year.
It also proposes that the government's pilot Workstart job subsidy scheme
should be developed with an extra 200,000 places at an added cost of Pounds
1.2bn. At present there are only 1,000 places in what is still an
experimental scheme.
The TUC believes the proposed job subsidy could be equal in amount to the
average cost to the exchequer of an unemployed person in lost taxes and
benefit payments.
It suggests an average subsidy of Pounds 115 a week.
It estimates that the removal of every 250,000 from the unemployment
register to full-time work would provide the Treasury with a direct net gain
of Pounds 2.2bn. The TUC urges Mr Kenneth Clarke to make no tax increases in
his Budget except on the top 1 per cent. It also opposes public spending
cuts and reductions in benefit entitlement as 'unfair, unnecessary and
counter-productive'.
The TUC argues that the large size of the public sector borrowing
requirement is not due - as ministers argue - to excessive public spending
but to the loss of tax revenues because of the recession. 'A restoration of
economic growth rates would have a dramatic impact on tax revenues and hence
on the overall PSBR,' it says.
The TUC calls for more targeted public investment on infrastructure
projects, a review of the financial rules governing public-sector industries
to allow in private finance, and a national training strategy.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Murdoch banks on cheaper Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to cut the price of The
Times is a surprising one for a publication marketed in the past as the 'top
people's paper'.
Nothing like it has happened since the 1930s, and conventional wisdom has
always been that newspapers - particularly broadsheet newspapers - are not
very price-sensitive.
But Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has long suspected that
newspapers are too expensive, and that the way to reverse current falls in
circulation is to cut costs.
The national price cut, leaving the weekday Times selling for 30p, a cut of
15p, and the Saturday edition for 40p, a cut of 10p, is expected to be
permanent.
Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, said last night: 'We have studied
closely the results of our current experiment in Kent and concluded that the
new price for The Times is the right one.
'There has been considerable debate in the industry about price levels and
declining circulation in the quality market as a whole.
'We have led the argument and are now leading with the necessary action.'
The move is likely to put intense pressure on The Times' broadsheet rivals
to follow suit. While The Guardian is seen as impregnable with its own
distinct readership, the immediate target is to win readers from The
Independent, which sells for 45p.
According to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for July 1993, The Times
sold an average 359,822 copies per day, down 6.42 per cent on the same month
last year.
The Daily Telegraph, priced at 48p, leads the quality field, with average
daily sales in July of 1,017,483, a 0.23 per cent drop on 1992.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Sky expands satellite horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, yesterday formally launched
Sky Multi-Channels with the help of a live boa constrictor, a Humphrey
Bogart lookalike and hordes of children.
Beneath the inevitable razzmatazz as the 18 channels in the new Sky
Television package were announced is one fundamental fact.
More channels are being offered to viewers but fewer are 'free'. Satellite
television, at least from British Sky Broadcasting (in which Pearson, owner
of the Financial Times, has a significant stake) will from now on be
essentially a subscription service paid for monthly.
Of the original six Sky Television channels only Sky News will be freely
available across Europe. Without a subscription viewers will no longer be
able to see Sky One, the most popular Sky channel.
For the consumer, the new arithmetic of subscription television costs Pounds
6.99 a month - Pounds 3.99 a month until the end of the year.
Viewers will be able to get a 12-channel package ranging from Sky One
(general entertainment) and Discovery (documentaries), to Country Music
Television, UK Living (aimed at women) and Nickelodeon, a channel aimed at
children. Within this package of channels, and apart from Sky News, only
MTV, the music video channel, will be available without subscription.
Buy one of the premium services such as Sky Sports or Sky Movies and the
monthly bill rises to Pounds 11.99. The entire package will cost Pounds
19.99 a month.
The broadcasters such as Viacom and United Artists Programming of the US,
who have joined the package, will get 15p a subscriber each month.
The move to subscription represents both a considerable risk and a
considerable opportunity for Mr Murdoch. If the UK public was to decide that
it did not want to pay more for extra channels of television, Sky could run
into increasing opposition.
But if more viewers can be persuaded to pay for extra television then an
increasingly powerful stream of revenue could be generated which could make
BSkyB and its affiliated channels one of the most powerful forces in British
broadcasting.
As Sky launched a Pounds 15m advertising campaign yesterday the signs were
that the gamble would pay off.
Sky said that on Tuesday alone its customer centre at Livingston, in
Lothian, received more than 65,000 calls - most of them inquiring about
signing up for the new package.
Sky said that new dish sales were running at about 20,000 a week, the
highest for a long time, although the total growth this year, which is
estimated between 700,000 and 800,000, compares with about 1m last year.
Mr Murdoch will face new competition in October from Mr Ted Turner, who
plans to launch two new channels in the UK - TNT, a channel which includes
films, and the Cartoon Network. These are in addition to his existing Cable
News Network.
All three will be available without subscription and could form the nucleus
of a collection of channels funded by advertising.
Mr Murdoch yesterday took credit for the push that has taken satellite
television from four channels to 32 in four years - although many of the
channels are German.
'It was our marketing drive that got the dishes on the roofs so that the new
multi-channel signals could be received,' he said.
The launch coincided with a forecast by stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite
that there could be 800,000 subscribers to the new basic package by the end
of the year and that BSkyB would make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 68m next
year.
The stockbroker puts a value of Pounds 2.5bn on BSkyB. Whether that turns
out to be true will depend on viewers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE HOURLY pay for security guards has risen by 12p, to Pounds 3.52 an
hour, in the 12 months to April 1993, a survey by the British Security
Industry Association has found.
Average weekly pay has risen to Pounds 194.63, the highest since October
1991 when guards were working a near-60-hour week against just over 55 hours
this year.
The lowest-paid guards are in the north-east, where average pay for a
55-hour week is just over Pounds 150. Guards in central London earn the
most.

MIDLAND Poultry Products, based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, yesterday
laid off 100 staff and called in receivers after it failed to reach
agreement over Pounds 290,000 in grant aid from the Black Country
Development Corporation.
The corporation said it was unable to approve the grant, aimed at helping
the company offset costs of setting up a new plant, because the company
could not provide guarantees of continued viability.
Accountants Ernst &amp; Young, appointed receivers, said although the company
had ceased operations they were confident of finding a buyer.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Murdoch cuts price of Times to 30p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS CORPORATION is cutting the price of The Times nationwide by 15p to 30p.
The move - which will take immediate effect - is unprecedented in the recent
history of Britain's broadsheet newspapers. It follows an experimental 15p
cut to 30p in Kent, which has produced a consistent rise in circulation of
between 12 per cent and 15 per cent since it was introduced on August 2.
The national price cut, which is expected to be permanent, will herald one
of the most intense periods of competition between broadsheet newspapers in
living memory.
The decision is a surprising one for a publication that in the past has been
marketed as the 'top people's paper'. Mr Murdoch, chairman of News
Corporation, has long suspected that newspapers are too expensive, and that
the way to reverse current falls in circulation is to cut costs.
A 30p Times, News Corporation hopes, will take the paper from its current
circulation of about 370,000 to well above 400,000 and into second place in
the broadsheet market behind the Daily Telegraph.
The Guardian is seen as impregnable with its own distinct liberal
readership, and the immediate target is The Independent, which has been
going through difficult times both financially and editorially.
It is believed, however, that Mr Murdoch has framed a long-term policy to
compete head-on with the Daily Telegraph and dislodge some of its
circulation of about 1m.
News Corporation's price cutting started earlier this summer when The Sun
lopped 5p off its 25p cover price. The result has been a modest 300,000
increase in sales - enough of a success to justify extending the cut into
1994.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Supermarkets win Costco challenge go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge yesterday granted Britain's three largest supermarket
chains the right to an early hearing of their legal attempt to stop Costco,
a US-owned warehouse club, opening its first UK outlet in Thurrock, Essex.
The ruling, by Mr Justice Brooke, came as another council, Hertsmere in
Hertfordshire, approved in principle an application by Costco to open a
second outlet at Bushey, Hertfordshire.
J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are jointly opposing the decision last May
by Thurrock Council to award Costco planning permission for a warehouse as a
wholesale operation and not as a retailer.
Costco, which plans to sell goods ranging from baked beans to car tyres at
deeply discounted prices, says it is not a retailer because it will sell
only to club members.
But the supermarkets say Costco should be subject to planning rules similar
to those on retailers.
The supermarkets' legal challenge had not been expected to be heard for at
least 18 months, well after the planned opening of the Thurrock warehouse in
late November. Although Mr Justice Brooke set no date for a hearing he said
it was 'in the public interest' for the issues raised to be settled quickly.
He also denied Costco leave to appeal against his decision and awarded costs
against the company.
The hearing will be watched by many retailers as a test case with important
implications for competition in the industry.
The supermarkets, which have invested large sums in superstores, fear Costco
and other warehouse clubs would have an unfair advantage if they were not
required to operate from scarce and expensive retail sites.
Hertsmere council has agreed to authorise the construction of a Costco
warehouse on a non-retail site provided the company signs a legal agreement
restricting the range of products it sells.
The three supermarkets said they would not challenge the planned agreement
if they judged it to be sufficiently restrictive.
Since Thurrock granted Costco planning permission the department has issued
planning guidelines which advise local authorities to treat warehouse clubs
in the same way as retail outlets.
ASDA supermarket workers have voted overwhelmingly against strike action and
have accepted a 2 per cent pay increase.
Nearly 69 per cent of the 35,270 staff in the postal ballot responded - an
exceptionally high return, according to the GMB general union which
organised it.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Defence groups angered by size of EC aid bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE GROUPS yesterday criticised the government for seeking only Pounds
15m in regional aid from the European Commission to help areas hit by
military spending cuts.
Organisations representing regions where falling defence orders have led to
plant closures and thousands of job losses, said the application for a share
of the Pounds 100m Konver fund would not cover the costs of helping
companies diversify into civilian production.
Under the scheme, announced earlier this year by Mr Bruce Millan, EC
regional policy commissioner, the government had until yesterday to submit
its outline plans and spending needs to help areas dependent on defence.
Britain is seeking Ecu20.1m (Pounds 15.4m) in aid, which would be matched by
the government, local authorities or the private sector.
Campaign groups bidding for EC aid in areas such as Lancashire, Avon,
Gloucestershire and Wiltshire said the total aid package of Pounds 30m,
spread across the country, would be largely ineffective in paying for new
business start-ups, technology transfer schemes, vocational training, and
the conversion of disused military bases.
The Western Development Partnership in Avon, which is supporting a joint bid
by the three western counties for Pounds 6m in aid, said Britain's
application was disappointing.
The partnership said yesterday: 'It's a very paltry amount to address the
problem.'
In Lancashire, where defence cuts have been blamed for 7,000 job losses in
recent years, officials expressed dismay at the UK submission. Mr David
Miller, director of economic development at Lancashire Enterprise, said:
'We've already won matching funds for projects worth Pounds 11m next year.
Now the government is only offering us Pounds 2.4m - the money just isn't
enough.'
Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday denied the
government had submitted an application for less money than Britain
deserved. The DTI said it had been told by the Commission there was no more
than Pounds 15m available over the next year.
Brussels said aid could be increased in future years.

FT  02 SEP 93 / BR to contest door compensation claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL yesterday said it would contest legal action over the safety of
doors on some InterCity trains following a series of accidents in which
passengers died falling from carriages.
InterCity, the high-speed division of BR, is facing the first compensation
claims relating to the doors since a Health and Safety Executive report in
May criticised the locks on older rolling stock.
The HSE called for modifications to the doors following 165 deaths between
1981 and 1990.
Solicitors acting for the families of two men who died in separate accidents
on the west coast main line and another passenger who suffered
post-traumatic stress said yesterday they would be seeking Pounds 100,000
total compensation.
InterCity denied liability for the accidents, but said it would fit modified
locks to almost 2,000 slam-door carriages at a cost of Pounds 17m.
Mr Douglas Fraser, acting for solicitors Silvermore Livermore in Liverpool,
said he hoped BR would settle. 'If not, we will take them right through the
courts.'

FT  02 SEP 93 / Council seeks return of redundancy payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-NINE former local authority employees who received redundancy
payments nearly three years ago under an enhanced severance scheme, since
ruled unlawful, are being taken to court by their former employer.
The 29 are among 368 former employees who have been instructed by North
Tyneside council to repay a total of Pounds 1.5m they received above the
statutory minimum entitlement.
Letters sent by the council in July to the 368 - who received enhancements
ranging from Pounds 400 to Pounds 18,000 - demanding repayment have elicited
only two offers of reimbursement. The council confirmed yesterday that it
had selected 29 test cases. Summonses will be sent out later this month.
The proceedings will be in the County Court but some cases could go higher
as some of those refusing repayment have union backing.
The council's enhanced severance scheme was introduced in September 1990 to
help it shed jobs because of charge-capping. It was subsequently challenged
by the district auditor. A High Court ruling that the scheme was unlawful
was upheld by the Appeal Court last year.
Between November 12 and December 31 1990, 342 people took redundancy,
including Pounds 1.4m in enhanced payments. A further 26 who took redundancy
under the enhanced scheme after December 31 1990 signed letters agreeing to
reimburse additional payments, totalling Pounds 141,000, should the legal
challenge be upheld.
The 29 test cases include 20 of these 26. The nine others are three former
teachers, three ex- white collar staff and three ex-manual workers.
Mr Barry Howarth, a Unison regional officer, said yesterday that the union
was not contesting the cases against the 20 but was supporting all its
members among the 342 who were declining repayment, in the belief they have
a winnable case. The 368 received enhancements ranging from Pounds 400 to
Pounds 18,000.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Insurance sales practices attacked: Building societies
accused of 'unfair tie-in' of mortgages with home policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES were yesterday accused of 'unjust' practices in the way
that they sell home insurance policies on behalf of the UK's biggest
insurance companies.
Direct Line, the telephone-based insurer, makes the accusations in a report
submitted to the Office of Fair Trading. It says that building societies
continue unfairly to 'tie-in' the purchase of building insurance policies
with mortgage agreements. The report also accuses societies of not providing
sufficient information about charges to their customers. It says this would
enable them to shop around for cheaper policies.
Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary launched in 1986, sells
more than 1m motor insurance policies and is now aiming to break into the
Pounds 4bn a year home insurance market.
Ms Jane Dickson, company secretary of Direct Line, said: 'If consumers knew
that in some cases up to a third of the money they pay to insure their homes
was going to their building society as commission, they'd vote with their
feet.'
Building societies and other intermediaries sell nine out of 10 home
insurance policies, taking a commission of up to 30 per cent of the premiums
they charge.
Although the societies have voluntarily agreed not to link the sale of
insurance to the sale of standard mortgage products, more than 40 per cent
of mortgages consist of 'packages', a mortgage loan conditional on the
purchase of other products. Legislation passed in 1990 which aims to make
societies provide full information about packaged products and their true
costs has not yet been implemented.
Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association,
defended the payment of commissions, which he said reflect the work that
building societies carried out for insurers. He said that building societies
were concerned that too much information might 'confuse' consumers.
Direct Line says that the sharp rise in the cost of insurance premiums in
recent years has aggravated the problem.
'Increased premiums may reflect increased risk. However, increased
commission, paid as a proportion of these larger premiums, does not reflect
increased work or responsibilities. Nothing has been done by
commission-based insurance intermediaries to reduce commission levels,' says
Direct Line.
Meanwhile the Consumers Association, which has itself criticised 'tie-ins'
in the past, today accuses insurance companies of increasing house contents
insurance premiums by 'staggeringly high amounts'.
The latest edition of Which?, the association's magazine, says the cost of
house contents insurance premiums has more than doubled since 1987, while
house buildings premiums have risen by more than half.
Insurance companies have 'bumped up the price of home insurance over the
past few years with swingeing increases that more than outstrip inflation -
partly to pay for their past blunders', says Which?
Mr Simon Hinde, a senior editor, says the increases are 'simply
unacceptable.
Which? says insurers are 'worryingly reluctant' to cover homes which have
suffered from subsidence.
Asked if they would insure a house which had been underpinned one year ago,
more than three quarters of insurance companies contacted by association
researchers refused a quote or said that they needed more information.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Unions clash on building workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS TO END an inter-union conflict in the construction industry that
threatens to disrupt next week's Congress in Brighton will be put to the TUC
general council today for its approval.
Mr John Monks, incoming TUC general secretary, is trying to resolve the row
about alleged membership poaching between the construction union UCATT and
the AEEU engineering and electrical union.
UCATT leaders are demanding an end to what they see as the AEEU's campaign
to recruit their members in construction.
They want the AEEU to dismantle its construction and building trades
section, insisting that this is the price the union must pay to bring the
electricians back into the TUC six years after their expulsion.
During their years outside the TUC the electricians - outside TUC rules on
inter-union relations - went on a membership recruitment offensive,
attracting workers from TUC unions into their own ranks.
Last night details of a proposed resolution of the dispute were not
disclosed.
AEEU leaders have argued that their union's construction section contains
many workers who were not recruited by the electricians from UCATT before
amalgamation.

<TEXT>
INSURERS HAVE come under attack from the Consumers' Association for
increasing house contents insurance premiums by 'staggeringly high amounts'.
The latest edition of Which?, the association's magazine, says the cost of
house contents insurance premiums has more than doubled since 1987, while
house buildings premiums have risen by more than half.
Insurance companies have 'bumped up the price of home insurance over the
past few years with swingeing increases that more than outstrip inflation -
partly to pay for their past blunders', says Which?
Mr Simon Hinde, a senior editor, says the increases are 'simply
unacceptable.
'Insurers have blundered badly over a long period and are making customers
pay for their mistakes. Instead of cutting costs and doing more to fight
fraud they're taking the easy way out - clobbering the consumer.'
Which? says insurers are 'worryingly reluctant' to cover homes which have
suffered from subsidence. Asked if they would insure a house underpinned one
year ago, more than three quarters of insurance companies contacted by
association researchers refused a quote or said they needed more
information.
Which? advises consumers to shop around by contacting at least one
intermediary.
It also says buyers should take care to ensure they are buying the right
amount of insurance and not to pay extra for cover they may not need.
The association urges consumers not to assume that an insurance policy
offered by their building society is necessarily a good deal for them.
Companies offering what Which? describes as 'best buys' include Direct Line,
for both claims and service on both buildings and contents, Frizzell, best
on service for contents policies, and Prudential for claims and service for
both buildings and contents.

FT  02 SEP 93 / University rejections increase by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REJECTIONS OF candidates by universities have increased by 10 per cent this
year compared with the same point last year, the universities' admissions
system said yesterday.
The figures confirmed predictions that admissions would be much tighter this
year following better A-level results than expected and a cut in government
funds for arts courses.
The increase in rejections from 120,000 to 132,000, and the improved
A-levels, suggested that candidates had been rejected in spite of attaining
grades which would have earned them a place last year.
Suggestions that the admissions procedure would be chaotic appear to have
been exaggerated, however. The 'old' universities (excluding those which
were polytechnics or colleges of higher education until last year), have
already accepted slightly more students than last year, according to the
Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca).
It expects that about 137,000 places will eventually be awarded. Last year
just less than 130,000 students were given places. Slightly more applicants
have been accepted through clearing this year than at the same point last
year (1,155 compared to 1,073).
Few places are available on popular single-honours arts courses, for which
funds have been cut, but universities are having difficulties in filling
science courses, though funding is unchanged.
Clearing started later for the former polytechnics, but many report a much
harder year than last year because they were obliged to accept students
whose arts A-levels would normally have been good enough to gain a place at
one of the 'old' universities.
Mr David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University
Teachers, said problems with clearing had been exaggerated by the press, and
older universities in particular had 'gone to huge lengths' to take more
students.

THE PUBLIC scrutiny to which Whitehall officials have been subjected by the

Ministry of Defence promotes British arms exports.
Yesterday senior MoD officials promoting a British army and navy equipment
exhibition which starts in Aldershot on Monday defended aggressive defence
sales promotion in militarily sensitive areas on economic grounds.
One official said: 'Defence exports don't make wars, they prevent them.'
Civil servants emphasised the need to promote defence exports which
accounted for an estimated 110,000 British jobs and defended the need to
observe client confidentiality.
It was also clear that they remain highly critical of what they perceive is
the unjustifiably negative image of government emanating from the Scott
inquiry. One senior official said: 'What I resent is the suggestion that the
British are conspiratorial, slightly dirty, and underhand.' He added that
the French continued to be far more unscrupulous in bending rules.
Since the arms-for-Iraq inquiry several MoD officials have been subjected to
detailed questioning by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley
Baxendale QC about the extent to which government departments may have
circumvented guidelines restricting arms sales.
But their careers appear to have remained largely untarnished. One early
witness at the Scott inquiry, Mr Christopher Sandars, who helped oversee
defence sales in the 1980s, has recently been promoted from a post in the
cabinet office to under-secretary of state responsible for defence export
policy at the MoD.
The Scott inquiry resumes its public hearings after the summer recess on
September 13 with evidence being taken from Mr David Gore-Booth, the UK's
current ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who was previously under-secretary of
state responsible for the Middle East at the Foreign Office.
Three former Foreign Office ministers, Mr Timothy Renton, Mr David Mellor
and Mr William Waldegrave, are to give evidence in the following week. Lady
Thatcher is scheduled for December, prior to Mr John Major's appearance in
January.

on 33 memory drugs under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL pharmaceutical industry is carrying out clinical trials on
33 different drugs intended to improve memory in elderly patients, said
Professor Brenda Costall of Bradford University's pharmacology department.
'The memory enhancing drugs will not do anything in the normal brain but
they do help if the memory is impaired through age,' she said.
One of the candidate drugs is Zofran, which the pharmaceuticals company
Glaxo sells as a treatment for nausea in patients receiving surgery or
chemotherapy.
All of the 33 drugs produced encouraging results in animal tests.
Prof Costall predicted that it would become clear within five years which,
if any, helped human patients.

Nerve-cell transplants may fight brain disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVE CELLS from a patient's intestine may soon be transplanted to cure
brain disease, the British Association meeting at Keele heard yesterday.
Animal studies at University College, London, show that nerve cells
transplanted from a rat's gut into its brain grow into the surrounding
tissue, while at the same time nerves from the brain penetrate the
transplant.
Some of the animals had brain damage which would be a good model for human
degenerative disorders, notably Huntington's Chorea and Parkinson's disease.
Professor Geoffrey Burnstock, head of anatomy and developmental biology at
UCL, says gut-to-brain transplants would avoid many problems posed by foetal
transplants - where cells have been transplanted from human foetuses into
the brains of Parkinson's sufferers as a means of 'rewiring' damaged nerves.
More than 100,000 people in the UK suffer from Parkinson's.
Dr Peter Jenner of the Parkinson's Disease Experimental Research
Laboratories at King's College, London, described the findings as 'very
exciting'. The foetal technique had been over-hyped and produced false
hopes, because the foetal cells had not grown well enough, he said. The best
results were on patients in Sweden but none had recovered sufficiently to
stop taking drugs.
Most of the chemical messengers which control brain activity are present in
the gut cells. There would be no possibility of the transplant being
rejected by the patient's immune system, because it came from his or her own
intestines. And the ethical objections to using foetal cells would not
exist.
The next stage in Prof Burnstock's research will be to discover what it is
about the gut transplant that triggers nerves in the brain to start growing.
Usually damage to the brain is permanent because nerves do not grow back. If
the factors responsible are isolated, they could be used to treat spinal
injuries and other nerve damage.
The UCL research also opens up the possibility of curing inherited brain
disease. Gut-to-brain transplants could be used to deliver correct copies of
faulty genes.
Prof Burnstock said the nervous system of the gut was sometimes known as a
'small brain' because it could sustain so many sophisticated reflex
activities independently of the central nervous system. More than 60 of the
transmitter chemicals it uses were also produced in the brain.
It is not clear how soon the research could be applied to humans. Further
animal studies are needed to find out how selective a transplant's effect is
and how its growth is controlled.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Fast expansion 'would cause another recession'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID ECONOMIC expansion will fuel inflation and usher in another recession
after only a few good years, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, warned yesterday.
In an interview with the Securities and Investment Review Mr George
criticised the UK's economic policy-making establishment for making mistakes
from which it should learn.
Commenting on the boom of the late 1980s he said: 'Very simply, the mistake
was that we let the pound get out of hand and lost control of inflation as a
result. That is something we have to avoid in the future.'
The governor said his personal ambition was for the growth rate of output to
be above the growth rate of inflation for three consecutive years.
'You should not settle for anything less than an effective elimination of
inflation. In reality, this is probably captured by the zero to 2 per cent
medium-term objective which the government has set,' he said.
Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit says in its lates forecasts that
the recovery will not be strong enough to make a big dent in the budget
deficit and tax increases will be necessary over the next few years.
The unit expects recovery to continue in the second half of this year at the
same pace as in the first, but tighter fiscal policy and slow earnings
growth will stop it from gaining further momentum.
At least as much emphasis willgo on higher indirect taxes as on cutting
public expenditure in the Budget, the report warns.
'Set against this and the expected failure of the recovery to gather further
momentum, the chancellor will probably cut interest rates further to assure
continued recovery.'
The unit expects the economy to expand by 1.4 per cent this year and by 2.2
per cent next year. Growth in 1995, 1996 and 1997 will not rise above 2.3
per cent, it forecasts.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Labour offensive claims Pounds 1,000 tax 'bombshell'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR LAUNCHED an autumn offensive yesterday with the claim that the 'tax
bombshell' in the March Budget meant that a family on average income would
pay Pounds 1,000 a year more in tax by April 1995, when the changes were
fully in place.
At the centre of the campaign is renewed opposition to the extension of
value added tax to domestic fuel and a warning to ministers not to extend
the VAT base further in the November Budget, to areas such as food, books
and children's clothes.
The attack, based on the theme 'stop the rot - start to build', is aimed at
a broad range of policies on which Labour says the government has betrayed
its election promises, including education, crime and public services.
A lobby by pensioners of the Tory party conference in Blackpool and the
organisation of a petition to parliament, as well as efforts to set
Conservative local councillors against the government's policy are among the
tactics planned for the coming weeks.
The campaign comes against a background of criticism from some Labour MPs at
the way in which Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has abandoned the
tax policies put forward in the party's general election manifesto.
Labour also hopes that it will reverse the trend of recent months in which
its standing in opinion polls has slipped slightly, although it has
maintained a decisive lead over the Conservatives.
Highlighting the impact of the tax increases already planned, Mr Brown said
that taxation was 'the one card the Tories could play at successive
elections, and it is no longer available to them'. The warning of a 'tax
bombshell' was a deliberate echo of the Conservatives' election campaign
attack on Labour.
Mr Brown conceded that under European Community agreements the government's
ability to reverse the extension of VAT to domestic fuel - even if it wanted
to do so - was extremely doubtful, but insisted that his party's campaign
was still worthwhile.
He said there were four ways in which to deal with the deficit: economic
growth, cutting unemployment, tax reforms - including a windfall tax on the
'excessive profits' of the privatised utilities - and some savings in public
spending, such as the agriculture budget.
Labour's figures - which were dismissed by the Tories - are based on the
changes in income tax, allowances, mortgage tax relief, vehicle excise duty,
excise duties and national insurance contributions, as well as the extension
of VAT.

FT  02 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Gene
study aims to cut health risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER UNDERSTANDING of the interaction between genes and the environment,
which controls an individual's susceptibility to disease, could lead to
personal health cards that identify areas of risk and enable individuals to
monitor their progress.
This could be one result of a new field of research called Ecogenetics which
examines the way an individual's genetic make-up responds to environmental
factors such as chemicals, food additives or smoking.
Professor Mark Ferguson of the Department of Cell and Structural Biology at
the University of Manchester told the association that this would allow
healthcare to be better targeted and more cost-effective.
Not all environmental agents caused disease in all people, so there was
clearly a genetic basis to susceptibility, he said. 'Understanding how
different individuals respond to different external factors is of major
importance in trying to understand and prevent, as well as treat, a number
of important disorders.'
If the main susceptibility genes could be mapped, it would be possible to
produce a health passport for every individual and everyone could be given
appropriate preventative advice and screening.
"Everyone knows of the association between smoking and lung cancer but not
everyone who smokes is at risk of the disease. Ecogenetics will make it
possible to make predictions about an individual's risk.'
Prof Ferguson said this would make anti-smoking information much more
potent. 'Humans respond better to warnings about individual risk than to
blanket prescriptions.'
It would be possible to target screening services, such as breast scans, to
those with a known genetic risk.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Fowler to quit as Group 4 director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, is to resign as a
non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, the international group of
security businesses, from 1 October to spend more time with his party.
Sir Norman, who left Mrs Thatcher's cabinet early in 1990 in order to spend
more time with his family, said yesterday that since becoming party chairman
after the election last year 'my time has become increasingly limited and
therefore I have decided, with great regret, to stand down'.
In the general election campaign Sir Norman acted as Mr John Major's
'minder', signalling a return to full-time active politics, and for more
than a year he has combined the party chairmanship with five non-executive
director-ships.
Group 4 hit the headlines in April when, soon after it had begun work as the
first private-sector company to run services escorting prisoners between
prisons and courts, four men escaped or were wrongly released within as many
days.
Sir Norman's decision will raise speculation that he hopes for a return to
office with a senior post in the cabinet.
The announcement came as Labour attacked the practice of cabinet ministers
leaving government and almost immediately acquiring well-paid jobs in the
private sector.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday said there should be a
delay of at least two years before ministers can take up posts in private
business.
He was responding to the announcement the day before that Mr Norman Lamont,
the former chancellor, had been appointed a non-executive director of the
merchant bank NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, less than four months after his
reluctant departure from government.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Sharp fall in union support for Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, has suffered a sharp decline in popularity
among Britain's trade union leaders, a poll published today in New Statesman
and Society shows.
Both former leader Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport
spokesman, are rated more highly than Mr Smith.
Since last year's poll Mr Smith has seen a 20 per cent fall in his rating.
His performance achieves a score of 6.3 out of 10 this year compared with
7.8 last year. This is lower than that of Mr Kinnock during his final year
as party leader. By contrast Mr Prescott's popularity among union leaders
has soared - taking him from eighth to first place in the shadow cabinet
popularity table with a score of 6.7 out of 10.
Modernisers Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr Tony Blair, the
shadow home secretary, have both suffered declines in their ratings.
Only 55 per cent of union leaders say they would like to see the abolition
of the union block vote at the party conference, down from 61 per cent last
year.
The survey was based on 51 completed questionnaires from among 120 trade
union general secretaries.

FT  02 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Cities
urged to review hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE LARGE inner-city hospitals should be closed, says Sir Bernard
Tomlinson, author of the government report which last year recommended
closing several London hospitals.
'Every city should take a fresh look at its hospital base,' Sir Bernard told
the association. 'Actual closure of hospitals has so far mostly involved
smaller peripheral or specialty hospitals but it is now necessary to
consider the closure of some large hospitals, most of which are in inner
cities.'
Sir Bernard, former professor of pathology at Newcastle University, said the
main factor forcing change was medical progress, which enabled general
practitioners to treat many patients at home who would previously have
required hospital care.
In addition many patients, particularly the elderly, stayed in hospital much
longer than they needed because community services could not take over their
care. At the same time 'lack of ready access to GP care results in many
patients using hospital accident and emergency departments for primary care,
again increasing hospital and probably overall health service costs'.
He said London's health services needed greater changes than those of any
other city. 'No other city has such a concentration of expensive teaching
hospitals.' In contrast, London's primary services were worse than those of
any other city, with less medical, nursing and support staff.
Others at the association session on 'Healthcare on a limited budget' backed
up Sir Bernard. Professor Alan Maynard, head of York University's Centre for
Health Economics, said NHS resources could be used more efficiently if
routine surgery was carried out at district hospitals rather than teaching
hospitals. The saving for colo-rectal surgery would be about 40 per cent.
Professor Bryan Jennett, a neurosurgeon at Glasgow University, said:
'Services are now available more cheaply in the districts, as a result of
changing medical practices.'

FT  02 SEP 93 / Greenpeace wins right to fight Thorp tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday won permission to
bring a High Court challenge against the government's decision to allow
radioactive testing of the Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
But the court also ruled yesterday that British Nuclear Fuels can begin
testing the Pounds 2.8bn plant's systems with uranium ahead of the two-day
review, which is set to begin on September 14.
However, Greenpeace said last night that it had secured an Appeal Court
hearing tomorrow for its application to overturn the decision to allow
testing. Greenpeace said that this could still prevent the plant becoming
contaminated with radioactivity as 'BNF told us after the hearing that
radioactive material will not be introduced into the plant for six days'.
Both sides claimed victory yesterday after the court hearing in the latest
round of the increasingly complex deliberations about whether the plant
should be allowed to start reprocessing used nuclear fuel.
BNF said: 'We welcome the news that Greenpeace have failed in their attempt
to halt uranium (testing).' Ms Bridget Woodman, Greenpeace's nuclear
campaigner, said: 'We are very happy to have won our application to seek
judicial review.'
Last week ministers told BNF that it could begin testing the plant with
radioactive material to save time if a licence is eventually granted. The
proposed tests will check radioactivity-measuring equipment and the part of
the plant that separates reusable fuel from the waste.
In refusing to block the testing ahead of September 14, the judge said that
he had been 'very considerably influenced' by BNF's estimates of its
financial loss and by Greenpeace's likely inability to compensate BNF for
that loss if BNF argued successfully that the delay was unjustified. Mr
George Newman QC had argued for BNF that if a 'stay' on testing had been
granted it could have cost the company up to Pounds 2m a week and put 700
jobs at risk.
But the judge also said that Greenpeace had 'an arguable case' for a
judicial review of the decision to allow testing.
Greenpeace is arguing that by allowing testing to go ahead the government is
prejudicing the decision on the plant's licence. BNF needs the same licence
to generate nuclear waste and emit radioactive discharges to carry out tests
as it would for full operation of the plant, Greenpeace claims.
If Greenpeace is successful on September 14, it will simply halt testing,
not the granting of a full licence. The government's decision on the future
of the plant is not due until after the current public consultation, which
is due to end on October 4. But ministers have already said that they are
'minded' to grant authorisation.

He was responding to the announcement the day before that Mr Norman Lamont,

'The public will be very concerned about cabinet ministers moving straight

He called for guidelines governing the conduct of ministers, similar to the
cabinet office rules about officials taking posts in the private sector
after leaving the civil service.
'The prime minister should lay down new rules immediately governing the
appointment of ex-ministers to companies within months of leaving the
government,' he said.

SIR Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, is to resign as a
non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, the international group of
security businesses, from 1 October to spend more time with his party,
Alison Smith writes.
Sir Norman, who left Mrs Thatcher's cabinet early in 1990 in order to spend
more time with his family, said yesterday that since becoming party chairman
after the election last year 'my time has become increasingly limited and
therefore I have decided, with great regret, to stand down'. He has been a

In the general election campaign Sir Norman acted as Mr John Major's

than a year he has combined the party chairmanship with five non-executive
directorships.
Group 4 hit the headlines in April when, soon after it had begun work as the
first private-sector company to run the service escorting prisoners between
prisons and courts, four men escaped or were wrongly released within as many
days.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is today to set out the government's
plans for further involvement of private-sector companies in managing the
prison system. Late last month Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of
prisons, said that inmates at the Wolds, the remand prison run by Group 4,
lazed about for much of the day, though he praised the staff and the
facilities at the jail.
While there is no direct management link between the Group 4 organisations
running these services and the parent company which Sir Norman is a director
of, the connection was enough to give opposition MPs plenty of scope for
humour at his expense.
Conservative central office said that Sir Norman had no immediate plans to
resign from his other posts. Even so, his decision will raise speculation
that he hopes for a return to ministerial office, with a senior post in the
cabinet.

previous role as chairman of the House of Representatives armed services
committee.
The results of the Bottom-Up Review he announced yesterday draw heavily on
some of the concepts he worked with before, but they also show the
Pentagon's own thinking.
After submitting to Congress a budget for 1994 he frankly described as
'treading water', Mr Aspin has now completed the more detailed review he
promised would set the stage for more radical changes in the US defence
budget.
The review is based on a complete change in the threats and missions the US
armed forces are to be built to confront. Instead of preparing for the third
world war, the US military strategy will now be based on the need to be
ready for two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts.
There has been much debate at the Pentagon in recent months over the
'win-hold-win' and 'win-win' concepts for dealing with such big regional
conflicts - a debate which has wide implications for the size of the US
forces.
A force structure geared to winning a single big regional conflict would,
according to Pentagon documents, require eight active army divisions, eight
navy aircraft carrier battle groups and 10 air force active fighter wings.
A strategy based on winning one such conflict while containing a second
conflict until the first was won - the win-hold-win strategy - would require
another two army divisions, two more carrier groups and three more fighter
wings.
To be able to win two nearly simultaneous big conflicts and have spare
capacity for action elsewhere such as peacekeeping, as Mr Aspin has decided,
adds another two divisions, two carrier groups and a fighter wing to the
force.
Some outside defence analysts believe this structure to be excessive. They
argue there have only been three such big regional conflicts in 50 years -
Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf - though the Soviet Union loomed throughout as
the big threat.
Gen Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged
yesterday that it was not really likely that two such wars would confront
the US simultaneously, but he argued that it would be 'irresponsible and
unwise' not to prepare for the possibility; failure to do so could encourage
the very eventuality that the US sought to avoid.
Gen Powell said the review assumed potential attacks by Iraq and North
Korea, but said that this was merely a basis for planning the force
structure.
'History teaches us that we never really fight where we thought we were
going to fight. The forces you buy with this assessment might well be used
in a conflict you never dreamed of,' he said.
By gearing forces only for 'nearly simultaneous' conflicts, however, the US
can save a lot on its strategic lift capacity, essentially preserving only
enough sea and air transport capacity to transport to one front at a time.
Improved air and sea lift, nevertheless, are a big component of the Pentagon
plan to adapt US forces to meet the different kinds of task they will be
required to handle in the future. Mr Aspin said the Pentagon would either
continue the programme to buy the new but controversial C-17 transport
aircraft or buy other airliners to replace the ageing C-141s, and would also
keep a brigade of heavy armour permanently afloat on ships that could be
sent to the Gulf or to north-east Asia at short notice.
Other 'enhancements' to improve the flexibility and capability of US forces
would include:
Adding ground attack capability to the navy's carrier-based F-14 fighters.
Modifying B-1 and B-2 bombers to enable them to drop conventional weapons as
well as nuclear.
Developing smart rockets and missiles for the army.
Preparing brigade-size National Guard units to back up active units, instead
of whole National Guard divisions, which have in the past taken longer to
reach full readiness.
The Bottom-Up Review was supposed to be driven only by an assessment of the
forces the US would need to defend itself in the future, not by the need to
meet a budget savings target, and Mr Aspin yesterday ducked questions on the
budget implications of the plan.
Nevertheless, critics are already charging that by preserving a force
structure that is only slightly slimmer than the Base Force planned by Mr
Richard Cheney, President George Bush's defence secretary, the Bottom-Up
Review may have jeopardised the development of defence programmes for the
longer term, when more dangerous threats may have emerged.
'We really aren't in a position to pursue a rich man's strategy any more.
What we really need is a bottom-up review that looks not only at short-term
requirements but also establishes a security posture for the medium and long
term,' said Mr Andrew Krepinevich of Defence Budget Project, a Washington
group that monitors defence spending.

MR Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela's suspended president, said yesterday he
would appeal to the Supreme Court against Congress's decision to block him
from returning to office even if he is acquitted on corruption charges,
writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
Congress voted on Tuesday night to make permanent last May's suspension of
Mr Perez from the presidency following allegations of embezzlement and
misuse of public funds. Congress also voted to ratify Mr Ramon Jose
Velasquez as interim president, and authorised him to serve out the
remaining five months of Mr Perez's term.

FT  02 SEP 93 / California bill seeks to ward off UK tax retaliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S Senate has passed a bill that legislators hope will settle the
British government's complaints about the state's system of worldwide
unitary tax assessment and ward off retaliation against California-based
companies operating in the UK.
The bill, which is expected to be considered by the state assembly's revenue
and taxation committee today, would address the three main complaints
foreign companies make about the operation of the California tax system.
Since 1988, companies have been able to choose an alternative, known as
water's edge assessment, to the controversial unitary system, but have had
to pay a fee for this election.
The new bill would abolish this fee and eliminate some additional paperwork.
It would also remove the right of the California tax authorities to override
a company's choice of the water's edge system.
The US federal administration is hoping that the bill will enable it to
avoid taking sides between California and the UK in a case brought by
Barclays Bank against unitary taxation now pending before the Supreme Court.
British business groups and MPs have said the new legislation does not meet
their demands because it preserves elements of the unitary system, and are
urging the UK government to maintain its threat to refuse Californian
companies a tax credit they now receive if the issue is not settled by the
end of this year.
Under a unitary assessment California may tax a company on a proportion of
its worldwide income, rather than only on income earned within the state.
Because this method of assessment conflicts with the methods used by other
countries and contained in the US's bilateral tax treaties, it can give rise
to double taxation.

The government, which has a 7 per cent stake in the Swiss national airline,
said that after discussions with Swissair directors it was satisfied the
so-called Alcazar project would secure the airline's future. It added that
it would be prepared to change laws restricting ownership of Swissair.
The four airlines aim to complete a memorandum of understanding by
mid-September, covering an operating agreement that could lead ultimately to

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Nokia in German move to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, has shifted production of its
small-screen television sets from the Far East to Germany, claiming that the
move will cut costs and improve quality, Andrew Adonis writes. Nokia, one of
Europe's top three television manufacturers, expects to reduce its
production costs by up to 20 per cent by concentrating television production
in Germany instead of continuing with an arrangement with Sanyo, the
Japanese supplier, in Singapore.
The shift involves a DM20m (Pounds 8m) investment in two new production
lines, but no net increase in employment.
Mr Heikki Koskinen, president of Nokia's consumer electronics division, said
he believed the move was the first of its kind in the industry. 'It will
enable us to unify our development and production efforts, and offers the
prospect of a reasonable margin at a competitive price.'
Although it returned to profit in the first four months of this year on the
back of fast expanding telecommunications sales, Nokia's consumer
electronics division is still making losses, like those of most of its
European competitors. The division accounted for a third of Nokia's sales.

FT  02 SEP 93 / US reduces projections for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday sharply reduced its forecasts of US
economic growth, predicting that real gross domestic product would expand by
only 2 per cent this year, not 3.1 per cent as forecast in April.
The new projection, which covers the 12 months to the fourth quarter of this
year, represents a halving of the economic growth rate since last year.
Revised figures released this week showed that real GDP grew 3.9 per cent in
the year to the fourth quarter of 1992.
The administration's growth projections for next year were revised down from
3.3 per cent to 3 per cent.
However, in its 'mid-session' economic review, the White House also released
more optimistic estimates of future budget deficits. The federal deficit is
now expected to fall from Dollars 285bn (Pounds 190bn) this fiscal year to
Dollars 179bn by fiscal 1996. Previously it had projected a decline from
Dollars 322bn to Dollars 212bn over the same period.
Economic data released yesterday also pointed to continuing lacklustre
economic growth.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the health of manufacturing
industry - was 49.3 per cent last month, slightly down from July. Readings
below 50 per cent are regarded as a sign that manufacturing industry is
contracting.
An index gauging employment trends fell particularly sharply, indicating
that jobs are probably still being shed in manufacturing.
The Commerce Department said floods in the Midwest and droughts in the
southeast contributed to a 0.2 per cent decline in personal incomes between
June and July; personal incomes fell 0.1 per cent between May and June.
Officials said this was the first time since 1954 that personal incomes in
cash terms had fallen for two consecutive months.
Consumer spending, however, rose 0.4 per cent in July, to register its
fourth consecutive monthly gain.
In a separate report, the department said construction spending fell 0.5 per
cent between June and July, following a 1.8 per cent gain in the previous
month.
The administration's forecast of only 2 per cent growth this year mainly
reflected disappointing growth in the first half. The White House claimed
that GDP growth would have been 0.3 per cent faster both this year and next
had a Republican minority in the Senate not blocked a planned short-term
fiscal stimulus earlier this year.
The 2 per cent growth forecast is consistent with a modest acceleration of
economic growth in the second half to an annual rate of close to 3 per cent.
The revisions to White House projections mirror similar adjustments by
private-sector forecasters: the consensus 'Blue Chip' forecast is for growth
of 2.3 per cent this year.
The administration's new estimates, however, do not take account of
substantial upward revisions to GDP between 1990 and 1992 announced this
week.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Kohl moves to dispel fears on farm accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday moved to dispel fears that Germany might
back French demands for a renegotiation of the Blair House EC-US accord on
farm trade when he met Mr Peter Sutherland, general secretary of Gatt in
Bonn.
'The German position regarding Blair House is unchanged,' Mr Kohl said in a
statement after the meeting.
'Nothing I have heard reflects that there is a repudiation of Blair House
from Germany,' Mr Sutherland added.
Mr Sutherland stressed clarity was urgently needed in the EC so that trade
talks in Geneva would not be stalled and that a successful conclusion could
be reached by December 15.
In Brussels, the European Commission yesterday repeated its unanimous
support for the Blair House agreement.
At its first weekly meeting after the summer break, the Commission ruled out
any possibility of a renegotiation.
Though some commissioners made clear that there could no longer be any
ambivalence over the farm trade agreement if a Uruguay Round settlement was
to be reached, other officials were more circumspect on France's possible
new demands, and Germany's apparent support for them.
Mr Sutherland issued his warning as the chancellor reiterated that French
resistance to the farm accord had to be overcome in order to reach a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks.
'Difficult and complicated negotiations can only be concluded successfully
if all participants are fundamentally ready to compromise,' the chancellor's
statement said.
'The important thing is that this accord should be in line with the reform
of the EC Common Agricultural Policy agreed in May 1992.
'The EC Commission as the leader of the negotiations assumes that this is,'
the statement added.
Senior government officials said Germany would continue to hear out French
objections to Blair House in a process which started yesterday as top
officials from the chancellor's office, the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the
Agricultural Ministry met their counterparts in Paris.
However, they emphasised that they were seeking a compromise which
represented a viable solution for the French and did not jeopardise the
Blair House agreement.
According to officials in the Agriculture Ministry, French proposals for
changes to the Blair House agreement, which have circulated since last
Friday between Bonn and Paris, could be met without full renegotiation of
the accord with the US.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday unveiled its plan for a tougher European Community policy
against unfair commercial practices, which has become one of Paris's
priorities in the Gatt world trade negotiations.
France is proposing that Europe should imitate the US in instituting
speedier and more automatic anti-dumping investigations and in aggressively
retaliating against unfair trade practices, including those of the US,
partly as a means of getting Washington and other Gatt partners to give Gatt
greater powers to police world commerce.
In the four-page memo which it has sent EC partners, France proposes the EC
executive should be allowed more leeway to investigate European industry's
complaints about dumped or subsidised imports and to impose punitive duties.
Specifically, it backs a Commission plan which would make it harder for EC
governments to stop the EC executive imposing dumping duties or safeguard
restrictions against imports.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister, cited a recent
EC-US trade liberalisation deal in heavy electrical equipment, re-opening of
talks on Japanese car imports into Europe, and recent curbs on imports of
Russian aluminium and East European steel to show the EC could flex its
commercial muscles.
Yesterday saw the arrival of German officials in Paris to discuss France's
ideas about refashioning the draft US-EC farm agreement. Mr Alain Juppe,
foreign minister, said the two countries positions 'are not yet harmonised'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Chicago back-room operator to sell Nafta -
Laurie Morse on a Daley drafted in to lead ratification drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get
his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in
international trade arenas. But he comes to Washington well prepared for the
kind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a
divided Congress to pass it.
William Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago's mayor
Richard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine 'Boss',
the late Richard J Daley. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,
45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with
important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised
labour. He has never run for political office.
Mr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet
position and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton's chief negotiator at
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
He chaired Mr Clinton's election campaign in Illinois, where he delivered 48
per cent of the vote to Clinton, above the national average, and continues
as a tangible supporter. Most recently, he arranged a posh Chicago dinner
for the president that raised Dollars 1m (Pounds 670,000).
However, Mr Daley's appointment to chair the White House's task force on the
North America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent
polls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support
Nafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.
Mr Clinton himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under
George Bush's administration, until side agreements dealing with
environmental and labour issues were reached last month. Many Democrats in
Congress, including some in the powerful Illinois delegation, are
uncommitted. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by
January 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and
visible.
Mr Daley was chosen for the job, Chicago observers say, because he has
proven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a
controversial battle. 'Bill Daley is no Washington neophyte. Clinton needs
someone with political sense to move this thing through Congress, and Daley
has the connections,' says a fellow Washington lobbyist.
Opposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a
potential political pothole for Mr Clinton. Mr Daley's talents have been
summoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the
agreement.
The president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta. The
administration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement. Clinton
ally and fellow Chicago Democrat, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
ways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his
committee. However, Mr Rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use
of his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.
By rough count, Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic
representatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement:
those along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer
product, or manufacturing export interests.
His Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the
public tactics of Nafta's most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot. Mr Perot's
populist anti-Nafta campaign touts the 'giant sucking sound' that will be
heard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border.
'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,' says Chicago political
commentator Mr Bruce DuMont. 'Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber. You may
not see him, but you'll see the results.'
Mr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead the
Nafta push. He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint as
president of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, which was founded by the
Amalgamated Textile Workers union in 1922. Although it passed into private
ownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile union
officials.
Mr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley's union ties to help the Nafta effort.
However, Mr Daley, by pushing Nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union
supporters. Mr Jim Jontz, former congressman from Indiana and director of
the anti-Nafta Citizen's Trade Campaign, said: 'I don't know why Bill Daley
would want to be in a position like that. It's just wrong.'

EASTMAN KODAK, the US film company, has filed an anti-dumping petition
against Japanese photo product makers for allegedly selling colour
photographic paper in the US at prices below those in their domestic market.
Kodak said that Japanese manufacturers of these products were selling paper
for colour prints at dumping margins of up to 300 per cent. The company
condemned the Japanese action as 'an illegal trade practice'.
The companies cited include Fuji Photo Film and its Dutch subsidiary,
Konica, Oriental Photo Industrial and Mitsubishi Paper Mills.
Japanese photographic product makers have been expanding in the US, which
has become their second largest market in the world after Japan. While Fuji
has taken about 10 per cent of the US market for colour film, it has about
50 per cent of the Japanese market. Kodak, which has been in the Japanese
market for over a decade, has often complained that the Japanese film market
is dominated by Japanese makers and closed to outsiders.
Fuji said yesterday that since it had not received a copy of the petition
yet it did not know what prices Kodak was referring to in its claim of
dumping by the Japanese company. Colour negative photographic paper is sold
to wholesalers and labs, which charge for the prints that are made with the
photographic paper.
Konica said that it was not exporting photographic paper to the US any more
since it had a manufacturing plant there which met demand for the North
American market.
Kodak's charge follows claims of dumping against Japanese steelmakers
recently, claims against carmakers earlier this year which did not lead to
formal charges, as well as a formal anti-dumping petition against
Japanese-made defrosters in February and against steel products in May.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Rabin's gambit dishes the Israeli right: The opposition has
little chance of defeating the peace moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S right-wing political parties and hardline Zionists appear unable to
block the Palestinian peace plan and seem increasingly marginalised by the
government's gambit.
Although the right-wing retains considerable support in Israel and an
ability to mount unruly protests, the way the peace plan has been framed -
granting minimal concessions to Palestinians - has ensured its broad
acceptance.
Furthermore, the threat of violent resistance to the agreement from a
minority is, so far, not being taken seriously in a country which prides
itself on its democratic traditions and its abhorrence of intra-Jewish
violence. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said yesterday: 'Israel is
a democratic country. None of us is afraid in the slightest of people who do
not respect the democratic system.'
For the moment, the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, retains a comfortable
majority both in the parliament and in the nation. He has successfully
argued that, by leaving the 120,000 Israeli settlers in the occupied
territories untouched, by maintaining Israel's control of occupied Arab east
Jerusalem and by guaranteeing no let-up on security, the peace plan costs
Israel little. So far the Israeli public has endorsed the plan. The only
poll conducted has shown 53 per cent in favour.
Once again Mr Rabin, a general-turned-politician, has dished the opposition.
He has always argued that Israel could only negotiate from strength and that
the Israeli public would only swallow a peace agreement if they were certain
their government would protect their security.
Since he was elected last June the 71-year-old prime minister has stolen the
security issue from the right-wing opposition Likud party and won
considerable respect from Israelis for acting tough. Last December he
deported 400 Islamic fundamentalists. In March he sealed off the occupied
territories after a wave of stabbings by Palestinians and in July he mounted
a devastating seven-day bombardment against Lebanese civilians in
retaliation for attacks by Arab guerrillas from Lebanon.
Since the peace agreement emerged, the right-wing, led by Likud, has
restrained itself to inflammatory accusations of betrayal by Mr Rabin and
calls for fresh elections but they look more like spoilers in a sideshow
than a real force of opposition.
Mr Rabin has flatly ruled out any new poll saying his election victory last
June gave him a sufficient popular mandate for peace.
The prime minister has received support from unlikely sources such as the
right-wing Jerusalem Post.
The Israeli right fears a strengthening of the PLO, long branded a terrorist
organisation bent on the destruction of the Jewish state; the use of a
Palestinian entity as a springboard for attacks against Israel and a civil
war among Palestinians. Most Israelis share these concerns but seem ready to
take a risk for peace.
In the Knesset debate on the agreement, Mr Peres accused the opposition of
being 'yesterday's men' and said: 'The world has changed completely and only
you haven't realised it.'
Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader, has recognised the problem the
right is facing in its battle to defeat the plan. Although he has raised the
prospect of the agreement leading to war with Palestinian militants he said:
'We will work within all legitimate means of the opposition to stop this
harmful process to the future of Israel. We will do it in the Knesset and we
will do it in the street.'
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, has also threatened to
lead the nation 'against the breaking up of our country. The government will
not have a single quiet day until this treacherous plan is cancelled,' he
said.
But so far the nation has not risen up with the right. A demonstration on
Monday night attracted a couple of thousand protesters. In another opinion
poll of Jewish settlers, only 2 per cent said they would consider violent
resistance to the peace agreement.
Inside the cabinet the peace plan was passed by 16 votes to two. Although Mr
Rabin is facing a coalition crisis following charges of fraud brought
against two members of the ultra-religious Shas party, most Labour MPs
believe that even if the two ministers resign, Shas will stay in the
coalition or, at the very least, continue to support the government from the
back benches.
Inside parliament, Mr Rabin can count on a 67-53 peace majority composed of
Labour (44), the left-wing Meretz bloc (12), Shas (6) and Arab MPs (5). The
prime minister, however, sensitive to Jewish concerns about a peace deal
dependent on the votes of Arabs and left-wingers, is trying to broaden his
support.
Intense negotiations are under way with Agudat Yisrael, an ultra-orthodox
party, which has three MPs.
Many observers believe Agudat Yisrael will support the agreement but will
not join a coalition which includes the left-wing Meretz bloc.
If so Mr Rabin's parliamentary majority will increase to 70-50.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Peres outlines his vision of peace: Veteran Israeli dove
sees new era of co-operation in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister and the man who clinched the
peace agreement with Palestinians in secret talks last week, yesterday
outlined his vision of a revolution in the political and economic geography
of the Middle East.
The 70-year-old veteran politician and long-time Israeli dove spoke at a
press conference of a new era of peace and economic development based on
free trade, open borders, regional integration and mutual respect.
Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, for assistance for the Palestinians, said the region
could now slash its Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.7bn) a year arms expenditure and
develop an Arab-Israeli alliance against extremists on both sides.
He promised Israel would assist Palestinians and help raise foreign capital
for a Palestinian entity.
Mr Peres has always been ahead of public opinion on the peace process and it
is by no means certain that he speaks officially for the government. But he
does represent broadly the centre-left of Israeli politics and, in
particular, the maj-ority of the Labour movement.
He said it was in Israel's interests to end the suffering of Palestinians
economically, politically and psychologically. 'There is nothing better for
Israel than a good neighbour,' he said.
'Today the Middle East is divided into two parts more than Arabs and
Israelis. It is between people who support peace and people who want to kill
peace.
'I think the time has come to make a coalition of all parties who support
peace in order to prevent and combat those forces that want to assassinate
peace,' he said.
On arms expenditure and foreign aid, Mr Peres said the Middle East needed
not more money but a different structure.
'To be honest we are spending Dollars 50bn a year on the arms race. What
for? How dare we go and ask other nations to contribute to the Middle East
before we ourselves take our own affairs seriously. We have to correct our
mistakes and once we correct them I am sure the rest of the world will
support gladly the creation of a productive and serious peaceful Middle
East.'
He said Israel had agreed an agenda for peace with Jordan and, in the most
recent meetings, the two sides had dealt with only trivial issues 'like to
whom should the mosquitoes and flies ask for a visa to fly over from Akaba
to Eilat. We were left without subjects but for mosquitoes and flies. We can
sign tomorrow.'
The Israeli foreign minister said there was no reason why Arab nations
should not adopt normal diplomatic relations with Israel and lift their
economic boycott.
He likened an accord with the PLO on mutual recognition to the French
recognition of the Algerian FLN. 'When the FLN became a political party the
government opened a dialogue. This is the best comparison to our approach. .
. the moment the PLO becomes a political party there will no longer be a
problem.'

FT  02 SEP 93 / Japan moves on economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S new government has proposed 60 economic deregulation measures in the
first step of a broad campaign to curb costly anti-competitive practices.
The outline measures paved the way for deep reforms in Japan's economic
structure, although the short-term impact would be unclear until the
government published full details towards the end of the month, analysts
said in Tokyo.
The package could, in the long term, reduce market restrictions to foreign
companies and bring a widespread fall in prices and increased consumer
demand, they said.
This will be an important test of promises by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new
prime minister, to shake up the Japanese system. It will be followed closely
by the US, keen to see evidence of attempts to raise import demand.
The plans include cuts in gas and electricity rates of most benefit to
industrial users, easing of controls on the construction of big discount
stores, fewer curbs on discount drinks retailers, the opening of satellite
broadcasting to foreign competition and the deregulation of mobile telephone
sales.
The package proposes an end to the minimum production ceiling for brewers,
which would eventually open the oligopoly of four Japanese brewers which has
controlled the Japanese beer market for the past 30 years.
The measures were agreed in principle at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday
evening, for detailed publication before the end of this month. Half the
measures would be implemented before the end of March 1994, but around 10
required legislation, said government officials.
However, this is not the first time that such proposals have been made and
they are strongly opposed by powerful industry groups. But the government is
confident the plans will be realised. In this, it would be helped by the
powerful Ministry of Finance in its eagerness to promote deregulation to
deflect pressure for an income tax cut, said analysts.

FT  02 SEP 93 / PLO meets to discuss terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, was last night meeting his executive
committee to take one of the most decisive steps in the organisation's
history: signing a document which commits the PLO to recognising Israel and
giving up its armed struggle against the Jewish state.
In Jerusalem Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said Israel objected to 15
of the 33 clauses of the Palestinian National Covenant, the PLO founding
charter, which call directly or indirectly for the destruction of Israel.
Mr Peres said a document on mutual recognition was ready to be signed if the
PLO pledged itself to four conditions:
The PLO must issue a communique that all those items calling for the
destruction of Israel are now invalid.
The PLO must make a clear announcement of its complete rejection of violence
and 'terrorism' and declare that all disputes will be settled by peaceful
negotiation.
The PLO must recognise 'loudly and clearly' the right of Israel to exist in
peace and security.
The PLO must commit itself to UN resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for
future negotiations.
Mr Peres said Israel was not demanding that the PLO give up its demands for
the repatriation and compensation of Palestinians displaced when Israel was
founded in 1948.
PLO rules require that the charter can only be amended with a two-thirds
majority of the Palestine National Council - the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile. But Mr Peres said Israel would be satisfied with an
unambiguous document signed by the PLO.

FT  02 SEP 93 / HK investors warm to mainland cooling: With market reforms
on course, austerity measures are not being seen as a threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE source of two thirds of all foreign investment in mainland China,
Hong Kong is closely watching Chinese vice-premier Zhu Rongji's moves to
rein in an over-heating economy. But while the colony's businesses may be
toning down publicity of their mainland investments, few are toning down the
projects themselves.
The main concern for Hong Kong investors is not so much the state of China's
economy, but the state of its reform programme. With Mr Zhu's reformist
rhetoric continuing, confidence has returned and China deals are being be
signed rather than cancelled.
Mr Edward Cheng, director of Wharf Holdings - a company with a number of
significant China investments - admits that the austerity measures will take
their toll on Hong Kong businessmen. 'But,' he argues, 'those who will be
affected are the short-term speculators. For the long-term investors the
slow-down will create genuine opportunities.'
According to Credit Lyonnais Securities, Hong Kong listed companies have
'committed' to China investments worth a total of HKDollars 86bn (Pounds
7.4bn), primarily in infrastructure, property, manufacturing, leisure and
retailing.
The retailers and property developers would be the obvious casualties of a
collapse in the yuan, the Chinese currency, and of an austerity programme
which focuses on eradicating property and stock speculation. But few appear
particularly apprehensive.
Mr Anthony Nightingale, managing director of Jardine International Motors,
whose associate company owns the Mercedes franchise for southern China,
confidently predicted that sales would 'more than double' this year. The
company sells mainly top range models to Chinese joint venture companies, at
HKDollars 500,000 before tax.
The Mercedes has become the ultimate status symbol for southern China's
born-again capitalists, many of them the speculators or corrupt officials Mr
Zhu wants to bring under control. So far the evidence is not of an excess of
austerity.
Mr Dickson Poon, who recently set out to bring his range of luxury brand
names to the Chinese, said his strategy had remained unchanged. His company,
Dickson Concepts, is investing HKDollars 400m in setting up both stores and
a manufacturing capability in China. 'Since our opening (in May) we have
experienced extremely stable sales. There has been no negative impact on the
sales side since the announcement of the austerity programme,' he said.
By March 1993 Dickson Concepts will have opened 30 fashion boutiques, two
fashion stores, and 10 luxury watch outlets in China, selling a wide range
of brand name products, from Charles Jourdan to Rolex.
However, 90 per cent of these products will be manufactured in China, which
reduces both costs and currency risk. Mr Poon said he was convinced the
long-term investors would reap significant rewards.
Retailers focusing on imported goods have been harder hit because of
escalating costs and the impact of currency depreciation. But as one
merchant banker commented: 'Retailers were paying a fraction of the labour
and land costs of Hong Kong, but charging double the prices for the product.
It could never last.'
Nor, it seems, could the spiralling in southern Chinese property prices,
which was chiefly the result of mainland and Hong Kong speculators, rather
than any build-up in demand.
The austerity plan focuses on rechannelling existing financial resources
from property speculation back into more productive activities. A recent
study by property consultancy CY Leung indicates that this has already taken
its toll, with residential property prices falling 29 per cent this year in
Hong Kong's border city of Shenzhen.
For the smaller players the austerity programme could be a chastening
experience. Mr William Cheng, managing director of listed property developer
Shun Ho Construction, said: 'From an investor's point of view, we are
currently faced with an artificially propped up currency and a situation
where the rules could all have changed by next year. Investors are going to
wait.'
The more substantial property developers, however, have always played a
long-term game. Mr Peter Churchouse, research director at Morgan Stanley,
said: 'What the big developers have been saying is, let's get a foot in the
door and see how this market works. These companies have played the game
very well, tactically.'
Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok has pulled out of a HKDollars 3bn commercial
development in Beijing and New World Development cancelled an investment in
the re-development of a Beijing department store.
However, both withdrawals resulted from disagreements with the joint venture
partners rather than concerns over the state of the market; other Hong Kong
companies are considering the two projects.
The larger Hong Kong investors have concentrated on building up cheap
supplies of land in core areas within the main cities, and their initial
financial commitment remains small. The other primary focus has been basic
infrastructural projects, such as power stations, roads and ports, where the
costs are higher, but the demand is irrefutable.
A Baring Securities report on 59 of the largest listed companies in Hong
Kong calculated that an average of only 2 per cent of their total assets
were in China and only 3 per cent of pre-tax profit was derived from there.
A more salient concern for most investors is the knock-on effects of the
austerity programme on assets within Hong Kong. There could be a significant
impact on the colony's role as a service centre for China's trade and
manufacturing, combined with the effects of an outflow of Chinese capital -
as much as HKDollars 50bn is estimated to have flowed into Hong Kong's
property market during the past 18 months.
If Mr Zhu achieves his soft landing for the mainland economy, Hong Kong's
pioneering China investors should flourish. But if he fails, they will not
be alone in facing the consequences.

<TEXT>
CHINA has begun throwing open its top bureaucratic jobs to competition as
part of an overall reform of what the Chinese call their 'cadre employment
system'.
The State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, an important government
'think tank', is seeking applications for the position of director of one of
its affiliated research institutes.
This is the first time a central government agency has sought to fill the
director's position by open examination, according to the China Business
Times newspaper.
More and more senior cadres will be selected through public examination and
competition, instead of appointment from higher authorities, the paper
reported.
Applicants for the research institute job will be required to take a written
exam and undergo an oral test before qualifying for a one-year probation.
Appointments to senior jobs in a sprawling and opaque bureaucracy have
generally relied on a system of patronage and 'back door' deals rather than
merit.
China recently announced that it would reduce its 10m-strong bureaucracy by
about 25 per cent. It has also begun streamlining its bureaucratic
superstructure, getting rid of a number of specialised departments and 'ad
hoc' organisations under the State Council, or cabinet.
At the recent National Political Congress, or parliament, ministries,
commissions and other organisations under the State Council were cut from 86
to 59 in an effort to deal with problems of duplication.

FT  02 SEP 93 / India cuts interest rates again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIA yesterday cut interest rates in an attempt to reverse a two-year
slowdown in economic growth.
The government believes that, without more signs of growth, Indians could
become disenchanted with its programme to modernise and open up the economy.
Industrialists last night welcomed the interest rate cuts but said the
government would have to do more to stimulate the economy.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, cut the commercial banks'
minimum lending rate by one percentage point to 15 per cent and the maximum
deposit rate by the same margin to 10 per cent. They were the fourth cuts
since the central bank started easing rates from a peak of 19 per cent last
autumn.
The reductions are designed to promote steady growth following a sharp
monetary squeeze in 1991-92, when rates were raised to curb inflation and to
help defuse a balance of payments crisis by choking off demand for imports.
Inflation has since fallen from a peak of 16.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent and
the country's balance of payments position has improved markedly thanks to a
recovery in exports and an inflow of savings from Indians living abroad.
Foreign exchange reserves have soared fourfold to Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds
4.86bn).
The reserve bank had signalled its intention to cut interest rates in
mid-October but brought forward the reduction because of slack demand for
funds from industry.
Industrialists are responding to the government's economic reforms with
corporate restructuring, talks with potential foreign partners and the
announcement of investment plans. But they have so far been reluctant to
commit themselves to spending money.
Growth in industrial output could fall short of the government's forecast of
6-7 per cent for the year to the end of March next year because demand for
steel, machinery and other capital goods is still weak, despite export
growth in some industries, notably textiles. Exports in the first three
months of the financial year rose 27 per cent.
The Confederation of Indian Industry argues that minimum lending rates
should be no more than 3 per cent above the rate of inflation, or about 9-10
per cent. This would be difficult to achieve without extensive financial
reform, including abolition of rules which force banks to direct cheap
credit to priority borrowers such as state industry.
Also, the government is struggling to control its own borrowing. It promised
to cut the fiscal deficit from 6.5 per cent in 1991-92 to 5 per cent last
year and 4 per cent in 1993-94. In fact, last year's figure was 5.7 per
cent.

ATTEMPTS by the German government to stem the rise in unemployment are
limited, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Bonn wants to curb the widening budget deficit, and at the same time make
German industry more competitive. The former demands cuts in social
spending, the latter requires higher productivity with a leaner work force.
To achieve both, Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, unveiled two
draft laws in August designed to cut social spending in western Germany. The
package, spread over three years, would reduce spending by DM77bn (Pounds
30.8bn). Unemployment benefits are included in these cuts. For instance, for
those with dependents, unemployment benefit and social security payments
will be reduced to 55 per cent of the employee's last net pay. Those without
dependents will in future receive 53 per cent.
Any attempt to reduce the growing levels of unemployment in eastern Germany
is hampered by high wage levels, despite continuing low levels of
productivity.
FRANCE
A FIVE-YEAR jobs plan unveiled by France this month reveals the dilemma
facing the government of Mr Edouard Balladur as it tries to contain the rise
of unemployment while leaving social security and worker protection intact,
writes John Ridding in Paris.
The government's proposals are now being discussed with trade unions and
will go before parliament next month.
At the heart of the plan is a series of measures to increase the incentives
for employers to hire workers and increase the flexibility of the rigid
French labour market. The principal proposals include: the transfer of
social security payments from companies to the state for workers paid up to
1.5 times the minimum salary of FFr5,880 (Pounds 677); the replacement of
the 39-hour working week with an equivalent annual total, designed to
increase the flexibility of production while reducing overtime costs; The
increase in the number of tax-deductible hours that part-time employees can
work; the decentralisation of the management of training and apprentice
schemes and tax incentives for employers to participate in these schemes.
BRITAIN
THE British government believes the best way to cut unemployment is through
reducing the cost burdens on business through deregulation, writes Robert
Taylor. But it also runs programmes to reduce the jobless total. These
include a business start-up scheme to help the unemployed to start
businesses with training and financial advice and community action linked to
unemployment benefit.
ITALY
THE Italian government last week took it first step to combat unemployment
by accelerating spending on a stream of public works projects, writes Haig
Simonian in Milan. Foremost is Italy's ambitious L23,800bn (Pounds 10bn)
high-speed train network, due to link the country's biggest cities in the
next six years.
Spending for a variety of other transport projects has also been
accelerated. The conventional railways will receive about L5,000bn a year
for the next two years, while about L7,500bn will go on upgrading motorways
over five years. Money is also destined for various public building
projects.
SPAIN
JOBS currently being lost in Spain are those created under relatively new
laws allowing employers to hire people on temporary contracts, writes Peter
Bruce in Madrid. Under the Francoist labour system, inherited by Spain's
democratic rulers, people already in jobs were guaranteed them for life - a
strong disincentive to the creation of new jobs which the Socialist
government tried to redress by introducing temporary jobs contracts in the
mid-1980s.
Roughly 1m jobs were created using these contracts, especially during the
economic boom triggered by Spain's admission to the EC in 1986. Being the
most vulnerable, however, they have been the worst affected by the current
recession. While the government does have a number of old job creation
schemes in place - primarily one which pays employers a subsidy for hiring
apprentices on short contracts - it has not responded to the current crisis
with new incentives.
NORWAY
THE Norwegian government last week announced plans to introduce a package of
measures, valued at an estimated NKr600m (Pounds 55m), to create jobs, boost
the competitiveness of industry and increase non-oil exports, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
Since 1990 the government has reduced industry taxes and tariffs by an
estimated NKr8bn and is planning a large-scale transport infrastructure
investment programme during 1994-97, which it claims will reduce the annual
transport costs of industry by NKr17bn, besides creating new jobs.
DENMARK
THE Danish government expects to 'break the unemployment curve', as the
prime minister, Mr Poulf Nyrup Rasmussen, puts it, through an
unprecedentedly expansive fiscal policy, including substantial income tax
cuts, in 1994-95, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. It has backed the
fiscal policy up with labour market reforms which are designed to increase
flexibility and prevent a resurgence of inflation once demand recovers.
FINLAND
UNEMPLOYMENT in Finland has reached a level that was unimaginable even two
years ago for a country that traditionally prided itself on being a model
welfare state, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The Finnish government has faced intense union opposition to a scheme
allowing employers to pay jobless youths 30 per cent below minimum levels.
In any case, the country's employers have so far proved reluctant to take
advantage of this freedom.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Europe - The Jobs Crisis: Unemployment in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's unemployment rate is heading for post-war highs, with the OECD
forecasting that it will hit 12 per cent next year. In response governments
are unveiling jobs initiatives in part familiar and in part radical, with
policy-makers no longer able to rely on economic growth, FT writers report.
ACROSS EUROPE more than 22m people are out of work. Employers are cutting
jobs by the tens of thousands, propelling unemployment towards post-war
highs.
By next year, the rate in Europe* will touch 12 per cent against a previous
high of 11.2 per cent in 1986, the OECD says.
In recent weeks, several governments have unveiled policy initiatives to
tackle the crisis. Some are familiar from earlier waves of high
unemployment. Italy, Norway and Denmark, for example, are bringing forward
spending on public infrastructure, with the primary aim of employing
construction workers. But there is much that is new in both the nature of
the problem and the responses to it.
Policy-makers in the 1990s are being forced to seek radical solutions at a
time when there is little evidence they can rely on economic growth, as in
the past, to reduce unemployment significantly.
'In most European countries, the proceeds of economic growth in the past 20
years have essentially been appropriated by those who have remained in
employment. The unemployed have been excluded,' says Professor Paul Ormerod
of the University of Manchester.
In Spain, the economy virtually doubled in size in real terms between 1970
and 1992 but employment fell by 2 per cent in the same period, Prof Ormerod
points out.
Other European economies have shown similar trends. According to the
professor, the growth in output and employment from 1970 to 1992 was
respectively: Germany, 70 per cent and 8 per cent; France 75 and 7; Italy,
84 and 8; Britain, 52 and 3.
How are policy-makers responding? In much of continental Europe and at the
European Commission there is a growing awareness that a new balance needs to
be struck between regulation which protects securely employed 'insiders' and
deregulation in favour of the unemployed 'outsiders'.
European Commission officials and governments in countries such as France
and Spain stress that this does not mean the abandonment of worker
protection. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, says his
government will not use the recession as an excuse to destroy France's
system of social protection. But governments and EC officials are examining
ways in which distributional goals can be achieved which minimise negative
effects on employment.
One way this can be done is by reducing the cost of employment by switching
some non-wage labour costs from employers to the state. France, Norway and
Belgium have recently chosen this path. Several governments - Spain, Italy
and Germany - are also involved in varied attempts to limit pay rises in the
hope that pay restraint will create jobs.
More radically, some countries such as Spain and Italy are trying
substantially to increase labour market flexibility. That means, for
example, making it far easier to sack workers, many of whom have in effect a
job for life. In Spain it looks as if a compromise might be possible which
involves reducing the cost of sacking established workers in return for
tougher restrictions on the use of temporary contract workers.
But throughout Europe, with the exception of the UK, labour market reform to
improve employment will not be imposed by governments but will be negotiated
through the established institutions of social partnership.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Inflation up slightly in Italy during August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S inflation rate rose by 0.1 per cent in August, the lowest monthly
increase since 1986. The figure suggests that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's
government will be able to meet its target of an annualised rate of 4.5 per
cent this year.
Last week Confindustria, the industrialists' association, maintained that
the annualised rate at the year-end could even be lower than envisaged by
the government. But a recent report from Salomon Brothers was more cautious,
predicting a rate of 5 per cent, reflecting in large measure the continued
impact of devaluation.
The August figure reflects the depressed state of the economy. Normally in
August restaurants, bars and hotels as well as food shops tend to raise
prices. This year prices have either been held or reduced.
According to a report released yesterday, restaurants saw their custom fall
by 30 per cent last month and 13 per cent lowered their prices. At the same
time many stores discounted goods in sales.
The other important factor in gradually pulling Italy's inflation rate into
line with that of its main EC partners is that pay lags inflation by as much
as 2 percentage points.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French constitution may have to be amended to strengthen controls
against political asylum-seekers, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister,
said yesterday.
But in an attempt to defuse a potentially damaging dispute with Mr Francois
Mitterrand, the Socialist president, Mr Balladur, a conservative, said he
favoured a minor revision of the constitution through parliament, rather
than a national referendum on the issue. He said a final decision would be
taken following further talks with Mr Mitterrand.
Pressure to revise the constitution was triggered by a ruling last month
from France's constitutional council.
The council struck out elements of a tough new anti-immigration law drawn up
by Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, and said that asylum-seekers
had to be guaranteed the right to apply for refuge in France and to appeal
against rejections from other European Community states.
Mr Pasqua, who argues the freedom of movement in the EC would prompt a flood
of asylum-seekers into France, has called for a revision of the constitution
to prevent such an outcome. But President Mitterrand, seeking to protect the
rights of political refugees, has resisted constitutional reform.
Mr Balladur, faced with a serious challenge to the harmonious 'cohabitation'
he has enjoyed with Mr Mitterrand since taking office in March, has sought a
compromise solution,
There are currently about 4m legal immigrants in France and an estimated 1m
illegal immigrants. Economic recession and the influx of emigres from
eastern Europe have heightened concerns on the issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community must accept the need for policy changes to
accommodate the proposed accession of the three Nordic applicants, Finland,
Norway and Sweden, Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, said yesterday.
Spelling out Helsinki's position ahead of what will be the toughest phase
during the autumn of the simultaneous accession talks between Brussels and
the three, Mr Aho said the climatic and geographic conditions of the region
warranted financial support for sectors such as agriculture.
'We cannot change the climate. The main question is whether we are able to
get such support which creates even rules for competition for Finnish
farmers and farm industries,' he said.
Officials said position papers approved this week by Mr Aho's centre-right
government, which will be put to Brussels as early as today, demanded EC
subsidies for Finnish farmers worth FM3.5bn (Pounds 407m) a year, with a
further FM3.5bn coming from the Finnish government. They also call for the
maintenance for a transitional period of trade barriers to protect the
Finnish food processing industry and EC aid for remote Arctic and sub-Arctic
regions.
The EC has signalled sympathy for the special needs of the Arctic regions,
but has yet to show its hand on the question of new subsidies, particularly
given the severe constraints on its budgets.
'That is the problem, maybe, inside the Community. It means that they have
to accept, in a way, new policies -a new approach - like they did when
Portugal and Spain joined. Then it was the southern approach. Now it is a
question of the northern approach,' said Mr Aho in an interview.
'These positions we have presented are based on Community systems so that
Community logic is the basis of our demands,' he said. Negotiations with
Finland have been considered the least difficult of the three sets of Nordic
accession talks (negotiations are also under way with Austria) as public
feeling remains hostile to the EC in Sweden and especially Norway. But
opinion is still finely balanced in Finland and Mr Aho, whose party is split
on the issue, is anxious to drive as hard a bargain as possible with
Brussels to ensure victory in a referendum promised before scheduled
accession in 1995.
He also clearly believes the recent crises within the community on the
Maastricht treaty and on currency co-operation have increased the EC's need
to score a success in the enlargement talks, thus strengthening the Nordic
countries' bargaining positions. 'If the Community is not able to reach its
goals in this field, I think somebody is going to ask what is going to
happen to the Community,' he said.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Swedes find hard times far from over: The biggest problems
are still very much there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as the Swedes were beginning to believe the worst was behind them in
the country's deepest recession since the 1930s, a leaked report last week
from the International Monetary Fund highlighting the dire state of the
public finances came as a painful warning that the hard times are far from
over.
Rising exports - boosted by last year's big devaluation of the Swedish krona
 -improving industrial profitability and tumbling interest rates had
combined over the summer to produce a conviction that the economy had at
last touched bottom after more than two years of decline. The stock market
boomed through the spring and summer and all the forecasts were of a return
to growth, albeit modest, by 1994.
The consensus that the economy will expand by around 1.5 per cent next year,
after three years in which it will have shrunk by nearly 5 per cent, has not
changed. But the IMF report provided a stern reminder of how far Sweden
still has to go in the struggle for sustained recovery.
'People are longing for good news and there is some,' commented Mr Hubert
Fromlet, chief economist at Swedbank. 'But we shouldn't over-estimate the
good news. We still have a lot to do.'
Two deeply entrenched problems - unemployment and the yawning budget deficit
 -still loom ominously over the economy. Tackling them means confronting the
issue of how much further Sweden must go in reforming its famously extensive
welfare and social security structures.
The IMF report, according to newspaper reports that have not been denied, in
effect called for much greater dismemberment of the 'Swedish model'. It
criticised the level of public spending for having 'weakened incentives to
work and to save', created 'a cripplingly high level of overall taxation'
and produced a 'public sector deficit that dwarfs those in other industrial
countries'.
It said the government's plan to cut SKr10bn (Pounds 833m) in spending and
bring the deficit down from what it estimated to be more than 16 per cent of
gross domestic product (higher than other estimates) now, to 4.3 per cent in
1988 was inadequate. It said cuts should be doubled to SKr20bn a year.
Prime minister Carl Bildt's centre-right government was not much out of
sympathy with the thrust of the IMF criticism. It came to power in 1991
committed to stripping back the state's role in the economy and cutting
taxes. But the depth of the recession - and especially an unprecedented real
jobless rate of 13 per cent of the labour force - has limited its options.
The fear is that too hard a fiscal squeeze could jeopardise the return to
economic growth. In any case, Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, is
already under fire from the Social Democratic opposition for her medium-term
plan to cut SKr26bn in transfer payments and SKr35bn in public consumption.
With a general election due in September 1994, the government is hoping
conditions will have improved sufficiently by then to head off the Social
Democrats, who have abandoned a consensus approach on the economy and want a
shift towards stimulating consumption, given the low level of inflation.
There are signs of a turnaround. Industrial output bottomed out at the turn
of the year and is set to rise by more than 2 per cent in 1993 as a whole.
Exports are rising sharply, up 15 per cent this year, in large measure due
to a more than 20 per cent depreciation in the Swedish krona since it was
floated last November.
The government can claim that reforms it has enacted - chiefly cuts in
corporate and marginal income taxes made early in its tenure - have helped
create a climate for recovery. But it faces a bleak outlook on what amounts
to the central political issue, unemployment.
The export-oriented sector may be producing and earning more, but it is not
adding significantly to its workforce. The domestic economy is still mired
in recession and is not expected to return to growth at least until late
next year. Unemployment is likely to peak at up to 18 per cent just before
the election.
Government policies are partly responsible. Cuts in public spending and
measures to increase savings, by cutting the tax deductibility of interest
payments, are holding down demand. There is a lag in the stimulation effect
from falling interest rates as households and companies prefer to unwind
debt rather than spend or expand. Private consumption is set to fall by
nearly 4 per cent this year and remain negative next year.
The question is not whether the government will adopt the IMF's way, but
whether it can stick to the more modest path it has set itself. With the
election clock starting to tick, it will be a hard enough road to follow.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Gonzalez attempts to force the pace on pay policy: Spain's
PM has thrown off post-election lethargy and is aiming for an agreement this
month
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the August holiday is stressful for Spaniards. They go quiet,
sleep badly and snap at their friends. The meeting today in Madrid between
the government, unions and employers, to try to negotiate an incomes policy,
promises to be trying.
This is not least because, having done little about Spain's recession since
winning a fourth term in the June 6 general election, Mr Felipe Gonzalez
wants a three-year 'social pact' agreed by September 20, when the draft of
the 1994 budget first gets to parliament.
Agreement on wage moderation has become the centre-piece of his efforts to
pull Spain out of recession and it may also affect his own political
survival. Hasty deals are the stuff of Spanish politics, though, and the
pact the government is looking for - a near freeze on wages and dividends
next year and small rises in 1995 and 1996 - could easily be settled on
time.
Mr Gonzalez needs the deal in place quickly in order to make next year's
deficit-curbing budget look plausible. He has developed a grudging respect
for the market forces which battered the peseta into three devaluations in
the past year and now appreciates the need to match his reputation for
pragmatic policy-making with policies that are actually carried out. Spain
has strayed well beyond its budgeted deficits ever since it joined the
European Community in 1986.
Luckily, the government has had a relatively happy summer. Despite record
21.2 per cent unemployment and the recession, the Madrid stock market has
recovered to levels not seen since before the Gulf war and foreign investors
have been flocking to auctions of government bonds. The peseta has shown
great strength against the D-Mark, despite the loosening of its float.
But this is all based on hopes that Spanish interest rates will fall, and
that will only begin to happen (if the Bank of Spain has its way) if wage
growth slows and the budget holds the public deficit in check.
Neither the unions nor employers have been complimentary about an incomes
policy but, as talks begin, it is going to be hard for either to be spoilers
without being obvious. The government will make concrete proposals: wage
freezes next year in the civil service and public companies and a ceiling of
around 2.5 per cent in the private sector. Companies would be asked to limit
dividends.
Officials insist the government, purged of expansive left-wingers, is going
to be tough. 'We have to stabilise this economy,' says an aide to the new
finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes. 'If we have deficits, they should be the
deficits we budget for.'
By July the public deficit (central government plus social security) was 65
per cent bigger than last year's, worth nearly 6 per cent of gross domestic
product as the recession hit tax revenues and boosted unemployment benefits.
To finance its borrowings, Spain will spend nearly 5 per cent of its GDP
this year just paying interest. Overall, public debt is worth 45 per cent of
GDP now, say officials, and if nothing is done to slow it, that figure would
rise to 60 per cent in just two years.
The main problem is pensions. After a general strike on December 14 1988, Mr
Gonzalez accepted union demands to raise pensions and to widen the jobless
benefit net. State pensions, which accounted for 9 per cent of GDP in 1988,
will account for 11 per cent this year. The state paid Pta2,000bn (Pounds
9.85bn) in pensions in 1982. This year it will pay Pta7,500bn.
The 1994 budget, officials say, will try to hold this year's deficit
constant, but just to stand still the government is being forced to consider
changing the way it calculates pensions and to cut spending on
infrastructure.
The pension debate will be the most bitter. Madrid wants to base state
pension payments on forecast inflation for the year and not, as now, on the
inflation outcome the year before. Madrid's inflation forecasts are
routinely lower than the actual outcome.
Under the control of Mr Solbes, who is not a member of Mr Gonzalez's
Socialist party, the Finance Ministry is anxious to sweep away the
impression left by the former incumbent, Mr Carlos Solchaga, that budget
targets are merely broad guidelines. Mr Solbes wants to hold the public
deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP next year (it will end 1993 at around 5.9 per
cent) and to cut it to 3.5 per cent by 1996.
The ministry is also warning that if wage moderation is not agreed
voluntarily, it will be enforced before the budget debate begins on
September 30.
But does Mr Gonzalez have the stomach for a fight? He now runs a minority
government and is surrounded by smiling allies with long knives up their
sleeves. The sharpest belongs to Mr Jordi Pujol, premier of Catalonia and
leader of the Catalan CiU, without whose support the Socialists could not
survive in parliament in Madrid.
He is highly critical of Madrid in general but has recently been concerned
to extract confirmation from the government that it would honour its
promised to cede to Catalonia the right to spend 15 per cent of the income
taxes the central government raises in the region. Confirmation was quickly
given, probably assuring the budget safe passage.
In choosing how hard to fight to hold down wages, Mr Gonzalez also has to
decide how far to push a series of labour market changes the government has
said it wants in place by next January. These would make it easier and
cheaper for employers to fire workers.
Fortunately for Mr Gonzalez most of his enemies in Spain will once again be
taking his near total silence for weakness, dithering and doubt. This is
potentially a big mistake except that this time the government has
established a clear and measurable short-term recovery programme which,
should it falter even a little, could invite quick retribution from the
markets.

FT  02 SEP 93 / West German industrial production up in July
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial production in west Germany rose a provisional 0.5 per cent in
July.
Manufacturing output rose 1 per cent, more than compensating for a 2.5 per
cent drop in mining and a 3.2 per cent fall in construction, the Economics
Ministry said yesterday.
However, it warned that following an upward revision of the June
month-on-month figures, it expected a downward revision for July.
The region's seasonally-adjusted index of industrial production stood at
111.6 at the end of July, compared with 110.6 in April and the second
quarter average of 111.0.
Aggregate figures for June and July, compared with the April and May total
(a measure considered less subject to short-term distortions) also showed a
0.5 per cent improvement.

BOSNIAN Moslems yesterday scaled back their demands for territorial
concessions in a move which could lay the ground for a possible agreement
between the three warring factions.
Bosnia's president Alija Izetbegovic tabled a proposal that his Moslem
republic should receive an additional 4 per cent of the 28 per cent already
allocated under the proposed partition. Previous Moslem proposals have
demanded at least 10 per cent more land.
The Bosnian Serbs were yesterday reported to have offered the mostly Moslem
Bosnian government full land access to the Moslem enclaves in eastern
Bosnia.
Serbian sources said Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to
give the Moslems a 1.8 mile-wide corridor linking the three enclaves.
But as the negotiations intensified, diplomats warned that the Serb leaders
had repeated that this would be their 'final concession' and the Moslem
delegation threatened to return home if their demands for additional land
were rejected.
'This demand is the minimum of minimums. If they (Serbs and Croats) reject
this, we are going home,' said Mr Mustafa Bijedic, Bosnia's ambassador to
the United Nations in Geneva.
Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a member of the Bosnian delegation, said his side was
demanding that the allocation of land to the Moslems be increased by 2 per
cent in the east and 2.8 in the west in order to improve on the maps which
leave his republic comprising seven isolated pockets.
Mr Izetbegovic is also asking for a land connection to the sea and the
Adriatic port of Neum.
However, citing 'historical' precedent, Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's
president, has rejected Moslem demands on the grounds that giving up Neum
would isolate Dubrovnik, the resort on the southern Dalmatian coast, from
Croat regions.
As the three parties appeared to inch closer to a settlement, Mr Manfred
Worner, Nato secretary general, yesterday met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary general, to discuss the possible deployment of peace-keeping
troops.
In spite of hopes that the discussion might lead to a firm commitment about
the possible deployment of troops in the region, the discussions were held
under a total news blackout.
Nato officials yesterday denied that the silence reflected any political
disagreements. But with many diplomats remaining sceptical that the three
sides will reach a firm agreement quickly, both British and French
diplomatic sources stressed that they would not be prepared to commit any
troops until the there was a workable peace agreement.
Meanwhile, in an effort to broker a ceasefire between the Bosnian and Croat
forces, General Francis Briquemont, UN commander in Sarajevo, yesterday
travelled to Medjugorje to supervise talks between the two commanders.
A four-day ceasefire between the Croat and Moslem forces in Mostar is due to
run out this evening. However, a UN protection force spokesman in Zagreb
confirmed yesterday that there had been skirmishes throughout the day around
Mostar and across central Bosnia.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Yeltsin tells rival he is sacked: Dismissal of
vice-president Rutskoi raises constitutional doubts
</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday ordered the sacking of his
vice-president and most dangerous political challenger, in what his
opponents have dubbed the opening of his 'September offensive' against his
enemies.
The attempt to dismiss Mr Alexander Rutskoi for alleged corruption appears
to be unconstitutional and was declared so by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, leader
of the anti-Yeltsin parliament.
The sacking of the vice-president was 'balanced' by the dismissal of Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister and a Yeltsin ally. However,
Mr Shumeiko announced later that he had been released from his duties at his
own request
Both dismissals were said to be 'temporary', and both derive from alleged
misuse of state funds earmarked for essential imports, allegations about
which have been traded freely between the two men.
They come at a time when the political situation in Russia has deteriorated
into a static confrontation between the various levels of authority - a
situation which threatens to impede economic reform and continued financial
assistance from the west.
Though Mr Yeltsin has a history of avoiding decisive confrontations, the
attempt to dismiss Mr Rutskoi pits him squarely against his opponents and
may herald a new round in the struggle for power between president and
parliament.
Significantly, the move was made the day after Mr Yeltsin inspected the
army's crack Tuman division near Moscow, units of which protected him during
the abortive coup in August 1991.
Both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Shumeiko are under investigation, although Mr Gennady
Ponomaryev, Moscow public prosecutor, told a newspaper yesterday that 'we do
not see a crime' in the evidence presented about Mr Rutskoi. The
vice-president, speaking from northern Russia, said that 'this man (Yeltsin)
has put himself above the fundamental laws of the constitution'.
A statement from the presidential office said the dismissals had been made
'in connection with the harm mutual accusations of corruption by the two men
bring to the state'.
Mr Yeltsin justified his action on the constitution he has vowed to replace.
But none of the clauses cited includes the right to sack his vice-president,
who was elected with him in June 1991.
The dubious constitutional validity of the decree sets Mr Yeltsin directly
against a parliament which sees its main task as defending the existing,
Soviet-era constitution. Mr Mikhail Mityukov, chairman of parliament's
legislative committee, said: 'The president cannot deprive the
vice-president of his status, since they were elected at the same time.'
Mr Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the opposition National Salvation Front,
said: 'This is obviously the first decision in a series of actions combined
under the slogan of 'September offensive' which the president promised us.'
Even Mr Andranik Migranyan, a presidential council member, said the news was
'completely unexpected' and admitted that 'perhaps he does not have the
right to do it'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Western groups to buy more from the east

WESTERN Germany's largest companies plan to double their purchases from
eastern German enterprises by 1995 despite high labour costs and low levels
of productivity in the five new Lander, the Federation of German Industry
announced yesterday.
The project to 'buy east German', launched last February, is aimed at
reviving the region's economy. It is supported by a range of west Germany's
biggest companies, including motor manufacturers and retail and mail-order
chains. Although it is progressing slowly, several purchasing managers from
west Germany said yesterday they would help improve the quality, marketing
and efficiency of goods bought in the east.
When the project was launched purchases of east German goods and services by
western German companies since early 1991 totalled DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn),
against eastern purchases from western Germany amounting to DM174bn. Ms
Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, said this
would reach an annual figure of DM25bn by early 1995.
'There are goods to be bought. This offensive is aimed at integrating the
two economies,' she said yesterday. The long-term effects of the scheme, she
added, would entail transferring crucial 'know-how' and management skills to
the east.
Some companies - Audi, for example - have set up a special east German
section in its purchasing department. Mr Erich Schmitt, a member of Audi's
management board, said the company had already spent DM600m a year on buying
spare parts from eastern Germany. 'The enterprises in the new states have to
know what we want. Despite the high labour costs, there are some advantages.
Since productivity is so low, we can improve the efficiency fairly quickly.
'There is greater scope for more flexibility.
'We have to get it into our heads that eastern Germany is a place which we
must automatically include in our contracts. That demands a change in the
mentality of western German businesses,' he added.

<TEXT>
GERMAN industry is in danger of toppling into a domestic battle with
'everyone against everyone else' as it struggles to master its current costs
crisis, according to Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes-Benz.
Such a clash would be part of the penalty to be paid for managements'
tendency in the past to place too much emphasis on harmony and not enough on
competitiveness, he told journalists. He appealed for a 'constructive
conflict' in which participants would find a path between the extremes of
the traditionally cosy industrial relationships and damaging in-fighting.
Speaking as head of the central pillar of Germany's biggest industrial
concern, Mr Werner clearly marked out Daimler-Benz's position in a
rapidly-intensifying national debate on the country's economic and social
future.
The Bonn cabinet is expected today to approve a government paper on possible
cures for the rigidity of the nation's industrial and social structures, and
what is called its 'growing unwillingness to accept innovation and change'.
While the economy as a whole is burdened with the immense costs of
unification, Germany's export-oriented industry is struggling to adapt to
increased global competition. The motor industry, labouring under a 30 per
cent costs disadvantage against the Japanese, is under unprecedented
pressure.
Mr Werner implicitly rejected the rough-and-ready attempts by some
companies, notably Volkswagen, to force concessions out of suppliers.
He also refused to accept the continuation of the 'inhibiting social comfort
consensus', in which the avoidance of friction between labour and
management, and even between companies, was considered paramount.
But he made plain his belief that the core strengths of the German way of
doing business could be restored to the national advantage. 'It is our job
to reactivate German management culture: a symbiosis of creativity and
efficiency,' he said.
Mercedes itself aimed to improve productivity by 15 per cent next year,
partly by shedding 14,000 jobs. 'Productivity in stagnating markets must be
paid for with jobs,' Mr Werner said.
Hinting at future workforce reductions, he said that in order to remain
competitive, German manufacturers would have to improve productivity by 40
per cent in the next few years.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Newspaper price war stepped up by Murdoch: Times cut to 30p
as News Corp unveils satellite TV expansion package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation last night widened Britain's newspaper
circulation wars by announcing that the price of The Times would be cut by
15p to 30p from next week. The price cut, the biggest of its kind in the
broadsheet market for decades, is aimed at reversing a declining circulation
which is affecting most of Britain's newspapers.
The announcement coincided with Mr Murdoch's launch of a multi-channel
package of satellite television channels in the UK as part of an ambitious
expansion package which includes a German TV deal and an 'open university'
in Asia.
The Times' price cut is likely to herald a period of intense competition
between broadsheet papers. Rivals, such as The Independent and The Daily
Telegraph, will be under pressure to follow suit. In a front-page editorial,
The Independent today appealed for its readers' support, accusing Mr Murdoch
of trying to drive it out of business. But none of the other broadsheets
would comment.
Mr Murdoch's move follows a successful 15p price cut for The Times in Kent
which increased sales by up to 15 per cent and a 5p cut in the 25p cover
price of The Sun, News Corp's leading UK tabloid, this summer. That resulted
in a 300,000 rise in sales.
A 30p Times, News Corp hopes, will take the paper from its current
circulation of about 370,000 to well above 400,000 and into second place in
the broadsheet market behind The Daily Telegraph. The immediate aim is to
win readers from The Independent, which has been going through difficult
times both financially and editorially.
Mr Murdoch's satellite TV package will make 18 channels available to UK
audiences by early next year. They will range in content from home shopping
to children's programmes. Most will be available only by subscription.
At a banquet in London last night to mark the launch of the Sky
Multi-Channels package, Mr Murdoch, News Corp chairman, said the age of the
media mogul was over. 'The consumer is in the saddle, driving the
telecommunications industry.'
He outlined a series of deals designed to ensure that News Corp would be
'part of this process of economic expansion'. They included:
A deal with British Telecom and Cellnet to explore digital 'super highways
of the future' with a 500-home experiment combining access to
telecommunications, TV shows, movies and specialist information.
A deal with Pro 7, the German broadcaster associated with the Kirch
Corporation, to develop pay television in German covering as many as six
channels.
The launch in Asia of a wide range of programming including an Open
University and educational channels using the Star satellite system. News
Corp recently bought control.
The launch of a second satellite sports channel in the UK.
A deal with Televisa of Mexico to produce 500 hours of multilingual popular
drama.
Completing the array of deals, News Corp last week spent Dollars 12m (Pounds
8m) on acquiring a small electronic publishing company, Delphi Internet
Services, which can handle electronic newspapers.
Meanwhile, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, called on the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission to investigate 'News Corporation's penetration of
this country's mass media'.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Swan Hunter loses Pounds 50m order from Oman to French
shipyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for Swan Hunter, the struggling Tyneside warship builder, have
suffered a further blow with the loss of a crucial Omani order to French
competition.
The Cherbourg shipyard, Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, said it
signed a firm contract yesterday to build three large patrol craft for
Oman's navy. The contract, worth about Pounds 50m, is expected to lead to
orders for up to five more vessels of the same type.
CMN also disclosed that it is among the companies which have expressed a
tentative interest in buying Swan Hunter.
The Tyneside shipyard, in receivership since May, was counting on winning
the Omani order to enhance its attractiveness to potential buyers. It now
has no shipbuilding orders on its books beyond the completion of work on
three Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy.
Failure to win the Omani order has set back hopes of selling the company as
a shipbuilder. Union officials said it was likely to cost 100 more jobs from
a workforce of 1,700, already cut by 700 since May.
Joint receiver, Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse, said the news was
'obviously a disappointment' although not unexpected. He indicated that Swan
Hunter was unlikely to win orders of this type until a buyer was found for
the yard. Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development
Corporation, said he feared the lost order would have a 'domino effect'.
CMN, which employs 500 people, is the sole shipbuilding interest of Soffia,
a French-owned construction group. Mr Pierre Belmer, CMN spokesman, said the
company had secured orders for a number of vessels in recent months. CMN had
spare capacity in Cherbourg, but had an expansion-minded management.
Mr Belmer said CMN would be in a position to take a decision on Swan Hunter
at the start of 1994, although any deal would be for part of Swan Hunter,
not for the company at its present size.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Fowler bolsters rightwing hostility totax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTWING hopes of heading off tax increases in the November budget were
boosted yesterday by a declaration of support from Sir Norman Fowler, the
Conservative party chairman, and comments by Mr Eddie George, governor of
the Bank of England.
Mr George said that economic growth would help reduce the Pounds 50bn public
sector deficit. His comments will give comfort to those within the
Conservative party who oppose significant tax rises in the November budget.
'The impact of economic activity on the deficit can be larger than people
allow,' he said, adding that the problem did not need to be resolved 'in one
go'.
Mr George told Securities and Investment Review magazine he could see no
reason why the UK could not enjoy a prolonged upswing in growth if inflation
remained low.
Meanwhile, Sir Norman, in his first public comment on the party's
increasingly divisive internal debate, called for public spending cuts - the
alternative being promoted by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury.
Speaking on the eve of a tour of Conservative constituency associations
aimed at boosting morale, Sir Norman said the party would want Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to take 'whatever action was necessary' to reduce
the government's budget deficit.
But he said grass roots members would expect public spending to be 'the
first area which is looked at and which is reduced'. Public spending 'must
be the first port of call before one goes to taxation. We have been and are
committed to being a low taxation party', he told BBC radio.
Sir Norman's intervention adds weight to a campaign against the prospect of
tax increases being run by prominent rightwing backbenchers, with the
apparent backing of rightwing cabinet ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary.
The right's case will also be strengthened by the launch of a Labour
campaign against government economic policy by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, who moved to exploit the government's difficulties by claiming
the Conservatives were the party of high taxation.
Deliberately echoing the Conservatives' general election attacks on Labour,
he said taxpayers faced a 'tax bombshell' which would raise average taxes by
Pounds 1,000 a year by 1995.
Mr John Townend, rightwing chairman of the Tory finance committee, claimed
there was 'a growing view among all our ministers that if we did go into the
next election as a high spending, high taxation party, our chances would be
pretty slim'.
The right's objective is to revive proposals put forward by Mr Portillo
earlier this year for cuts of between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent in the
budgets of the main spending departments.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Bosnia peace talks fail over land demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN peace talks in Geneva broke down yesterday, prompting Lord Owen,
international mediator, to warn of the danger of a deeper slide into
'anarchy and war' if the three sides did not reach a speedy settlement.
Lord Owen said: 'The talks have failed because there is not an agreement on
the map. They all want more territory than either of the others is prepared
to give.'
However, along with his fellow mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, he held
out hope that the proposal would remain on the table. The alternative was
'fragmentation, anarchy, warlords and chaos'.
He admitted that 'barring a miracle or a sudden shift in one of the parties'
he did not expect negotiations to resume today, although he said the leaders
of the three warring parties - Croats, Moslems and Serbs - had agreed to
remain in Geneva until today. None of the leaders ruled out resuming talks
in the near future.
Amid fears of a surge in fighting in central Bosnia, the republic's
president Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, said his army would 'respect the
ceasefire. But, of course, whether there will be war or not does not depend
only on us'. Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who appeared enraged by
the breakdown of the talks, said he was sure the Bosnian Serbian forces
would respect the ceasefire, which was put in place earlier this week.
Earlier Croatian president Franjo Tudjman predicted that the fighting would
continue unabated. Clashes have intensified in central Bosnia as Croat and
Moslem troops have tried to grab more land. Members of the Moslem delegation
were reported to be in tears as the Croats left the talks. Mr Izetbegovic
blamed the collapse on the failure of Serb and Croat leaders to make
essential concessions to his land-locked republic.
'The minimum of minimums which we put before the conference today would have
allowed an economically and political viable state,' he said. 'They (Serbs
and Croats) have rejected our requirements and therefore this round of talks
failed,' he told a news conference.
The key sticking point appeared to be Moslem demands for the restoration of
'ethnically cleansed' territory in eastern and north-western Bosnia and the
land connection to the sea at the Adriatic port of Neum.
The setback surprised observers after a day in which all three sides had
indicated they were on the verge of agreement. Mr Charles Redman, President
Bill Clinton's special envoy, said: 'I think it is a tragedy that they could
not come to a solution.'
In an attempt to persuade the Bosnian delegation to accept the offer, which
included a widened 1.8 mile corridor connecting the three eastern enclaves
but failed to meet any other Moslem demands, Mr Milosevic held a 15-minute
private session with Mr Izetbegovic.
Earlier, the Bosnian government had laid the ground for a possible agreement
by scaling back its demands for territorial concessions.
Mr Izetbegovic had put forward a proposal that his republic should receive
an additional 4 per cent of land on top of the 28 per cent already allocated
under the proposed partition. Previous Moslem proposals had demanded at
least 10 per cent more land.
Amid fears of renewed fighting, Lt Gen Francis Briquemont, UN commander in
Sarajevo, yesterday travelled to Medjugorje, near Mostar, to supervise
ceasefire talks between Bosnians and Croats.
Meanwhile, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, yesterday met Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Geneva, to discuss the
possible deployment of more peacekeeping troops.

FT  02 SEP 93 / Israel and PLO pact could be signed 'in days'

<TEXT>
MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was
last night battling to persuade his senior colleagues in Tunis to sign an
unprecedented mutual recognition accord with Israel.
Jordan, meanwhile, said it would sign a preliminary peace agreement with
Israel in Washington.
At PLO headquarters in Tunis, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, an executive committee
member, said the accord could be signed within days and would be agreed
before the signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, shared the optimism and said
Israel was ready to sign a recognition agreement immediately the PLO agreed
to annul its charter calling for the violent annihilation of the Jewish
state.
Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby EC officials for aid to
Palestinians, also said that the accord was separate and independent from a
peace deal with Palestinians on interim self-rule.
He said the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on self-rule for
1.9m Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, including
Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho,
'stands on its own legs' and was not dependent on a recognition deal.
In Amman, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, the Jordanian prime minister, said he
expected a Jordanian-Israeli declaration of principles to be signed during
the of Middle East peace negotiations in Washington.
He said an 'agenda' between Jordan and Israel had been near completion for
months but the Jordanian government had held back from signing to allow the
Palestinians time to agree on an initial settlement.
"Aside from certain matters concerning language, we are likely to agree on
an agenda this time round,' he said.
The agenda - which contains the framework for a peace agreement - is
believed to include the return by Israel of two strips of land and increased
Jordanian water rights from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. It also outlines
the right of return of an estimated 100,000 of Palestinian refugees who fled
to Jordan after the 1967 war when Israel seized the West Bank.
In Jerusalem. Mr Peres agreed that a Jordanian agreement could be signed
'tomorrow' and said the last Israeli-Jordanian rounds of talks had discussed
only minor details.
The rapidly developing Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian breakthrough showed
signs of triggering possible progress in the two other tracks of the Middle
East peace process - the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks. A PLO
official said Spain was hosting secret talks among the three parties and
that a draft Israeli-Syrian agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace was close to completion.
However, Israel and Syria denied the claim.
Mr Peres clarified the timetable for the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord. He
said a signing ceremony and approval by Israel's parliament would take place
within two weeks. A joint committee would then iron out outstanding issues
and the plan would then be implemented within four months.

The debate was given a fresh twist by Mr Redwood, who suggested that the

expected economic recovery.
His comments were underlined by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trelleborg plans rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday became the fifth
large Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the past two weeks when it
unveiled plans to raise SKr1.2bn (Dollars 149m) from shareholders to cut
debts.
It also aims to sell its Munksjo paper and packaging unit, or float it on
the stock exchange, in a move which could raise several billion kronor. The
group also wants to sell its remaining shares in Svedala, the mineral
processing and transport unit.
The plans were announced as the group sank deeply into the red with a
first-half loss after financial items of SKr796m, against a SKr117m profit
in the same 1992 period.
Depressed metal prices led to a fall in turnover, to SKr10.97m from
SKr11.55bn, while there was an operating loss of SKr131m, against a SKr29m
profit.
Trelleborg said in July it planned to cut debts by SKr3bn over the next 12
months.
The rights issue will be on a one-for-two basis at SKr30 per share.
The group has net debts of about SKr10bn and has already sold assets worth
SKr1.4bn this year.
Incentive, the industrial and investment group controlled by the Wallenberg
family, said rationalisation and increased focus on engineering businesses
helped it lift first-half profits to SKr273m from SKr212m, excluding
associated companies.
The increase was achieved despite a fall in sales to SKr2.74bn from
SKr2.93bn, amid weak conditions in the group's main Nordic and west European
markets.
If income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab is included,
profits climbed to SKr780m from SKr654m.
The group said construc-tion groups Munters and Tour &amp; Andersson and
materials handling group Hagglunds Marine had performed well despite
difficult market conditions.
Hasselblad, the camera company, had a more difficult time, largely because
of a weak European market.

FT  01 SEP 93 / India caught in new cellular network bid row
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government has taken steps to end controversy over awarding
licences for cellular telephone networks by withdrawing licences granted
last autumn and handing out new ones.
But the new decision could be as hotly contested as the original. Already,
one unsuccessful bidder has started court action and another has said that
it might follow suit.
The controversy illustrates how India's efforts to modernise and liberalise
its economy can fall foul of bureaucratic and political interference.
The ambitious proposals for establishing cellular telephone networks in the
four largest cities - Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras - were first
announced two years ago.
Telecommunications groups from Europe, East Asia and North America rushed to
bid in partnership with large Indian companies.
But when the Ministry of Telecommunications finally announced the results
last year, the losers protested against the evaluation of bids.
Three losing bidders - including Hutchison Max Telecom, a joint venture
involving Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong - challenged the ministry in court.
Hutchison Max Telecom was particularly aggrieved because its bid had been
rejected on the grounds that its tender documents contained a typographical
error.
The court in March ordered the ministry to re-evaluate aspects of the bids.
In particular, the judge said officials had been wrong to turn down
Hutchison Max for a typographical mistake and ordered them to reinstate the
company.
Hutchison Max's bid came top in the re-evaluation: it was therefore entitled
to one of the two licences for Bombay, potentially the most lucrative market
and most bidders' top target. This then entailed redistributing most of the
other licences.
After months of deliberation, officials finally informed bidders last week.
Hutchison Max was delighted. Mr Bhai Mohan Singh, head of the family-owned
group which is the local partner in the venture, said yesterday: 'This has
gone on too long. I'm glad we can get started at last.'
But Tata group, India's largest conglomerate, which had been granted a
licence for Delhi in the original awards and was given nothing, filed a
petition in the Supreme Court challenging the ministry.

CRAMPED and crowded, the Bekaa Camp in Jordan houses over 90,000 refugees,
most of whom were displaced when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in 1967. Palestinians in the camp see no prospect for an improvement in
their lives as a result of agreement between the Palestine Liberation
Organisation for autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
The latest bon mot in the sprawling camp west of Amman plays on the Arabic
for Jericho (Ariha) which sounds like the word 'smell' or 'stench'.
The general consensus is that the Gaza-Jericho accord 'stinks and means
absolutely nothing,' according to Ayman Shahin, a 22-year-old pharmacy
student at the University of Jordan who was born in the camp. '(Yassir)
Arafat has sold Palestine and over 40 years of struggle,' he says. The
refugees are angry at the modest size of the land offered and they fear that
this small step will be the last.
Large families are cramped into small concrete and corrugated iron huts
where economic deprivation is prevalent. Although all the Palestinian
factions are represented in the Bekaa camp, it has traditionally been a
stronghold for Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah group.
However, in recent months opposition to the peace talks and the curtailment
of financial aid and welfare benefits from the cash-trapped PLO has led to
disillusion and contempt for Mr Arafat's policies.
The refugees fear the worst from the Gaza/Jericho accord. They refuse to
believe Mr Arafat's claim that the deal will be the initial stage to a full
Israeli hand-over of the West Bank and they see little improvement for
themselves should the deal be implemented.
In some quarters of the camp there is open hostility or murderous undertones
at the mention of Mr Arafat's name.
Fuelling the anger are various Islamic groups, particularly Hamas which has
seen support grow since the inception of the peace process in Madrid in
1991.
Bands of fundamentalists can be seen walking around the camp lobbying for
support of their rejectionist policies of an all-or-nothing deal with
Israel. Their uncompromising stance is that either they take all the
pre-1967 lands back immediately and capture the rest of Israel later or the
armed struggle will continue.
The Amman-based spokesman for Hamas, Mr Mohammed Nazal, condemns the
agreement as 'an end to Palestinian hope'. Furthermore he predicts that it
could lead to increased inter-Palestinian rivalry and possibly civil war
both inside and outside the occupied territories.
The majority of Palestinians in the camp support the Hamas line of continued
armed resistance, whatever the outcome of the current 11th round of peace
talks.
Jordan is home to the largest number of Palestinian refugees. Figures from
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency show that in 1992 more than 1.1m
refugees were registered in the kingdom. Almost 70 per cent of Jordan's
population is Palestinian and one quarter of the country's population are
considered refugees. The future of the refugees is an important point of
discussion on the Israeli-Jordanian track at the peace negotiations, but the
Palestinians in Bekaa are not comforted by discussions and the peace agenda.
In the al-Hussein refugee camp in the heart of Amman, refugees reacted with
anger or resignation.
'We reject all of this because all of Palestine, from the Jordan to the
Mediterranean is ours,' said Mr Adnan al-Hindi, a Hamas supporter who runs a
pharmacy in the Amman camp. 'These people (Arafat and the PLO) either gave
up half way through our struggle. . . or are traitors,' added Mr Hindi, who
was born in the town of Qibab and who has been a refugee in Jordan since the
1948 war.
But Sami Ahmed, a butcher at al-Hussein who supports Mr Arafat, said: 'We
have no choice but to accept the Gaza-Jericho plan. . . We have been
fighting the Jews for 45 years and we got nowhere. Now we have to make
concessions to get somewhere.'
'We have had enough statements and heroics,' said Mr Hussein Abdullah, 60,
and a merchant in the Ain al-Hilweh part of Amman.
'Thousands of Palestinian martyrs have fallen in the armed struggle but
nothing has been achieved. Perhaps this step is a beginning to building an
independent Palestinian state.'

THE Czech economy will begin its recovery in the second half of this year
and expand more rapidly in 1994, according to Mr Jiri Pospisil, the monetary
policy director at the Czech National Bank, writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
'Private consumption is growing. The government is relaxing its restrictive
policy and we expect a rise in public consumption in the second half. There
has been a rise in imports of investment goods, and the construction sector
is doing well,' he said.
A 4 per cent fall in industrial production for the first six months
exaggerated the impact of temporary factors, he said. Many businesses closed
for inventories before the country's split and the introduction of value
added tax. An estimated 30-40 per cent drop in exports to Slovakia was
offset by export growth elsewhere.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (19): Dancing with
the dead at the Starlight - Journey to the heart of an anguished continent /
Nicholas Woodsworth travels from Bagamoyo, once the terminus of a busy slave
trading route, to the Great Lakes - retracing the paths trodden by those in
bondage in the 18th and 19th centuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
THERE is not much left of Bagamoyo these days. It has become once again what
it was in the beginning, a somnolent backwater lost on a low coast at the
end of a bad road.
Campaign charts of a lost battle, maps of mould and lichen grow large on the
walls of imperial buildings in ruin. Wooden stick ribs protrude from the
sides of crumbling mud huts. Green bush and tropical lethargy encroach
everywhere. Even chickens peck languidly in Bagamoyo. On the afternoon I
arrived, the place hardly looked like a signpost pointing the way to the
heart of Africa.
But time, aided by heat, humidity and termites, has simply covered over the
traces of the past. Once Bagamoyo was the terminus of a busy Arab slave
trading route stretching 700 miles into the interior. 'Lay down your heart'
is the Swahili meaning of the word Bagamoyo, and in the phrase lies millions
of men's, an entire continent's, anguish.
But Bagamoyo did not only export African tragedy to the rest of the world;
it was also the conduit that brought the rest of the world, and many of its
tragedies, to Africa. In the mid-1800s Richard Burton, John Speke, Henry
Stanley, James Grant, all celebrities of the Victorian age, passed through
here, using age-old slave routes to rediscover and remake a continent. Near
the beach at Bagamoyo, over the door of a small weather-beaten church, is
nailed a sign honouring the passage of that greatest of explorers, David
Livingstone.
'I beg to direct your attention to Africa,' Livingstone addressed Cambridge
University in 1857. 'I know that in a few years I shall be cut off in that
country, which is now open. Do not let it be shut again] I go back to Africa
to try to make an open path for commerce and Christianity; do you carry out
the work which I have begun.'
We have, in a manner of speaking, carried out that work. Within a few years
Livingstone's penetration of Africa had become the rape of Africa. The
continent was transformed not by idealism, but by the steam engine, quinine
and the Maxim gun. Its own evolutionary patterns shattered, Africa was
co-opted into an imperfect imitation of a world that over-rode it.
Like a fastidious gentleman with desires satisfied and composure regained,
the world a century and a half on seems reluctant to continue the
relationship or consider too deeply the results. War, famine, debt, disease,
corruption, over-population, mismanagement, social breakdown and a hundred
other illnesses taint and exhaust the former object of its attentions.
Bagamoyo slumbers, a symbol of a pathway once open but now, as Livingstone
feared, at risk of closing down. The 'dark continent', once a romantic
mystery that demanded investigation, may finally become a reality no one
wants to know about. Bagamoyo is as good a place as any to contemplate its
future.
Dar es Salaam
I was not able, as I had intended, to catch the train that leaves from Dar
es Salaam and snakes slowly westwards across 700 miles of stunted, dusty
bush. One hundred and fifty years ago this was the route that led towards
central Africa and that holiest of Victorian grails, the source of the Nile.
Today the route remains almost as haphazard, and few overland travel
itineraries work out as planned.
I had to abandon the wheezing Peugeot bush taxi I had hired for the bumpy
trip from Bagamoyo to Dar, leaving it immobilised in a cloud of radiator
steam. I had to abandon too the patched-up bus that followed some time
later, leaving it raised forlornly on jacks. Can high-tech save the
continent? A blond Scandinavian in a shiny new aid agency Landcruiser saved
me, but me alone. I left my fellow bus passengers by the dusty roadside,
waiting, as all Africa sometimes seems to wait, for something to come along.
But not even imported technology allowed me to make my train - it had left
an hour before I finally reached Dar. Could I catch a fast bus and meet the
train at an onward station? It was not that easy. Tanzania's roads are
atrocious, so badly maintained they strangle the economy and so dangerous
that public buses are prohibited from using them at night.
I used what only the privileged can use to make life work in Africa - money.
For Pounds 18 - six weeks wages for a Tanzanian civil servant - I had a
privately hired, 26-seater bus rush me, its solitary passenger, 125 miles
through the darkness to the next train stop at Morogoro. With a little money
in Africa even mediocre men can become special men. It is what many whites
have always enjoyed.
Morogoro
Like the roadside villages I passed through that evening, the Morogoro
railway station at midnight was inky black, its platform a dark void
pin-pricked here and there by the flickering flames of kerosene lamps.
Drought here means more than parched fields; with hydro turbines silent, it
also means little power or electric light.
What does one do when the conveniences of modern life fail, when systems
break down, reserves are exhausted, ambitious plans come to nothing? In this
part of the world there is often little alternative - people simply bear
with it. In the dark I picked my way over a platform thick with sleeping
bodies bundled in blankets and as still as corpses, and settled down. What
does one do when finally opportunity presents itself? On a continent where
people are many and services few, one scrambles. When the train finally
pulled in the corpses sprang to life, bellowing and bumping blindly in the
night, everyone trying to get bags and bundles through doors and windows
before everyone else. The carriages may be over-crowded, the conductors
bullying, the toilets smelly, the dining car less than epicurean, but when
the choice is one of poor service or no service at all, there is little
dickering.
Tabora
Eighteen hours and some 400 miles later, the train passed through Tabora and
I got off. In their search for the Nile, Stanley, Livingstone, Burton and
Speke all found rest and uncertain hospitality here. From the 1820s Tabora
flourished as an Arab town, an inland centre for the depredations of
expatriate traders.
Slavery aside, things have not changed greatly today. On Tabora's dusty
streets I met Pyara Sokhi, a Sikh entrepreneur who has broken with the
town's small but powerful Asian community. Over a feast of curry in
celebration of Guru Nanak's birthday, Sokhi told me of his fears for
Tabora's future. In a vast, impoverished region where Arab, and now Indian,
interests maintain a firm grip on commerce, an African-run economy has
failed to get off the ground. Tanzania's new free market has made wealthier
those who were already wealthy.
African Tabora is foundering. I had thought that putting up for three days
with the mud-brown water and wriggling insect larvae that dribbled out of
the tap in Tabora's dilapidated Railway Hotel bad enough. I was not prepared
for the depressing year-in, year-out reality that Pyara Sokhi introduced me
to.
At the Tabora Boys' Secondary School, once an educational showpiece, I
watched Danish aid workers fit new plumbing into old buildings. There is so
little public money for education that Danida has had to undertake the
refurbishment and maintenance of public schools throughout the country.
Julius Nyerere, the architect of Tanzanian socialism, boarded and studied in
this school 45 years ago; today, his experiment in tatters, he would find
there are not even enough desks or beds to go round. In the town library
most books date from the 1960s. Computers are merely a rumour.
In Tabora's Kitete Hospital, the largest in a region of 18m people, a
shortage of Tanzanian staff has been bridged only by the voluntary services
of an eight-man medical team from China. The medicines are Chinese, as are
the operating theatre and technical equipment. Patients double up in beds.
There is no blood bank, no dependable electrical supply, and the water that
comes from the taps, when it comes at all, is the same mud-brown. I watched
a young child dying from third degee burns. Somewhere in the post, a doctor
told me, a grafting scalpel was on its way from China; it might or might not
arrive in time.
Chomachankola
In 1858 John Speke, the Victorian explorer of the Nile's source, swung north
from Tabora and crossed a burning and inhospitable plain to the green shores
of Lake Victoria. I did too, hitching a ride with Phil Riddell, a United
Nations irrigation specialist.
Bright and energetic, Riddell is typical of the best of a new generation of
expatriate specialists on the continent. Since the first aid efforts of the
1960s lessons have been learned and plans scaled down to better suit
Africa's abilities to make them work. Riddell remains enthusiastic about his
work; Africa is vital, he believes, to the world's long-term food
strategies.
But as we bounced along a dirt track towards a new irrigation project at the
village of Chomachankola, he acknowledged that he wrestles, often
unsuccessfully, with problems spared much of the rest of the world. Riddell
has worked in Asia, where technology and foreign aid has been grafted to
firmly established productive systems. He is also familiar with the Middle
East, where new systems have been tailor-made in technologically virgin
territory. Africa, he says, is more difficult than either.
Here local technology is not sophisticated. But in the past at least, he
said, it was substantial and assured survival. Now, because of population
pressures, environmental change, domestic political policies and global
economics, old techniques are no longer viable. They are also difficult to
adapt. Technology is inseparable from the history of the people who use it;
on a continent forcibly prised from its past, it has no firm base to build
on.
Great problems are made up of a series of little problems. At Chomachankola,
Riddell was happy with progress being made on the low-tech, gravity-fed
irrigation project there. But when I last saw him at Mwanza on Lake Victoria
a few hours later he had forgotten the dream of global food supply; he was
back at the cutting edge, arguing with a drunken port official, who for a
bribe had sold his reserved car space on a ferry west to the next aid
project. There is a more crucial factor to to aid than technology, Riddell
admitted. It is the human factor. I boarded my own ferry north to Uganda.
Kampala
I enjoyed dancing with the bar girls of the Starlight Nightclub. They are
vivacious - full of energy and the sensual enjoyment of music and movement.
But they also made me sad. They are survivors in a decimated country. What
Idi Amin began, Aids has continued. Soon, many of them too shall be gone. I
tried not to think that evening that I was dancing with the dead.
But Kampala is an African city that shows one of Africa's greatest
attributes - resilience. Here everyone is a survivor of not just Aids, but
of two decades of violence and megalomaniacal government. Yet Ugandans show
a will to rebuild their lives. The streets of Kampala may still be
down-at-heel and battle-scarred, but the crowds that throng them have an
insuppressible vitality and lack of rancour.
In the Nakasero market I bought a souvenir made from throw-away bits of
western technology. It is a small lamp made of an inverted light bulb fitted
with a wick and mounted on the lid of a Danish butter tin. Filled with
kerosene, such lamps bring light to a country where 90 per cent of homes are
without power. It is a simple re-application of means to needs. For me it is
a symbol, full of hope, of Africa's capacity to find ways out of disaster.
Jinja
By kamikaze-piloted mini-bus, the town of Jinja lies a hair-raising two
hours from Kampala along the shores of Lake Victoria. For me it was the end
of a 10-day journey; for the Nile it is the beginning of a 2,000-mile trip
that ends in the Mediterranean. Jinja lies in lush countryside amid rolling
fields of coffee, maize, tea, and bananas. It is a place of such beauty and
fertility that it is hard to believe things could ever go far wrong.
Certainly, when he first walked here beside the turbulent and fast-flowing
Nile Speke could not have imagined how far wrong the African future could
go. Nor could the prosperous Asian community that until the 1970s made this
a prosperous industrial centre.
For 20 years Jinja has been a decaying town, its foreigners expelled, its
factories expropriated, its once-sumptuous villas and mansions run to ruin
by the poor families that camp out in them. It is a place that might have
gone the way of Bagamoyo. But Jinja is slowly coming alive again. Former
non-indigenous owners and businesses are trickling back, encouraged by a
government that now believes the benefits of foreign involvement outweigh
the disadvantages.
Do they? From the point of view of most westerners there would seem to be
little gain. Even 10 days of casual travel makes Africa appear to be a
continent adrift, its problems intractable, its potential unrealisable. How
must it look to the foreign banker, businessman, or diplomat?
A century ago the Victorians found that African exploration raised more
questions than it answered. Today we are explorers of new African frontiers,
and the answers are even harder to come by. Is a revival like Jinja's,
fairer and more equitable to African interests, realistically possible?
Is the continent doomed to become one vast Bagamoyo? Our idealism has been
much tempered since Livingstone first directed our attention to Africa. A
short journey here makes his warning seem now almost too late. But perhaps
not - Africa is inextricably involved with the rest of the world. What began
long ago with Arab traders continues today with Chinese doctors, Indian
businessmen, Norwegian aid workers, British engineers. Once discovered,
Africa will not go away.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at risk (17): A great risk of
missing the boat - Southern Africa / The future of a region racked by
political turmoil, civil war and social upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'IF YOUR neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' That adage,
from veteran South African entrepreneur Anton Rupert, forms the rationale
around the world for regional integration: the argument is that a sated
neighbour is a stable neighbour, unlikely to turn belligerent. And with
peace and stability come economic development.
Four years ago, southern Africa's prospects looked unrelievedly bleak, with
Angola and Mozambique sunk in civil war, Zambia in turmoil, Zimbabwe in
economic decline and South Africa exhausted by decades of repression.
Today hopes are high that South Africa will prove the region's economic
saviour. But the post-apartheid government in Pretoria is likely to pay
little attention to the problem of hungry neighbours until it can solve the
far more dangerous problem of hungry citizens. And that could take until the
end of the decade, even on an optimistic timetable, dampening hopes that
South Africa will be the 'locomotive' of rapid growth in southern Africa -
at least in the short term.
First among the problems is the political transition in South Africa itself,
where violence and instability have severely depressed economic activity and
deterred foreign and local investors. Until South Africa is stable,
accelerated economic growth in the region remains a pipe dream: and
achieving stability in the republic may prove a lengthy process.
Similarly, political upheaval in other countries of the region will
inevitably delay growth. The most economically promising country outside
South Africa - Angola - looks set to languish in civil war for the
foreseeable future; Mozambique's future is far from certain, in spite of
plans for multi-party elections; Zambia is struggling under the burden of
decades of past mistakes, economic and political; Zimbabwe is weak
economically.
The economic basis for regional integration is also shaky. Prospects for
significantly increasing trade within the region are uninspiring: first and
foremost, because most of the countries of southern Africa simply cannot
pay, at least not with hard currency.
To get around the payment problem, South Africa could extend the rand
monetary area to include other countries - a far too costly option, given
the lack of monetary discipline exhibited by most of the region's central
banks - or resort to countertrade. But it will be difficult to boost two-way
trade links given the fact that South Africa's neighbours are far less
developed than the republic (in a market worth Dollars 130bn, South Africa
already has an 80 per cent share) and because regional complementarities are
few, outside of a limited range of raw materials.
Little can be expected from the lifting of sanctions in this area either:
even under sanctions, regional states grouped together under the Southern
African Development Coordination Conference (since renamed the Southern
African Development Community) imported R2.4bn of goods from the republic,
or almost 60 per cent of Pretoria's African exports.
The most promising areas could well prove inter-regional trade in services,
such as power and water, with Eskom, the South African electricity utility,
proposing a southern African electricity grid; Pretoria already imports
water from Lesotho through the Highlands Water project.
But important as this co-operation is, the record to date suggests there is
little evidence that SADC politicians in the region are prepared to
relinquish enough economic autonomy to form a truly integrated regional
community.
In the longer term, there is no alternative to regional integration. In a
world of economic and political power blocs, southern Africa cannot hope to
prosper in its present fragmented state. The risk is that, unless the region
achieves political stability soon, it will simply miss the boat.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (16): Killer virus
hits at heart of economy - AIDS / More than half of the world's 15m
sufferers are in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO

<TEXT>
TWELVE YEARS after the world first woke up to the consequences of Aids,
sub-Saharan Africa remains in the grip of the disease, and many fear its
economic impact threatens to reverse the continent's development well into
the next century.
Figures from the World Health Organisation show that more than half of the
world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m
Africans, and it is estimated 14m of the region's people will be infected by
2000.
The disease in Africa is mainly transmitted through heterosexual contact,
affecting men and women equally. Figures for each country remain patchy, but
Aids-control programmes in Uganda suggest between 7 and 10 per cent of the
population is infected with HIV. In Zambia, the ministry of health estimates
between 20 and 25 per cent of Zambian women of child-bearing age have HIV.
The problem is believed to be growing in West Africa and in South Africa.
According to the World Bank, in many African countries, particularly in the
urban areas, Aids has become the 'major cause of adult mortality, leading to
a doubling and even a tripling of the adult mortality rate'. In Africa, the
disease is concentrated in the 20-45 age group, the strongest section of the
labour force, and many now fear labour shortages will become widespread on
the continent - leading to rising employment costs, which could impede
development.
The increasing incidence of tuberculosis, which has killed more than 1.3m
people since 1980, has also been linked to the increase in Aids, with nearly
50 per cent of sufferers said to be HIV-infected.
Experts now believe there is a real danger that the disease will derail
attempts in recent years by African governments to restructure their
economies.
In rural areas, the backbone of many African economies, the disease has had
a devastating impact. A report for Panos, the research charity, by Tony
Barnet, of the University of East Anglia, said in many parts of southern
Uganda (an area once known for its fertility), HIV-related illness and death
had resulted in less careful tending of banana plots, unpruned coffee
bushes, a reduction in the size of cultivated plots and a narrowing in the
range of crops.
In parts of Zimbabwe, the cultivation of Chilli peppers had grown at the
expense of more lucrative crops - it needs less energy for harvesting - and,
as Panos says, 'in Rwanda, the long-term effects may be increased
cultivation of cassava and reduced cultivation of other foods and cash
crops'. This in turn could lead to less export income and poor nutrition.
In parts of Tanzania, agricultural production is said to have fallen by
between 3 and 20 per cent, due to HIV-related deaths. In addition, says the
recent World Bank report, 'the viability of agricultural credit schemes may
also be affected. The number of defaulters may rise, as households use
credit to finance medical care, leaving survivors to liquidate their
remaining assets in order to repay loans'.
But it is perhaps in the urban areas and more formal sectors of the economy
that the impact of Aids is most visible.
In many urban centres, the infection rate has been put as high as 30 per
cent. Ironically, the higher the income, the greater the sexual activity,
and a 1988 study in Zaire found higher HIV rates among better-educated and
higher-paid workers.
In industry, whole sectors are under threat. In Zambia, where the copper
industry is the source of 75 per cent of export earnings, researchers have
not only warned that workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids
faster than replacements can be trained, but have added: 'The result will
not be a sudden collapse in minor output; rather there will be a slow but
steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents, and delays and
output will suffer.'
In other countries, the loss of output and earnings in manufacturing due to
HIV/Aids illness have become apparent with the decline in production levels.
The service sector has not escaped either, and Panos highlights the
situation in South Africa where life insurance companies face a huge
increase in payments. Aids-related claims in the period 1985 to 1988
amounted to Pounds 855,000. Yet in 1989 alone the figure was Pounds 700,000.
Productivity levels have been hit across the continent, due to ill-health
among workers and funeral attendance. An official at the Uganda ministry of
commerce and industry said last year: 'Even if someone does not die here,
every week we have at least three employees asking for permission to attend
a relative's funeral.'
According to forecaster DRI/McGraw Hill, Aids will see Africa's gross
domestic product depressed by more than 4 per cent by the end of the decade.
Companies have already taken action. BP's African subsidiary has a formal
'common agreed policy' on Aids written into its employee handbook. Unilever,
with 80,000 employees on the continent, has 'guidelines rather than a formal
policy', and takes an active monitoring and educational role in relation to
Aids. British American Tobacco in Uganda subjects its workforce, or even
prospective employees, to blood tests. The South African Chamber of Mines is
reported to have refused to recruit anyone who reacts positively to a test.
The World Bank adopted an Agenda for Action on Aids in Africa, in 1988, and
has loaned more than Dollars 100m in its fight against the condition and
other sexually-transmitted diseases since 1986. That total includes its
single biggest loan for fighting Aids, totalling Dollars 64.5m, which it
gave to Zimbabwe in June.
If Africa is to fight the scourge, more assistance is vital.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (14): An issue the
west ignores at its peril - Environment / The problems of over-population,
over-cultivation and over-grazing
</HEADLINE>

NO ISSUE divides Africa from the first world more strongly than the
environment. While the west worries about the endangered black rhino and
loss of bio-diversity, most Africans are too exhausted from the daily
struggle to find fuel and water to care about the destruction of their
environment.
The priorities of each seem irreconcilable, and yet, they need not be. What
is needed is a greater awareness in the industrialised world of how its
policies exacerbate Africa's environmental crisis. And African governments
need to place greater emphasis on combatting the extreme poverty which is a
cause, as well as a result, of environmental degradation. There is little
time to reverse the damage. At current growth rates, Sub-Saharan Africa's
population of 600m will double in 22 years. The World Bank estimates the
growth rate will decline from the present 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent at
the end of the decade, as Aids takes its toll and family planning becomes
more widespread. However, even this decline will not be enough to prevent
the population doubling early in the next century.
Already, women in the Sahel and many parts of east Africa walk 15km each day
to gather a bundle of firewood. In a few years, there will be more mouths to
feed and less wood to burn.
Over-cultivation and over-grazing are transforming much of the continent
into a vast wasteland: an area twice the size of India, according to the
United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), is under direct threat of
desertification. In addition, Africa is losing 2.7m hectares of woodlands
every year. In most countries, forests are disappearing because people need
land for farming, not wood to burn.
When famine sweeps across Africa, the west calls it a natural disaster and
spends billions of dollars in emergency food relief. But Africa's hunger is
not simply a question of crop failure. In 1985, five out of six nations on a
United Nations list of famine-afflicted countries were also racked by civil
war. In Ethiopia, Chad, Sudan, Mozambique and Angola, it was difficult to
distinguish between drought-related famine and war-induced starvation.
'For the past 20 years, civil strife has indirectly wreaked as much
devastation on the environment as any other cause in Africa,' argues Dr
Roger Batty, an Oxford historian and consultant at UNEP. He believes western
powers have been culpable of fuelling conflict by arming their client states
on the continent. With the end of the cold war, however, superpower interest
in conducting wars-by-proxy on the continent has evaporated, and it is hoped
that the level of military aid to African governments will also fall.
Environmental degradation can also add to the pressures from which conflict
emerges. 'The next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile,
not politics,' Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, now the UN secretary-general,
warned in 1985. The Nile basin touches on nine other countries, reaching as
far south as Tanzania and Zaire. All upstream nations are keen to extend
land under irrigation by tapping Egypt's only source of water.
'Without political imagination,' Mr Boutros Ghali continued, 'Egypt will
become a new Bangladesh fraught with drought and famine - but with one
difference. This Bangladesh will be on the shores of the Mediterranean,
half-an-hour by jet from the rich people in the north.'
Already, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees, there are 5m
displaced people on the continent. To call them refugees would be a
misnomer, for most will never be able to return to their homes. Many are
fleeing land too degraded to support them. Others seek refuge from civil
war, government repression, ethnic conflict, or simply the desperate poverty
of rural areas. But up to now, the west has preferred to focus on endangered
animals, rather than endangered humans.
The expulsion of Maasai pastoralists from 4,800 square miles of traditional
grazing land which became the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania was one of
the first important battles fought by western conservationists in Africa.
All over the continent, 'experts' imposed the theory that wildlife and
people should be separated. This principle is now being challenged. 'It is
hard to imagine that 150,000 tourists are not causing greater environmental
damage and disturbing wildlife far more than 2,000 Maasai ever did,' says Mr
Raymond Bonner, a US journalist and author of At the Hand of Man: Peril and
Hope for Africa's Wildlife.
New solutions are required which marry the needs of local people to those of
the environment. In Luwangwa, Zambia, hunting rights are auctioned among
safari companies and the revenues are channelled to the local tribes. As a
result, villagers have started supporting the national parks service and set
up security committees to prevent poachers entering into their areas. The
number of poached carcasses of elephants and black rhinos in Luwangwa fell
by 90 per cent between 1985 and 1987.
The lesson to be learned is that Africa needs an economic incentive to
protect its wildlife. But western institutions - be they tourist or
pharmaceutical companies - are often reluctant to pay the price.
Far more worrying than the endangered black rhino are Africa's disappearing
insects and plants - species that could hold the cure for Aids. Already,
Africa has destroyed 65 per cent of its original wildlife habitats.
Concerns about the staggering loss of bio-diversity are not exaggerated. A
substance discovered in the rosy periwinkle, a species unique to Madagascar,
has quadrupled the survival rate for children suffering from leukemia.
Worldwide sales of the rosy periwinkle drug now earn more than Dollars 100m
a year, but not a cent has accrued to Madagascar in compensation for
preserving the plant's habitat.
A growing number of ecologists now argue that the best way of persuading
African nations to protect their bio-diversity is by paying them to leave
their natural resources intact. What is found in Africa may be needed in
Europe and the rest of the developed world.
Paper mills in the US and Japan, for example, are experimenting with an
African plant, Kenaf, a relative of jute, which produces five times more
pulp than the average tree. After 30 years of investigations, the US
Department of Agriculture has singled out Kenaf as the most promising
substitute to produce tree-free paper. It is an annual crop, whereas
man-made forests require up to 60 years in the northern hemisphere to reach
maturity. US newspapers which have tested Kenaf newsprint report that it is
brighter, reproduces better pictures, and uses less ink, which does not
stain hands.
Africa's environmental problems are often portrayed in doomsday tones. In
reality, they are neither insoluble nor insurmountable. What is needed is a
radical reassessment of the value the industrialised world places on
Africa's environmental health. It is an issue the west ignores at its peril.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (15): Islands of
hope in a sea of despair - Non-government organisations / NGOs are now
involved in virtually every aspect of African life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NON-GOVERNMENT agencies provide isolated islands of hope in a sea of social
and economic despair, the British charity Oxfam wrote earlier this year in
its assessment of the African crisis.
This is no exaggeration. By stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of
government services, NGOs have become as indispensable to Africa's
development efforts as official aid flows. NGOs invested Dollars 6.4bn in
Africa in 1989 - more than the World Bank's net transfers to the region, and
more than six times the figure for direct foreign investment.
And as disenchantment grows with African bureaucracies, donor governments
are increasingly channelling official assistance through NGOs. 'They help
the poor directly, without costly bureaucratic mediation of donors and
recipient governments, and without danger of assistance ending up in pockets
of the rich, the military or the corrupt,' says the World Bank. NGOs now get
about one-third of their funds from official sources.
Although emergency relief work dominates the headlines, NGOs are now
involved in virtually every aspect of African life, providing health
services, drilling bore holes, serving as a 'bank' willing to finance small
traders and cottage industries. Farmers are more likely to get seeds for
planting, rural credit and extension services from an NGO than from
government. And they are more concerned about the welfare of African women
than most African men.
NGOs are often the only safety net between tough structural adjustment
programmes and abject poverty.
At Kikuyu Hospital, one of the oldest mission hospitals in Kenya, Ms
Margaret Waweru, the administrator, says: 'We are seeing a growing number of
patients who feel government hospitals no longer provide adequate services.'
This is particularly true since Kenya's state hospitals started charging for
services. Because Kikuyu manufactures its own drugs, it can sell them to
patients at a fraction of the market cost.
The mission hospital has also become the main referral centre for eye
surgery in the country, because the infrastructure once available in state
hospitals - drugs, surgical instruments, equipment - has collapsed.
Many of the doctors working at Kikuyu left the state health service in
frustration. 'It was very demoralising not to have the basic means to do
your job,' says one of the eye surgeons. 'It's not a question of pay. Medics
prefer working for NGOs because they know they will have the resources to
work well."
In the 1980s, it was common for NGOs to try to duplicate government
services, Now the emphasis has shifted to working alongside government to
strengthen their services.
Kikuyu hospital runs training programmes for ophthalmologists in the state
health service. In Zambia, Oxfam and Unicef have played a pivotal role in
the rehabilitation of primary health clinics. And in Uganda, charities such
as Save the Children Fund are supplying medical kits, essential drugs and
salary top-ups for government health workers.
But NGOs are not a panacea for Africa's ills: 'At best, we can only provide
patchwork solutions,' says Friar Arnold Grol, the founder of an NGO called
Undugu Society.
The charitable nature of NGOs has also shielded them from public scrutiny.
There are very few studies on the effectiveness of NGOs in alleviating
poverty. Do they provide cost-effective services? Are NGO projects
sustainable in the long run? And what happens to these projects when
expatriate staff leave?
One limited study, conducted by Britain's Overseas Development Institute,
found a mixed bag of results. This is hardly surprising, given the thousands
of NGOs, both foreign and indigenous, now operating in Africa.
However, the study drew some interesting conclusions. Where poverty
alleviation did occur, improvement was modest. There was little evidence to
suggest that beneficiaries had managed to escape from poverty on a permanent
basis, while few projects demonstrated potential to sustain themselves once
an NGO ceased operating in the area.
Credit-focused initiatives were found to be costly to administer due to the
expense of monitoring large numbers of small loans. Few of the schemes
became self-sustaining or self-administered. Drought or disaster quickly
increased default on loans and eroded the capital base of these small
lending ventures.
But perhaps the greatest weakness of NGOs lies in their narrow focus. Often,
projects fail because the wider economic or social context is not taken into
account. In Ghana, a US-funded project to raise maize productivity was so
successful that it collapsed when local markets were flooded with maize and
prices plummetted. An engineering workshop making ox-ploughs in Acholi,
western Uganda, went out of business when bandits started stealing cattle in
the region. Another common temptation is for NGOs to create an artificial or
temporary demand for produce or skills they are trying to develop. The
activity collapses when NGOs stop purchasing the goods.
These weaknesses notwithstanding, the NGO's seem set to play an increasingly
important role in efforts to resolve Africa's development crisis.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (12): Fresh hope of
progress - Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ZAMBIAN copper industry is a useful exemplar of mining in Africa. During
the late 1950s to the early 1970s there was growth and diversification. The
post-colonial era, however, saw an increased state involvement which caused
a decline in efficiency and profitability.
The 1990s, however, have brought hope of progress. Although statistics are
hard to come by, the anecdotal evidence of greater interest in Africa by
international resource groups is overwhelming. Most of the work is
exploration, but further investment is bound to follow.
One reason for the upsurge in interest is that other mining areas are fully
exploited. Also, an effective environmental lobby means much of the
developed world is becoming increasingly hostile to mining companies.
Africa, by contrast, still tolerates some environmental degradation.
Favourable policy reforms, however, have also contributed to a healthier
investment climate. In Zambia, for example, the government's commitment to
market economics and privatisation brought an upsurge in foreign interest.
Prospecting licences, mostly for copper and gold, have been issued to Phelps
Dodge of the US and South African mining houses including Anglo American,
JCI and Anglovaal.
In Ghana, liberalised mining investment laws have attracted Dollars 900m of
new capital and helped to quadruple the country's gold production to 1m
ounces a year since 1986. The government has plans to double production to
2m ounces a year by 1997. Much of the expansion will come from the rich
Ashanti mine, but gold deposits in western Ghana have also attracted
investors.
And in Zimbabwe, Mr Derek Bain of the Chamber of Mines says exploration 'is
the greatest it has ever been'. Most hope lies in platinum where BHP, Delta
Gold, Anglo, RTZ and Union Carbide all have interests. Mr Alan McKerron,
head of Anglo's New mining business division, says the example of Ghana is
spreading to other countries.
Further bolstering economic liberalisation is the 'conditionality' of
multilateral financial bodies. Mr Bernard van Rooyen, executive director of
Gold Fields, comments: 'Politicians are increasingly willing, but there is
also a degree of compulsion because the only funds are from the World Bank
and IFC and you won't get funds if you don't toe the market line.'
Mr John Fernyhough, head of South African Sales at SG Warburg in London,
argues that there is considerable pent-up interest in Africa among North
American mining houses. Given political stability, Mr Fernyhough argues,
these companies will pile into Africa.
In its 1989 report, sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth,
the World Bank concluded: 'Mineral production could (and should) become an
important source of growth in many African countries. But this potential
will not be fully realised unless a mutually beneficial partnership is
established between government and investors.' That partnership may now be
taking shape.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (13): Reformers lose
their way - Public sector and privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORMERS have least to show for their efforts in the broad field of public
sector restructuring, including privatisation. Opposition from vested
interests is powerful, technical and institutional capacity is weak,
undeveloped capital markets constrain the sell-off of state corporations,
many of which are so rundown that there are few buyers anyway.
To make matters worse the reformers themselves seem to have lost their way.
IMF and World Bank programmes play the numbers game, requiring governments
to reduce the public service payroll as a condition for financial support.
Staff cuts without improved efficiency have merely led to accelerated
deterioration of the administration, and the very social services - health
and education - that the donors are anxious to strengthen.
A similar situation has arisen in the parastatal sector. Donor demands for
an end to subsidies have resulted in swingeing price increases - again with
very little discernible impact on efficiency and the quality of service.
Operating losses and subsidies have been reduced, but frequently at
long-term cost to the economy in terms of inflation, declining service and
reduced investment.
The damage done to the public sector was highlighted by a recent speech by
the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox. He admitted that
between them the donors and African governments, have undermined capacity in
the region. This will take a generation or longer to reverse, during which
time structural adjustment will be constrained by a weak public sector.
There are no accurate data on the size of the African public sector. World
Bank figures show public enterprise activity accounting for as much as 70
per cent of GDP in Malawi and 58 per cent in Tanzania, while in 1991 Ghana
(the regional success story) had 329 parastatals, Mozambique 250 and
Cameroon 147. The public enterprise share of total employment was as high as
60 per cent in Mozambique at the end of the 1980s, more than a third in
Burundi and Cote d'Ivoire and over a fifth in Ghana.
On the positive side, dozens of countries are committed to liquidating,
selling-off or radically restructuring and commercialising their state-owned
enterprises, but progress is slow.
In Ghana the privatisation agency reported 21 sell-offs in 1991, but 11 of
these were back in the state's portfolio a year later.
Frequently too, privatisation has taken the form of a reduction in the
state's equity holding rather than a complete sale or even loss of effective
control.
Much of the region's privatisation has taken place in just five countries -
Ghana, Guinea, Mozambique, Nigeria and Senegal. The proceeds of divestment
are no more than Dollars 15m in Ghana while in Nigeria total receipts are
less than 5 per cent of government equity. So for all the publicity
surrounding parastatal reform, progress has been modest - indeed, in no
single country has reform taken root.
Few African countries have been willing to set up strong joint-venture style
privatisation agencies with active foreign participation from banks,
accountancy firms and management consultants.
And even if privatisation can be accelerated, this will still leave the
problem of the weak public service. If functions ranging from tax and
customs administration to education and health continue to be deprived of
adequate funding and subjected to capricious political interventions,
overall economic performance will suffer. The challenge of the 1990s is not
just to sort out Africa's public enterprises, but even more urgently to
rebuild the institutional capacity that has been allowed to decay for the
past 20 years.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (11): In search of a
kick-start - Private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most important challenges facing Africa in the 1990s is that of
kickstarting the private sector. But as Sir William Ryrie, retiring
executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
says, Africa is the only region in the developing world where public sector
investment exceeds that of private enterprise. More than half the region's
investment is funded from aid.
This low level of private investment cannot be attributed to a shortage of
entrepreneurship, says Sir William, noting that since the African Project
Development Facility was launched in 1986, over 2,000 entrepreneurs have
sought its assistance,
The IFC - the World Bank group's private sector arm - has launched four main
initiatives in the region:
More than 23 governments have been advised by the IFC's Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS) on how to attract direct investment from abroad. The
IFC itself has invested in large energy sector projects in Cameroon and
Nigeria and in the Ashanti Gold Mine in Ghana. Much is expected from small
enterprise development programmes, seen as a partial solution to the
region's escalating unemployment problem and also as an area where Africa
has comparative advantage. In Ghana, for example, small enterprise accounts
for more than 80 per cent of manufacturing employment. Access to finance is
probably the main constraint on small firm expansion and the IFC's African
Enterprise Fund targets its lending and investment activities on small
businesses, funding some 58 projects in 18 countries since its inception.
The IFC has assisted 10 countries in privatisation programmes, though
progress has been slow.
The fourth initiative is fostering capital market development.
The World Bank's private sector programme has a broadly similar focus.
Initially, its support for private sector development targeted
infrastructural investment to complement industrial and agricultural
projects. This changed in the 1980s as the Bank focused on specific
obstacles to private sector growth, launching its Private Sector Development
Programme in 1989, with three main objectives - creating an enabling
business environment, restructuring the public sector and promoting
financial sector development. In the 18 months to mid-1992, it financed 42
projects in 24 sub-Saharan countries. In addition to its support of
privatisation, the Bank is working to strengthen the role of the state
through capacity-building and institution-building investments. In the
financial sector, its main task has been regulatory reform, including
liberalising interest rates, allied with institutional reform including
restructuring ailing banks, and establishing appropriate systems for
prudential regulation and bank supervision.
Yet there remain formidable obstacles. In Kenya, for example, a study found
that the average company needs 15 licences a year to operate, taking some
223 staff hours to acquire. Backhanders add 66 per cent to legal fees while
total costs including 'irregular charges' amounted to more than a fifth of
incremental profits. Given the scepticism over an early return of foreign
investment, the donors are right to bang the small enterprise drum. But in a
world where retailers and consumers want increasingly sophisticated quality
products, and where modern technology and scale economies demand heavy
investment, it is difficult to see small business playing more than a
residual role.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (9): Thrown into the
deep end - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<TEXT>
FEW yardsticks measure Africa's marginalisation better than its share of
global manufacturing activity. In 1980, manufacturing value added (MVA) in
sub-Saharan Africa totalled Dollars 12bn - 0.4 per cent of the global total
if South Africa is excluded, or Dollars 30.5bn (1.1 per cent) including
South Africa. Ten years later, in 1990, the region's share had slipped to
0.9 per cent; though if South Africa is left out, it remained at 0.4 per
cent.
By 1980, it had become clear that misguided, if well-intentioned, attempts
to promote industrialisation had saddled the continent with a battery of
inefficient, internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms, many owned
by governments.
Since then, structural adjustment measures - especially trade
liberalisation, tariff reform, exchange rate devaluation, deregulation,
positive real interest rates and privatisation - have changed the rules of
the game. Industries that grew up behind tariff walls and import controls -
many of which should never have been established - were thrown into the deep
end of global competition.
Macroeconomic stability aside, the most important single factor in
industrial adjustment has been establishing - and sustaining - competitive
exchange rates. Given the size of the domestic market and high inflation,
substantial devaluation has been necessary to re-establish competitiveness
in both domestic and export markets.
Also crucial is the simplification of import regimes to ensure that
manufacturers importing raw materials or parts do not face bureaucratic
hurdles and heavy import taxes.
Critics of structural adjustment claim that the reform package implies
de-industrialisation, destroying domestic capacity and favouring imports.
World Bank researchers insist that there is no evidence for this, pointing
out that in nine countries where macropolicies improved, manufacturing
output grew substantially faster than before adjustment.
Ultimately, though, there is only so much policymakers can achieve.
Thereafter, it is up to private initiative and investment, which is where
the problem arises. Abundant raw materials and low-cost labour are no longer
enough. Technical and managerial skills, scientific and marketing know-how,
prompt deliveries and high-quality products are essential, achieved
primarily by foreign investment by global companies. In 1990, for instance,
Singapore's manufacturing output was almost half that of the entire African
continent, due in large part to the presence of some 3,000 affiliates and
subsidiaries of multinationals.
Unido figures show African productivity levels at about one tenth of those
of north American manufacturers - the comparative figure for Asia is 18 per
cent. But because average wages in Africa are less than 9 per cent of the
north American level, as against 16 per cent in Asia, sub-Saharan producers
still have a competitive edge on cost grounds. However, this is not enough;
the key role of human capital cannot be exaggerated. In the 20 years to
1990, Africa's productivity rate - relative to north America - fell from 16
per cent to 10.5 per cent, while Asia raised productivity to 18 per cent
from 12 per cent. But the most important factor in productivity is the
region's low levels of investment in physical plant and in human capital.
Government policy will help but the turnround in African industry will
depend on the return of the foreign investors. So long as they remain
scarce, so too will Africa's industrial capacity.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (10): An optimistic
outlook - Stock markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<TEXT>
PROBABLY there is more optimism and enthusiasm about stock market
development in Africa than about any other aspect of the business landscape.
The strong rebound in Latin American markets since the end of the 1980s
shows what could happen in sub-Saharan Africa as reform programmes take
hold.
Zimbabwe's experience is a case in point. Reforms introduced mid-year,
including reduced taxes and guaranteed free exit for dividends and
disinvestment proceeds, saw the ZSE index rise more than 50 per cent, driven
by an influx of more than Dollars 2m in foreign money.
Initiatives from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private
investment agencies will boost the sector. In mid-1991, there were no funds
operating in the region, but in the past two years, a number have been
established, most notably the Africa Growth Fund (a venture capital
vehicle), the Commonwealth Equity Fund, the Emerging Markets Fund and the
Mauritius Fund, while London-based Genesis Emerging Markets Fund has minor
African holdings.
Also active in the fund field is the Wall Street-based Aidoo group, headed
by a Ghanaian American, Judith Aidoo, which earlier in the year formed an
investment advisory arm, Aidoo Group Asset Management. AGAM plans to market
African fixed-interest and equity securities to US investors. Initially, it
is using a niche market approach seeking to interest expatriate Africans
living in the US and elsewhere in investing back home, while also targeting
black Americans. The fund, of about Dollars 20m to Dollars 30m is likely to
be followed by a purely equity fund at a later stage.
South Africa comes into the picture here too, with scope for reversing the
sanctions process of pension funds and institutional investors that divested
from the country during the sanctions era. Ms Aidoo is also developing
innovative ways of tapping into privatisation and debt restructuring
financings. One of these involves linking the Clinton administration's
proposed 'Russia Fund', designed to finance Russian privatisation, with debt
relief for African countries that owe money to the Russians. Angola,
Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia together owe the
former Soviet Union some Dollars 14bn. She suggests that Russia should sell
its African debt to western donors in the G-7 group at deep discounts.
The Aidoo group puts the market value of African debt owed to Russia at no
more than 10c in the dollar. So a Pounds 1bn Russia privatisation fund could
purchase Dollars 10bn of the total Dollars 14bn African debt owed to Russia.
The purchasers could then either cancel the debt outright or use it for
debt-for-nature or debt-equity swaps.
Debt trade is also a growing area. The Aidoo group estimates the outstanding
debt paper at around Dollars 180bn - or almost 30 per cent of the global
market in emerging market debt - covering 60 to 70 issues with an annual
turnover of some Dollars 13bn. Prices range up to 50 per cent of nominal
value, but the average is lower at around 15 per cent. This year, Salomon
Brothers in New York calculated Nigerian par bonds were the highest yielding
collateralised Brady bond paper in the market, offering a yield of some 15
per cent compared with 9.3 per cent for Mexico.
But the fundamental need is the return of sub-Saharan Africa's 'stock' of
flight capital, which may exceed 80 per cent of GDP, according to the World
Bank calculations. Only after Africans show themselves willing to invest in
their own countries will foreigners follow.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (8): Devaluation is
overdue - CFA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PUBLIC, World Bank officials bite their lips at the mention of the CFA
franc zone, and the severe economic difficulties of its 13 west and central
African member states, In private, they tear out their hair.
Fixing their currencies to the French franc and to each other was once a
guarantee of low inflation and economic stability for the members - Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. Now this monetary
union is transmitting a recession across the region.
Since 1985, the combination of declining commodity prices, lax domestic
fiscal and monetary policies and the appreciation of the French franc
against the US dollar mean that the CFA group have suffered a huge real
exchange rate appreciation of more than 30 per cent as the chart shows. The
result was an immediate and sharp loss of competitiveness for exporters from
the CFA zone. By 1991, average wages in Senegal, for example, had risen as a
proportion of average income to three times the level in Ghana and six times
that of Indonesia. The CFA franc is now about 30 per cent overvalued.
This loss of competitiveness delivered a downward deflationary spiral in the
CFA zone, fed by deflationary macroeconomic policies as countries tried to
control the fiscal deficits that this shock opened up. Real output per head
in the CFA countries had risen by around 2 per cent in the first half of the
1980s. It fell by an average 5 per cent a year between 1986 and 1991.
Neither the French government nor the CFA members are willing to recognise
either that the French franc-CFA parity, unbroken since 1948, is at the
heart of the crisis or that a substantial CFA devaluation may now be the
only way to preserve the zone. Instead, the CFA countries have tried to
correct their severe external and fiscal imbalances through fiscal austerity
and attempted wage restraint without recourse to devaluation. Most of the
group have tried to adopt World Bank-style adjustment programmes in the late
1980s.
The results have been disastrous. Battling against an uncompetitive exchange
rate, growing capital flight, a powerful and a restive civil service, most
of the CFA countries have been unable to meet the demanding macroeconomic
and structural targets that internal adjustment demands. The poor have
suffered at the expense of the urban elite able, with the help of aid flows,
to preserve their purchasing power. In Niger and Chad, the civil service
wage bill exceeds total tax revenue.
The result is what bank officials call a 'silent crisis'. Inflation is low,
there are goods in the shops and civil servants are still being paid. But
poverty is rising, the infrastructure decaying: without devaluation combined
with tight control on civil service salaries, the crisis will deepen.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (7): Still caught in
the vice - Foreign debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and EDWARD BALLS

<TEXT>
OF ALL the problems in Africa's post-independence legacy that now have to be
resolved, few are more burdensome and debilitating than external debt.
In 1962, the outstanding debts of all sub-Saharan African countries were
less than Dollars 3bn, with a debt service ratio of less than 2 per cent,
says Dr Percy Mistry, a former World Bank economist who has written
extensively about African debt. By 1990 debt exceeded Dollars 146bn,
equivalent to 110 per cent of GDP; service payments would take up three
times its annual export earnings.
Dr Mistry traces the build-up over three phases. The rush to borrow, which
began with the commodities boom that followed the first oil price increase
in 1973, came to a sudden end in the wake of the second oil shock. Between
1978 and 1982, high interest rates and deteriorating terms of trade for
Africa meant that sub-Saharan debt soared to Dollars 72bn with a further
Dollars 8bn in arrears. The third phase continues: the struggle to manage an
ever-increasing debt well beyond Africa's capacity to service, let alone
repay.
'Although it seems almost incredible in retrospect,' writes Dr Mistry,
'international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank used
little of their influence to curb extravagant and unsustainable programmes
of public expenditure financed by external borrowing.'
Some of the white elephants from this era are carcasses, others are still on
their feet. Grand conference centres, airports, steel mills and hotels dot
the African landscape. With better management, some might have been viable;
most should not have got beyond the drawing board.
The most prominent survivor is Nigeria's Ajaokuta steel mill, conceived in
the 1970s. Even with the project cost written off, it will be a net loser of
foreign exchange when operating. Yet successive Nigerian governments have
refused to write-off a Dollars 5bn project that will be a liability for its
lifetime.
The institutions remain reluctant to intervene. Nigeria today seeks further
rescheduling of its Dollars 34bn debt. But neither the Bank nor the Fund has
so far been prepared to add the scrapping of Ajaokuta to the list of
conditions for debt relief. The burden extends beyond the Ajaokutas of
Africa. The time and energy of finance ministers and senior officials is
spent in seemingly endless rounds of external-debt negotiations.
Debt initiatives over recent years have had a limited impact. Between 1989
and 1991 some Dollars 10bn of concessional debt was written off, with most
donor countries converting concessional bilateral loans to grants, while
official creditors have applied enhanced Toronto terms to a dozen low-income
countries. The more generous Trinidad terms (which would write off up to two
thirds of official debt) have rarely been applied.
But the World Bank says a permanent, and workable, solution must go further:
'The enhanced Toronto terms and the Trinidad terms are not enough to ensure
that African countries can service external debts in the medium and long
term as scheduled. A more radical approach is needed.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (5): In need of
investment - Ghana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GHANA'S achievements since its Economic Recovery Programme began in 1983
shows that adjustment works, say its proponents. Real incomes per head have
grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent
a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began.
World Bank officials argue that Ghana shows that adjustment, if properly
pursued, need not mean greater poverty or fiscal austerity. The share of tax
revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. And the sketchy evidence, according
to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on
average, adjustment has shifted resources from the richer urban areas to the
poorer, rural regions.
Nor can this growth record be explained by aid flows alone. Ghana remains
heavily dependent on gross aid flow, totalling 8 per cent of GDP a year.
But, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses, the net resource
transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared with a
sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent.
There is another factor in Ghana's success, which World Bank officials
prefer not to talk about: politics. Ghana's former military government has
consistently tried to align its interests with the rural poor. The
government also built an impressive record, over 10 years, before putting
its popularity to the test at last autumn's elections.
Ghana's record does seem to show that structural adjustment is necessary for
an acceleration in economic growth. But it also demonstrates that successful
structural adjustment is insufficient for an accelerated growth and a rapid
fall in poverty. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for
population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower
middle-income countries.
The government plans to accelerate its growth rate to 8 per cent a year over
the next decade, but it lags far behind its east Asian competition in all
areas of social and physical infrastructure, and the civil service is weak.
Meanwhile, the domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow
commodity base for export earnings, manufacturing exports are tiny, foreign
investment minimal. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in
Ghana in 1990, compared with 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32
per cent in Thailand. Success will be assured only when, and if, this
investment starts to flow. Failure would be a serious blow to adjustment in
Africa.

than most - Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE climbed, reluctantly, aboard the structural adjustment bandwagon in
1991, largely jettisoning the ideological baggage that so constrained the
economy during the 1980s. The five-year programme started badly, primarily
due to the worst drought in living memory, global recession and high
interest rates.
Few of the programme's quantitative targets are likely to be met by 1995.
Real GDP, programmed to increase 25 per cent over the five years, will have
fallen some 2 per cent by the end of this year, with the result that incomes
today are around their levels of 20 years ago. Even if all goes well over
the next two years, it will take conceivably until the turn of the century
for income per head to regain its 1990 levels.
Initial programme-funding targets have proved wildly optimistic and the
government has been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for an
extended structural adjustment facility, as well as stepping up its reliance
on aid.
Fiscal targets have been missed - for which the drought is blamed - and last
year's budget deficit of 11.3 per cent was well above the 6.6 per cent
programme target. Exports, which by 1993 were supposed to have reached some
Dollars 2,150m, are languishing around Dollars 1,500m, and will fall
substantially short of the 1995 target of Dollars 2.6bn - the World Bank's
forecast, of tobacco exports doubling by the late 1990s, being a classic
example of confusing a short-term blip with a long-term trend.
In the past six months, the pace of reform has quickened, though
heel-dragging continues in the parastatal sector.
On the positive side, finance minister Bernard Chidzero, in a remarkably
opaque budget presentation in July, promised to halve the budget deficit to
5.4 per cent of GDP this year, by keeping spending growth to half the
inflation rate while revenue rises more than a quarter.
Investment is gradually - grudgingly - being liberalised, as are exchange
controls. Individuals may now hold foreign currency deposit accounts in
Zimbabwe banks, repatriating 'flight capital' on a no-questions-asked basis.
In mid-year, Mr Chidzero opened a window to portfolio investment,
guaranteeing free remittability of dividends and profits to foreign
investors who buy shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.
The main obstacle to foreign investment remains exchange control, which
discriminates against the country's traditional - and loyal - investors, who
were in Zimbabwe before independence in 1980. Trade is being liberalised,
with exporters allowed to retain half their export earnings - and this will
increase to 60 per cent at the end of the year - and a further 20 per cent
of imports on open general licence.
In July, too, important moves to liberalise agricultural marketing were
announced, and a commodity exchange now operates out of Harare, trading in
the main agricultural exports. But because there has been more pain than
gain, so far as the man in the street is concerned, the Economic Structural
Adjustment Programme is extremely unpopular.
With elections scheduled by March 1995, some slippage in implementation
seems more than probable. The politically-driven, and very popular, land
designation programme - by which government can compulsorily acquire
commercially-owned farmland for resettlement purposes - is incompatible with
some of the government's more progressive policies designed to attract
foreign investment.
In the final analysis, Zimbabwe has a better chance than most of breaking
the African mould and making a success of economic reform. Should it fail,
it will have much to do with institutional and political shortcomings, and
the over-indulgent attitude of some donors, specifically the World Bank.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (4): Adjustment
abandoned - Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL structural adjustment in Nigeria, the region's second largest
economy after South Africa and its most populous nation, would have created
the positive demonstration effect the continent needs so desperately. But it
was not to be.
A year after seizing power, in August 1985, General Babangida's military
administration launched a bold reform, unpopularly known as SAP (Structural
Adjustment Programme). The naira was devalued 66 per cent, import licensing
was abolished, tariffs were partially restructured, most prices were
deregulated, a privatisation programme was launched and monetary reforms
introduced. But the follow-through was weak; within 18 months, growing
public opposition to some of the measures, spearheaded by those who had lost
their preferential access to foreign currency, import licences and other
'rents', forced the government to back down.
With hindsight, the reflationary 1988 budget can be said to have marked the
end of effective reform. Nigeria's IMF programme began to collapse, and by
mid-1993 the country's arrears on external debt and trade payments were put
at more than Dollars 6bn. If failure could be attributed to a single factor,
it would have to be the military's inability to control public spending.
Substantial amounts of oil revenue - estimated at 200,000 barrels a day -
were siphoned off into 'off-budget' accounts and never accounted for.
Revenue-gathering efforts were stunted by the government's refusal to tax
domestic fuel consumption realistically and by massive evasion of border
taxes on imports. With a narrow revenue base substantially reliant on oil,
the budget deficit over the SAP period from 1986 averaged 7.7 per cent,
compared with 7 per cent in the pre-adjustment period.
SAP had its positive aspects, notably a distinct culture change within
Nigerian business: there is no support for a return to import licensing and
direct controls. In agriculture, food crop production went up 60 per cent
and export crops rose almost 45 per cent. Manufacturing saw strong growth in
textiles, with output more than doubling during 1986-89, having fallen 40
per cent between 1981 and 1986. Privatisation fell short, with 68
parastatals being fully or partially privatised by 1992, compared with a
target of 111 enterprises.
One central lesson is that, even with a 'big bang' approach, as in 1986-87,
adjustment cannot work unless the momentum of reform is maintained in
several different key areas simultaneously. When it came to the crunch in
1988, the political will was not there, and the country is now in crisis.

prosperity - Foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SUB-SAHARAN Africa has missed out on the surge in global foreign direct
investment (FDI) during the 1980s. Investment inflows into Africa, relative
to GDP, are half the level of those elsewhere. After averaging Dollars 1bn
annually during the first half of the 1980s - of which three quarters went
to oil exporting countries - FDI accelerated during the 1987-91 period
averaging Dollars 1.7bn. Almost half (Dollars 830m) went to Nigeria, and
another Dollars 190m to other oil exporters.
The region's stock of foreign investment was estimated by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development at some Dollars 11bn, with South Africa
accounting for a further Dollars 11bn. Zimbabwe and Nigeria each account for
19 per cent, with Gabon in third place (13 per cent), followed by Liberia
with 12.5 per cent and Cote d'Ivoire with just under 10 per cent. Between
them, these five countries accounted for three quarters of the region's
foreign-owned capital stock.
Not only is the region's foreign-owned capital stock small and highly
concentrated, but it has also been falling. Excluding South Africa, the
inward stock of foreign capital fell 45 per cent in the 1980s, mainly
reflecting currency devaluation. In 1980, the sub-Saharan share of global
inward investment was 4.5 per cent, but 10 years later it was 0.7 per cent.
Inward investment declined from 7.5 per cent of the third world total during
the 1981-86 period to 5.5 per cent, two thirds of which was oil sector
investment. One reason is Africa's failure to broaden its investment base.
While FDI flows to other continents have diversified into manufacturing and
services away from resource-intensive activity, Africa's chief attraction
remains its energy and mining potential. Sluggish economic growth, poor
returns, a shortage of skills and small markets continue to deter
investment.
The key to attracting foreign inflows is the availability of relatively
cheap skilled, technical and supervisory labour, crucial to meeting quality
standards that are increasingly important in global marketing. Africa is
also at a serious disadvantage in terms of both location and infrastructure.
But the greatest deterrent to FDI inflows has been government hostility
towards multinationals. That is changing, but the results - outside the
energy sector - have been disappointing. Hardly surprising, for in the late
1980s, the return on capital was lower than anywhere else in the third
world, except Latin America. But Africa's politicians now realise
multinationals may not bring in substantial foreign capital but will provide
the technology, expertise and market access Africa needs.

Some are inclined to write Africa off as hopeless. Others see Africa as a
special case to which the principles of economics do not apply. I reject
such views. It is our approach that has failed. Africa has not . . . We need
to bear in mind that Afro-pessimism is widespread in the world outside. We
face a challenge. We must overcome the pessimists.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, December 1992
FOR THOSE who seek culprits to blame for Africa's deepening economic crisis,
there are many candidates: the lingering legacy of the colonial era, the
harsh dictates of World Bank structural adjustment programmes, the miserly
aid and restrictive trade policies of developed country governments and the
kleptocratic tendencies of Africa's own governing elite.
So-called 'Afro-pessimists' and their gloomy appraisals make an easier
target for those who are reluctant to confront the true dimensions of
Africa's crisis.
Yet the facts tell their own story. After a dozen years of structural
adjustment and more than Dollars 170bn in net development assistance, the
sub-Saharan economy is still falling behind. Incomes per head fell by an
average 1.1 per cent a year between 1982 and 1992 compared to an average
rise of 0.8 per cent a year in all developing countries and 6.4 per cent in
the east Asia developing countries.
The outlook is far from encouraging, as the accompanying articles
demonstrate throughout this survey. Institutional and infrastructural
decline is accelerating, the number of countries facing political
disintegration is growing and the Aids crisis is deepening.
The aid keeps flowing, although sub-Saharan Africa cannot be sure that its
share of global aid - up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970 -
will continue to rise. But Africa is increasingly cut off from the rest of
the world economy - there is little evidence to suggest that either
returning flight capital or foreign investment can fill the gap between
Africa's capital needs and its ability to generate domestic savings.
The combination of half-hearted policy reform, some debt relief, and
substantial aid is expected to continue to slow the pace, rather than
reverse the direction, of this relative and absolute decline. The World Bank
expects African real incomes per head to rise by 0.6 per cent a year over
the next decade compared to 2.9 per cent for all developing countries and
5.9 per cent in east Asia.
Still, as the World Bank rightly says, the gloom can be overdone. Across the
continent, human development indicators have improved over the past two
decades. Infant mortality has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1973
to 107 in 1991, while life expectancy has risen from 45 years to 51 years
over the same period.
Progress on these social measures of quality of life was made in the 1980s
despite adverse shifts in Africa's terms of trade, volatile commodity
prices, persisting protectionism in OECD countries, and the doubling over 10
years in the the share of Africa's export earnings which go to service
debts.
Moreover, the World Bank can correctly claim that the nature of the
obstacles to economic progress in Africa is now better understood. Ten years
ago, African governments defended to the death fixed exchange rates,
administered prices, state ownership of industry, subsidies to parastatals,
cheap food for urban workers and negative real interest rates while the
private sector was regarded with suspicion.
Now most governments accept, at least in principle, that establishing
macro-economic stability through structural adjustment policies - cutting
budget deficits, slowing inflation and monetary growth, establishing a
competitive exchange rate and eliminating obstacles to exports - is
necessary if their economies are to achieve self-sustaining economic growth.
The World Bank can point to signs of success in the handful of countries
which has taken the structural adjustment advice to heart - most notably
Ghana but also Uganda, Burkina Faso and until recently, Malawi - as evidence
that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for progress. Since
Ghana's adjustment programme began, its gross domestic product has grown by
an average of 4.9 per cent a year, over twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1
per cent.
Equally powerfully, the Bank can point to the deepening recessions in the
member countries of the French African Community (CFA) zone to demonstrate
that governments cannot pick and mix items from the adjustment agenda.
Between 1986 and 1991, cumulative losses in competitiveness cut the output
of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. GDP in the other
16 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an
average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period, compared to a fall of 0.2
per cent annually in the first half of the decade.
WHY DO the economies of sub-Saharan Africa continue to perform so poorly?
There are two broad explanations. First, most African governments have not
been willing to pay more than lip-service to the need for structural
adjustment. Second, the experience of those countries which have tried to
keep to the spirit, as well as the letter, of World Bank programmes suggests
that structural adjustment is far from sufficient to deliver sustainable
economic growth.
In country after country the political commitment to economic reform has not
been maintained. Of 26 adjusting countries, in 1990-91 only one  - Ghana -
was judged by the World Bank research department to have an adequate
macro-economic policy stance. In another 14 the stance was found to be fair,
while in the remaining 11 it was rated either poor or very poor.
One reason that adjustment is hard to sustain is that it takes many years to
deliver results, much longer than the World Bank and the IMF were originally
prepared to admit. But the deeper problem is that economic reform invariably
runs counter to the interests of the urban elites who dominate government in
Africa. Many African rulers are politically dependent on the patronage and
corruption which regulations and secrecy conceal and which reforms are
designed to root out.
Kenya and Nigeria are prime examples of countries whose governments, in
spite of the glaring need for adjustment, have never been able to maintain
the reform momentum for long - too many powerful Nigerians benefit from the
rewards that a distorted foreign exchange market deliver to those with a
banking licence.
Ghana, by contrast, has sustained adjustment, in part because its military
government consistently aligned its interests with those of the rural poor
rather than the richer urban elite which probably stands to lose more from
adjustment in the early stages. The rural vote secured the election of
Flight Lt Jerry Rawlings as president last December.
The donors have, rightly, come under fire for their willingness to conceal
what they know of the activities of African governments. For all its talk of
'good governance', the World Bank has never been willing to require that its
client governments observe minimum levels of transparency, accountability
and access to information, or apply these tests to its own dealings with
African governments.
The Bank often finds itself standing between unsuccessful governments and
their electorates and withholding vital information on the state of the
economy, and presenting overly optimistic progress reports that do no
service to the reform cause. In Nigeria, the World Bank remains willing to
conceal the extent to which the government siphons off an estimated 200,000
barrels of oil a day for its own off-budget purposes. In Zimbabwe, Bank
officials recently submitted wildly optimistic export and growth numbers to
their executive board to support a loan application.
But the shortcomings of African governments, and the unwillingness of Bank
officials to disclose unpalatable facts, are only part of the story. The
absence of political instability and corruption, and the adoption of the
full adjustment agenda is not, it seems, enough to deliver a significant
growth take-off.
In a handful of cases, there has been an impressive supply-side response.
The Mauritian miracle is the most convincing, but the response of farmers
and textile manufacturers in Nigeria, of clothing exporters in Zimbabwe and
tourist operators in Kenya and Tanzania, all reflect only partial success.
One reason is that the non-farm private sector is too small to exploit the
new opportunities. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in
Ghana in 1990 compared to 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per
cent in rapidly growing Thailand.
Across Africa, the private sector is dominated by a handful of
multinationals and hundreds of small-scale enterprises. Those medium-sized
companies which do exist are primarily service-orientated and often
dependent on the regulations and tariff walls that adjustment policies
dismantle.
Meanwhile, global companies have been slow to return. The post-1970
deterioration in commodity prices, the increasing need for skilled rather
than merely plentiful and cheap labour, and the increased emphasis on short
lead times and quality over cost, all make it harder for Africa to sell
itself as a location for foreign direct investment. Even successful
adjusters have not shed the reputation of being high-risk, low-return
locations.
Africa does not have the social and physical infrastructure requirements
that multinationals increasingly demand. Standards of literacy lag behind
those of the east Asian developing economies, while the public
infrastructure, education and health systems have deteriorated across the
continent.
Even when governments are getting macroeconomic policies right,
implementation on the ground - in the central bank, at the tax office, at
the customs desk - is proving much more difficult. The reason acknowledged
in a recent speech by the Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox,
is the region's deteriorating institutional capacity. The Bank group lends
Dollars 4bn a year to sub-Saharan Africa but has Dollars 14bn waiting to be
dispersed.
The World Bank now concedes that some of its performance yardsticks - a
reduction in the number of public servants on the payroll - are not
meaningful indicators of policy reform. Laying off road-workers makes little
impact on the wage bill, has no impact at all on administrative efficiency
and invariably means increased road maintenance charges later.
Reducing the role of the state has left a vacuum - filled in many instances
by the donors and non-governmental organisations. In reality, the shift of
control in Africa is not from the state to the private sector or to the
market but to the donors.
Aid dependence has become aid addiction. Mr Jaycox argues that by
substituting expatriate management for domestic skills, donors are
'systematically destroying capacity that does exist'. This is much worse
than it sounds given the long lead time necessary to rebuild that capacity.
The result is a disturbing contradiction between the desire for private
sector and market-oriented development and the intrusive role the agencies
frequently play in project decision-making. An alarmingly high proportion of
the region's investment decisions are made by aid workers rather than the
private sector.
AFRICA can move from crisis to recovery. Given a healthier global
environment, a more robust OECD growth performance, adoption of the Uruguay
Round proposals, firmer commodity prices, fewer droughts and an end to war
and civil unrest, an acceleration in the sub-Saharan growth towards 5 per
cent a year, from 2 per cent over the past decade, is within reach.
Whether the majority of African countries can achieve even this modest
growth rate will depend on the willingness of African governments to pursue
the right policies, and on the incentives that the developed country donors
can offer to persuade governments to put long-term development before
political short-termism.
The failures of the 1980s suggest that the west, in seeking ways to speed,
rather than impede, development, must make a much clearer and public
distinction between those governments which truly embrace reform and those
which merely pay lip-service. That means offering greater rewards to those
countries - such as Ghana, Uganda and Zambia - which are demonstrating a
sustained commitment to reform, while taking a tougher stance towards those
countries - such as Kenya and Nigeria - which continue to evade
responsibility for their failures.
Lessons must be learned from Somalia: humanitarian intervention without a
political and economic framework for recovery is, at best, short-term relief
and, at worst, compounds the disaster.
Trade, aid and debt relief are the best ways to encourage success. Ghana's
ability to sustain reform over the past decade is due, in large part, to the
fact that annual gross aid flows, averaging 8 per cent of GDP, were
available almost from the moment that reform began.
But it is absurd that Ghana should, at the same time, be paying a third of
its annual export earnings in debt service to bilateral and multilateral
donors. The Ghanaian government will not request debt relief, even though it
clearly qualifies for debt reduction, for fear that these aid flows will dry
up. But the donors should be offering, to Ghana, and other successful
adjusters, much more generous packages of aid and debt relief.
The international aid community must also think hard about the ways their
activities help and hinder development in successful adjusters. The slow
pace of indigenous capacity-building means that the need for external
institutional support will remain for decades.
There is a strong case for more burden-sharing between the donors and
agencies, starting with a greater and more formalised role for
non-government organisations (NGOs), working with local communities in areas
such as primary health and education which are so important if sustainable
growth is to be achieved.
But the World Bank and the donors need, radically, to re-assess their
approach to the numerous African governments who merely flirt with economic
reform.
The 1980s evidence suggests that trying to force adjustment measures on
unwilling and corrupt regimes is counter-productive. First, the World Bank
resident representative and visiting firemen tend to become the regime's
apologist, increasingly willing to answer local critics and justify and
defend ill-designed adjustment policies on the government's behalf.
Then the Bank and the IMF become useful scapegoats when flawed and partially
implemented policies do not deliver results, a tactic that President Moi of
Kenya and ex-Presidents Kaunda of Zambia and Nyerere of Tanzania have all
exploited.
To avoid this trap, the Bank must insist that reform programmes are
home-grown rather than imposed from outside, something which Ghana's
achievements show is difficult but possible. The donors must, meanwhile, be
prepared to put political reform at the top of the agenda. What is needed is
not necessarily a change in government but rather a change in the style of
government towards more open and accountable policy formulation and debate.
Enforcing good governance requirements is much more demanding, and arguably
far more important, than requiring multi-party elections as a pre-condition
for aid. Sometimes elections help: without the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda in
the 1991 elections, Zambia would probably not have become the country with
one of the best macro-economic records in the region. But Ghana's successful
transition to civilian rule occurred, in part, because the military
government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10-year
period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's
elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very
different result.
But there is nothing democratic or economically progressive about
multi-party elections unless minimum standards of good governance are
already achieved. Last year's elections did not persuade President arap Moi
of Kenya to put past patronage policies aside and embrace accountability and
transparency. Nigeria's disastrous and flawed transition to civilian rule
shows how multi-party elections can become an excuse for not taking tough
economic decisions.
Africa's debt burden further complicates the strategy, as the Nigerian
experience again illustrates. Without debt relief, Africa's most populous
country has little hope of progress, a point that World Bank officials make
with great force. But the Paris Club creditors remain unwilling to offer
further relief to a government which consistently misuses the resources it
does control.
Across Africa, the carrot of debt relief has not been enough to persuade
half-hearted adjusters to accelerate reform - the World Bank is right to
argue that a substantial write-off of Africa's remaining debts, on more
generous terms than are currently envisaged, and taking account of differing
debt structures, is now inevitable and should occur across the board.
But debt relief should be combined with a public statement from the Bank and
the donors that, for Africa, the rules of the aid game have changed.
The Bank, and the donors, should refuse to engage in policy-based lending
with any government which does not meet minimum standards of transparency
and public access to information, including the Bank's own reports.
They must be much tougher about policing and enforcing the conditions upon
which future lending is based, including much more rigorous and rapid
internal auditing of Bank and IMF lending. If governments are not willing to
embrace the full structural adjustment agenda and good governance
requirements, then the donors should only finance humanitarian projects.
The World Bank, and the donor community, must speak out about the true state
of Africa. Telling things as they are means being more realistic about what
adjustment programmes can achieve. It means acknowledging that deregulation
and liberalisation are only a beginning, that five-year programmes are
implausibly short and that it will take many years of investment in human
and physical infrastructure before the region's institutional base is
rehabilitated.
Afro-realism means resisting the temptation to declare victory in Ghana or
Uganda or to make excuses for the shortcomings of governments in Nigeria and
Kenya. For those countries which take the structural adjustment medicine,
recovery will be long and hard. For those that do not, the chances of
progress are slim and the future looks bleak.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (1): Africa is
striving for a fresh start - Four years after the World Bank's seminal 1989
report, the continent's crisis is deepening and more children are dying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NOT SINCE the end of colonial rule, some three decades ago, has Africa been
gripped by such a fundamental struggle. At stake is the fate of a continent
battling for economic recovery against mounting odds.
Over the past handful of years, the old order has collapsed, or is on its
last legs. Apartheid has crumbled. Dictators have been overthrown, democracy
sought, and state-controlled economies have succumbed to the market.
As the world itself changed, African presidents lost the patronage of Moscow
and Washington, and donors demanded 'good governance' from previously
tolerated corrupt or mismanaged regimes.
From Lagos to Lusaka, the mood of the continent has altered dramatically as
Africa has entered a new era. Africans have fewer inhibitions about
criticising their governments, and they speak out more confidently for human
rights and against corruption.
Above all, they debate what is critical to their future: structural
adjustment - as powerful in its impact as any ideology the countries of
sub-Saharan Africa have adopted. Drawn up by the World Bank, endorsed by
other official donors and the IMF, criticised by many non-government
organisations, and often bitterly attacked within the region itself, it
shapes the lives of more than 600m Africans.
Yet some 10 years after its inception, the results are modest. As articles
elsewhere in this survey suggest, the business environment in Africa has
changed for the better. But in its crucial forthcoming review of adjustment
in Africa, provisionally entitled Progress, Payoffs and Challenges, the Bank
is expected to warn that progress falls short of expectations.
Implementation by governments has been weak, the obstacles formidable, the
time required longer than expected, the results modest, and elements of the
programme flawed.
The report is guarded in its conclusions. But the insights it provides,
together with the experiences of FT writers on the ground, point to a sombre
conclusion: structural adjustment, while essential to Africa's recovery, is
not sufficient. The African crisis is outpacing efforts to resolve it.
For millions in the region, the new era is associated with pain. Factories
have been closed, food subsidies eliminated, social services cut, as
governments seek to live within their means. The poor are the first to
suffer. 'Structural maladjustment is even more painful than adjustment,'
observes Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's long-serving finance minister. He is
sympathetic to their plight, but that is scant comfort.
Even in the most successful of the 30 or so countries in various stages of
structural adjustment, relief is modest and the road ahead long and arduous.
At present growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it
would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income
countries. The less successful have longer to wait: 'With today's poor
policies it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita
income of the mid 70s', says a Bank official.
In the meantime, Africa is being left far behind by countries which have
made better use of their resources and compete more vigorously for capital.
In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is
three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than
Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
Equally striking is Africa's declining share of developing-country exports
of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17
to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share.
'Can Africa's decline be reversed?' asked the Bank in its last important
study of the continent's plight: 'The simple answer is yes. It can be and it
must be. The alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.'
Four years later, the region remains racked by disease, disaster and debt:
the question becomes more compelling, the alternative creeps closer. The
Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4
to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well
below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population.
Today, more people in Africa are poorer, and more children are dying. Other
signs of stress are apparent, beginning with the distressing list of
countries that have effectively ceased to function as modern nation states:
Zaire, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, Angola. Hopes raised by the end of the war
in Ethiopia, the peace agreement in Mozambique, and a fragile peace pact in
Liberia, are offset by renewed civil war in Angola and Nigeria's steady
decline, and strife in Sierra Leone and Rwanda.
Former 'success' stories and 'role models' in the 1970s have since become
cautionary tales. Kenya struggles to implement economic reforms which erode
the patronage on which the ruling Kanu party has been so dependent. Cote
d'Ivoire moves deeper into difficulties that cannot be addressed until the
CFA franc is devalued, an obstacle that holds up effective economic reform
in the 13-member CFA bloc.
The collapse of the settlement in Angola and continuing violence in South
Africa raise doubts about whether, in the short term at least, southern
Africa can be the engine-room for regional growth.
Most disturbing of all, perhaps, is the concern that Africa no longer has
the adequate institutional capacity to help itself. The technological gap
between Africa and the world has widened, and the continent's management is
weak. Many schools and universities are without teaching materials. Civil
services have been neglected or politicised. The integrity of the judiciary
has been eroded.
Meanwhile, Aids takes its terrible toll. More than half of the world's 15m
sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans.
An estimated 14m will be infected by 2000; many are from the skilled urban
class on which the implementation of reform greatly depends.
Hopes that the emergence of multi-party politics would prove a simple
stepping stone to good governance have proved premature. Opposition parties
have turned out to be weak, fractious and susceptible to patronage, owing
more to ethnicity than policy for their support.
For the industrialised world, the will to help may emerge only when an
ailing Africa is seen as a threat to self-interest, in the form of
immigration to southern Europe, or a rise in Moslem extremism, growth in
drug-trafficking or health risks posed by a continent that cannot be
ring-fenced; or when it is stimulated by the loss of flora and fauna with
medicinal value, or environmental concerns.
Self-interest or humanitarian imperative, Unicef's poignant warning is
timely: 'The abandonment of hopes for the continent would mean the writing
off of the talents, aspirations and potential of one eighth of mankind, both
now and far into the next century.'
From Africa must come a new generation of leaders, committed to reform, and
tapping the same spirit that brought freedom 30 years ago. Angered by the
failures of corrupt and autocratic leaders, frustrated by economic policies
that did not deliver, impatient to recover their lost civil rights, and worn
out by wars, Africa's people are striving for a fresh start.

FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities struggle as buyers hold back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST bull run in London's equity market met its first check yesterday,
when a new intraday peak was quickly lost, and by the end of the session the
FT-SE 100 Index was barely able to hold on to the 3,100 mark, or Friday's
peak close. Modest trading volume suggested that little stock had been sold,
but the mood suddenly appeared a little less confident than last week.
UK equities at first followed the trend in other European stock markets, and
an advance of 14.5 points took the Footsie to 3,115.1. Share prices were
also helped initially by further gains in British government bonds, where
long-dated interest yields dipped to only just above 7 per cent. Falling
bond yields have been providing support for equities, and the stock market
reacted sharply late yesterday when bond prices were trimmed.
Much of the session focused on the market's attempt to hold on to the 3,100
level, which was lost briefly early in the afternoon. With the market now
evidently looking vulnerable to profit-taking, some strategists suggested
that a convincing fall below 3,100 might provoke a significant setback.
Marketmakers were still short of stock yesterday and quickly came in to buy
at the day's low point of 3,096.6, and the market rallied to a close on the
FT-SE 100 of 3,100.0, a loss of a mere 0.6 on the day. Further attempts to
test the level of support for the 3,100 mark are believed likely this week,
however.
The picture was much the same across the full range of the market, with the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index finally stand-ing a net 1.4 off at 3,511.9.
Seaq volume fell away sharply to 476.1m shares, with non-Footsie stocks
showing increased activity to make up about 63 per cent of the total. On
Friday, Seaq volume of 529.2m shares was worth Pounds 1.25bn in retail
value, holding up to recent daily averages.
With autumn now overshadowing a stock market that has enjoyed a
spectacularly successful August holiday month, analysts were focusing
attention on the heavy list of company results now facing investors. The
banking sector was dominated yesterday by interim figures from HSBC,
although shares in the Hong Kong bank took the result calmly to close little
changed. Tomorrow brings trading news from, among other leaders of UK
industry, Reckitt &amp; Col-man, Rolls-Royce and Vickers.
Few market strategists have raised their year-end forecasts for the Footsie
during the latest upswing in share prices, and many now fear that UK
equities could be due for a correction. At Salomon International, Mr Marcus
Grubb said that the cheapest European equity markets relative to bonds
appear to be France, Spain and Italy, rather than the UK. Any significant
delay in Bundesbank easing, or a 'double-dip' in the German economy, could,
he believes, prompt a sharp setback in equity markets.
A negative factor for the market was a report that Norwich Union, the UK
insurance group and heavy investor in UK securities, has turned bearish on
secondary oil shares, of which it has been a strong holder. But this was
counterbalanced yesterday by continued firmness in the pharmaceutical
stocks, which have been attracting US investors again. But retail and
consumer shares kept up their hopes for an early cut in UK base rates.

In a firm brewery sector, Whitbread stood out, helped by a broker's buy note
together with continued speculation over the fate of Grand Metropolitan's
Chef and Brewer public houses-restaurants chain. The 'A' shares advanced 10
to 544p in moderate turnover.
Kleinwort Benson turned buyer of Whitbread, arguing that the group was
exceptionally placed to take advantage of the UK economic recovery on both
its brewing and retail fronts. The company's position in retailing in
particular will mean it will recover more quickly than other brewing stocks,
according to Mr Andrew Holland at Kleinwort. 'The improvement in cash flow
over the last two years has been dramatic and should prove sustainable,' he
said.
Meanwhile, weekend press speculation over whether GrandMet will sell its
750-strong Chef and Brewer chain again spilled over into the market,
although brewing analysts said there was little fresh news to be garnered.
Both Whitbread and Bass are said to have made enquiries over the chain - on
which analysts put a price tag of between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn.
However, speculation is growing that GrandMet may parcel off the division
should one buyer prove hard to find. Boddington was yet another name being
mentioned as a potential buyer yesterday. Bass shares were steady at 502p.
GrandMet 3 ahead at 460p and Boddington a penny up at 281p.
Dealers adopted a cautious approach to trading in HSBC both ahead of and
following the interim results. These came in towards the bottom of the
market's range of expectations, put at between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn,
although a more refined view was between Pounds 1.1bn and Pounds 1.3bn.
HSBC shares traded around 7 higher at 740p immediately before and after the
figures, but subsequently fell away to 725p as analysts scrutinised the
figures in detail and sought guidance from the accompanying statement.
Thereafter the shares crept forward, finally to stand a net penny up at
734p. Turnover of only 3.9m was described as disappointing by marketmakers.
The other big banks came under pressure late in the day, Barclays sliding 9
to 499p on 2.6m traded and Lloyds 5 to 554p. National Westminster dipped 3
to 494p and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 7 to 276p.
Composite insurances extended their recent dull performance as the market
became increasingly nervous about Sun Alliance's interim report, scheduled
for tomorrow. Sun Alliance shares slipped 5 to 385p, with less than 1m
shares traded.
Analysts expect the group to achieve profits of up to Pounds 80m, compared
with a previous deficit of around Pounds 98m. There was little reaction in
the market to news of losses expected by Chubb Corporation, the manager of
Sun Alliance business in the US. Chubb said its Pacific Indemnity unit would
incur losses following the settlement of a multi-billion dollar abestos
lawsuit with Fibreboard Corporation.
A bout of profit-taking left the oil sector with a sprinkling of small
falls. The leaders, among the FT-SE 100's best performers over the past two
weeks, drifted easier, with BP losing 3 1/2 at 316 1/2 p on 6.4m traded and
Shell 5 at 673p.
A press suggestion that Norwich Union, the insurance company and among the
biggest investors in the oil exploration and production sub-sector, could be
about to lighten its considerable holdings triggered a flurry of selling in
companies such as Goal, 2 easier at 57p, and Clyde, 2 1/2 off at 51 1/2 p.
Recent high-flyer Lasmo tumbled 5 1/2 to 148p.
Shares in UK airports operator BAA were boosted by reports from British
Airways of a sharp increase in traffic out of London's Gatwick Airport in
recent months. BAA moved ahead 15 to 833p, while the British flag carrier's
shares ended 5 firmer at 360p in trade of 2.9m.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel continued to strengthen amid continued
hopes of a cut in interest rates in France, home of many of the investors in
the stock. The shares added 8 at 485p.
Among engineering stocks, hopes of a tank order for engineering group
Vickers, which reports interim figures tomorrow, left the shares 2 1/2
dearer at 151 1/2 p. Profits are expected to be in the range of Pounds 8m to
Pounds 9m, against a Pounds 4.1m loss a year earlier.
News that flotation plans for BM Group's Australian subsidiary Austoft were
well advanced cheered the market, helping the shares harden a penny to 17
1/2 p.
Metals group Johnson Matthey dropped 22 to 480p after General Motors, of the
US, one of its customers, launched legal action against JM.
Speculation that international mining group RTZ would soon be making further
disposals, following last week's sale of most of its Pillar business to
MB-Caradon, pushed the shares up 7 to 741p. Caradon dipped 4 to 336p on
profit-taking. SG Warburg was said to be positive on BTR, which gained 3 1/2
at 399 1/2 p.
Renewed speculation that Reed International will soon announce the purchase
of Official Airline Guide, the US publisher, helped the shares appreciate 16
to 733p.
Among the property sector, Slough Estates weakened 4 to 236p on a negative
note from NatWest Securities.
