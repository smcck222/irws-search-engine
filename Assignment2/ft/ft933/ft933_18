FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best performance in a generally active telecoms sector came from Cable
and Wireless as the shares responded to a strong push from Hoare Govett, the
stockbroker, plus talk of sizeable switching activity involving other
telecoms shares.
By the close of trading, C&amp;W was 17 ahead at 862p, an all-time closing high,
after touching a peak 863p earlier in the session. Turnover was 2.4m shares.
C&amp;W's outperformance was largely at the expense of Vodafone, whose shares
have outpaced those of C&amp;W in recent weeks. Vodafone ended the day a net 8
lower at 571p, with a hefty 4.7m shares traded. Dealers noted plenty of
switching business in the market yesterday, out of Vodafone and to a lesser
extent the two classes of BT, and into C&amp;W. BT 'old' managed a minor
improvement of 1 1/2 at 428p, while the partly-paid were fractionally higher
at 184p. Combined turnover in BT stock was 26m, comprising 14m of the 'old'
and 12m of the 'new'.
Hoare Govett, reiterating its strong buy stance on C&amp;W, said the recent
takeover of McCaw, the US cellular group, by AT&amp;T, on a 'per head of
population' valuation was worth 50p a share on the C&amp;W stock price.
Today brings the launch of Vodafone's new pan-European 'Eurodigital'
cellular service, the first of a number of cellular phone moves in the next
few weeks, including the launching of C&amp;W's One-2-One PCN network and
Vodafone's Metrodigital system. In addition to the new system launches,
Cellnet, owned by BT and Securicor, is expected to introduce further price
cuts in the near future.

FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ready demand for LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVERSION of LWT stock into ordinary shares brought the widely predicted
flurry of selling from the company's senior management. Nearly 10m shares
were traded as executives took their first opportunity to exercise options
taken up as part of the company's successful franchise bid in 1991. Around
4m shares, or 3.78 per cent of the company's new share base, were placed
with institutional investors at 458p by Cazenove.
There was also speculation that Granada Group would be returning to the
market after seeing its 20 per cent stake diluted by yesterday's con-version
exercise. Granada, which paid around 500p a share in building up its stake
in July, now has a 17.5 per cent holding.
The first trade in the ordinary LWT shares was struck at 405p, but the stock
soon picked up and eventually closed at 465p, its closing convertible price
on Friday.

FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY strength in stock index futures, which saw the near month contract
climb to a new peak, gave way to a mood of uncertainty as traders mused
about the future direction of the market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 3,114, early buying soon drove the September contract on
the FT-SE 100 to a new high of 3,130, all in the first half-hour of trading.
But that early progress was short-lived and a mood of caution appeared to
descend upon the market, leaving the September contract to surrender the
earlier gain as it drifted lower for the next few hours. Traders stressed
uncertainty in underlying stocks.
It hit the day's low of 3,103 in the last hour of trading but steadied to
end at 3,108, in line with Friday's close and just 2 points ahead of its
fair value premium to cash of around 7 points. Volume was a reasonable 8,419
lots in the September contract, while increasing action in the December
contract saw its turnover reach nearly 2,000 lots.
Turnover in the traded options improved from Friday's session as 29,313 lots
were recorded against a previous 24,801. Some 12,298 contracts were dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option. The actives list among the stock options was topped by
Hanson, which saw 2,819 contracts dealt, and was followed by HSBC with
1,293. Lasmo, British Gas and Tomkins were also busy.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late firming of bonds helps
Dow to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets edged near or into record territory yesterday, supported by
a late firming trend in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent all day in a
narrow trading range a few points either side of opening values, was up 7.26
at 3,651.25, less than a point shy of its all-time high. Other leading
indices set new records. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.66 firmer at
463.56, the American SE composite 2.33 higher at 458.60 and the Nasdaq
composite 5.46 stronger at 742.82. New York SE trading volume was 252.8m
shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,168 to 774.
Prices drifted for the second consecutive day, analysts noting that the
markets traditionally move in narrow ranges in the days before the long
Labor Day holiday weekend, which signals the end of summer.
Initially, investors failed to respond positively either to stronger markets
overseas - Tokyo, Frankfurt and London shares were all higher overnight - or
the Commerce Department's upward revision of its estimate of second-quarter
gross domestic product from an original 1.6 per cent increase to 1.8 per
cent.
The upward revision caught Wall Street off guard, because analysts had been
predicting that the GDP figures would be revised downwards ever since the
June merchandise trade data revealed a sharp weakening in export sales.
The lack of a strong reaction from equities was probably due to a decline in
Treasury prices that was sparked by the GDP data. When longer-dated
Treasuries recovered later in the day, however, equities also firmed.
Additional good economic news on consumer confidence (the Conference Board's
index rose this month) and manufacturing activity (the National Association
of Purchasing Management's August index was also up) may also have helped
prices.
Airline issues were in demand: UAL rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 148 1/2 ,
Delta Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 and AMR, parent of American Airlines,
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 67.
Among mostly firmer drug shares, SmithKline-Beecham fell Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 32 3/4 after broking house Wertheim Schroder downgraded the stock
from a 'buy' to a 'sell', citing concern about possible weak sales next
year.
Another stock moving on a broker's report was WMX Technologies, which
climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 32 7/8 in busy trading after Prudential
Securities repeated its 'strong buy' recommendation on the shares and
predicted that earnings growth would accelerate over the coming year.
Chemical Waste Management, a WMX unit, put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 9 1/8
.
The Limited added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 23 3/8 in volume of 3.1m shares
after the retail group announced a restructuring that includes shrinking or
closing 360 stores by the end of 1995.
Canada
TORONTO finished the day mixed after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index
was off 1.2 at 4,137.5 but advances narrowly led declines by 388 to 366.
Volume totalled 60.6m shares valued at CDollars 633m.
The transportation sector showed the largest swing among the sub-group
indices, climbing 2.24 per cent.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes above
21,000 for first time since June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTING hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate continued to
support share prices, and the Nikkei average closed above 21,000 for the
first time since June 3, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 113.91 higher at 21,026.60, its sixth
consecutive gain, after a volatile session dominated by profit-taking by
institutional investors and buying by arbitrageurs and dealers.
Share prices firmed during the morning ahead of the government's emergency
economic cabinet meeting. However, comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the
finance minister, ruling out the need to cut the discount rate, depressed
sentiment later and the index fell to a day's low of 20,831.08 in the early
afternoon on profit-taking. It subsequently rose to a high for the day of
21,029.70 on buying of telecommunications-related stocks.
Volume expanded to 350m shares from 203m. Rises outscored falls by 547 to
408, with 203 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished 15.46 up at a 1993 peak of 1,693.09. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index eased 0.66 to 1,295.91.
Some traders expect profit-taking to cap a further rise in the Nikkei index,
while others suggest that a further advance could prompt buying by investors
who currently hold short positions. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said:
'If the index keeps edging up like this, it could trigger short-covering.'
Banks were bought on hopes of a rate cut, Bank of Tokyo climbing Y70 to
Y1,810 and Sakura Bank Y50 to Y1,660.
Housing shares were higher on hopes of tax benefits for house buyers.
Sekisui House rose Y30 to Y1,470 and Misawa Homes Y30 to Y1,370. Real estate
issues were also firm, Mitsui Fudosan adding Y10 at Y1,340.
Telecommunications-related issues fuelled a late rally in the Nikkei as
Fujitsu appreciated Y9 to Y848 and NEC put on Y10 at Y1,020. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone rose Y5,000 to Y960,000.
Victor, the audio manufacturer, lost Y30 to Y1,020 on reports that it might
post a pre-tax loss in excess of Y20bn for the current year to next March.
Namco, down Y20 at Y3,500, was sold on reports that it would bail out
Nikkatsu (up Y13 at Y35), the insolvent movie maker which will be delisted
on October 2.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed 107.72 firmer at 22,881.47 in volume of
37.9m shares.
Roundup
ACTIVITY IN the region was mixed, with Kuala Lumpur, India and Pakistan
closed for holidays.
HONG KONG regained some of last week's losses, the Hang Seng index rising
126.75, or 1.7 per cent, to 7,549.73. Turnover came to HKDollars 3.8bn.
Activity was a little subdued ahead of interim results from HSBC Holdings,
which came out after the close. In London the bank's half-year profits were
adjudged to be much in line with expectations.
Hutchison moved ahead 70 cents to HKDollars 23.40 on suggestions that it
might sell its British Telecom interests.
SINGAPORE broke through the 2,000 level on late buying of Sembawang
Shipyard. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.56 higher at
2,008.66, rebounding from an intraday low of 1,977.35. Sembawang added 40
cents at SDollars 12.60.
SEOUL fell back as investors reacted with disappointment to government
measures aimed to boost equity investment. The composite index shed 7.24 to
664.88 in 16.7m share volume.
TAIWAN retreated further on a late wave of selling, the weighted index
closing off 31.41 at 3,892.04. Turnover remained thin, at TDollars 11.4bn
against Monday's TDollars 9.5bn. The textile and paper sectors saw sharp
declines, with Shihlin Paper losing TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 76 and Hualon,
the textile manufacturer, falling 40 cents to TDollars 18.10.
JAKARTA set another 1993 peak, the JKSE index closing 7.63 higher at 417.30.
Banks were stronger, but Astra International, a star performer last
Thursday, was corrected down by Rp450 to Rp17,000 under continued selling
pressure by foreign shareholders.
AUSTRALIA added a further 6.2 to the All Ordinaries index, which ended at
1,962.2. But activity was generally described as dull, reflected in modest
turnover of ADollars 268.6m.
Among the blue chips, BHP and News Corp both eased 6 cents to ADollars 16.16
and ADollars 9.98 respectively. The banking sector was strong as National
Australia advanced 18 cents to ADollars 11.56 and Commonwealth 16 cents to
ADollars 9.60.
NEW ZEALAND was slightly lower as Telecom receded after weakness in the US,
shedding 4 cents to NZDollars 3.80. The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 1.31
to 1,982.79.
Brierley Investments continued to buck the trend, rising a cent to NZDollars
1.26, with speculation that a large asset sale was planned.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Buba introduces element of doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week saw almost as striking a succession of new highs in global equity
markets as did the week before. However, in continental Europe, the
Bundesbank's decision to leave German key interest rates unchanged brought
in an element of doubt.
Although the French and Spanish markets closed at new peaks last Friday,
seven of the 13 Continental bourses featured in the FT-Actuaries World Index
series produced declines on the week.
Nordic countries seemed to suffer from the sheer vigour of an earlier
recovery in the financial sector: a drop of nearly 8 per cent in Sweden's
banking shares index last Tuesday was followed by one of 11.4 per cent in
Finnish banks a day later, although the Stockholm market produced a big
recovery last Friday.
Belgium, down 2.1 per cent on the week, was one of the few bourses to show a
decline in the month of August, over which Europe as a whole has been about
6 per cent ahead. Kleinwort Benson says that social policy reform, covering
the method of financing social security, employment and competitiveness,
offers the Belgian government its greatest political challenge so far.
Meanwhile, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, and his colleague, Mr Richard
Davidson, look at the relationship between Germany, France and their
respective equity markets. They say that last week's Bundesbank action
confirmed that Germany is more concerned with its own domestic priorities
than with preserving the structure of the ERM.
'France now has the choice of continuing with the Swedish way of shadowing
the D-Mark with high interest rates,' they say, 'or adopting the British way
of cutting rates and stimulating a recessionary economy. We believe that it
will adopt the latter course.'
They expect the French market, therefore, to outperform Germany in the short
term.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse activity recovers as UK
investors return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN of the UK investor gave activity a boost, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT hit a new three-year high as the DAX index rose 23.00 to 1,944.89;
but it lost some of its gains in the afternoon, the Ibis-indicated DAX
closing at 1,931.95.
Turnover rose from DM5.8bn to DM11bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in
Frankfurt, said that equities had risen on the strong domestic bond market,
where the average bond yield fell by another 5 basis points yesterday to
6.05 per cent.
Deutsche Bank reflected bond market gains as it rose DM16 to DM795, although
it fell back to DM788.50 after hours. In the construction area, a buying
order for Bilfinger &amp; Berger pushed it DM42 higher to DM960, and
Heidelberger Zement rose DM55 to DM1,115.
Meanwhile, the market punished disappointing results. Hoechst, marginally
below par on Monday, fell another DM1.30 to DM278.80 while BASF and Bayer
rose by DM4.10 to DM257.90, and DM5.50 to DM301.40 respectively. Other names
in the sin bin included Varta, the battery maker, Linotype, the printing
machinery maker, and Karstadt, the stores group.
PARIS peaked again as the CAC-40 index improved 10.82 to 2,216.49, off the
day's high of 2,222.87. Turnover was strong at FFr4.7bn, after Monday's low
FFr2.7bn.
The expiry of August futures and options was a contributory factor to the
market's gains, while optimism about imminent domestic interest rate cuts,
possibly during this week, also lifted shares.
Elf Aquitaine was one of the few stocks to go against the trend, closing off
FFr2.70 at FFr445.90 after a fall of nearly 60 per cent in first half
profits. The oil group included a FFr2.3bn write down of oil assets because
of the weakness in international oil markets.
In contrast Elf Sanofi, in pharmaceuticals, added FFr11 to FFr1,009 after
satisfactory first half figures while BSN picked up FFr25 to FFr952,
recovering all the ground it had lost at the end of last week because of
alleged problems with glass bottles made by its Dutch subsidiary.
MADRID tried to blast its way into new high ground, but the gains did not
hold and the general index closed 1.76 lower on the day at 303.12, after
309.06 at midsession.
Turnover was strong at Pta38.38bn. The afternoon was not enhanced by a New
York downgrade of Repsol by Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, which removed
the American Depositary Receipts from its recommended list. In Madrid, the
shares fell Pta140 to Pta3,880.
ZURICH said that the CS Holding results were in line with expectations as
the bearers eased SFr5 to SFr2,950; the SMI index rose 7.1 to 2,488.1.
However the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Ascom, accelerated
its downtrend. Down SFr70 on Monday ahead of a first half loss, it dropped
another SFr110 to SFr1,140 after an early plunge in the shares led to a
temporary suspension of trading.
AMSTERDAM maintained its forward momentum, with a rise in the CBS Tendency
index of 1.5 or 1.1 per cent to 131.4. The market's rise was mainly
concentrated in the morning session, with some profit-taking evident in the
afternoon.
A firm bond market also supported equities, while technical factors assisted
the rise in some stocks, notably Unilever, which put on Fl 6.50 or 3.3 per
cent, to Fl 203.90, mostly on short-covering.
Traders at Amsterdam brokers Pierson also noted switching out of cyclicals
into defensive stocks, such as Unilever, and commented that the overall
market was now looking overbought; a technical correction was now both
logical and healthy, they added.
MILAN retreated a little in a technical correction from recent high levels.
The Comit index finished down 1.02 at 631.84.
The construction and cement sectors remained active following the untying of
bottlenecks in public works projects by the government last week:
Italmobiliare rose L96 to L46,276.
COPENHAGEN featured gains of DKr10 to DKr130 in East Asiatic on a turnround
prediction, and of DKr16 to DKr480 in Sophus Berendsen B after Monday's
higher profits. The KFX index, unruffled by the state 1994 draft budget,
gained a marginal 0.12 to 97.88.
VIENNA saw OMV fall Sch15 to Sch798 ahead of a statement by the oil group on
its interim figures which are due to be announced next week. OMV said that
it saw little change in its financial situation, having reported a first
half loss in 1992. The ATX index rose 6.33 to 1,014.08.
TEL AVIV added another 2.4 per cent to Monday's gain of 1.1 per cent in
reaction to political developments in the region and the cabinet's approval
of the budget. The Mishtanim index rose 5.01 to 208.76 in turnover of
Shk244m.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Money Markets: High Lombard lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS in the German cash market remained extremely tight yesterday as
banks continued to borrow through the very expensive Lombard facility to
meet end-of-month requirements, writes James Blitz.
The problems encountered in last week's very illiquid market continued to
haunt dealers.
There had been very little borrowing in last Wednesday's regular money
market oper-ations on the assumption that official rates would come down.
When rates stayed unchanged on Thursday, dealers found themselves short at a
time when they needed to have books balanced to meet end-of-month
requirements.
Some DM6.3bn was therefore borrowed at the rate of 7.75 per cent on Monday,
and heavy Lombard borrowing was reported yesterday. Call money was traded at
a very wide spread of 7.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Three-month money
remained at 6.55 per cent.
The Bundesbank announced a repo rate for today's weekly operations at 6.80
per cent for maturities of 14 days. This was no surprise to a market which
has become increasingly scep-tical about the possibility of German rate cuts
being made in the next four weeks.
September Euromark futures declined 3 basis points to close at 93.43, coming
more and more into line with the cash level.
There is similar downward pressure on the front-month French franc
contracts.
Yesterday, the September French franc contract fell 6 basis points to finish
at 92.86. But at this level it is pricing three-month cash in two weeks'
time at 7.14 per cent, some 35 basis points below yesterday's cash level.
Dealers are pricing in more reductions in French rates.
One dealer wondered how likely further easing was, with the French franc at
the comparatively strong FFr3.49 to the D-Mark, and with a pronounced
downside.
Conditions in the sterling market were extremely tight yesterday, with a
Pounds 2.15bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England and no takers in the
early round of trading.
The overnight rate conse-quently came near to the 8 per cent level, and
three-month money nudged up to 5 29/32 per cent, having been at 5 7/8 per
cent at the end of last week. The September short sterling contract weakened
4 basis points to 94.11. The December contract was also down 4 points,
finishing at 94.56.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar supported by GDP data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was well supported against both the D-Mark and the yen in
yesterday's European trading after the second-quarter GDP figures were
revised upwards by more than the market had expected, writes James Blitz.
Second-quarter GDP was revised to 1.8 per cent from a previous 1.6 per cent,
but the impact of the figure was all the greater because market expectations
had been for a rise of only 1.1 per cent.
The strong data were backed up by reasonable consumer confidence figures.
The conference board said its index had fallen to 59.0 in August from 59.2
in July. But July's figure was an upward revision from 57.7 and the
expectations for the August number had only been for 57.2.
Altogether, these figures helped to push the dollar to a high of DM1.6820
from a low of DM1.6675 in Europe. It closed at DM1.6780, up nearly a
pfennig. Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y104.70 from a previous
Y103.95. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.6765 and Y104.77.
Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank in London, said GDP data
may give the dollar longer term support because of upward revisions for
growth figures in previous years.
'In recent years, the Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates in
the belief that the economy needed a strong stimulus, but it might start to
question that policy,' he said.
However, Mr Gunner added that the immediate outlook for the dollar still
depended on the non-farm payroll report for August, expected on Friday.
In the case of the dollar/yen rate, much will depend on the Japanese
government's new fiscal stimulus package due to be delivered around
September 20. There are signs that the authorities in Tokyo are seeking to
water down the contents of this package. But the dollar may have received
some encouragement from comments by the Japanese trade minister, who said he
wanted both a discount rate cut and a supplementary budget.
European trading was very thin, even though many dealers were back in London
from the summer vacation.
The D-Mark gained some strength from unusually tight conditions in the
German money market, with call money seen at the 7.5 per cent level. But the
French franc still managed to make headway against the German currency,
closing at FFr3.495 from a previous FFr3.499.
The Danish krone also firmed against the D-Mark: it eased to DKr4.115 in
mid-morning, but later rose to close around DKr4.0950.
The pound ended  1/2 pfennig down on the day at DM2.4950. Sterling money
markets continue to take a dim view of the prospects for a reduction in UK
interest rates. But the British political party conferences are only a few
weeks away, and some dealers believe that the prospect of another season of
speculation on UK monetary policy is upon us.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria maintains oil output as
strike starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA maintained oil production near its normal Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries quota of 1.8m barrels a day yesterday, the official
start of the strike by the national oil workers' union, Nupeng. The strike
is part of a move by the Nigerian Labour Congress to force the interim
government to concede the outcome of the June presidential election.
Although the oil workers' strike has left oil production intact it has
reduced exploration activity and almost halted the marketing and
distribution of fuel in the south-west of Nigeria, which accounts for 50 per
cent of demand.
The multinational oil producers have local agreements with the oil workers'
unions that in case of a national strike they will maintain essential
services, which include the production of crude oil. The oil majors report
that their contingency plans have enabled them to maintain normal output.
According to industry official, increased security at the oil fields from
last week and the risk of workers'losing pay whilst on strike have also
contributed to maintenance of production. Shell, which produces about half
of Nigeria's production, continued to operate its Bonny terminal at the
weekend, although the absence of experienced crew forced it to stop night
loading.
Onne port and Port Harcourt in the east and the two big ports in Lagos have
been closed since Saturday and pilots are refusing to allow ships in or out.
The downstream sector of the oil industry is more vulnerable to disruption
and was already in poor condition before the strike began. The state-owned
energy company, which has a monopoly on oil refining, importing and depots,
has been unable to keep up an adequate supply of domestic refined products
throughout Nigeria for several months. Reserves in Lagos and the south-west
were already low by the weekend, when early strike action and confusion over
the new grade of more expensive petrol had almost halted the supply.
Deliveries of fuel have continued in the north and east of Nigeria.
Nupeng is demanding the cancellation of the petrol price rise introduced
through a new grade of petrol last week by President Ibrahim Babangida's
outgoing regime. The new grade costs around ten times more than the ordinary
grade and is the first step in the phasing out of Nigeria's domestic fuel
price subsidy.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's
waterlogged bread basket - Unsettled weather is delaying harvesting and
eroding grain quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S bread basket has been a little moist recently. I am told that some
southern and western areas have been relatively fortunate, but East Anglia,
where I farm, has had a succession of weather fronts passing over it and
most have brought showers or longer periods of rain.
It makes for a frustrating harvest, made the more so when radio weather
forecasters, who should know better, say things like, 'The farmers will be
able to get on with their harvest today', after a night during which half an
inch of rain has fallen. Do they not realise that it takes many hours of
sunshine to dry standing grain after such a downpour? In several cases
during the last few weeks crops have been almost dry enough to begin
harvesting when it has rained again.
The fact is you cannot drive a combine harvester through wet crops. If you
tried the internal works would become hopelessly clogged; besides which
grain must contain no more than 14.5 per cent of moisture if it is to
qualify for European Community intervention buying and/or avoid being dried
expensively on the farm or by the purchasing merchant. Many farm grain
driers are capable of removing up to 5 per cent of moisture but immediately
after half an inch of rain kernels contain 25 per cent to 30 per cent of
water and, except under exceptional circumstances, drying such grain is
impractical and uneconomic.
The crop most farmers in the arable east are attempting to harvest and dry
at present is winter-sown wheat. Most barley harvesting, both winter- and
spring-sown, has been completed except in the north and in Scotland.
Winter wheat is generally recognised as the highest yielding cereal grown in
the UK as well as being the most profitable. Predictably, therefore, the UK
grows and harvests two and a half times as much wheat as it does barley.
In 1992 the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that the national wheat crop
amounted to some 15.7m tonnes while the barley crop totalled only 6m tonnes.
Oats, rye and triticale added another 500,000 tonnes between them to bring
the entire harvest up to a little over 22m tonnes.
Domestic demand for home-grown grain for both human and animal consumption
is about 16m tonnes leaving 6m tonnes for export. In recent years the
quality and price of UK samples have been such that markets have been found
for most of this tonnage - mostly in other EC countries, although
significant quantities went elsewhere. Very little has languished in
intervention stores.
This year, however, quality is being eroded by unsettled weather and UK
prices are less attractive to overseas buyers because of the strengthening
pound and the relative weakness of the French franc. The French, needless to
say, have a much bigger exportable surplus than the British and they are
cashing in on the currency differences.
And the longer the weather stays catchy the greater will be the French
advantage. Cereal harvesting in France is virtually over and although
northern France has experienced the same kind of weather as the UK and this
has caused some deterioration in the quality of late-harvested wheat, this
was nothing compared to the damage since done to British crops. Milling
quality, in particular, is being washed away by the rain.
Quality is assessed by a series of complex tests and it is only by reference
to the results of these that merchants will bid for a sample.
The three most commonly used criteria in the UK are for individual grain
weight and size, for protein content, which needs to be above 11 per cent
for best bread-making potential, and for the quality of the dough produced.
The best possible test would be to bake a loaf with the wheat in question
but this is too time-consuming for practicality, so other quicker methods
have been devised.
For dough quality most British millers rely on the Hagberg Falling Number
Test. It involves grinding a measured sample of wheat into meal, mixing it
with a predetermined amount of water in a test tube, heating the solution
for 60 seconds and mixing the result to a kind of dough. A weighted plunger
is then introduced into the top of the test tube and allowed to sink by its
own weight. The number of seconds the plunger takes to reach the bottom of
the tube is the Hagberg reading for that sample. The higher the number the
better the wheat for baking bread.
Other tests are used in other EC countries and this can cause complications
for grain intended for export. The Chopin Alveograph Test, for instance,
requires dough to be mixed and then blown up and burst like bubble gum, in
order to test its elasticity. Another is called the Zeleny Test and yet
another the SDS.
All are variations on the theme of checking the strength of the gluten in
the grain, which is consistently related to its bread-making potential. And
gluten is strongest in crops that have suffered least rainfall when they are
ripe.
This year protein levels in the UK have been generally low at around 10.2
per cent. Hagberg readings have been variable and any sample with a number
in excess of 200 combined with 10.5 per cent protein is likely to be worth a
premium over the feed wheat price of around Pounds 100 of Pounds 25 to
Pounds 28.
Last year both protein and Hagberg readings were much higher as were ex-farm
prices.
This year the wet harvest has reduced quality and the fall in the value of
the French franc has cut export possibilities. So, what is to happen to
wheat surplus to UK requirements? For in spite of this being the first year
of set-aside there will still be a surplus - some traders say almost as big
as in 1992.
Very little, I am assured, is likely to go into intervention stores when the
EC buying-in scheme opens in November. Or if it does it will not stay there
long. For the EC has introduced a new scheme of export restitution payments
to help finance exports to third countries and pay transport costs. This,
the trade believes, will ensure that vast tonnages of wheat do not lie idle
while those who desperately need it remain hungry. But it is inevitable that
UK farmers will be forced to take lower prices than they had hoped.
I am writing this on the morning of August Bank Holiday Monday. After yet
another night of light drizzling rain the sun has come out. In a few hours'
time we shall try again to harvest some wheat. We already know it will be
too moist to sell and will need to be dried like most of the grain we have
gathered this year. We still have several days of harvesting ahead of us and
feel we cannot afford to wait for the ideal conditions, which are so
elusive.
Bank workers and other office wallahs may be sunning themselves on a beach.
But we farmers and our workers will be hard at it. Who was it who said it
was the relaxed way of life that made us do it?

IN THE first six months of this year the Indian tea crop was up 26m kg to
263.11m kg.
Except for Cachar in Assam, where production in the first half declined by
1.35m kg to 13.16m kg, all the other tea growing centres in the north and
the south registered higher output. At 121.74m kg, total Assam production
was up nearly 5m kg, while West Bengal's output of 54.77m kg showed a
remarkable improvement of 10.34m kg. Darjeeling, which grows some of the
finest teas, recorded a production rise of 761,000 kg to 4.21m kg. Last year
Darjeeling production fell by 24.4 per cent to 9.9m kg.
South India, which suffered a production setback of 26.5m kg last year
because of a prolonged drought bounced, back in the first half of 1993 with
a rise of 10.57m kg to 85.33m kg. The Tamil Nadu crop of 52.17m kg was up
5.16m kg. Kerala registered a crop rise of 5.21m kg at 31.07m kg, while at
2.09m kg, Karnataka's output was 201,000 kg ahead of the corresponding
period last year.
The monthly Indian tea crop, however, suffered a setback of about 4m kg in
June to 81.29m.
Industry officials expect the country's tea planters to grow about 740m kg
of tea in 1993, up from 703.9m kg last year. In 1991 production amounted to
741.7m kg.
It now appears that the export target of 210m kg for 1993 can be achieved.
Up to June export licences for 95m kg had been issued and the country has
been particularly successful in stepping up tea exports to the UK.
The industry is happy that in spite of the rise in production, prices at the
auction centres are much higher than last year's. At the Calcutta auction,
the average price realised for CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea to the middle of
August was Rs52.77 (Pounds 1.11) a kilogram, compared with Rs41.46 over the
same period last year.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean banana exporters seek
clarification of EC regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANANA EXPORTERS in the Caribbean have asked the region's governments to
seek clarification from the European Community on several aspects of the new
banana import arrangement which took effect last month.
The exporters say there are many areas of the new arrangement which are
causing them concern, and that they need to be assured that their industries
are fully protected from factors such as natural disasters and price
fluctuations.
The EC's new banana import regime imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota on Latin
American fruit. Imports within the quota will attract a duty of Ecu100
(Pounds 76) a tonne while those above that level will incur a duty of Ecu850
a tonne. The community's traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and
Pacific group have access for the remainder of the EC's needs of about 1.5m
tonnes per year. This fruit will pay no tariff.
The Caribbean Banana Exporters Association has asked the region's
governments to determine from the EC the factors allowing an increase in
their quotas. 'The EC has allowed for quotas for the Latin American
countries to increase as demand increases, but they have not, to date,
allowed for our quotas to be increased,' said Mr Marshall Hall, the
association's outgoing president.
The exporters are also seeking a review of the distribution of national
quotas. 'We are concerned that as far as the quotas which have been
allocated to each of the Caribbean countries is concerned, there is no
opportunity for a downturn in one country to be picked up by another
country,' Mr Hall said. The EC is to be asked to treat the Caribbean
countries as a cumulative quota-holder to allow shortfall in production in
one country to be filled by another with surplus fruit.
The association, which is made up of exporters from Belize, Dominica,
Jamaica, St Lucia, Suriname and St Vincent, is also concerned about promised
support for prices. They are contending that they will not be protected in
the event that they cannot cover their production costs if prices for the
fruit fall significantly.
'Although the community has talked about price support we have not been told
how this will work,' Mr Hall said. Industry officials said that in the event
of a fall in price or a natural disaster such as a hurricane, they could not
depend on the community's Stabilisation of Export Earnings (Stabex) facility
which was 'under pressure and does not have much money now.'

The GOLD price yesterday climbed back above the support level that was
breached last week but dealers were not expecting an early break above the
Dollars 375-a-troy-ounce level that has been the markets ceiling for the
past two weeks. As the London bullion market price gained Dollars 2.35 to
Dollars 371.55 an ounce at the afternoon fixing traders said the market had
been aided by buying in New York. But renewed selling trimmed 20 cents off
by the close. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices fell away from
their highs during late afternoon trading and ended little changed. As
traders jockeyed for position ahead of tomorrow's September traded option
declarations the cash premium over the three months delivery position
narrowed by Dollars 10 to Dollars 28 a tonne, with the three months price
closing Dollars 12 up on the day at Dollars 1,943.50 a tonne. The NICKEL
market staged a modest rally following the recent fall to 6-year lows. The
three months price closed at Dollars 4,600 a tonne, up Dollars 55. London
COCOA prices surrendered modest early gains after the New York market opened
lower. The December price closed at Pounds 832 a tonne, up Pounds 1.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disgruntled Colombian coffee
growers get sweetener
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIA'S decision to raise the domestic coffee price paid to growers by
14.3 per cent is ostensibly a sign of confidence that firmer international
prices are going to last. But the increase, which was agreed rather suddenly
last Thursday, also seems to be a government gambit to mollify growers after
the appointment of a special commission to study policy changes had
antagonised much of the powerful coffee sector.
Although the price rise satisfied the coffee federation, Federacafe, central
bank officials are unhappy about its effect on inflation and the budget
deficit. Just four months ago the price was put up by 8 per cent, so the
overall increase so far this year amounts to 22 per cent - close to the
annual inflation rate. All through the coffee crisis Colombia has maintained
relatively high support prices and the international price will have to rise
above 92 cents a lb in to reach a break-even point.
Covering the latest increase will cost the National Coffee Fund about
USDollars 50m more this year.
However, the burden on the fund is not as big as it might have been because
this year's harvest is expected to be under 15m bags (60kg each), about 20
per cent down on 1991-92 production. The reduction is due partly due to cuts
in application of fertiliser and other inputs and partly to the effect of
the 'broca' disease. But the cost of holding back up to 3m bags once the
producers' export retention agreement begins to operate is likely to be
considerable.
Since the final collapse of the International Coffee Agreement talks earlier
this year, both the private exporters and the government have been pushing
for a major overhaul of coffee policies and institutions, to fit the better
with the free market framework. Some have seen this as an attack on
Federacafe - the pillar of the coffee industry - and the government's
announcement of a new study commission, which did not include federation
representatives, seemed to confirm this.
However the latest price rise shows that the coffee growers still remain
considerable influence in government circles.
Robusta coffee futures prices fell back at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday after last week's big rise. The November position closed at
Dollars 1,261 a tonne, down Dollars 20.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: High-yielding countries show surprising
strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS that the European government bond rally might be losing
momentum proved premature yesterday as prices rose again on thin summer
buying, sending yields to new lows.
Spanish benchmark bond returns broke through 9 per cent while UK gilt yields
approached 7 per cent and French 10-year returns hovered above 6 per cent,
some 4 basis points below their German equivalent.
It was among high yielding markets that the strength was most surprising. A
week ago, Spanish yields were around 9.4 per cent. The 10.3 per cent coupon
maturing in June 2002 rose two points yesterday, sending the yield down to
8.89 per cent.
The Italian market was slightly overshadowed by a L3,500bn seven-year CCT
auction on Monday which failed to fulfil market forecasts. There are more
auctions this week, with offers of three-year, five-year and 10-year paper
adding a further L9,500bn of supply.
Nevertheless, yesterday saw 10-year futures traded in London open 1.25
points higher than Friday's close, catching up with continental Europe's
gains after the UK's Monday bank holiday. The September contract traded
closed at 114.55, a net gain of 80 basis points.
Portugal, the third member of the so-called olive belt markets, saw 10-year
yields fall to 9.5 per cent as Spanish investors bought in the neighbouring
market for the advantage of the nominal yields.
LONG-DATED UK gilts rose sharply, confounding many economists who argue that
the fundamental economic factors that have driven the market are more than
discounted.
The ultra-long end of the yield curve was squeezed  3/4 points higher as
overseas investors sought to buy while domestic institutions remained
sceptical of further gains but were not prepared to sell.
RENEWED strength in French government bonds provided an opportunity for two
sizeable Eurobond issues. Economists said the government and corporate
sectors would take advantage of the low cost of borrowing until investors
began to suffer from indigestion. Tomorrow, the French Treasury will auction
FFr18bn - 20bn of tap stocks.
BELGIAN bonds retreated from earlier highs as the central bank continued its
efforts to shore up the Belgian franc against the D-Mark and left short-term
rates unchanged.
LOW GROWTH, a low inflation outlook and a buoyant US bond market helped
Australian paper to a record close. Ten-year Commonwealth bonds ended 1.5
points firmer.
AFTER dipping on news of stronger than expected revised second-quarter
economic growth, longer-dated US Treasury prices firmed following the
Federal Reserve's coupon pass and the release of a weak Johnson Redbook
store sales report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102
1/8 , yielding 6.092 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 1/16 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent.
In early trading, prices fell after the Commerce Department revised upward
its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 1.8 per
cent, from an initially reported 1.6 per cent. News of a rise in the
National Association of Purchasing Management's August index of
manufacturing activity and in Conference Board's August consumer confidence
index also depressed prices.
The early declines did not last long, however, and by mid-morning
longer-dated securities were ahead. One factor in the rebound was the
realisation that an upward revision in the inventories component of the GDP
data suggests third-quarter growth may be slow as companies choose to run
down stocks to meet demand rather than boost production.
Prices were also aided by the Fed conducting a coupon pass, buying
securities to meet a reserve need tied to the upcoming Labor Day holiday.
Johnson Redbook reporting a drop in August department store sales also
supported prices later in the day.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Flood of issuers tap demand for
longer-dated maturities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market was flooded with new issues yesterday as
borrowers took advantage of investor demand for longer-dated maturities to
raise cheaper, long-term financing.
The French franc sector, where 10-year yields are now below Germany's,
caught investors' attention as two public-sector borrowers made a rare
appearance.
'The French yield is attractive for borrowers and the currency side is
quieter,' said one syndicate manager.
RATP, the Paris public transport system, made its debut in the Euromarket,
raising FFr2.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds priced to yield 18
basis points above the 6 3/4 per cent French government bond due 2003. The
pricing was seen to be fair for a triple A-rated borrower.
Region d'Ile de France, the French regional authority, offered a wider yield
spread of 22 basis points on its seven-year offering which raised FFr600m.
Although the borrower also has a triple-A rating, the extra yield was
designed to make up for the likely lack of liquidity in the bonds. Most of
the proceeds from both issues were swapped into floating-rate francs.
Yesterday's activity in the French franc sector raised hopes that more
borrowers would tap the sector. An official at J. P. Morgan said that good
progress had been made on the planned French franc global bond for Credit
Local. The issue, scheduled for October, is expected to have a 10-year
maturity and raise up to FFr8bn.
In the D-Mark sector, Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, was able to
increase its 10-year offering by DM500m to DM1.5bn due to strong investor
demand.
The pricing of the bonds, to yield 24 basis points over the 6 1/2 per cent
bund due 2003, was regarded as decent value for a borrower which is popular
with domestic investors. The aim of the deal was to raise Depfa's profile
with international investors.
Meanwhile, Belgium is close to launching its well-flagged D-mark Eurobond
issue totalling DM600m to DM1bn. Banks have been bidding for the mandate to
arrange the deal, with a proposed pricing of 15 to 22 basis points over
Bunds for a maturity of more than five years. A spokesman for the borrower
said the issue was likely to be launched next week.
Yesterday, the World Bank awarded the mandate for its dollar global bond
offering to Lehman Brothers and Nomura Securities. The offering, likely to
raise Dollars 1.25bn and have a maturity of 10 years, is expected to be
launched next week.
Nomura is also preparing a Y30bn five-year Eurobond issue for China, its
first international offering since 1987, when it raised DM300m through an
issue with the same maturity. China has an indicated investment grade rating
of BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's.
Elsewhere, British Colombia launched the first issue with a 12-year maturity
in the Canadian dollar sector since 1989. It offers investors a yield
pick-up of eight basis points over the borrower's 10-year global bond
launched in June.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Vacancies at CFTC threaten
loss of regulatory power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DELAY in Washington in naming appointments to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission has led to speculation that the Clinton administration
intends to use the agency for political purposes.
The five-member commission is now reduced to just two commissioners. Mrs
Wendy Gramm, the Bush administration stalwart who guided the agency through
a difficult 1992, left the chairmanship in January along with another
commissioner, Mr Fowler West. Last month, Mr William Albrecht, the agency's
acting chairman, departed to return to the University of Iowa.
The CFTC, which oversees futures and options trading in the US, and which
was recently granted regulatory powers over the Dollars 4,000bn derivatives
industry, can manage routine business with two commissioners, but is not
expected to move forward on any significant decisions until new appointments
are made.
One of the more controversial issues before the CFTC is the application by
the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for
exemptions for professional traders from many of the agency's rules. The
CFTC issued similar exemptions to over-the-counter derivatives traders
earlier this year.
Born out of the agricultural industry, the CFTC's regulatory duties now
focus on increasingly complex banking issues.
Derivatives trading dominates the global foreign exchange and interest rate
markets, and also touches on equity business, leading to cross-regulatory
commitments with the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other regulators.
The CFTC risks losing its momentum in these regulatory co-operations the
longer it goes without a chairman, agency personnel say.
The vacant chairs will also weaken the agency's international presence.
World derivatives regulators gather in Bergenstock, Switzerland, for their
annual meeting early next month. The CFTC, which is generally the most
important voice at the meeting, risks not having a chief executive present.
Mr Hal Hanson, chairman of the Futures Industry Association, says the delay
in making CFTC appointments demonstrates the agency's low priority on the
administration's agenda.
While Mr Clinton has appointed a high-profile executive to the SEC, 'the
CFTC has not shown brightly on the administration's radar screen,' says Mr
Hanson.
Many high-level industry people once in the running for the top CFTC post
now appear to have dropped out, lending credence to talk of political
appointments, says Mr Hanson. The futures industry, usually well-connected
in Washington, is in danger of being left out of the due election process.
Mr Glenn English, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, voiced the
concern of many in the futures industry in a letter to the president dated
July 27.
He wrote: 'Your administration has the opportunity to name three new CFTC
commissioners to fill existing vacancies. I am not writing on behalf of any
particular candidate, but rather out of concern that the relatively small
size and specialised nature of the Commission will lead your advisers, as in
previous administrations, to recommend individuals that do not meet the high
standards of experience and demonstrated knowledge that the CFTC must have
to function as an efficient regulator.
'I urge you to make sure that your appointments to the CFTC are not only
good people but also highly respected and recognised experts in their
field,' he added.
Members of Mr English's staff said that even if the president names a CFTC
chairman soon, the background check and confirmation process could leave the
agency without a chief executive at least until early October.

refinancing package.
Bechstein, which has debts of more than DM38m (Dollars 22.4m), the result of
expanding too quickly after German unification, will sell its headquarters

THE LIMITED, the US clothing and toiletries retailer, will close or remodel
as many as 360 of its Lerner New York and Limited women's clothing stores as
part of a two-year restructuring programme.
The company, which operates 12 specialty store chains and a mail-order
catalogue business, said that it would take a Dollars 200m pre-tax charge
against earnings this year after reassessing the carrying value of certain
Lerner, Limited and Henri Bendel outlets. The provision would cover the cost
of the closures, remodelling and asset revaluation.
The company also announced that it had completed the sale of a 60 per cent
stake in its Brylane mail-order division to Freeman Spogli, a California
merchant bank, for Dollars 285m in cash. It said the disposal would result
in a Dollars 203m pre-tax gain.
Some of the proceeds are to be used to accelerate the store closure and
remodelling programme which is expected to be completed by the end of 1995.
In contrast to many restructurings, the company's refocus is expected to
increase total employment, not reduce it.

<TEXT>
DAF TRUCKS made a profit of Fl 1.8m (Dollars 950,000) in its first three
months after being resurrected in slimmed-down form following the Dutch
truck maker's financial collapse at the start of this year.
The figure was achieved after tax, interest and an allocation for
development costs. The profit at operating level was Fl 6.2m, achieved on
turnover of Fl 367m.
The results are roughly as forecast by the company after it was formed with
the aid of Fl 451.7m in equity and loans from the Dutch and Flemish regional
governments, banks and institutional investors.
They cover the period from March 2 to June 21, putting Daf Trucks in
position to make a conventional second-half report for a financial year
ending December 31.
The company yesterday said that it expected a 'significantly higher positive
result' for the whole year, with a projected turnover of Fl 1.4bn.
The results coincided with an announcement by Leyland Daf Trucks, the Dutch
company's wholly-owned UK sales arm, that it had won its largest
post-receivership order in the UK, for 152 trucks worth Pounds 7.5m.

first half

<TEXT>
THE Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - the HSBC Holdings'
wholly-owned subsidiary which controls its Asia Pacific activities -
yesterday announced a 57 per cent increase in interim profit attributable to
shareholders to HKDollars 6.37bn (USDollars 822m), up from HKDollars 4.06bn
in 1992.
Hongkong Bank registered strong earnings growth from its operations in Hong
Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, but the figures were also boosted by a sharp
reduction in provisions against bad debt.
During the first half of 1992, Hongkong Bank wrote off an estimated
HKDollars 1.4bn against its exposure to the Olympia &amp; York group, and this
was followed by an estimated HKDollars 2.1bn provision against the Canadian
property group in the second half of the year.
Hongkong Bank's chairman, Mr John Gray, described the outlook for the second
half as 'encouraging'. He said: 'The measures taken to correct over-heating
in China's economy may mean slower growth for both China and Hong Kong in
the short term, but long term they are likely to be beneficial.'
At the interim stage, HSBC's Asia-Pacific operations accounted for 75 per
cent of the group's pre-tax profit and 37 per cent of its assets.
Wardley Holdings, which operates the HSBC's Asian merchant banking and
broking activities, achieved results significantly ahead of expectations as
a result of a booming Hong Kong stock market and the volatility in
international currency markets.
There was also a continued turnround from Hongkong Bank of Australia, helped
by the strength of its treasury and trade finance divisions.
In Hong Kong, the bank registered a substantial increase in trade finance as
a result of continuing re-export growth from the neighbouring Chinese
province of Guangdong.
The company's 61 per cent owned Hong Kong retail bank, Hang Seng Bank,
announced a disappointing 17.5 per cent increase in interim profit in spite
of booking a HKDollars 259m profit from its sale of Wing On Bank. This
reflected the tightening of net interest margins and increasing competition
for deposits this sector has faced.
However, Hongkong Bank said its local operations had attracted strong loan
demand. During the interim period, the bank registered a 13 per cent
increase in loans compared with the first half of 1992.

HEALTHY stockbrokerage profit, rising fee income and higher interest from
Brazil and Argentina helped Bank of Nova Scotia achieve a 11.2 per cent gain
in second quarter net profit.
Canada's fourth-biggest chartered bank earned CDollars 183m (USDollars
139.60m), or 77 cents a share, for the three months ended July 31, up from
CDollars 165m, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on average assets
was 0.71 per cent against 0.69 per cent.
Net interest income rose 4.8 per cent and non-interest income 21.3 per cent.
Noninterest expense was up 10 per cent.
The bank reduced its country-risk provision by CDollars 200m, reallocating
this to property and corporate loan provisions and raising the general
provision from CDollars 50m to Dollars 250m.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 520m, or CDollars 2.18 a share, up 2 per cent
from CDollars 510m, or CDollars 2.2, on fewer shares outstanding. Return on
assets was 0.69 per cent against 0.73 per cent. Total assets reached
CDollars 105bn on July 31, up 9.2 per cent year-on-year and mainly a result
of a 12.3 per cent increase in mortgages.

Bell argued before the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Litton Inds wins Dollars 1.2bn
suit against Honeywell
</HEADLINE>

   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LOS ANGELES jury yesterday awarded Litton Industries, the Californian high
technology group, Dollars 1.2bn for the alleged infringement of a patent by
Honeywell, the Minnesota-based controls company. But Honeywell pointed out
that the judge was continuing to hear evidence in the case, which it
insisted was far from over.
The jury's award is very high by the standard of patent cases and could hurt
Honeywell's shares when the New York Stock Exchange begins trading this
morning.
The stock of both companies was suspended ahead of yesterday afternoon's
announcement and trading did not resume later in the day.
The case centres on ring laser gyroscopes, a device used in aircraft
navigation, which Honeywell pioneered in the 1960s.
Litton alleges that Honeywell infringed its patents, taken out in 1979 and
1989, for a process to coat mirrors used as part of the gyroscope's
measuring system.
Honeywell argues that Litton's patents are invalid and Honeywell's coating
process is anyway different from that of its rival.

THE BOARD of Western Mining Corporation, the Australian metals producer, has
taken the rare step of publicly disciplining the company's managing
director, Mr Hugh Morgan, over the loss of a mining lease earlier this year.
The disciplinary action was announced yesterday by Sir Arvi Parbo, WMC
chairman, following an internal inquiry into the loss of the mining lease,
known as Ernest Henry, which is expected to reduce annual earnings by
ADollars 20m (USDollars 13.50m).
Sir Arvi's statement said that Mr Morgan, one of Australia's highest-profile
businessmen, accepted managerial responsibility in the matter and would not
be eligible for the company's senior officers' share plan for two years.
'Mr Morgan is further required to minimise his involvement in outside
activities to enable him to concentrate on the implementation of the actions
decided upon by the board,' Sir Arvi said.
The announcement was viewed in Australia yesterday as a humiliating rebuff
for Mr Morgan's strident management style and outspokenness on a range of
issues including the mining industry's relationship with aboriginals.
WMC lost the Ernest Henry lease to a small Australian mining company, Savage
Resources. The lease is now almost certain to be developed into a copper
mine by Savage and its new partner MIM Holdings, a mining rival to WMC.

The WMC board has also disciplined Mr C. N. Middleton, the exploration
manager most directly responsible for the lost mining area, and two senior
exploration executives, Mr D. N. Harley and Mr R. Woodall.
But the enquiry found that none of the company's officers behaved in a
manner which required dismissal. The company has indicated that it would be
making procedural changes, especially in its exploration division.

The deal calls for NEC to supply NCR, the computer subsidiary of AT&amp;T, with
IBM-compatible colour notebook PCs for one year initially.
It will further the ties between NEC and AT&amp;T, which are already
co-operating in the telecommunications and semiconductor fields. For
example, NEC is the second source for AT&amp;T's Hobbit semiconductor chips.
The Japanese company expects shipments of its colour notebooks to NCR to be
more than 20,000 a year.
The colour notebooks to be supplied by NEC use TFT-liquid crystal displays
and are all manufactured in Japan. NEC launched the notebook in the US under
its own brand in April.

Leaving the board are Mr Tom de Beer, Mr Eugene van As and Mr Jaco Fouche.
The first two were on the board in their capacities as chairmen respectively
of Genbel and Sappi, two of the companies that are being unbundled.
Mr Grant Thomas and Mr Rob Angel, respectively chief executives of Malbak
and Engen, will be staying on the Gencor board as non-executive directors,
despite their groups ceasing to be under Gencor control after the
unbundling.

China lifted a ban on foreign financial institutions in 1979. Since then
over 130 representative offices and 90 bank branches have set up in China.

Commission that it needed CDollars 315m (USDollars 238m) more revenues in
1993 and CDollars 520m in 1994 to maintain a reasonable return and offset
revenues lost to long distance competition. For many years long distance
rates have subsidised local rates.
But the CRTC, the federal regulator, said Bell did not need the increases to
retain 'financial integrity'. It reduced the company's allowable rate of
return to 11 to 12 per cent from 12.5 to 13.5 per cent sought by Bell.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: US banks stake out insurance
battlefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TINY outpost of Banks, Oregon (population 489), is an unlikely
battleground for the struggle between US banks and insurers over whether
banks should be allowed into the insurance business. Yet this small town,
wedged between the city of Portland and the Pacific Ocean, has been the
setting for one of a series of convoluted legal actions which will
ultimately determine whether banks can use their networks to sell insurance
products around the country.
This Oregon town is home to one of the first nationwide insurance marketing
efforts by a bank, the Portland-based US National Bank. Taking advantage of
a legislative loophole which allows nationally chartered banks (as opposed
to those organised under state laws) to sell insurance from towns with
populations of less than 5,000, US National markets insurance products by
direct mail throughout the US. Similar operations have sprung up in small
towns all over the country as banks seek to expand the range of products
they sell to their customers.
A flurry of legal actions over such operations, brought by insurance agents
eager to protect business, is currently winding its way through the federal
court system. The right of US National to continue its operations in Banks
was upheld in July by a federal appeals court in Washington. But the latest
ruling of its kind, handed down by the federal appeals court in Houston, was
a setback for the banking industry. This judgment, delivered against
NationsBank, the North Carolina-based bank, could severely restrict the
ability of banks to sell annuities, a business with bank sales put at
Dollars 15bn a year.
According to the Houston ruling, annuities - contracts which pay a set
amount periodically to an investor for life in return for a single lump-sum
payment - are a type of insurance contract, and so should be subject to the
same rules as other insurance products. That runs counter to a ruling
earlier this year by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the arm
of the US Treasury charged with regulating nationally chartered banks. The
OCC concluded that annuities were banking rather than insurance products, a
view it continued to adhere to yesterday.
For banks which have grown accustomed to picking their way through the
discrepancies between banking and insurance regulation and between federal
and state legislation, such conflicts are nothing new.
'We've been in litigation for three years,' says Mr Tom Brumley, president
of the small Kentucky-based Owensboro National Bank, which has assets of
just Dollars 370m. Mr Brumley has been fighting the Kentucky insurance
regulators over whether the bank can sell insurance products at all in the
state. Echoing the ambitions of bankers around the country, he says he wants
to use his existing network to sell more products to the 22,000 households
which comprise the bank's customer base.
Kentucky law forbids bank employees from selling insurance. The question
now, to be decided in the federal appeals court in Cincinnati, is whether
such state legislation has primacy over federal law, or whether Mr Brumley's
bank can enter the insurance business.
Complicating the picture for the banks has been a lack of clarity in some of
the rulings so far. The Washington judgment found that banks could sell
insurance from small towns - apparently leaving it open to banks with
insurance operations headquartered in such places to use any method to sell
insurance anywhere in the US, including through their existing bank branch
network. Last week's ruling in Houston, though, appeared to limit banks to
selling insurance only in small towns.
Bankers hope that such discrepancies will eventually be ironed out in the
supreme court. Given the vested interest involved, most hold out little hope
that Congress will attempt to clarify the issue with new legislation, a
route recommended by the Washington court.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: France to open state sell-off
with BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest banks, will kick off the
government's ambitious privatisation programme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday
described the bank as a 'symbol' of the French economy. He said the
privatisation would take place within weeks, providing stock market
conditions were favourable.
The choice of BNP, valued at between FFr35bn and FFr40bn (Dollars 6.9bn),
reflects the government's desire to demonstrate confidence in the
privatisation programme, which aims to sell 21 publicly-controlled companies
to the private sector.
'They wanted to start with a bang,' said Mr David Harrington, head of
research at James Capel in Paris. 'It is a signal that they mean business on
privatisations.'
The government is expected to sell the whole of its 73 per cent stake in the
bank as part of its plan to raise at least FFr40bn from privatisations this
year.
The privatisation of BNP will be followed by the sale of the government's
43.4 per cent stake in Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group. Elf Aquitaine,
the oil group, and Banque Hervet, a small retail bank, are next on the list.
BNP has been preparing itself for privatisation since the appointment in
March of Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman. It has increased its provisions for
general risks and bad loans, particularly for small and medium-sized
companies.
These provisions have caused a sharp fall in profits. Results for the first
half of this year showed a fall of 60 per cent to FFr522m. However banking
analysts in Paris said they represented an attempt to eliminate problems
ahead of privatisation.
Between now and privatisation, say analysts, BNP will try to secure a hard
core of long-term investors. These could include UAP, the insurance group,
which already holds about 10 per cent of BNP's shares.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Profits at CS Holding surge 65%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, the
Swiss bank, yesterday reported a jump of 65 per cent, to SFr882m (Dollars
600m), in first-half net income. It forecast a 'very good' full-year profit.
The strong result, attributed mainly to soaring revenues from trading,
enabled the group to reach for the first time its target of a 15 per cent
return on equity.
The return would have been higher if the group had not shifted an unusually
high proportion of its SFr2.8bn in pre-tax profits to provisions for bad
loans.
Provisions in the first half reached SFr1.34bn, SFr509m more than in the
first half last year. All but SFr9m of the SFr234m pre-tax profit of the
group's new subsidiary, Swiss Volksbank, was placed in a contingency
provision. This was in addition to SFr472m of excess Volksbank equity
transferred to general reserves.
Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, said economic activity was recovering,
particularly in Switzerland. But with the recovery moving slowly, 'a
considerable amount' would probably have to be charged to provisions in the
full year.
Another CS Holding official acknowledged that the provisions at the interim
stage were very generous, but said they were made as a contingency. 'It is
better to do it in the first half rather than be surprised in the second
half,' he said.
Consolidated gross income jumped 44 per cent to SFr6.49bn. Volksbank,
acquired in April for SFr1.6bn, provided SFr655m of the rise. Trading
income, the group's largest source of profit, soared 83 per cent to
SFr2.3bn, while commission income was up 31 per cent to SFr2.2bn. Net
interest income ahead 23 per cent to SFr1.67bn.
Total operating expenses advanced 37 per cent to SFr3.7bn, with the
inclusion of Volksbank figures accounting for two-fifths of the rise. Much
of the rest came from big performance bonuses paid at CS First Boston
subsidiaries.
The addition of Volksbank pushed total assets to SFr343.3bn at June 30,
making CS the largest Swiss financial services group.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat pins hopes on new model

<TEXT>
FIAT, the Italian motor group, hopes foreign sales of its new Punto small
car, to go on sale early in November, will open the way to an export-led
recovery for its car activities.
Mr Paolo Cantarella, managing director of the Fiat Auto subsidiary, compared
the Punto's importance with the Fiat Uno, the award-winning small car which
reversed Fiat's decline in the early 1980s.
Mr Cantarella expected up to 50 per cent of Punto production to be sold
abroad, against 40 per cent for the Uno. Fiat is releasing the new model, in
which it has invested more than L5,600bn (Dollars 3.5bn), simultaneously in
Italy, France and Germany.
Mr Cantarella admitted the segment of the European car market into which the
Punto fitted was by far the most competitive.
Rivalry in the 'B' segment, which includes the VW Polo and Renault Clio, was
set to stiffen as other manufacturers, which had previously concentrated on
bigger cars, diversified into smaller models.
Fiat is depending on the Punto to spearhead an improvement in sales, notably
in the home market it once dominated. Fiat's share of the Italian market has
plunged to around 44 per cent from about 60 per cent in the late 1980s.
The group's position has been exacerbated by this year's 26 per cent fall in
domestic car sales. 'We don't underestimate the difficulties the industry is
facing. However there's no reason to suppose we can't return to development
and recovery,' said Mr Cantarella.
The Punto is expected to sell between 60,000 and 70,000 units this year  -
too few to affect Fiat's 1993 results. However, sales should reach between
450,000 and 500,000 in 1994.
Fiat will release first-half sales and earnings figures later this month.

FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Oil write-down batters results
at Elf Aquitaine

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil and gas group and one of the companies that
will spearhead the government's privatisation campaign, yesterday announced
a drop of almost 60 per cent in first-half profits. The fall follows a
write-down of oil assets.
Net profits fell to FFr1.4bn (Dollars 240.5m), against FFr3.3bn in the first
half of 1992, after a FFr2.3bn write-down of oil assets. Total sales rose to
FFr102.7bn from FFr98.9bn.
However analysts said underlying profits had performed in line with
expectations, with operating income falling 24 per cent to FFr3.69bn,
excluding the write-down. Elf's shares slipped by FFr2.7 to FFr445.9.
Elf said the decision to revalue its oil assets, principally in the North
Sea, was 'a cautious response' to the prospects of continued weakness in the
international oil price. It said the 'one-off' move would not affect its
dividend policy, or future production volumes.
Analysts said the write-down represented an attempt by Elf to clarify its
prospects before the sale of all or part of the government's 50.8 per cent
stake by early next year.
The French government yesterday confirmed that the state was likely to
retain a 'golden share' of between 10 and 15 per cent in Elf, which has a
total estimated market value of more than FFr100bn.
Like other companies at the top of France's privatisation list, Elf is
experiencing difficult market conditions. Its core oil and gas exploration
and production activities suffered a 22 per cent fall in operating profits,
to FFr1.64bn, reflecting the fall in oil and gas prices.
The group's chemicals and minerals division suffered from continued pressure
on petrochemicals prices and reduced demand for fertilisers. Although
specialty chemicals enjoyed strong sales, particularly in the US, operating
profits for the whole division fell sharply to FFr176m from FFr1.3bn.
The refining and marketing division was boosted by the acquisitions of Minol
in eastern Germany and the African distribution network of British
Petroleum. As a result, operating income rose 35 per cent to FFr782m.
Elf Sanofi, the healthcare and pharmaceuticals arm, kept net profits at
about FFr456m. Elf's stake in the unit was reduced from more than 60 per
cent to 51 per cent following the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent, the
cosmetics and luxury goods company.

<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, said first-half profits rose 58
per cent, to SKr3.67bn (Dollars 456.1m), as it continued to benefit from
surging sales of its two main drugs, Losec and Pulmicort.
The group warned that profit growth over the rest of the year would be
slower, mainly because last year's fourth-quarter result was inflated by
SKr500m in currency gains following the floating of the Swedish krona. It
expects sales growth to continue at the 38 per cent level achieved in the
first half.
Currency factors slowed pre-tax profits growth in the second quarter from
the 63 per cent of the first three months. However, growth in operating
profits, which rose to SKr2.99bn from SKr2.06bn in the first half, was
unchanged at 45 per cent.
An 18 per cent increase in volume, and the depreciation of the krona powered
the increase in group sales, to SKr10.56bn from SKr7.64bn. The group said
sales rose 50 per cent in the UK.
It also said its position was improving in Germany, its largest single
market, where all drug companies came under an intense cost-containment
squeeze in the first few months of the year. Even so, first-half sales in
the German market fell 10 per cent.
Sales of Losec, the company's highly-successful anti-peptic ulcer drug, rose
61 per cent to SKr3.28bn from SKr2.04bn. Total sales of the drug, including
those through licensees, amounted to SKr5.55bn, against SKr3.3bn.
Sales of anti-asthma agent Pulmicort climbed 53 per cent to SKr1.37bn from
SKr898m. Plendil, the anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 41 per
cent to SKr416m.

<TEXT>
LINDE, the German engineering group, yesterday announced a fall of just more
than a third in pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year. It
predicted profits for the full year would also be down.
Hit by the effects of a strong D-Mark and by domestic recession, pre-tax
profits fell to DM161.1m (Dollars 96.7m) from DM243.1m in the first half of
last year. Turnover fell 6.9 per cent to DM3.23bn.
Linde warned that sales would be down 5 per cent for the whole year. Order
intake rose to DM5.99bn, 10 per cent higher than at the end of 1992. This
reflected a number of new plant construction contracts.
Linde said demand for fork-lift trucks and warehousing equipment was sharply
lower than expectations. The European market for fork-lift trucks, for
example, shrunk 26 per cent in the six months.
Without recent acquisitions, the group's turnover in this market segment was
down 16 per cent, and order intake by 18 per cent.
The strengthening of the D-Mark against European currencies also hit the
fridge manufacturing business.

Iberia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIMMERING boardroom row at Iberia over management of Latin American
operations came to a head yesterday when Mr Miguel Aguilo was ousted as
chairman of the Spanish national carrier and replaced by Mr Javier Salas,
chairman of INI, the state holding company which owns Iberia.
Mr Salas, who will continue to run INI, will be seeking to redirect Iberia's
Latin American strategy where a string of acquisitions, notably that of
Aerolneas Argentinas, has placed onerous burdens on Iberia's already fragile
balance sheet.
Mr Aguilo's departure was not unexpected. The airline posted pre-tax losses
of Pta47.2bn (Dollars 349m) last year and losses are estimated at Pta30bn
for this year's first half. INI recently injected Pta120bn of extra capital
into Iberia.
The outgoing chairman has been blamed for failing to weld Iberia's Latin
American operations to those in Europe. 'We haved been unable to make Madrid
the European entry point to Latin America and we have frittered away
potential economy of scale profits from our Latin American investments,' an
Iberia executive said.
Aerolneas, Iberia's chief asset in a Latin American arm that includes
shareholdings in Venezuela's carrier Viasa and in Chile's Ladeco, is
estimated to be losing Dollars 200m a year.
Mr Aguilo's exit was foreshadowed earlier this year when Mr Salas appointed
Mr Manuel Moran, a senior INI executive, as chief executive of the Argentine
airline. About 50 managers and senior technicians have since been sent from
Spain in an effort to turn around Aerolneas.

issue

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday became the fifth
large Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the past two weeks when it
unveiled plans to raise SKr1.2bn (Dollars 149m) from shareholders to cut
debts.
It also aims to sell its Munksjo paper and packaging unit, or float it on
the stock exchange, in a move which could raise several billion kronor. The
group also wants to sell its remaining shares in Svedala, the mineral
processing and transport unit.
The plans were announced as the group sank deeply into the red with a
first-half loss after financial items of SKr796m, against a SKr117m profit
in the same 1992 period.
Depressed metal prices led to a fall in turnover, to SKr10.97m from
SKr11.55bn, while there was an operating loss of SKr131m, against a SKr29m
profit.
Trelleborg said in July it planned to cut debts by SKr3bn over the next 12
months. The issue will be on a one-for-two basis at SKr30 per share.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Astec (BSR) doubles to Pounds 4.33m -
Strong performance prompts resumption of dividend payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTEC (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company that
is 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, is resuming dividend
payments for the first time in three years following a doubling of pre-tax
profits and earnings per share in the first half.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 jumped from Pounds 2.17m to
Pounds 4.33m, boosted, said Mr Brian Christopher, chairman, by higher sales,
a profits turnround in the slimmed-down electronic components division and
lower interest payments.
Sales increased by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 136.4m (Pounds 124.4m). On a
comparable basis, adjusting for exchange rate differences and operations
sold or closed in 1992, sales grew by 6.3 per cent.
The group, which has achieved a steady improvement in performance over the
past 18 months, reported increased earnings per share of 1.2p (0.6p).
It is paying an interim dividend of 0.25p, the first distribution since a
0.7p interim in 1990.
Mr George Tamke, chief executive, said the results reflected the company's
strong underlying financial performance, including growing market share and
improving operating margins.
Sales in the core power conversion business increased by almost 30 per cent
to Pounds 108m (Pounds 83.1m). However, after adjusting for the impact of
exchange rates the increase was a more modest 8.6 per cent.
Operating profits in the division increased to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.6m) but
margins fell to 3.6 per cent (4.2 per cent) reflecting the non-recurring
start-up costs of a new modular production line and the group's second plant
in China.
Excluding these start-up costs, Mr Tamke said operating margins grew by a
percentage point.
Electronic components sales declined to Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 41.3m)
reflecting the reorganisation of the operations which now solely comprise
Beckman Industrial. However, the components business reported an operating
profit of Pounds 712,000, or 2.5 per cent of sales, compared with a loss of
Pounds 354,000, and is now expected to resume growth.
The group generated a positive cash flow of Pounds 13.1m in the first half
that enabled it to eliminate borrowings and end the period with Pounds
300,000 net cash.
As a result of this and lower interest rates net interest payable fell from
Pounds 977,000 to Pounds 240,000.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Seasonal deficit at Rhino increases to
Pounds 263,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY RIMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LINE with directors' expectations, Rhino Group, the USM-quoted novelty
products and giftware merchandising and distribution company, showed pre-tax
losses of Pounds 263,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds
150,000.
The Future Zone Stores and Downpace subsidiaries are highly seasonal and the
directors explained that the second six months 'should benefit substantially
from Christmas trading'.
The group also announced an Pounds 850,000 placing of 2.5m new shares by
Panmure Gordon. Proceeds will be used to bring forward the Future Zone
opening programme enabling the group to have more than 40 stores open for
the Christmas season.
First-half turnover expanded from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 3.6m and operating
losses came to Pounds 326,000 against Pounds 131,000. Interest receivable
was Pounds 63,000 (Pounds 19,000 payable).
Losses per share were 0.52p (0.97p). The group said it was planning a
capital reconstruction in order to eliminate losses and allow dividends to
be paid in due course.
Future Zone, which started the year with five stores, now has 26 trading,
and Rhino has entered into a conditional agreement for Future to acquire six
leasehold stores in prime locations. Consideration is Pounds 100,000 cash
for one of the properties while the agreement includes rent-free periods for
each of the others.
Downpace, the distributor of licensed merchandise, was trading well with
turnover up 29 per cent.
Directors said that Downpace had the UK distribution licence for certain
items of Jurassic Park merchandise, which was making a 'positive impact in
the second half'.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth helps Macfarlane rise 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH EACH of its three divisions contributing improved results Macfarlane
Group (Clansman) was able to lift profits from Pounds 4.55m to Pounds 5.35m
pre-tax for the six months to June 30.
The 18 per cent advance came on the back of a Pounds 4m rise in turnover
from continuing operations to Pounds 46.3m.
The Glasgow-based group's activities take in packaging, plastic moulding and
development.
Earnings emerged at 4.74p (4.04p) per share and the interim dividend is
lifted from an adjusted 1.253p to 1.44p.
Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said yesterday that there were now 'a
few signs of growth in the economy'. He was confident that trading
conditions would improve by the end of this year.
He added that this should lead to substantial investment opportunities.
In order to ensure that the group was placed to take advantage of
opportunities Mr Gordon Lane, previously managing director of Abbotts
Packaging, has been appointed group development director.
His responsibility will cover acquisition strategy and new products.
Lord Macfarlane said the improved results in part reflected 'prudent
financial housekeeping and strict control over costs'. Almost all the
companies in the group improved their performance.
Benefits of the cost-cutting programme undertaken in 1991 helped the group
boost pre-tax profits for the 1992 year by 48 per cent to a record Pounds
10.1m.
A significant number of jobs were cut and a squeeze put on stocks and
debtors.
The shares added 2p yesterday to 216p.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lofs shows improvement to Dollars 1.16m for
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based shipping group whose
ultimate holding company is Iroquois Shipping Corporation of Liberia,
reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 1.16m (Pounds 780,000) for the three
months ended June 30 1993.
The result marked an improvement on the Dollars 1m for the six months to
September 30 and reflected increased freight rates on the London Spirit and
London Victory.
In the six-month period the London Spirit was being overhauled and was
unavailable for hire.
Operating costs were reduced following the acquisition of the London
Enterprise.
Directors said that on July 15 the newly built tanker, London Pride, was
delivered and began trading under the five-year charter to Chevron.
The benefits would show through in future results, they said, but would be
tempered by the loans to finance her.
Freight and hire revenue totalled Dollars 4.36m (Dollars 5.8m for six
months).
Earnings per share came through at 3.3p (4.4p) basic and 3.1p (4p) fully
diluted.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993 were Dollars 1.86m.

turnround
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A Pounds 427,000 cut in interest charges to Pounds 168,000 enabled
Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder, to edge back into the black at the
pre-tax level for the year to end-June, writes John Murrell.
Profits worked through at Pounds 28,000 and compared with a deficit of
Pounds 98,000.
The outcome also took account of an exceptional debit of Pounds 133,000
relating to costs of the recent placing and open offer.
Turnover fell from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15.7m - the comparative figure
included land sales. Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.2p.
Since the early part of 1993 directors noted a 'marked improvement' in the
number of both site visitors and net reservations.
They pointed out, however, that the recovery in the market had 'visibly
slowed in recent weeks, with purchaser confidence being eroded by
speculation on personal taxation and other economic issues'.
Nonetheless, they said there was a 'continuing demand' for new homes and
provided there was stability in interest rates and 'clearly defined economic
policies' they looked for improvements in both the level of output and
margins over the next year or so.
It was pointed out that without the benefits of the funds from the placing
and open offer, effected in June, borrowings would have been Pounds 900,000,
representing gearing of 23 per cent.
The inflow from the issue of new shares, which will be used to replenish
land stocks and support growth plans, raised the company's net asset base to
Pounds 10.5m and created a cash at bank position of Pounds 5.7m at June 30.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Admiral advances 11% on market penetration
boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMIRAL, the Surrey-based computing services company, boosted pre-tax
profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.18m for the first half on the back of an
improvement throughout its businesses.
The shares responded via a 10p rise to 470p.
Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, described the result for the six months to June
30 as 'highly satisfactory'.
He noted, in particular, increased market penetration of client server
technology - through which the company enhances the efficiency of computer
networks by using the power of personal computers and relegating the
mainframe to a database.
Admiral was benefiting from related product sales and the resulting software
development, training and consultancy work.
Mr Brendish added that since the company was listed on the stock exchange in
1987, 80 per cent of its customers had returned to do further business.
Mr Ceri James, managing director, said the first half had seen a significant
advance in all its market sectors. He wasparticularly pleased with the
growth in industrial and commercial business, which now accounted for more
than 25 per cent of turnover. Defence accounts for 30 per cent and the
financial sector for 33 per cent.
Admiral has six autonomous operating companies - four in the UK, one in
Australia and one in Singapore. The four UK companies provide information
technology consultancy, systems development, training and software products.
The group has carried out development work for the Switch debit card and for
the Tracker system of identifying and recovering stolen cars.
Turnover increased by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 13.6m) and
operating profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.06m. Net interest receivable
fell from Pounds 249,000 to Pounds 129,000.
Mr James said group turnover had risen on higher product sales and the
larger number of staff. At the end of the half year the company employed 660
people, compared with 602 at the end of last year and 509 at the end of
1991.
The Australian company was 'doing well but not as well as expected'.
Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (11.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted
from 1.7p to 2p.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson cuts losses to Pounds 1.66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWEN &amp; Robinson, the Basildon-based jewellery and sports footwear retailer,
cut interim pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.44m to Pounds 1.66m. The company
credited an increase in gross margins and a reduction in shop costs and
central overheads.
The company also announced the departure of Mr Mike Smith, finance director,
'to pursue other career opportunities'.
Turnover in the six months to July 31 for the company, which underwent a
capital reconstruction during the period, fell 20 per cent to Pounds 8.21m
(Pounds 10.2m).
Mr Neil Thomas, chairman, said in line with other retailers in the sector
sales volumes had been disappointing. However, taking into account shop
closures, the fall was 14 per cent.
The Gold Centre jewellery side was trading in line with budget following
cost cuts and increased margins. The Foothold sports shoe retailer recorded
a small trading profit.
On prospects Mr Thomas said that although signs of economic recovery were
random and inconsistent, Foothold had recently shown a significant
improvement in sales.
The pre-tax result was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 246,000
(Pounds 405,000) and the lack of exceptional costs against Pounds 300,000.
Losses per share fell from 31.08p to 13.94p taking into account shares
issued for the placing and open offer and the conversion of bank debt and
loan notes.
The conversion of A preference shares and convertible preference shares was
deemed to have applied throughout the period. The comparative figure was
adjusted for the preference conversion and the 1-for-20 consolidation of
ordinary shares.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cookson Group builds laminates side in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON GROUP, the specialist industrial materials company, is strengthening
its position as a supplier to the printed circuit board industry by making
its second related acquisition in a week.
The group, which has been refocusing on four core divisions, and will
announce interim results tomorrow, is acquiring the European electronic
laminates business of Perstorp, a quoted Swedish company, for over Pounds
11m.
Cookson announced plans last week to buy Brent Electronic Chemicals for
Pounds 24m in cash and assets. BEC is a division of Brent Chemicals
International, which supplies specialty chemicals, solders, fluxes and other
materials to the PCB industry.
Perstorp is the second largest supplier of electronic laminates in Europe
with sales last year of Pounds 35m. The acquisition will substantially
strengthen the position of Cookson's existing subsidiary, Polyclad
Laminates, which is the market leader in the US in high performance
multi-layer laminates and has growing sales in the Far East market.
Perstorp produces a similar range of multi-layer materials and mass
lamination products used in sophisticated electronics manufacturing, from
highly automated plants in Perstorp, Sweden and Nantes, France.
Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, said: 'This acquisition will
give us a significant, well established position in the European market for
multi-layer laminates. It will also give us management and technology, all
of which will further enhance our position worldwide.'
Under the terms of the purchase agreement Cookson will initially acquire 90
per cent of the group's Swedish operations and all of the French operations
for Pounds 11.1m.
In addition the agreement includes an earn-out arrangement whereby profits
in excess of a 20 per cent return on Cookson's investment will be shared on
a 50:50 basis over a three-year period.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Triton Europe losses at Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRITON Europe, the UK arm of the US independent oil and gas company,
incurred a loss of Pounds 50m for the year to May 31, following a Pounds 41m
write-down of the value of its oil and gas properties. There was a
comparable loss for the previous year of Pounds 700,000.
The company has changed the status of reserves held on its books after an
annual evaluation. All oil and gas prospects classified previously as
'proved, undeveloped', are now cited as 'probable', making them less
valuable.
Mr David Jones, company secretary, said the change was the result of current
economic conditions, which made it less likely the oil would be exploited.
It mainly concerns the Paris basin holdings, which have seen Pounds 37m
knocked off their value since Total, the French oil group that operates the
fields, decided it did not want to spend any more money to develop the
reserves in the current climate.
Triton has restructured its exploration and production activities over the
past year, cutting its staff by 75 per cent from about 60 in January to 15.
Restructuring costs reached Pounds 990,000 and were included in the total
write-down figure.
The company said, however, that its cash position remained strong with a
balance of Pounds 6m and credit facilities of Pounds 30m. After-tax losses
reached Pounds 34.4m, against profits of Pounds 3.9m, for losses of 41.7p
per share (earnings of 4.7p).
Mr Jones said Triton was restructuring its exploration programme to go for
higher risk-higher reward prospects such as its US parent had found in
Colombia where it was involved with British Petroleum in the Cusiana
development, which was believed to contain more than 1bn barrels of oil.
The company said its move to exploration in Italy should provide a solid
base for further expansion. It drilled its first well this year in the
southern Apennines.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BM to float Austoft arm on Australian SE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the engineering company currently undergoing a programme of
disposals and debt reduction, is to float its Austoft Holdings subsidiary on
the Australian Stock Exchange.
The sale will raise ADollars 36m (Pounds 16m). Austoft, which makes sugar
cane and harvesting machinery, will also waive net loans due from BM of
ADollars 11m.
Mr Howard Sutton, BM chief executive, said the group was taking advantage of
the improvement in the Australian stock market.
The net effect of the sale would be to reduce net borrowings by about
ADollars 30m.
BM has borrowings in excess of Pounds 100m and has had its banking
facilities extended until next Monday. Earlier this month it announced the
sale of BM Plant and Talbot Diesels, its UK distribution businesses, to a
management team.
The company said yesterday that discussions were progressing satisfactorily
with its bankers on longer term financing arrangements.
The sale of BM's 75 per cent stake in British Building &amp; Engineering
Appliances remains on schedule for the autumn, as do plans to dispose of its
remaining construction equipment distribution business.
BM paid ADollars 30m for Austoft and Mustang of the US, which it retains, in
1989. Austoft made pre-tax profits of ADollars 7.5m for the year to
end-June, when net assets stood at ADollars 32.6m.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Starmin seeks reappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
Conservative party minister, will seek shareholders' permission to reappoint
a director who resigned as an executive a month before it emerged that
pre-tax losses had been understated by millions of pounds.
The company's 1992 report and accounts includes a resolution to be put to
the annual meeting for the reappointment of Mr Raschid Abdullah, now a
non-executive director who, with his brother Osman, relinquished executive
responsibilities in July when a review of the company's accounting policies
was announced. The two, who earlier built up the Evered aggregates company,
had run Starmin since 1989.
Under the company's articles, Mr Raschid Abdullah must secure the approval
of the company's AGM on September 21, to remain a non-executive director.
The review, completed in August, showed that instead of pre-tax losses of
Pounds 8.06m, losses totalled Pounds 11.9m in 1992. Turnover should have
been reported as Pounds 18.7m rather than Pounds 20.1m and losses per share
3.6p instead of 2.5p. A separate revaluation led to a write-down of tangible
fixed assets of Pounds 4.75m. The company rescinded a proposed final
dividend of 0.2p. The discrepancies hinged on profits booked on disposals
which were later reversed.
The report and accounts show that Lord Parkinson was paid Pounds 30,000 for
his duties as a non-executive director in the year to December 31. He became
chairman in June. In his statement Lord Parkinson apologises to shareholders
for the delay in the publication of the accounts and expresses hope that the
company can 'look to the future'.

<TEXT>
SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast-based aircraft and missiles manufacturer,
yesterday reported a Pounds 5m rise in operating profits to over Pounds 21m
for the year ending January 31.
However, general recession in the aerospace industry took its toll on sales
which fell by Pounds 11m to just over Pounds 381m.
Short, Norther Ireland's largest private employer, was bought by Bombadier,
the Canadian transport group, in October 1989.
A Pounds 200m equipment and plant modernisation programme is under way, with
Pounds 134m spent to date.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, said the business environment in both
aerospace and defence was likely to 'remain difficult' for at least the next
12 months.
He added: 'A programme of cutbacks by Short's major customers and reductions
in defence budgets have left us with no option but to reduce the Short's
workforce significantly.'
Job numbers fell from 9,892 to 8,797 at January 31 and so far this year
there have been a further 645 redundancies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSURE costs of its loss-making Scottish operations left Ferry Pickering,
the Leicestershire-based printing and packaging group, with pre-tax losses
of Pounds 3.86m for the half year to June 30.
Profits last time were Pounds 95,000.
Turnover fell to Pounds 12m (Pounds 13m) with continuing activities static
at Pounds 10.3m.
Operating profits on continuing operations amounted to Pounds 643,000
(Pounds 445,000).
Exceptional closure costs were Pounds 2.6m, with an additional Pounds 1.39m
for goodwill previously written off.
Directors said the Dutch printing operation had performed satisfactorily but
fierce competition in the Netherlands had resulted in a reduced contribution
to prof-its.
The second half had begun with strong activity at the main operating plant
at Hinckley, they added.
Losses per share came through at 25.76p (0.6p earnings) but as expected, the
interim dividend is maintained at 2.1p.

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Future growth is virtually certain - The
plans of W Industries, developer of virtual reality systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRAP ON three kilos of headgear in a few upmarket amusement arcades and you
can experience a crude form of virtual reality, an electronic simulation of
events.
But the race is on among a handful of companies around the world to develop
the next generation of equipment. This will not only be much smaller and
lighter but offer a big step up from a two-dimensional screen into
'immersive virtual reality' through which users will be able to participate
in the electronic world.
Bringing these sophisticated toys to consumers - particularly for use at
home - will create a large new sector in the global electronic games market.
Some US virtual reality analysts estimate that the VR market as a whole will
be worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) within four years.
To help fund such expensive development, W Industries, a small UK company
with a leading technological edge in virtual reality, is planning to
announce today its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange later
this year and to change its name to Virtuality Group. Analysts believe the
flotation could raise Pounds 10m.
W Industries was founded by Mr Jonathan Waldern in 1988, following his
academic research in advanced computing programmes. By 1990 his company had
developed the world's first fully integrated virtual reality system.
Backed by Apax Partners, the venture capital company, its revenues have
moved from Pounds 102,000 in 1990 to Pounds 5.24m at the end of 1992. It has
now sold more than 360 of its virtual reality systems in 19 different
countries and is currently selling 20 units, at a retail price of between
Pounds 22,000 and Pounds 32,000 (plus VAT), each month.
Apax currently has about 67 per cent of the shares and the management 33 per
cent fully diluted, Apax having acquired its holding from Wembley Leisure.
Mr Waldern holds about 15 per cent of the company.
Mr David Payne, W Industries' chairman, says: 'Apax provided stable,
committed shareholding. Even at this stage Apax are not exiting, they are
staying in.'
Apax has so far seen no return because W Industries has not yet paid any
dividend. 'We don't plan to pay dividends in the short term because we want
to preserve our profits and inject them back into the business,' says Mr
Payne.
The purpose of the float, according to Mr Payne, 'is that we have an
enormous amount of intellectual property in the business. We believe that
virtual reality has a very explosive future ahead of it and we can't
continue to develop and package our intellectual property either fast enough
or in such a way that it is marketable out of the cash we are currently
generating.
'If we go in fast and do the right deals now with the big electronics firms
who recognise that we have some of the core intellectual property, there is
a chance that we may achieve the holy grail, which is to get some of what we
do accepted as the industry standard.'
W Industries has made a start in that direction. In July Sega Enterprises of
Japan, the world leader in coin-operated arcade entertainment, agreed to use
W Industries' operating system for its first immersive virtual reality
product.
The contract with Sega should be worth Pounds 3.5m to W Industries for the
first two years and Pounds 1.3m a year thereafter in licensing fees. Sega
bucked the trend for Japanese electronics companies this year, returning
pre-tax profits of Pounds 342m, up 64 per cent on the previous year. The
electronic arcade business is reckoned to be growing at 18 per cent annually
and is currently worth some Pounds 6bn a year worldwide.
Mr Waldern, W Industries' managing director, has a vision which he believes
will keep his company a global leader in this young but dynamic market.
He wants the world of electronics games to move away from being something
solely for young boys, seen as a rather anti-social activity, into a
family-based entertainment, where parents and children interact in playing
the games.
He believes that interactive immersive virtual reality, as a leisure
vehicle, has so far just skimmed the surface of what is possible.
Future growth will lie partly in technological innovation and partly in
intelligent marketing. If the technology supporting the current, relatively
crude graphics, with large cumbersome machines fixed in arcades, can be
adapted and transformed into a lightweight game easily installed in the
front parlour, and with graphical capacities far advanced from today's
possibilities, then W Industries could be on to a winner.
'Anybody can do this stuff on an expensive machine. But to be really
successful, it's got to be cheap.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Severfield-Reeve swings back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BETTER balance between demand and supply for structural steel helped
Severfield-Reeve report a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 398,000 to
profits of Pounds 210,000 for the six months to June 30 and to pay its first
dividend in two years.
Earnings per share were 1.22p (losses of 2.65p) and the interim dividend is
0.25p. On current trading, directors believe they will recommend a final
dividend.
Mr John Reeve, chairman of the USM-quoted steel group, warned trading
conditions remained tough, but added: 'Over the last two or three years, we
have seen upwards of 150 companies ceasing trading or going into
receivership in our sector. We are seeing far more of a balance between
supply and demand which reduces pressure on margins.'
He said demand had increased slightly on last year's 800,000 tonnes,
compared with 1.4m tonnes in 1989.
Turnover improved to Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 8.66m), mainly reflecting a price
increase from Pounds 630 to Pounds 700 per tonne of steel, in turn largely a
function of price increases by British Steel. The company said there were
some volume gains.
Gearing fell to 43 per cent (55 per cent) and has halved since the December
year end. The fall followed a Pounds 1.55m spring rights issue which diluted
directors' holdings from 70 per cent to 46 per cent. The company generated
cash of about Pounds 200,000.
Net interest charges increased to Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 173,000) reflecting
higher overdraft rates.
The company has orders worth Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4m) with further tenders
outstanding. It plans to export to the Far East and the Middle East.
Within the last two weeks it secured the contract for a headquarters
building for Scotland's Daily Record newspaper, worth Pounds 1.8m.
In August, the company spent Pounds 400,000 on 'nearly new' computer numeric

FT  01 SEP 93 / Johnson Matthey to be sued by GM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group,
lost more than 4 per cent of their value and dropped by 22p to 480p
yesterday on news that General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle group,
had filed a lawsuit against JM in a US District Court.
The suit alleges 'irregularities in accounting for precious metals used in
catalytic converters'. GM is seeking damages, punitive damages and legal
costs but an official said last night it was too early to judge what these
might total.
JM said the action had 'come out of the blue' and it needed more time to
study the details. Nevertheless, the allegations were denied and would be
'vigorously defended'.
JM supplies about 40 per cent of the anti-pollution vehicle catalysts GM
requires. In the US, the vehicle group provides platinum group metals which
are then used by JM to coat the catalysts. A JM official said that this
business had not been interrupted by the law suit.
Three years ago the two companies were embroiled in similar litigation which
JM described then as 'arising out of the interpretation of a contract to
supply autocatalysts'. GM said this was settled out of court. JM said that
matter was resolved 'without material loss (to JM)' late in 1991 and a new
four-year contract was signed with GM in 1992.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Growing out of the traditional boundaries: Changes fuelled
by the Midland buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings is hardly the household name in Britain that Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank used to be in Asia. Its interim results yesterday showed one
of the reasons. The true nature of the bank is hard to detect because it has
only started to take shape over the past year.
The results were full of adjustments for the consolidation of Midland Bank,
currency movements and other one-offs such as the Pounds 484m disposal of a
stake in Cathay Pacific. Yet below these complications, a quite different
bank from the traditional one seems to be forming.
The bank's aim is to become a well balanced business with strong enough risk
management controls to avoid some of its past mishaps with foreign
acquisitions.
HSBC's acquisition of Midland - which now comprises Pounds 67bn of the
Pounds 183bn assets - was intended to reduce its reliance on Hong Kong. The
46 per cent of assets that now lie in Europe produced 30 per cent of
profits.
The manner in which assets expanded from Pounds 143bn in June last year  -
adjusted for Midland - shows its two-pronged development.
The first line of growth was in trading assets such as debt securities held
by Midland. Midland's purchase of gilts and other government bonds nearly
doubled debt security holdings to Pounds 21.5bn. This was in contrast to
poor loan demand in Europe.
The second component of growth was different: the increase in residential
mortgages, particularly in Hong Kong. Mortgage assets rose from Pounds
14.6bn to Pounds 19.2bn over the year. The bank has tried to limit risk from
a housing market downturn by lending an average of 63 per cent of asset
value.
Mr John Bond, HSBC's chief executive, said the bank was 'comfortable' with
its mix of assets.
But the re-balancing of assets raises two questions: whether it is exposing
itself to risks through assets growth; and what criteria it will use to
allocate capital.
The risk question has been given added force by a further slip in the Marine
Midland US retail bank subsidiary. It had to write down the value of its
mortgage servicing business by Dollars 182m (Pounds 122.9m) because many
consumers repaid fixed rate loans. The business has now been reduced to a
net value of Dollars 96m.
Mr Bond argued that risk in Hong Kong had been limited by the low
loan-to-value ratio, and avoidance of people buying and selling houses
rapidly. The bank regards treasury assets as low risk because they are more
liquid than medium-term loans.
The longer-term question is the criteria by which the bank will choose where
to allocate its capital. It is becoming popular among banks to set targets
for returns on equity against which their parts can be judged. But HSBC does
not believe in such targets, largely because its businesses are diverse.
It judges returns on what it would get by putting the money into local
treasury bonds. It believes returns on equity will be lower in low inflation
economies, but this will be balanced by increases in asset values as
currencies appreciate. This means it does not judge subsidiaries wholly on
their earnings.
'We are looking for continuous improvement. We do not have a catch-all
return on equity target,' said Mr Bond.
If so, it means that HSBC will develop differently - perhaps more
organically - than banks which judge themselves by clinical rules, though
its emergence is likely to take some time yet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BECHSTEIN, one of Germany's oldest piano manufacturers, was yesterday
rescued from bankruptcy after Berlin's ruling Senate bought the company's
headquarters in the capital, clearing the way for banks to arrange a
refinancing package.
Bechstein, which has debts of more than DM38m (Pounds 15m), will sell its
headquarters in western Berlin for DM30m and rent the space from the Senate.
The Senate, which originally sold the property to Bechstein in the
mid-1980s, had an option to buy it back. Its value, because of its location
between eastern and western Berlin, is estimated at much more than DM30m.
Bechstein said: 'We could have done with a bit more money from the Senate,
but at least we are now on the road to a secure footing.'
Bechstein, which also owns Zimmermann, a quality piano maker in Saxony, has
been suffering from a decline in sales. Last year, turnover fell 15 per cent
to DM20m and is expected to fall short of DM15m this year.
In 1990, the company was making 350 grand pianos and 600 uprights a year.
Under a cost-cutting programme, Bechstein itself will produce 200 grand
pianos and 450 uprights. Its subsidiaries, Zimmermann and W. Hoffmann, which
produce 2,000 pianos a year, will try to challenge the growing presence in
Germany of pianos from south-east Asia and other parts of Europe.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIMON Murray yesterday stepped down as managing director - or Taipan - of
Hong Kong's largest conglomerate, Hutchison Whampoa. He is replaced by
fellow director Mr Canning Fok in a move which crystallises the group's
evolution from British-style trading company to Chinese corporation.
Mr Murray's departure, which had been expected, comes at a time of rapid
change for Hutchison. It has reversed the international diversification of
the 1980s and focused on its core businesses of infrastructure and property
in Hong Kong and China - businesses where the expatriate manager has a
limited role.
Mr Fok is regarded as a short-term stand-in for Richard Li, 26, who was
promoted yesterday to deputy chairman. He is the son of the chairman, Mr Li
Ka-shing, whose listed flagship Cheung Kong owns 40 per cent of Hutchison.
Mr Murray joined the group in 1984, four years after Mr Li became the first
'Chinese' owner of a British-style hong - or trading company - when it
purchased the restructured Hutchison from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation.
When Mr Murray joined Hutchison it was primarily involved in property
development, trading, retailing and port operation. Subsequently it acquired
control of Hongkong Electric and pushed into telecommunications.
However, he was also instrumental in Hutchison's diversification overseas -
primarily into Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) and Husky Oil and Gas -
reflecting growing concern over Hong Kong exposure in the lead-up to the
colony's hand-over to China in 1997.
But the overseas expansion has proved far less successful in the 1990s than
Hutchison's core business in the colony. During 1991 and 1992, Hutchison
wrote off HKDollars 2.2bn (Pounds 187m) against Husky Oil and suffered
losses in UK telecoms.
Last year, it became clear that Mr Li had decided to sell these businesses
and focus on post-1997 Hong Kong and China.
It is estimated that the company will invest HKDollars 8bn over the next
four years in the development of its two Chinese container ports, in
Shanghai and in Yantian, in the Pearl River delta. The group is also
believed to be negotiating some substantial Chinese property deals.
Mr Murray liked to play an active role in local politics, but his views are
believed to have upset the Beijing officialdom that Mr Li has been so
anxious to court. Mr Murray will remain a non-executive director and
consultant to the company.

FT  01 SEP 93 / HSBC doubles to Pounds 1.2bn: Changes fuelled by the Midland
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG trading income in Europe and banking growth in the Asia Pacific
region helped HSBC Holdings, the international banking group, to disclose a
126 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 521m to Pounds 1.17bn
in the first half of the year.
HSBC also provided pro forma figures including its UK subsidiary Midland for
the comparative period, which showed a 116 per cent rise in pre-tax profits.
Midland was consolidated into HSBC's results in the second half of last year
after a merger agreed a year ago.
Since December, HSBC increased assets by Pounds 13bn to Pounds 183bn. The
strongest asset growth came in mortgage lending in the UK and Hong Kong, and
in treasury dealing assets such as gilts and other government bonds held by
Midland.
The group achieved a return on shareholders' funds of 19.8 per cent and a 58
per cent rise in earnings per share to 33.12p, against 20.97p or a pro forma
13.24p. It increased its interim dividend to 7p from 4.8p.
Sir William Purves, chairman, said the merger with Midland was proceeding
'satisfactorily'. The outlook for Hong Kong remained good.
The most serious slip in the group's worldwide operations occurred in its
Marine Midland US retail bank, which wrote down its mortgage servicing
rights by Dollars 182m (Pounds 123m) as fixed-rate mortgages were repaid
amid falling interest rates.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 19 per cent on a pro forma
basis to Pounds 447m. Asia Pacific provisions fell to Pounds 50m, against
Pounds 173m, while US provisions were neglible as a result of a provisions
release at Marine Midland.
The group's pro forma non-interest income rose by 29 per cent to Pounds
1.64bn. This included dealing profits of Pounds 522m, against Pounds 204m,
as securities and foreign exchange dealing were helped by exceptional
trading.
Operating expenses grew by 18 per cent pro forma to Pounds 2.2bn, half of
the rise was accounted for by exchange-rate movements and half by costs at
Midland and Hongkong Bank.
But the cost-to-income ratio fell to 59 per cent from 64.2 per cent pro
forma.
The group's total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio strengthened to 12.9
per cent against 12.6 per cent pro forma.
But its tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets fell to 7.5 per cent from 9.4
per cent pro forma after re-classification.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Attwoods' US unit indicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUBSIDIARY of Attwoods, the waste management group where Sir Denis
Thatcher is deputy chairman, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for
billing irregularities and alleged violations of municipal contracts.
The indictments, from the District of Maryland, follow an investigation by
the US attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the
group's Eastern Waste Industries subsidiary in Annapolis.
Attwoods said the indictments related to overcharging dating back to 1982,
before the company was acquired. The investigations had already been
reported to shareholders. A Dollars 10m provision was made in the last
accounts.
Customers who had been overcharged had been reimbursed with interest at a
cost of about Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.7m), according to Mr Ken Foreman,
chairman and chief executive. Directors still believed the provisions were
adequate to cover legal costs and any fines that might arise from the
indictment of the company and eight current and former employees.
Mr Foreman said: 'There is no doubt that customers were overcharged. We
discovered it and wrote to every customer back to 1982.' Most of the
customers affected had stayed with Eastern.
He said Attwoods had begun auditing and reimbursing customers in March 1990,
before the federal authorities announced the investigation.
The employees who Attwoods thought were responsible for the over-billing had
been fired. It did not believe the indicted employees still with the company
were guilty.
Attwoods is about to report preliminary results depressed partly by poor
performance at its US recycling company.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Ferruzzi's radical plan wins shareholder approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second biggest
private sector company after Fiat, last night approved a radical capital
restructuring as a means of grappling with group borrowings of L28,838bn
(Pounds 12bn).
The proposals involve a reduction in the nominal value of the shares to L5
from L1,000 and their consolidation on the basis of one new share for every
200 held. The plan was the central point in a stormy seven-hour annual
meeting which also appointed a new board of directors.
The share write-down, required under Italian law because of the size of
Ferfin's losses, is the first step to a big rights issue, in which Ferfin's
creditor banks are expected to swap part of their debts for equity.
However, details of the rights issue are only likely to emerge once Ferfin's
main creditor banks unveil their long-awaited restructuring plan for the
group later this month.
Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's new chairman, said details of the rights would be
given when the rescue had been approved.
The restructuring is expected to include disposals of non-core activities
and the rationalisation of many remaining operations.
Ferfin's new board was reduced to just five members, with Mr Rossi as
chairman and Mr Enrico Bondi, also brought in by the banks, as managing
director. The three other members will represent creditor banks, the
Ferruzzi family and small shareholders.
This boardroom structure reflects the growing divisions that have emerged
between the Ferruzzi family, which controls about 48 per cent of Ferfin, and
the creditor banks now guiding its affairs.
Separately, Price Waterhouse, the international accounting group which last
week was banned by the Consob stock market and companies watchdog from
auditing Ferfin's accounts, said it would appeal against the decision.
Consob revoked Price Waterhouse's contract to audit Ferfin's books on the
grounds that it had failed to discover grave irregularities in the accounts.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Pace of US economic growth beats Wall Street forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the second quarter
this year, nearly twice as fast as most Wall Street analysts expected,
revised figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday.
Officials also announced the biggest revision to earlier estimates of growth
in gross domestic product for 20 years. The new figures show that the
economy grew at a real rate of 3.9 per cent in the year to the fourth
quarter of 1992 - a period in which candidate Bill Clinton capitalised on
the supposed economic failure of former president George Bush.
Analysts had predicted growth at an annual rate of just 1 per cent in the
second quarter following the release of unexpectedly poor trade figures for
June. However, the impact of the trade figures was more than offset by
upward revisions to federal, state and local government spending and a
larger-than-expected increase in corporate inventories.
The composition of growth was encouraging, with consumer spending and
business investment increasing at annual rates of 3.2 per cent and 14.4 per
cent respectively. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the
first quarter, as consumers retrenched after a binge at the end of last year
when GDP grew at a revised annual rate of 5.7 per cent, the fastest since
1987.
Figures for consumer confidence released yesterday showed no improvement in
August, despite passage of President Clinton's budget, which ended
uncertainty about future tax rates.
The closely watched index compiled by the Conference Board, a New York
business analysis group, registered 59 in August, unchanged from July and
below the 100 plus readings that would be normal in a robust recovery.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said confidence had 'dropped a
disconcerting 18 points' since the beginning of the year. The number of
respondents fearing worsening business conditions had steadily risen. There
was no sign in the latest survey of an imminent acceleration of economic
growth, he said.
Most private sector economists, however, are still predicting a revival of
growth in the second half to an annual rate of 2.5-3 per cent, reflecting
the stimulative effect of recent falls in long-term interest rates.
The benchmark revisions to GDP amounted to a rewriting of economic history.
The new figures suggest that the recession of 1990-91 was mild, with GDP
falling only 1.6 per cent from peak to trough, rather than 2.2 per cent. The
subsequent recovery was stronger with real GDP growing at an average annual
rate of 2.4 per cent rather than 2 per cent.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Izetbegovic edges closer to Bosnian settlement: Progress may
be made on split into mini-states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic last night appeared to leave the door
open to a settlement with his Serb and Croat adversaries which could end the
17-month conflict in Bosnia.
After 12 hours of talks in Geneva, where peace talks resumed after 11 days,
Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that progress could be made today on agreeing
on a map to split the republic into three mini-states. But, in contrast to
more upbeat statements from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, he
said: 'We have only discussed. No real progress so far. Maybe tomorrow.'
Mr Karadzic had appeared earlier to step up pressure on Mr Izetbegovic to
endorse a settlement today. He said: 'The negotiations are finished . . . we
expect the Moslems to sign the whole package tomorrow.'
While the two leaders appeared closer to an agreement, neither commented on
whether they had agreed to make changes in the proposed map. UN officials
played down the significance of an earlier announcement by Serb officials
that Serbs and Moslems had reached a five-point deal which included a
ceasefire and an early exchange of prisoners.
Meanwhile, in another sign of gathering momentum in the peace process,
western diplomats indicated that discussions were being stepped up for the
possible deployment of peacekeeping troops in the area.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Geneva today to discuss issues including
Bosnia. Nato officials in Brussels said the deployment of troops in Bosnia
was likely to be the central topic, but warned that the allies were still
not prepared to make any firm commitment yet on the numbers of troops.
However, the Russian government yesterday pledged to provide extra
peacekeeping troops for Bosnia in the event of a peace settlement between
the three warring factions, the first major power to do so unconditionally.
Speaking to reporters after meeting Mr Boutros Ghali, Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
Russia's foreign minister, said the number of troops would depend on the
terms of the peace accord and what their tasks would be.
It is widely expected in Nato that the US will provide a large part of the
40,000-plus extra peacekeeping troops that international mediators say will
be required to police a partition.
British officials indicated that Britain was considering contributing
several thousand troops, but stressed that a decision on the scale of its
commitment could not be made until the three sides had reached a firm peace
agreement in Geneva.
Although the Bosnian Serbs have accepted the peace package it is unclear if
they have made more territorial concessions to the mainly Moslem republic,
which, under the plan, will form a union along with the Croat and Serb
republics. But Mr Karadzic has previously refused to hand over more land to
the Moslems.
The Bosnian Moslems fear they will be wedged between the two ethnic states,
at the mercy of their foes.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Lamont returns to City as Rothschild director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who was dropped from the cabinet in
May, is to take on a job in the City. In a return to his former employer, Mr
Lamont will today join NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the merchant bank, as a
non-executive director on the main board while remaining a backbench MP.
Mr Lamont worked in asset management at Rothschild between 1968 and 1979
while starting his political career and serving as a Tory backbencher. He
left the City in 1979 to become a junior minister in the first Thatcher
government.
The former chancellor said yesterday he was 'delighted to be going back' to
Rothschild. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, the chairman, expects Mr Lamont to
spend two to three days a week working for the bank.
Sir Evelyn said he also expected Mr Lamont to have some 'roving commissions'
in which he could draw on his 'wide experience of the international scene',
his 'experience of government matters' and his many years as a Treasury
minister.
Neither Sir Evelyn nor Mr Lamont would discuss the former chancellor's
future income from Rothschild, although the annual report suggests most
non-executive directors earn between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000.
Since leaving the cabinet Mr Lamont has made do with a backbencher's salary
of Pounds 30,854 and payments for occasional newspaper articles. As
chancellor, he was paid Pounds 63,047, as well as having a 'tied cottage' in
the shape of 11 Downing Street and the use of a mansion at Dorneywood,
Buckinghamshire, for weekends.
Labour yesterday attacked Mr Lamont's appointment. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow
trade and industry secretary, said: 'Many of the people who were put out of
work by Norman Lamont's policies would have been only too pleased to pick up
a part-time job at his rate of pay.
'In fairness to them, he ought to have allowed a more decent interval before
taking up this post,' he added.
Mr Lamont said he expected to do other jobs, including writing his memoirs.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Lloyd's underwriters earn over Pounds 100,000 despite losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 150 Lloyd's underwriters earned Pounds 100,000 or more in 1992,
according to figures to be published today by the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the biggest organisation of Names.
The scale of remuneration - only marginally less than that paid in 1991 - is
bound to increase controversy at the market, where many Names face ruin
following losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.
Average earnings for the 150 best-paid underwriters were Pounds 143,673.
Although the figures include an element of profit-related pay for 1989, in
line with the market's three-year accounting system, the Lloyd's market as a
whole made losses of Pounds 2.1bn in that year.
Already one of the best paid underwriters, Mr Stephen Merrett, deputy
chairman of the insurance market, who was paid Pounds 207,000 as underwriter
of syndicate 418 in 1992, has been experiencing increasing difficulty in
persuading Names to continue to back his syndicates.
It emerged yesterday that members' agents, who handle the affairs of Names
and channel them on to syndicates, can supply only about Pounds 50m of
capital to the biggest of the Merrett Group's syndicates, number 418, for
next year. That is about a third of the level with which it is operating in
1993.
Syndicate 418, which underwrites US liability business, is one of the most
important in the Lloyd's market. A second Merrett syndicate, number 1,067,
has also suffered from a sharp fall in popularity among Names.
As a result the Merrett agency is stepping up its efforts to attract
corporate investors to support its business.
Merrett is hoping to convert Bermuda-based Underwriting Capital (Merrett) -
set up this year to provide reinsurance to its syndicates - into a fully
fledged incorporated Name as soon as Lloyd's rules permit. JP Morgan, the
bank, and Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, are the main
supporters of the company.

Congratulations to those LWT directors who have sold 13 per cent of their
shareholdings at the first opportunity. Like any sensible fund-manager they
have top-sliced a windfall profit - making sure of a cosy Christmas while
keeping a stake in the business. Despite institutional claims that the
kerfuffle over LWT is pure hindsight, the likely consequences were clear at
the time. Nor is it clear how investing institutions would react were a
similarly bizarre proposal to emerge now. Many apparently find it difficult
to object if boards and their financial advisers are agreed on a course of
action. Yet unless shareholders find the will to break the cosy consensus,
such excessive schemes may not be just a feature of the frothy 1980s.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flow of insurance capital into Bermuda must be galling for Lloyd's of
London as it tries to attract new blood of its own. The latest venture,
backed by Swiss Re with the promise of an international equity offering to
come, brings new capital committed this year to Bermuda to around Dollars
2bn. Most new Bermudan operations will reinsure catastrophe risks, an area
of the London market decimated by the string of natural disasters
culminating in Hurricane Andrew. Since demand for catastrophe reinsurance is
growing, it is only natural that fresh capital should fill the gap.
The benign Bermudan tax regime and the opportunity to invest in a new
venture with a clean sheet is proving a powerful attraction. In contrast
Lloyd's is still struggling with prior year losses and the threat of
litigation. So long as capital remains scarce, offshore centres like Bermuda
might complement rather than challenge the London market. Additional
reinsurance capacity should allow Lloyd's underwriters to place additional
business. In the hunt for additional capital to shore up the capacity of
Lloyd's itself, though, Bermuda has emerged as a serious competitor.
With catastrophe reinsurance rates more than doubling in many areas, and
even good-quality insurers still struggling to find sufficient cover, the
case for more capacity seems persuasive. But whether catastrophe rates are
now sufficient to cover the risk remains a moot point. One reading of the
recent claims record is that climatic change has made the world altogether
more risky than in the past. Such doubts might explain Swiss Re's
willingness to share the risks with outside investors rather than taking the
best of the business for itself.

FT  01 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must irk Walt Disney Company no end that having struggled hard to learn
from the mistakes of the past, it now finds itself in a deep and cunningly
constructed Parisian hole of its own devising. In bringing its theme park to
Europe, Disney won every concession its executives could dream of. All the
company needs now is for Euro Disney to make a profit. Sadly, that looks
like a wish that is unlikely to be granted soon.
The cash outflow from Euro Disney is likely to be FFr1.2bn this year and at
least FFr500m next. Gearing may exceed 400 per cent. Banks will be
understandably nervous of adding to the FFr20bn debts of the project, but
shareholders have few investment yardsticks to value any rights issue. The
company has no earnings and is unlikely to repeat last year's nominal
dividend. Euro Disney's asset value of FFr35 a share is also shrinking
rapidly. Even the discounted cash-flow model, beloved of those who launched
the first equity issue, has shown how present values can swing wildly
depending on the initial assumptions.
Since neither banks nor outside shareholders are keen, and the original deal
was so favourable to Walt Disney, it may be required to make concessions.
Disney apparently regards the FFr900m second phase of development as
important to build critical mass and fill the resort's hotels. One
possibility would be for Walt Disney to cut its management fees, buy the
hotels at a price reflecting their future value and then lease them back to
Euro Disney, generating cash for the second phase and allowing a rights
issue. Certainly Walt Disney's strictly limited financial commitment to the
project is an illusion. The last thing the US parent can afford is the
publicity that would surround the park's failure.

HSBC Holdings' 19.8 per cent net return on shareholders' funds makes it look
a paragon of virtue compared with other UK banks. The figure exceeds the
targets that many banks simply dream about. Yet, despite the prominence
accorded to this measure of performance in yesterday's interim figures, it
is not a reliable guide to how the bank is doing. For a start, any bank with
a large business in a relatively high-inflation centre such as Hong Kong
should expect a high return on capital. HSBC benefits from abnormally low
provisions, thanks partly to the large release of earlier provisions by
Marine Midland. Midland Bank's tax losses also make for an unusually low tax
rate.
The first half compares with a period when HSBC did not own Midland and had
large provisions on its exposure to Olympia &amp; York. Exchange rates were also
markedly different then. So the underlying picture is all the harder to
discern. Satisfactory, but not outstanding, appears to be the prosaic truth.
Certainly Chinese retrenchment suggests doubts about the growth prospects in
Hong Kong. HSBC itself admits it needs to restrain mortgage lending there.
While there appears no imminent risk of higher interest rates, HSBC could
face a rapid increase in bad debt provisions if any shocks emerged.
First-half bad debt provisions totalled only Pounds 50m in the Asia Pacific
region where group assets are Pounds 66bn.
HSBC must hope that declining provisions at Midland Bank would compensate if
good times in Asia come to an end. It would be pushed to offset any profits
shortfall with another large increase in dealing profits. More generally,
HSBC is much closer to the peak of its earnings cycle than the typical UK
clearer. Its 2.6 per cent operating return on risk assets is nothing out of
the ordinary, comparing with 2.5 per cent at Barclays and 2.7 per cent at
Lloyds. There does not seem to be much reason for the shares to out-perform
the sector.

A decade ago Haruki Kadokawa predicted that by 1994 he would have become one
of the world's most influential media tycoons. But this vaulting ambition
has been somewhat truncated by his sojourn over the past few days in police
custody answering questions about alleged cocaine use and importation.
A maker of big-budget period dramas, including Heaven and Earth, a 1989 film
in which 3,000 Canadian extras enacted a battle scene between warring
Japanese feudal clans, Kadokawa has been forced to watch the spectacle of
his own empire crumbling.
Although Kadokawa denies the prosecutors' allegation that he had asked staff
to bring in cocaine from the US, his publishing house, Kadokawa Shoten
Publishing, is not waiting for the outcome and has moved to dismiss him as
president. It is already worried by the extra diligence being shown by the
education ministry over student textbooks which it publishes and is fearful
of the potential impact on two of its most successful titles: Tokyo Walker,
an entertainment magazine, and The Television, a programme guide with a
circulation of 900,000.
Also affected is Rex, a cute cinematic dinosaur (director, Haruki Kadokawa)
and one of the bigger hits of the Japanese summer season. His career, unlike
those of the stars of Jurassic Park, is being cut short by an apprehensive
Japanese film distributor.

The Broadcasting Complaints Commission today entertains two of its most
distinguished ever complainants, two former chancellors of the exchequer,
Lords Howe and Lawson.
Their grievance concerns a Channel 4 programme, A Brief Economic History of
Our Time. First broadcast in February, it robustly dealt with the
Conservative government's monetary policies and Britain's 1980s boom and
recession.
The two peers of the realm, central players at the time, have decided to
exercise their right of complaint because they believe the programme was
almost entirely 'a critical and partisan polemic'. They also argue that if
they had not been misled about the nature of the programme they would have
declined to be interviewed for it.
The third chancellor interviewed - Labour peer Lord Healey - appears not to
have taken exception to the programme. Healey obviously felt that the
programme fell short of 'being savaged by a dead sheep' - how he once
described being attacked by the then Sir Geoffrey Howe.
Channel 4 and Fulcrum, the independent producers who made the programme, are
taking a strong line. Their intended defence is that the programme was not
only true, but also fair and balanced. But if Fulcrum and its main
investigative reporter Christopher Hird are found 'guilty' by the BCC, an
apology will have to hit Channel 4's airwaves.

Having an ex-chancellor on the board did not keep GPA out of the mire, nor

So Observer wishes Sir Evelyn de Rothschild better luck with his decision to
invite Norman Lamont back to his former employer.
'We are showing loyalty to someone who worked here,' says Sir Evelyn of the
man who was employed in treasury and fund management at the bank from
1968-1979.
Meanwhile, Sir Evelyn professes to be unruffled by any unguided missiles
Lamont might launch on the fringes of the party conference, hence possibly
endangering those close government links that are so valuable to merchant
banks. 'He has more friends than people think,' says the chairman of NM
Rothschild.

Britain's new ambassador to Azerbaijan, who takes up his new posting in Baku
today, will not be lacking in ex-pat company. Many officials from British
Gas and elsewhere, involved in a multi-million pound gas exploration deal,
are flocking to the region. This is in marked contrast to his colleagues
scattered around the rest of the former Soviet Union, where the British
government's tightly-drawn purse-strings have left a diplomatic community
definitely lacking in depth.
In the Baltic states, Lithuania and Estonia manage just four diplomats
between them; Latvia has the same number all to itself. These territories
may be small - boasting a combined population of just 8m. All the same
Malta, which is not generally considered to be a bridgehead to the lucrative
Russian market, has seven people, excluding the local hires.
The Germans, Danes and Swedes are ubiquitous on the ex-USSR's western
frontier - partly for historical reasons, to be sure. But even France which,
like the UK, has few traditional links to the region, has opened a trade
mission in Vilnius.
Next door, in Belarus, it gets worse. The UK 'shares' an embassy with
Germany - meaning that the man in Minsk has one room in the old east German
consulate, where the receptionist barely speaks English. At least Graham
Greene's Man in Havana employed a secretary.
In Kazakhstan, the Germans are also being similarly hospitable, while
Britain so far goes unrepresented in Turkmenistan and Georgia.
The Foreign Office is not insensitive to the problem, and defends the
distribution of resources, saying that these new states are 'still very much
on the periphery'. But who will be on the periphery in a decade or two?

In his recent book, Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic
Conflict, and his article in the FT ('Good and bad of managed trade', August
18), C Fred Bergsten defends his case for voluntary import expansion
agreements. He differentiates them from protectionism - namely voluntary
export restraint agreements - and argues that expansion agreements are
pro-trade and useful to improve access to the Japanese market.
I believe there are real risks in implementing voluntary import expansion
agreements (VIEs).
It is possible to introduce them only with the Japanese government's active
meddling with the market. Vague words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and
'encourage' used in existing VIEs are synonymous with an invitation to
open-ended government interventions. It is very confusing that, on the one
hand, the US government urges more market-oriented, pro-consumer policies in
Japan while, on the other, it calls for more market intervention through
VIEs. If we want to let market forces work in consumers' best interests,
intervention will be counter-productive. It will result in further control
and market regulation.
Mr Bergsten argues that VIEs expand trade and enhance competition. But they
are also anti-competitive. How can an agreement enhance competition if it
pro-hibits at least 20 per cent of Japanese users from buying domestic
chips?
Regarding Mr Bergsten's call to use VIEs only temporarily, it seems unlikely
that once they are in place there will be any inclination to get rid of
them. For example, after the initial five-year period, the Reagan
administration's semiconductor VIE was extended for another five years. Is a
10-year period temporary? What makes Mr Bergsten confident they will not be
used indefinitely with increased import targets? It is much more difficult
to terminate VIEs than to initiate them, and no one has ever succeeded in
doing so.
In spite of Mr Bergsten's second caution that VIEs be used sparingly, how
can business executives resist them when their governments will do the job
of developing a foreign market free of charge? The cost of forced imports is
borne by the targeted country, and the other country loses nothing by
demanding a VIE. Mr Bergsten suggests VIEs should be open to all countries
and denounces the Bush VIE on car and car parts, which benefits only US
companies and which, according to Mr Bergsten, Mr Clinton firmly rejects.
But in our bilateral consultations, the Clinton administration seems to be
pursuing the same approach vigorously.
In Reconcilable Differences?, Mr Bergsten writes that the semiconductor VIE
can take substantial credit for the increased share of foreign companies in
that Japanese market. But market share depends on the efforts of companies
and the market situation, and it is not something that an official text can
determine. At present, we see some worrying signs of deterioration in the
Japanese economy. It would come as no surprise if the economic environment
became less conducive to imports.
Business people tend to be discouraged by VIEs from making their products
more competitive. Instead, they are encouraged to press their governments
for a guaranteed slice of a foreign market. The fact that when
then-President George Bush visited Tokyo he was accompanied by three car
industry executives supports this view. It is imperative in our market
economy to get straight what the government is supposed to do and not to do,
and to have business people take responsibility for business matters. They
should not be given a way to blame others for what is their own fault.
VIEs are becoming increasingly out of date as corporate activities become
more globalised. The sourcing of parts and components, foreign investment
and the movement of technology and money on a global scale are now a matter
of fact. Corporate alliances among companies of different nationalities in
research and development, production and marketing are spreading throughout
the world. As a result, the nationality of a company and product is now so
complex and difficult to identify that any definition of imported or foreign
product is arbitrary and incomplete.
Mr Bergsten plays down the risk of inviting unrestrained government
interventions, and blurs distinctions between public and private sectors.
Consequently he fails to appreciate the self-perpetuating and contagious
nature of VIEs. Our experience suggests that they will not work in the way
he expects.

THE POLITICAL landscape of the Middle East has taken on a slightly surreal
aspect this week. If both sides are to be believed, Israel and the
Palestinians may be on the point of signing an agreement that will provide
an interim framework for Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. As remarkably, Israel may agree to withdraw its troops
from an area of the West Bank around Jericho and from Gaza as a first step
towards military disengagement.
To cap it all, Mr Yitzhak Rabin's coalition government may break a taboo of
decades by recognising the PLO; allowing Palestinian leaders to set
themselves up in Jericho; and even affording protection for top PLO
personalities as they seek to sell the deal to sceptical or hostile
constituents. It would scarcely come as a surprise after all that to read of
lions whelping in Jerusalem's streets.
Can this be the same Mr Rabin as had disappointed so many expectations since
he was elected last year with a promise to reach a rapid Middle East peace
agreement? Is this the same PLO that vowed in its founding charter to wage
'armed struggle' until Israel was destroyed, and that has proved singularly
incapable of seizing opportunities for progress towards an accommodation
with the Jewish state?
Weary precedent suggests caution is in order. Much could still go wrong as
the Washington peace negotiations enter their 11th round. Many details of
the purported Israeli-Palestinian accord remain unclear or contested; other
participants such as Jordan and Syria are rattled by a deal struck behind
their backs; and the Palestinian movement is even more fractious than usual
 -divided between the occupied territories and the diaspora, and stalked by
the threat of an assassin's bullet. Nevertheless, the claims of breakthrough
are sufficiently insistent for the outside world, and in particular the US,
to embark now on a concerted effort to ensure that it occurs.
Great credit
It is to the great credit of Mr Rabin's government and of Mr Yassir Arafat,
the PLO chairman, that the two sides have got this far largely on their own.
Doing so required the super-cautious Mr Rabin to manoeuvre delicately:
gradually acclimatising Israelis to the idea of talking to their sworn enemy
while at the same time guarding his flank against charges of jeopardising
Israeli security. For Mr Arafat, negotiating from extreme weakness, the
risks are if anything even greater. But he has shown commendable
single-mindedness in carrying most of his rebellious cohorts along towards
an agreement that will fully benefit only some of them.
Cherished principles
The problem is that Israel and the PLO may not be capable of arriving at
their destination unaided. The distrust between them and among Arab leaders
remains too great. Moreover, Mr Arafat's legitimacy among his own people is
not undisputed: many Palestinians suspect him of throwing overboard
cherished principles - such as the status of Jerusalem - to strike a deal
while he can.
To still such fears, the US should now decisively raise the profile of its
involvement and nudge the parties further towards clarifying their
intentions. Both Israel and the Palestinians should state clearly that this
agreement is an interim one without prejudice to a final settlement in any
respect, including Jerusalem. Jordan and Syria should be offered high-level
American reassurances that the Israeli-Palestinian deal is part of the
multilateral process, not designed to cut them out.
Most important, the structure of the Middle East negotiations - which
currently institutionalises Palestinian divisions by directly involving only
hand-picked representatives from the occupied territories - urgently needs
to be changed. Israel should go the extra mile and sit openly with the PLO
without insisting that it go through the difficult and tortuous process of
amending a charter that Mr Arafat has already declared null and void. If Mr
Rabin is worried that such a step would imply eventual Israeli acceptance in
principle of an independent Palestinian state, so be it. Some form of
Palestinian sovereignty is the only basis on which a final settlement can be
reached, and it would be better to admit as much now.

IT IS unlikely that the people who share this planet will ever agree about
which parts of the environment they want to preserve. The question is how
countries should go about settling disputes that arise from their differing
environmental standards.
Countries accuse others of causing them environmental harm in many different
ways. Most directly, pollution may spill across national borders.
Manufacturers in developed countries may also claim that laxer regulation in
developing countries allows companies located there to enjoy lower
production costs. Countries may also damage common environmental 'goods' by
polluting the world's atmosphere and oceans. Or there may be perceived harm,
arising for example when one country's treatment of certain animals is
judged offensive by another.
Such accusations have tended to be hurled by developed countries at
developing ones. Too often, the complaints are accompanied by threats of
trade restrictions. Some argue that the environmental damage is due to
economic growth, and that trade is bad because it stimulates growth still
further. Others claim that 'ecological dumping' occurs when exporters are
able to benefit from an environmentally permissive policy regime and call
for protection in response. Some may simply seize on trade as the easiest
available tool for enforcing their views. These arguments are often
propounded by environmentalists, who have tended to see multilateral trade
negotiations such as GATT and Nafta as threats to environmental standards.
Comparative advantage
Trade policy is generally the wrong response. For a start, poverty is an
important cause of environmental degradation, and trade can offer an escape
from poverty. Growth and affluence also increase the political demand for a
better environment. Furthermore, specialisation on the basis of comparative
advantage reduces many forms of pollution. One reason for this is that
industrial countries have a comparative advantage in some of the most
polluting industries, which are usually capital intensive, but also possess
the best anti-pollution technology.
Claims of unfair competition are easily abused by protectionist interests.
What is more, it is dangerous to behave as if every policy difference
between countries represents some kind of subsidy. At the limit all policy
differences between countries would have to be eliminated.
Hypocrisy
Developing countries are also right to detect an element of hypocrisy in the
demands of the richer ones that they clean up, since the latter gave scant
regard to keeping the environment clean during their own industrialisation.
Moreover, the largest output of greenhouse gases - arguably, the most
important global threat - still comes from developed countries. That is not
to say that pollution is an inescapable by-product of industrialisation -
some forms of pollution can be avoided at little cost, examples being land
and groundwater contamination. But, as a starting point, the choice of
standards should lie with the individual country.
Rather than entangling trade with environment policy, rich countries should
offer compensation when seeking to impose environmental policies poorer ones
do not share. Rio, which secured international agreement on measures to
avoid global warming and protect the diversity of animal and plant life,
recognised this principle in giving its backing to the Global Environment
Facility run jointly by the World Bank and the United Nations. The fund, set
up in 1990, plans to make up to Dollars 4bn available for funding projects
in developing countries projects over the next three years. Similarly, the
1987 Montreal Protocol on protecting the ozone layer of the atmosphere is
backed by a Dollars 200m fund to help developing countries meet its terms.
That approach is controversial, with respect both to raising the money and
disbursing it, as both these funds have shown. But at least it makes the
price of the bargain explicit, and forces the people of developed countries
to face up to the question of whether they really want to pay it.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Mr Grumpy at the door: Alice Rawsthorn and Michael Skapinker
ask whether Disney's European adventure will have a fairytale ending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
As the head of a group famed for its marketing of fantasy, Mr Michael
Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, has little difficulty finding cheer where
others see only gloom.
But even he seems taken aback by this summer's wave of media coverage about
the financial problems of Euro Disney, the group's theme park which opened
near Paris last year.
Most worrying for the group and its shareholders is that some observers have
begun to ask the previously unthinkable: will Euro Disney have to close for
the winter or, worse, might it have to close altogether?
Mr Eisner said yesterday that he might consider closing the park for a
limited period during the winter under certain circumstances. He might agree
to partial closure, he said, 'if Euro Disney came to me and said it was
economically advisable and wouldn't be negative for perception. Disneyland
in California used to close on Mondays and Tuesdays before I became
chairman.'
Partial closure, however, is not his favoured option. 'I don't believe the
park should close for a single day,' he says. 'Euro Disney closed the
Newport Bay Hotel for a while last winter and I think that sent the wrong
signal.'
When Euro Disney opened in April last year, accompanied by a two-hour live
television broadcast to 30 countries and a Dollars 10m TV advertising
campaign, closure was the last thing on the company's mind. The fanfare
invited intense scrutiny - so the company is in no position to complain
about the detailed attention given to Europe's biggest leisure attraction.
But Mr Eisner is irritated by the focus on Euro Disney's problems rather
than its potential. 'Every little pimple is written about. Euro Disney is a
great product and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't love it. But down the
road, discussion of the economic issues could affect public perception of
the product. It hasn't happened yet, but if we don't turn it round, it
might.'
The economic issues warrant discussion. Euro Disney lost FFr339m (Pounds
39m) in its last financial year to September 30 and is on course for a
further loss of more than FFr1.8bn this year. Its net debt has risen from
FFr18.5bn to FFr20.3bn since the start of the current financial year. Euro
Disney is now in danger of running out of cash. Walt Disney has promised to
provide financial support while the two companies try to restructure Euro
Disney's finances.
In the meantime, Walt Disney faces heavy losses on its 49 per cent stake in
Euro Disney. It lost Dollars 30.9m on the holding in the third quarter of
the current financial year alone and would have lost Dollars 48.8m under its
old accounting rules.
Mr Eisner does have some advantages, notably Wall Street's faith in Walt
Disney as a whole. As it attempts to resolve its problems at Euro Disney,
the group can rely on its strong track record in producing hit movies and
its schedule of new films for 1994 and beyond.
Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst at New York broker Paine Webber, believes
Euro Disney will succeed as the economy improves in France and Europe.
Meanwhile, Walt Disney's third-quarter results, to the end of June, saw a
reasonably healthy 10 per cent increase in underlying earnings per share
compared with 1992, although revenues from filmed entertainment dropped and
the company has not had a box office hit in the US this summer.
Wall Street is expecting strong earnings momentum next year, when Disney
will be greatly expanding its film production. However, the group's
association with Euro Disney's heavily publicised problems risks damaging
its gilded reputation with investors.
How did Disney, one of the world's most successful leisure and entertainment
groups, manage to get its European park so badly wrong? From the start,
questions were asked about Disney's ability to repeat its US success in
Europe.
The Paris climate was unsuitable, critics said, and visitors would not come
during the winter. The cost of running a park in Europe was high, they
added, and the prices would reflect that. Many potential visitors might
prefer to go to Walt Disney World in Florida, where the price per night was
no higher and the sun was more likely to shine.
In addition to these potential problems, Euro Disney had the misfortune to
open just as Europe entered its worst recession since the war. In its first
year, Euro Disney fared reasonably well in terms of attendance, hitting its
target of 11m visitors at the end of April, just over a fortnight later than
expected. However, income from catering, merchandise and hotels was well
below expectations.
In the spring and summer of this year, trading deteriorated still further.
It was only this summer, Mr Eisner says, that the gravity of the situation
became apparent. He says: 'It didn't hit until May and June. We realised
then that attendance was not up to last year's levels and that per capita
expenditure was substantially down.'
Added to the ravages of the recession was the strength of the French franc
which had risen sharply against some European currencies following last
September's exchange rate crisis. Attendance from countries with weaker
currencies, notably the UK and Italy, fell sharply.
The cost of servicing Euro Disney's debt ballooned, partly because, until
recently, French interest rates have been higher than initial budget
forecasts. Euro Disney was also forced to postpone construction plans,
thereby depriving the company of potential capital gains with which it had
originally planned to reduce its borrowings.
One obvious answer to Euro Disney's difficulties is to cut costs. The
company has made significant cuts in the past 18 months, particularly in
staffing levels. When it opened, staffing costs exceeded the planned budget,
Mr Eisner says. 'There was this absolute feeling of 'let's get this show on
the road',' he says. 'I don't know whether we overspent then, because it
should pay off over the next two or three decades. But it took us a while to
recover financially from having too much fat and satisfying every little
whim.'
Mr Eisner envisages further cuts, but is vague about where they will fall.
'There will be some tidying up, but only to the extent that we don't damage
the experience for our customers. We're looking at all the various areas.'
In the meantime, Mr Eisner hopes to increase attendance by continuing to cut
ticket prices for local residents and by capitalising on the franc's recent
fall against other European currencies by marketing the park in other
countries, notably the UK. These initiatives, Mr Eisner hopes, will be
helped by further falls in the franc's value and by an improvement in
Europe's economic outlook, particularly in France. 'We ought to be able to
achieve a lot through better trading,' he says.
However, Euro Disney's financial condition is so fragile that even a
dramatic improvement in its operations is unlikely to do more than partially
alleviate its difficulties. Mr Eisner says that Euro Disney has not, so far,
had to call on Walt Disney's offer of financial support. But observers
suspect that Euro Disney may have to do so by November, when attendance
falls off as the chilly winter season sets in and cash flow comes under
strain. This suggests that, whatever improvements it makes in its
operations, the company will need an injection of new capital as part of a
formal restructuring.
Euro Disney and its US parent are now in the early stages of assembling a
financial restructuring package. Here, too, Mr Eisner refuses to be
specific. 'All I can say is that we're examining every option,' he says. He
describes a possible rights issue as 'one of a list of 10 very good ideas'.
Mr Eisner hopes to finalise the restructuring plan over coming months and
present it to shareholders by next March. 'I wouldn't like to be talking
about it this time next year,' he says. 'The sooner it is completed the
better - not for financial reasons, but for public relations reasons.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No U-turn on nuclear fuel storage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PATRICK GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), is incorrect
to claim (Letters, August 21) that Friends of the Earth has made a
'staggering U-turn' by suggesting that BNFL should offer to store its
customers' used nuclear fuel, either at Sellafield or abroad, instead of
reprocessing it in Thorp. We made this proposal at the 1977 Windscale
inquiry and have consistently advocated it ever since.
Contrary to BNFL's unsubstantiated claims, storage is a safer and viable
alternative to reprocessing. Indeed, Scottish Nuclear will save around
Pounds 45m a year by storing its spent fuel in a purpose-built store at its
Torness reactor instead of sending it to Thorp for reprocessing.
If the economic case for Thorp is as 'robust' as Mr Guinness claims, BNFL
should have nothing to fear from independent scrutiny of its arguments.
BNFL's continued refusal to publish the Touche Ross economic assessment of
Thorp only serves to demonstrate that BNFL fears the flawed logic of
reprocessing will be exposed by its publication. Consequently, BNFL is in no
position to argue that there is no alternative to opening Thorp.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Little evidence of government success
with Citizen's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN N ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We welcomed the more objectively based assessment of the picture of
public services painted by David Owen than that released by the government's
own Citizen's Charter Unit. Your report on the findings of the ICM Research
Survey was honestly headed 'Public services rapped: Citizen's Charter
appears to be bringing little improvement' (August 26) - while the Citizen's
Charter Unit's press release was headed 'Survey shows widespread support for
Citizen's Charter'.
It may be true that there is widespread support for the charter - and why
shouldn't there be? There is little evidence, however, that the government's
policies for achieving these objectives are having any success or that they
carry the wide support that the Citizen's Charter Unit claims.
The survey shows, as your report made clear, that of 31 organisations about
which 3,000 people were questioned only eight were considered to have
improved during the last year. Among those was the Post Office, with a 92
per cent rating for overall performance.
The only policy for achieving the promised improvements of the Citizen's
Charter that received strong support was more regular inspection of
providers of services. Trade unions are always accused by this government of
pursuing vested interests, yet we were never listened to when we pressed for
improvements in the delivery of services long before the Citizen's Charter
was launched and we are not listened to now.
More and more people are beginning to say that the government's blind policy
of privatising everything it can is wrong-headed. There is a growing belief
that the policy is simply dogma and that cost and damage do not matter.
Maybe if the government would stop the nonsense of market testing the entire
civil service at enormous cost, and abandon the stupidity of privatising
British Rail and the Post Office, its claimed objectives would be treated
more seriously. At the moment it is pushing an ever growing boulder.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Theft in a shop is no less a crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY HYMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your recent photograph of a Covent Garden scene referring to 100
arrests being made as a result of a paging initiative continues to talk
about 'shoplifters' ('Arrests in Covent Garden increase as a result of
initiative with Mercury Paging', August 24).
The success which the police and the retailers are enjoying in combating
shop crime is not helped if the euphemism 'shoplifter' continues to be used.
We are not talking about a naughty schoolboy nicking a packet of sweets for
a lark, although that itself often leads to worse crime and a belief that it
is fair game.
What is under discussion is wholesale and often violent theft by groups of
people stealing to order and costing the honest customer money in the long
run. Someone who steals from a bank is not called a banklifter, he is called
a thief or worse.
What we are combating is professional shop theft and we should all start
saying so.

FT  01 SEP 93 / There's life in it yet: European union will go forward, but
it needs a route map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of the death of the European exchange rate mechanism are
exaggerated, but not greatly. Reports of the death of the Maastricht Treaty
on European Union are, to say the least, premature. Reports that the
European idea has run its course and can now be consigned to the dustbin of
history are pure fantasy, whether the fantasy of morbid continental
Spenglerians or that of euphoric 'Anglo-Saxon' Cobdenites.
There are two overwhelming reasons why the drive for greater European
integration will continue: security and the single market.
Take the latter first, since it is supposed to be less controversial,
although I believe it is the more troublesome of the two. Most
anti-Maastricht Eurosceptics say they are in favour of the single market.
They fail to realise that the single market is responsible for nearly all
the things ordinary people dislike, or think they dislike, about the EC.
Everyone has a favourite horror story about the manic desire of 'Brussels
bureaucrats' to regulate everything, from the colour of flamingoes to the
size of honeypots. Often these stories are accompanied by bitter complaints
about the effect of the EC in dismantling national regulations and exposing
the citizen to bigger lorries or lower standards of consumer protection.
Similarly, most businessmen have one list of complaints about the unfair
competition to which the EC exposes them in their domestic market from
rivals that are subject to less stringent national regulation, and another
about the grotesque national regulations or business practices that still
prevent them from exporting to, or investing in, the market of another EC
member state.
The single market only became remotely feasible when it was agreed, in the
mid-1980s, to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of national
regulations in preference to complete harmonisation. But hundreds of EC
directives were still needed to make it a reality, because so many national
regulations were seen in other member states either as inadequate protection
for consumers or as non-tariff barriers to trade and investment.
There is no elegant, global solution to this problem. 'Subsidiarity',
meaning that whatever can be should be left to national or local regulation,
is a good principle, but you still have to agree on how it applies in each
particular case. Most of the pressure to harmonise does not come from
'Brussels bureaucrats', but from consumer and producer lobbies in member
states. It will continue.
Even the quest for a single currency arises partly from a desire to
eliminate uncertainties and transaction costs which fragment the market, and
partly from fear that the single market leaves producers defenceless against
competing products priced in a national currency which may depreciate
against their own.
Recent events have shown that the attempt to maintain fixed parities between
separate currencies also imposes intolerable strains, but that will only
increase many people's eagerness to move to an arrangement where monetary
policy for the whole market is decided by consensus, rather than
unilaterally by the country with the strongest currency.
Security is a simpler matter, because the idea that states need to band
together in a league or confederacy for the common defence of their separate
national sovereignties, sacrificing a degree of autonomy for the sake of
preserv-ing the rest, is familiar and well understood.
If the EC's contribution to security has up to now been indirect rather than
direct, that is because its members looked to the Atlantic alliance for
their common defence. This was sensible so long as the main perceived threat
was the expansionism of a neighbouring superpower, which western Europe and
the other superpower had a common interest in resisting. Europe probably
could not have defended itself without US help, and the US had no intention
of leaving Europe to its fate.
Things are different now. The US retains an interest in European security,
but is struggling to redefine that interest in a new strategic context. The
dangers Europe faces are much more diffuse than in the past. Most of them -
the main exception being nuclear proliferation - are far less directly or
obviously threatening to US interests than was Soviet communism. Although
Europe's capacity to handle them on its own is in doubt, the doubt relates
to political will and strategic vision rather than material resources; and
in these areas it is not obvious that the US can make up for Europe's
deficiencies.
Security is not only a matter of armies and weapons, essential though those
still are. As well as managing, and preferably preventing, conflicts on or
near its borders, the European union (as the EC will become once Germany has
ratified the treaty) faces the need to police those borders against illegal
immigration and transnational crime, and to ensure order and security within
them.
Already these issues are the subject of intense intergovernmental
co-operation, which Title VI of the treaty (on justice and home affairs)
will further institutionalise. They are issues about which ordinary people
throughout Europe care passionately. True, they still tend to see them
mainly in a national framework, but even such a fierce nationalist as the
French interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua (a leading figure in last year's
anti-Maastricht campaign), admitted recently that many aspects of them could
no longer be handled by any EC member state on its own.
Europe will go forward. But it badly needs a new route map. Next week I
shall try to sketch in a few landmarks for the years ahead.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Not a penny more, not a penny less: Efforts to ensure UK men
and women receive the same pay for the same work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should a female finance clerk be paid the same as a male van driver? The
question raises complex and sensitive issues.
Last week the issues entered the limelight when the Equal Opportunities
Commission said the UK government was failing to implement European
Community law on equal pay.
After 13 years of argument with the government, the commission's governing
board said it would refer the matter to the European Commission in Brussels
for clarification.
'We are charged by parliament to enforce the pay equality laws but that law
is not working as it was supposed to do. It is our responsibility to see
that it does,' says Ms Kamlesh Bahl, the commission's part-time chairman.
Set up in 1975 to promote equality of opportunity between women and men, the
commission has often been called ineffective.
By taking this unprecedented public step over equal pay last week, the
commission surprised the government. Department of Employment officials had
already scheduled a meeting with the commission for October 4 to discuss the
legal changes Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, might be willing to
make.
Ms Bahl welcomes the department's initiative, but sees no reason to abandon
the action for clarification of the law from the European Commission.
'Issues of substance will still remain that must be resolved,' she argues.
But ministers believe the commission is too impatient over what is a complex
area. They deny Britain is dragging its feet over implementing equal pay
legislation.
The Department of Employment says its legal advisers are confident the UK is
not in breach of its EC equal pay obligations. It believes the referral of
the issue to Brussels will not help resolve genuine difficulties over
implementing the UK's equal pay laws.
Ministers' complaints that the commission should put the equal pay issue
into a wider perspective are echoed in the private sector. 'British women
have made larger advances at work than those from any other EC country in
the 1980s,' says Mr Graham Mather, head of European Policy Forum, the
independent think-tank.
The UK's flexible, deregulated labour market has helped create the biggest
female job market in Europe, the government argues; women in the UK are also
less likely to be unemployed than men in a recession.
In a recent paper to EC president Jacques Delors, the government said: 'The
Community must avoid imposing labour market regulations that increase costs,
lock member states and employers unnecessarily into existing rigidities or
make it harder to create new jobs.'
By approaching Brussels, however, the commission has decided not to rely on
the government's willingness to negotiate, but to apply pressure by
highlighting the UK's legal commitment to equal pay as enshrined in the
Treaty of Rome, the EC's constitution. All 12 EC member states are bound to
introduce equal pay under article 119 of the treaty.
The equal pay concept was widened by an EC directive in 1975. No longer was
the aim to ensure men and women received the same pay for doing the same or
similar jobs; there was also to be equal pay for work of equal value.
It is this requirement which prompts British government concern. Officials
claim the EC has failed to define clearly what this means in practice.
The Equal Opportunities Commission shares some of the government's
frustration. But it is also exasperated at the lack of progress towards
equal pay. It points out that women in all sectors in the UK earn on average
71 per cent of a man's weekly pay. In British manufacturing, the figure
falls to 59 per cent of the weekly pay of male non-manual workers. There has
been no significant narrowing of the gap since the early 1970s. The
Department of Employment earnings survey for 1992 shows women's average
earnings were Pounds 241.10 a week against Pounds 340.10 for men.
The commission believes legal complexities are hampering moves to close the
pay gap, adding that complaints procedures for cases of 'equal value', made
through industrial tribunals, are tortuous.
Equal value claims take on average 32 months, and a number have taken more
than seven years. Only 23 claims in equal value cases have succeeded in
nearly 10 years.
In addition, the wording of the law is imprecise, argues the commission.
This puts off potential claimants. According to UK law, a job must be of
equal value 'in terms of the demands made on the woman or man (measured by
effort, skill and level of responsibility) to that of a man or woman in the
same employment'.
At present the commission is funding an equal value case brought by a senior
grade speech therapist, who is trying to compare her job with that of a
senior grade pharmacist.
A further concern for the commission is that an equal pay award made to one
person cannot be extended to cover others doing the same jobs.
The commission wants several changes to existing equal pay laws. It is
calling for:
The automatic transfer of cases from industrial tribunals to the Employment
Appeals Tribunal.
The abolition of a tribunal's legal requirement to decide whether a person
has 'reasonable grounds' to pursue an equal value claim.
The creation of full-time assessors of equal value, and a strict timetable
for claims processing.
An end to the use of job evaluation studies by employers to stop an equal
value claim.
The extension of equal pay awards beyond the individual claimant so that all
employees in the same employment, who do the same or broadly similar work,
would be entitled to the same award.
The right for trade unions and the commission to challenge alleged
discriminatory aspects of collective agreements.
The right for the commission to initiate its own legal proceedings against
employers.
Mr Hunt told the commission last month that he was willing to make changes
to speed up procedures in equal value cases, including: Agreeing to abolish
the requirement that a tribunal should determine whether there are no
reasonable grounds for claim.
Accepting that an employer can only offer one justification of pay
differences between male and female workers.
Requiring independent experts to decide, within a 14-day time limit, whether
they will conduct an investigation.
Ministers baulk, however, at moves to extend the applicability of equal pay
or equal value awards beyond individual workers to others in a company. Nor
will they accept that the commission or trade unions should act on behalf of
a group of workers to bring equal pay cases to court.
Mr Hunt has reminded the commission that the government needs to avoid undue
burdens on employers, which could threaten jobs.
The commission feels only Brussels can bring reform. But its hopes may be
dashed. A recent confidential European Commission report complains of
difficulties in enforcing a commitment to equal pay across the EC. It admits
that 'little effective progress' has been made on the issue anywhere in the
EC, and suggests there remains 'a widespread lack of knowledge of the legal
provisions and practical ways' of dealing with equal pay among governments,
unions and employer bodies. As many as six EC countries - including Italy,
Spain and Belgium - have not even bothered to define equal value in their
legislation.
'Much remains to be done not only to ensure effective implementation of
existing community law but also to clarify complex concepts,' the EC report
notes. As Europe grapples with the worst unemployment crisis in 60 years,
the Equal Opportunities Commission may find Brussels unwilling to strengthen
legislation that could imperil job creation. If it has to wait years for an
answer and then comes back empty-handed, the cause it is fighting for may be
harmed.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Deserving winner in LWT share scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL NEUBURG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article on the beneficiaries of the LWT share scheme, Anwer
Bati is quoted describing Barry Cox as 'a very nice guy, was an ordinary
programme maker. Now he's worth Pounds 1.5m'. At the time of Bati's brief
spell at LWT as researcher in features, Cox was controller of current
affairs and features, known throughout not just LWT but the industry. He had
been originating editor of The London Programme, still going after nearly
two decades and, as a quality local series, a prime earner of brownie points
for franchise renewal.
Cox invented a range of other programmes, including The Six O'Clock Show, a
pioneer among 'infotainment' ventures which gave Greg Dyke his first chance
to shine as editor. As controller of corporate affairs, Cox had a key role
in formulating and implementing the strategy that won the new franchise on
which the current share price is based. In LWT's game of chance, Barry Cox
is one of the deserving winners.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Price rises not only BR option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN K WELSBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex, prompted apparently by reports of decisions still to be taken, is
ungenerous in accusing BR's management of seeing higher prices as the only
way to increase net revenues ('British Rail', August 24).
All three passenger businesses have continuing promotional programmes to
boost passenger numbers, especially off-peak. When a coach operator
complains to the Office of Fair Trading (unsuccessfully I hasten to add)
that InterCity is offering fares that are too cheap, it is apparent that
British Rail managers are not lacking in the competitive imagination you are
looking for.
Similarly, when hundreds of thousands of new customers are introduced to
rail travel through joint promotions with Boots and Shell, BR is clearly
expanding and developing its customer base.
For the railways, like any major business, pricing is only one element of
financial management and is considered in conjunction with cost-control
measures and marketing initiatives as well as the need - particularly
important in the public sector - to meet stringent annual cash limits.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Street Scene - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND offering of the 1993-94 English National Opera season is an
absolutely first-rate revival of Kurt Weill's Street Scene. The company has
taken time to get under the work's skin - when first shown at the Coliseum,
in 1989, this David Pountney production seemed disappointingly overloaded
with staging tricks. Now these are scraped away, to reveal an operatic
cityscape teeming with acutely observed character, and contained by an exact
appreciation of Weill's multifarious musico-dramatic skills and
single-minded purpose.
In this 1946 'Broadway opera' the blending of his European and American
styles achieves something entirely sui generis (not the less so for having
Porgy and Bess in its direct line of ancestry). Rich in incident, with a
knockout 'specialty number' in each act, the piece is actually a tightly
unified examination of life at the raw end of the modern city. 'Why do we go
on living in this sewer?' - the question framed by Sam Kaplan, the opera's
conscience - is its theme.
Street Scene is a work at once 'serious' and 'popular'; for me it is one of
the masterpieces of 20th-century opera. Certainly, ENO perform it as though
every member of the large ensemble subscribed with missionary enthusiasm to
that belief. James Holmes, who conducted last year's revival, unfolds the
tapestry with masterly tautness (which includes the knack of knowing where
to relax his grip). Voices are occasionally covered (do I now detect
amplification of the slighter singing voices, as well as of spoken
dialogue?). In spite of this, every detail tells.
Most of the current cast also took on their roles last year: the superbly
in-the-blood accounts of Frank Maurrant (by Mark Richardson), Mrs Jones
(Meriel Dickinson), Harry Easter (Richard Halton), Henry (Keel Watson), the
song-and-dance duo (Philip Gould and Caroline O'Connor) - and too many
others to list ' deserve a column of close-focused praise all to themselves.
So does the lean, quicksilver Sam of Kevin Anderson (whose quietly
reflective 'Lonely House' is a high point); in all her London appearances
Lesley Garrett has done nothing better than this warm, candid, gutsy Rose
Maurrant.
But I cannot end without celebrating the new Mrs Maurrant, Josephine
Barstow. She has already recorded the part (for Decca); now she adds it to
her long list of ENO glories. Anna Maurrant is the opera's tragic victim;
each of the company's previous incumbents - Kristine Ciesinski, Phyllis
Cannan, Janice Cairns - brought something intense, illuminating, heartfelt
to the part, and only a fool would want to claim latest as best. But
Barstow's tremors and frailty, her brief moments of bruised tenderness, her
soaring account of the Act 1 aria are the quintessence of her singer-actor's
art.
Sponsored by Woolwich Building Society; in repertory at the London Coliseum
until September 28.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Sex, death on the fringe - Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEX AND death were already to the fore in the first bunch of plays the
Traverse presented during this Edinburgh Festival. They are more so in the
five plays that have now joined the Traverse repertory. In Brad Fraser's The
Ugly Man, they are conjoined. Fraser is the Canadian author of Unidentified
Human Remains and the True Nature of Love (an award-winner recently seen at
the Hampstead theatre); The Ugly Man, which is shown here by the Canadian
troupe One Yellow Rabbit, is his modern-day version of The Changeling,
re-set on a farm in the mid-west.
And camped up. The original Changeling point about the heroine's gathering
hunger for depravity is underlined here with schematic clarity - but Fraser
has added a gay subtext, and he has sex scenes on stage. Whereas The
Changeling is straight melodrama, The Ugly Man plays melodrama for laughs -
slightly creepy laughs. Which could work brilliantly, but needs playing more
pithy than most of the Yellow Rabbit performance give it.
Blue Night in the Heart of the West, by James Stock, first shown in London
in 1991, tells a weird story about a Scotman's journey to Nevada and the
crazed web of incest and morbidity that trap him there. Well, maybe it was
high time to put the Henry James scenario (American innocents caught in
decadent Europe) into reverse. And it is a hoot, after the urgent but
wordless open-air scene of sexual intercourse that began the play, to hear
the man (his trousers still down) address the woman as 'Mom'. But I could
see no overall point to this psychosexual horror story. Its jokes, its
horrors, its psychological revelations all seemed incidental, and I never
knew where the play's core lay.
Crossfire (1989), by Michael Azama and translated from his French by Nigel
Gearing, is presented by Paines Plough. It is all about death, and in
particular the innocent victims of political killings (war etc), seen just
before and after the moment of their demise. Anna Furse directed. I found
that the play consisted of either seemingly natural dialogue paced with zero
spontaneity or utterly unspontaneous dialogue delivered with creepily
natural pacing; and, after an hour of stony boredom, I used another Fringe
event as my genuine excuse to leave.
Call Me Susan, by Jean Findlay, is all about prostitutes, and manages to be
exceptionally dull, pretentious and phoney for all its 70 minutes. Mainly it
involves two high-class prostitutes talking about the trade in bored,
sub-Socratic dialogues. In between these droning conversations (badly spoken
by Kate Beswick and Findlay herself), you hear the taped voices of real-life
European prostitutes. You cannot believe how deadly this fascinating subject
becomes; but take my word for it.
Enough of sex, enough of death. Bloodstream, by Andrew Buckland and
presented by Mouthpiece and the Market Theatre Company (South Africa), has
neither. Though I began by finding it trite and unoriginal, it gradually had
me happily hooked. It is a cartoon piece of green agitprop about the man who
is about to cut down the last tree on earth; it is also a
journey-through-the-body adventure comedy, told largely in mime, about two
rebel bloodcells' quest to reach (and change) the woodcutter's mind.
No, nothing about this is especially novel or profoundly adult. Andrew
Buckland and Lionel Newton are, however, performers of such zest,
impishness, virtuosity and commitment that they become irresistible. Their's
is a Moving Picture Mime Show style, full of 'kersplosh' sound effects as
they swim through, or impersonate parts of, the human physique; but they
also have lively, neatly satiric, text, loaded with a relentless supply of
puns (the body politic, cardiac arrest).
Bloodstream is agitprop as cartoon fun: a surprising and welcome combination
amid an otherwise lurid and morbid scene.
The Ugly Man, Blue Night in the Heart of the West, Crossfire, Call Me Susan,
and Bloodstream all continue at the Traverse until September 4.

Today's BBC Prom is an all-Mozart affair. The chamber orchestra The English
Concert, conducted by Trevor Pinnock, plays two symphonies, the Paris (K297)
and the Prague (K504) and, in between, three sections from Mozart's Vespers
(K339): Dixit Dominus, Laudate Dominum, and Magnificat (7.30 Radio 3).
With an eye to the opening next week of the world championship chess match
between Gary Kasparov and Britain's Nigel Short, BBC2's On The Line
investigates the notoriously odd relationship between chess and politics in
Russia (8.30).
For the handful of people who were not rooted in front of the set when they
were first transmitted, C4 is repeating five of the Inspector Morse dramas,
starting with a story about the murder of a retired policeman (8.30). BBC2
begins a three part drama about politics, centred upon Lou Larson, a female
Labour MP who is heavily into battered women and women's centres, but has a
'passionate past' which, it is feared, may be discovered by the press.
Phyllis Logan plays Lou (9.25).

FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Retrotelly: where trash becomes art - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER 1993 is proving a less than glittering season on British television.
There are several possible reasons. The BBC has been going through the
largest managerial change in its 70 year history: the 'Birtian revolution'
is being felt on screen, staff are preoccupied with operating the
corporation's new internal market, 'Producer Choice', and both BBC channels
have new controllers, Alan Yentob, former controller of BBC2 having moved to
BBC1, with his protege Michael Jackson taking over BBC2. Perhaps it would be
remarkable if, in the midst of such upheavals, they managed to create
sparkling schedules, especially as the summer is always the dullest season
of television's year anyway.
Yet even taking all that into account, BBC programmes seem to have been more
drab and uninviting than you might expect. It is hard to escape the feeling
that this has something to do with attempts to offset those huge over-spends
a year or so ago when tens of millions of pounds 'went missing' (in the
ghastly phrase so beloved of television news programmes) because, if I
understand correctly, in the days before Mr Birt's accountants moved in,
different BBC departments withdrew the same sums of money several times over
from computerised budgets without anyone noticing what was going on. This
summer's abnormally large number of repeats could, perhaps, have something
to do with balancing the books.
ITV has also been feeling the effects of the largest managerial change in
its history. True, their old system lasted less than 40 years, and some of
the regional production companies - London Weekend (with 16 new millionaires
on its staff last week thanks to the share options which held them in
'golden handcuffs' through the supposed temptations to move elsewhere at the
time of the licence auction) Anglia, Scottish and so on - have remained
where they were, and to some extent as they were, through the revolution
brought about by the franchise system. But the new process for getting
programmes on to the air, with the Network Centre taking over as scheduling
dictator from the old committee, or 'horse trading' system, has probably
still not had its full effect on screen.
Lead times for the production of big television series run into years, so we
shall not see the full effect of the Network Centre's decisions even in the
coming autumn season. However, some anxious programme makers are already
suggesting that the centre, fearful about such long lead times, is opting
for 'short termism' and declining to support, say, documentary schemes which
need several years to come to fruition, or even to commission a series as
well-tried as This Is Your Life for more than 12 months. It seems it was
this that drove its producers (Thames Television, now the biggest of
Britain's independents, having lost their London licence to Carlton) back
into the arms of the BBC where they were offered a contract for several
years.
Whatever the background, this summer season has felt more top heavy with
repeats than any before. It has previously been argued here that, With the
growing number of channels these days, any television service which reckons
to go beyond sheer time-filling ought to be producing a considerable
proportion of programmes worthy of repeat since most viewers will inevitably
miss the first transmission. That does not seem to be a common view,
however. Even though repeats of series such as Open All Hours and The Good
Life are so popular that they regularly feature in Top 20 lists, many
viewers still consider all repeats a form of 'cheating' by the broadcasters
and they assume that programme controllers should and do feel ashamed about
being forced into using quite so many. But matters do not seem to be quite
as simple as that. The gap between a common or garden repeat and a 'retro'
series is virtually invisible, and retrotelly, at least among broadcasters,
is becoming fashionable.
This column has long campaigned to sustain 10 per cent or so of the output
from British television at a level which will make it attractive to the sort
of people who read this page. BBC2 has always been the main provider of that
sort of programme. Last week Jackson announced his plans for the autumn and
he did have good news, especially in drama: The Changeling, Suddenly Last
Summer, Hedda Gabler and The Entertainer with Michael Gambon as Archie Rice
are due this autumn. But in other categories, particularly music and arts,
things look more doubtful: animated versions of great opera arias and a
13-part series 'featuring archive footage of some of radio's greatest disc
jockeys in action'. Most ominous was the manner in which Jackson chose to be
photographed at his press conference. With an oil painting to mark the
repeat of Civilisation? No. With a piano as a reminder of coverage of the
Leeds competition? No. He went before the cameras with a Captain Scarlet
puppet to illustrate his decision to repeat the sub-Thunderbirds series
Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons.
Could it be that Jackson, the first channel controller to have been through
the 'media studies' mill, is part of the Modern Review crowd who sincerely
believe that Dr Who, the Mario Brothers and the Bay City Rollers are just as
significant as Dr Faustus, The Brothers Karamazov and Beethoven, and that
they have just as much to contribute to the arts? It looks as though that
may be so. Time was when it was thought a bit of a giggle to raid the
archives and pull out the most dreadfully dated junk to show over a bank
holiday. John Wyver and Paul Madden started it at Channel 4, and in small
amounts at long intervals it was, indeed, amusing, like coming across an
episode of Hopalong Cassidy on the cable network while stuck in some US
hotel room overnight. But all of a sudden it seems to have gone from a bit
of a giggle to a deadly serious part of the scheduling battle.
It is not always necessarily dirt cheap to show old (British) programmes;
you may have to track down surviving actors and pay them again. It is fair
to assume, however, that BBC2's 12 hours of programmes from the 1960s on
Bank Holiday Monday, from 11.30 am to 11.30 pm, worked out a lot cheaper
than making 12 hours of high quality programmes. There were mesmerising
moments - Sandie Shaw in white flying helmet, clear wraparound plastic specs
and huge false eyelashes, driving a sportscar along a beach while singing
'Get Your Kicks On Route 66', the cast of Adam Adamant looking and sounding
like a bad drama class, Paul Johnson telling Germaine Greer 'We used to have
the most wonderful parties at 10 Downing Street' - but if a joke it went on
too long.
If not a joke, if people high up in the BBC have really come to believe that
schlock telly is a subject as worthy of our attention as renaissance
painting or grand opera, then in spite of what has been argued here in the
past, we may be approaching a time when television will no longer be a fit
medium for grown ups. Why has BBC2 made three programmes about David Frost
rather than three about Peter Brook or George Steiner? Presumably because,
first, people in television, the world's most self-regarding industry,
honestly think that Frost is more important and, second, because the
material on Frost but not on Brook or Steiner is all there in the archives.
It is one thing to fill the summer schedules with repeats of modern
programmes for short-term budgetary reasons. It is quite another thing, at a
time when the BBC is so insistent upon the need to provide high quality and
be distinct from other broadcasters, to start packing the schedules with
precisely the same sort of cheap retrotelly we are being offered by the
satellite channels UK Gold and Bravo. If the people who run the BBC are
going to march with bright smiles into that trendy world of relativism where
all values are equal, then it does look as though the falcon cannot hear the
falconer.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Bill T. Jones dance - Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERFICIALLY, the American dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones has plenty
going for him. He has striking stage presence; great good looks; he can
present a programme of five works in largely different moods; his company
includes dancers black and white, slim and obese; his choice of music
includes classical, jazz, minimalist; his dance vocabulary, includes chunks
of ballet, medieval and various modern styles; he has women partnering men;
and men partnering men too.
But Jones's work does not show you the catholic, liberal, inclusive world
view that the above would suggest. For all his magpie mix of dance material,
dance is not the point of his choreography. From the time of Jones's first
London appearance (1981), right through to this last weekend in Edinburgh,
it has been clear that his work is all about attitudinising. OK, some of the
attitudes that Jones &amp; Co strike could not be more politically correct -
pro-gay, anti-racist, etc. But they are designed simply to win applause.
By 'attitudinising', I mean that Jones is, literally and metaphorically, a
poser. See, for example, his own big solo, Last Night on Earth , where
(dressed in only his underpants, the better to show you his famously
gorgeous physique) he delivers signs and poses in monotonously bash-bash
patterns - and then explains to you what he thinks the signs and poses mean.
Though Bill T. has severe limitations as a dancer, he gives himself such
guarded exposure that you may well not notice that his phrasing is
monotonously harsh, that he lacks the strength to sustain a shape in the air
while jumping, that he cannot support leg extensions from the centre of his
body. In his fellow-dancers, however, these and other failings are grossly
apparent. He gives them whole wodges of rigorous Cunningham technique (in
Fete), and delicate, fiddly, balletic petits battements (in D-Man in the
Waters), and anyone can see that rigour and delicacy are what they lack -
that these dancers cannot do these steps with any true precision.
The point, I guess, is that Jones wants his troupe to look loveably
fallible. Hey, if we want to do Cunningham technique or petits battements,
if our fattest obese dancer wants to try jumping in grand jete, then why not
go ahead? This would be less creepy if Jones dared to present himself that
way too. Yet his co-dancers enjoy failing. In D-Man in the Waters, which is
set to Mendelssohn's wonderful octet, they get so out of hand that they
talk, laugh and finally yell at each other over the music.
Nor have I ever seen an American dance company (not even Lar Lubovich's
troupe) employ so much facial mugging. You can make weak dancers still dance
seriously if you give them real phrasing, but Jones prefers to have them
pull facial expressions at the audience, cueing us how to react.
Need I go on with this catalogue? I have loathed everything I have ever seen
Jones &amp; Co. do.
La danse, c'est une question morale, said Balanchine; and I find Bill T.
Jones &amp; Co. morally repugnant.

FT  01 SEP 93 / People: Bethnal Green City Challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lesley Klein and Michael Bear (left) have recently joined one of the City's
more unusual boards, that of Bethnal Green City Challenge, one of 20
nationwide city challenge organisations set up by the department of the
environment to rejuvenate Britain's dilapidated inner-cities.
Bethnal Green's version is 18 months into its Pounds 35m five-year
programme. As chief executive, Klein, an accountant by training, is engaged
full-time on a variety of projects, while Bear, chairman, is on secondment
(one day a week) from his post as managing director of BICC Developments,
the property arm of the BICC Group.
The City Challenge organisations are a peculiar mixture of public money and
private sector volunteer work. In Bethnal Green, says Klein, one of the
biggest challenges is to integrate more fully its large Bangladeshi
community into the life and work of the area.
'We are a stone's throw from the City. We can see the wealth it has but the
local ethnic communities here are inspired by that, they have a very
commercial and entrepreneurial attitude,' says Klein.
Like many others they are praying for an upturn in the property market; one
of the biggest projects - currently on hold - is a planned rejuvenation of
the Albion brewery site in Whitechapel which it is planned will house a new
superstore for the retailer J. Sainsbury.

FT  01 SEP 93 / People: TSB Scotland's new local hero
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The so-called Scottish financial mafia which dominates the top jobs in
Scotland's business world has a new recruit. Gordon Anderson, 62, the next
chairman of TSB Bank Scotland, comes from a background markedly similar to
many of his peers in the industry.
He has spent most of his career as an accountant, like Forbes Macpherson,
the current chairman. Anderson was deputy senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young
and a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Scotland, while Macpherson is a former senior partner of Touche Ross in
Scotland.
They both live in the posh Glasgow suburb of Bearsden and share the same
telephone code. Anderson lives in Manse Road just a couple of doors down
from Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, who helped restore Guinness's fortunes
after the excesses of Ernest Saunders' chairmanship. Anderson and Macfarlane
both went to the High School of Glasgow and are members of Glasgow Golf
club.
However, one can't quibble with the incestuous nature of the Scottish
financial establishment if it guarantees results like those of TSB Bank
Scotland. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 79.4m, or nearly twice
as much as the whole TSB group. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the TSB
Group, says that the Scottish market has always been a significant
contributor to TSB's business and with a mortgage book of Pounds 1.5bn, it
is one of Scotland's largest lenders in the housing market.'
Anderson, who has been a director of TSB Bank Scotland since 1991, takes
over from the 67-year-old Macpherson next March. Anderson has also been
appointed a member of the TSB Group, the parent of TSB Bank Scotland.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weekend departure of Peter Dew from his post of managing director at
Thornton group, the fund manager owned by Dresdner Bank, was 'entirely
amicable and friendly and to do with a change in the management system,'
according to Lord Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister who chairs the
group.
'There is no longer any real role for a conventional chief executive,' says
Lord Walker, who wants to see Thornton engage itself more actively in
Europe, with funds jointly managed in, for example, Paris, Frankfurt and
London. 'We will be producing more European products and I see expansion
both there and in the Far East.'
Dew has long been regarded as a leading figure in Far East investment, and
joined Thornton in 1988 after a period running his own property business.
Among his positions before that had been a 16-year stint as director of
Mercury Asset Management.
Thornton has plans to acquire Aetna UK's unit trust business and Lord Walker
says 'we will be making a number of other expansions and acquisitions, and I
want to bring in a younger generation to manage the business over the next
15 years or so. I have made sure that Peter Dew has been treated very
generously; the parting has been very amicable.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Seeing the wood for the trees
 -Attempts to manage New England's forests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A trip to New England's northern forests appears comforting to anyone
looking for unspoiled nature. Trees cover vast areas - New Hampshire and
Vermont boast 80 per cent tree cover and Maine 90 per cent - and the forests
are home to large populations of deer, moose, black bear and other wildlife.
This is misleading though, according to environmentalists, who are concerned
about increased logging and mounting pressures for property development in
the region.
Pressure is building as a result of rising prices for timber and property.
The controversy over protection of the spotted owl in the Pacific north-west
has driven up timber prices throughout the US. In the first six months of
1993, prices for New England softwood rose by 10 per cent, according to
Sidney Balch, chief forester in Maine for Boise Cascade, the paper and
timber group.
'With new restrictions on logging in other parts of the country, a lot of
demand is heading this way,' says Roberta Borland, executive director for
the Vermont Forest Products Association. In 1992, Vermont produced 502m
board feet of timber, more than twice that of 1970. John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Company's purchase last month of 238,000 acres of forest in Maine,
New Hampshire and Vermont troubled environmentalists. According to the
company, the land will not be used for property development, but ecologists
are worried.
'There are a lot of land deals going on that we don't know about,' says
Lewis Milford, who heads the Vermont Conservation Law Foundation, an
environmental agency. 'And when you see large tracts of land changing hands,
it all adds to the uncertainty.'
Ironically, concern over the future of New England's wooded lands comes at a
time when many ecologists are celebrating the seemingly miraculous recovery
of the area's forests. The forests are a relatively new, natural resource.
By the late 1800s, settlers in the region had cleared most of the timber to
make room for farms. Immediately following the American civil war, Vermont
had just 25 per cent tree cover, New Hampshire 30 per cent and Maine 40 per
cent. When farmers moved to the more agriculturally friendly mid-west, the
forests of the north east took over once more.
New England's forests have also become a vital natural resource for the
region, accounting for at least Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) a year in economic
activity. Logging is just part of the equation. Sawmills, paper and pulp
factories, furniture makers and maple syrup producers are all dependent on
timber from the region.
Industrialists and environmentalists alike are determined to maintain the
sector's vitality. 'All sides of the issue want to see this economic
activity encouraged,' says Charles Levesque, executive director of the
Northern Forests Land Council, a group formed to study the impact of
development on the forests' ecosystem. 'It's a question of how the land
should be managed, how many trees should be cut at a time and how much
clear-cutting should be allowed.'
Several factors make life more difficult for ecologists. Unlike the Pacific
north west, which is covered by vast tracts of public lands, the vast
majority of New England's wooded areas are in the hands of private owners.
For states which are known for stringent environmental controls, the laws
protecting New England's forests are surprisingly loose. New England forests
also lack the rare plant and animal life and old-growth forests which have
been invoked to enforce protection in other parts of the country.
'Because this is a new natural resource, it's relatively homogeneous
ecologically,' says Gary Decordova, who heads the Green Mountain National
Forest agency. 'In fact, one of our challenges is to increase diversity.'
To maximise the economic impact of logging in the northern forests, state
governments are hoping to encourage more 'value-added' activity. Vermont
recently converted 12 schools from electric to wood-burning heat to
encourage local wood use, cutting energy costs by 10 per cent according to
David Stevens, director of forests for Vermont.
To encourage value-added activities, New England states have launched a
marketing campaign to attract wood-based industries to the area. Several
furniture and furniture parts makers have opened their doors and companies
have begun to make everything from wood curl packing materials to musical
instruments.
Even if the logging industry is well-managed, however, the region's forests
will still be threatened by pressures for development in the region. Demand
is beginning to pick up for second-home building.
'What you get with second home development is a lot of small parcels of
timber,' says David Kittredge, associate professor of forestry at the
University of Massachusetts in Amherst. 'This poses an environmental
problem, because the wildlife can't get to where it needs to go without
crossing through developed areas or over highways. It also creates huge
problems for the logging industry. Even if a lot of tree cover remains, it's
expensive to move all the equipment around to log small plots of land.'
Environmentalists hope to introduce legislation to improve controls on land
use and forest practices in the region, but with so much land in private
hands, they are likely to face an uphill battle.
But despite the problems, industrialists and ecologists in the region remain
optimistic they will be able to resolve their problems. 'The conflicts are
building, but we still hope that with continued dialogue, we can manage the
forests in such a way that everyone will benefit,' says Balch.

Environmentalists applauded when the Global Environmental Facility was set
up three years ago to create a United Nations-backed international fund for
developing countries. They saw the GEF as a way for north and south to share
responsibility for global environmental problems.
The World Bank was administrator of the fund. Developing countries were to
receive Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) over three years for projects on
protecting the ozone layer, international waters and biodiversity, and
limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
Yet earlier this year, a proposed GEF project in Ecuador, Ecoforest 2000,
was dropped because of its controversial social and environmental
implications. Its failure revealed the obstacles in implementing the GEF's
objectives and raised questions over the World Bank's role as the
administrator of such a fund.
Ecoforest 2000 was conceived as a long-term forestry management scheme to
minimise deforestation of primary forest by planting tree farms for
sustainable use by commercial timber companies. The tropical rainforest in
north-west Ecuador has one of the world's highest biodiversity densities,
but also one of the highest deforestation rates.
It was the first project to be approved by the International Finance
Corporation, the private-sector financial arm of the World Bank, using GEF
funds.
At first sight a laudable initiative, it was soon criticised by local
communities and environmental groups.
Many asked why only a single managed timber source was planned as an
alternative to existing sources, namely the Durini Foundation, a
family-owned lumber group which is one of the wealthiest businesses in
Ecuador.
The small landowners were said to have equal or larger environmental
importance. The effect on the indigenous groups was also questioned.
Lorena Gamboa of the environmental group Accion Ecologica criticised the
IFC-GEF's impact study, saying it underestimated the effect of resettling 40
to 50 families toestablish tree farms. Landless farmers were likely to
increase pressure on deforestation and colonisation of virgin forest, she
claimed.
The GEF's plans to lease lumber rights from indigenous people at extremely
low prices in some of the last large tracts of primary forest also proved
contentious.
While such concerns were being voiced, expectations for the project to meet
community needs - to lessen acute poverty and enable development of regional
infrastructure such as health services and schooling - were large. And these
high expectations exacerbated the project's problems.
The IFC-GEF's alleged insensitivity to community needs prompted many to
question their commitment towards conservation. Ecociencia, for example, an
ecological research centre, says the project failed to provide an
alternative for principal agents of deforestation in the area - the colonos,
or settlers. Colonos subsist on sale of timber or clear land for farming.
Teodoro Bustamante, a member of Fundacion Natura, Ecuador's largest
environmental group, says the project's aim of a single and managed timber
source in the area was based primarily on commercial principles, with
conservation only a secondary consideration.
The IFC-GEF sponsored review of the project, released in March, confirmed
many of the criticisms and revaluation needs. Funds were subsequently frozen
and a round-table talk was scheduled for all those involved. But before the
meeting, the IFC delegation announced its withdrawal.
'We were all disappointed by the withdrawal,' says Bustamante, 'and it
ridiculed the entire consultation process, illustrating that they were not
really interested in our input.'
The subsequent collapse of the project has cast doubt on the potential for
alternatives to the continuing destruction of tropical primary forest in
Ecuador. Environmentalists are left with only bitter reproaches for how the
project was handled. And the failure of the Ecuadorian government to develop
a strategy of sustainable forest utilisation, and to allocate sufficient
resources to the management of forests and protected areas, has created a
hostile climate for foreign aid to benefit the country's environment.
But others believe one lesson can be learnt from the experience - future
projects would benefit if environmental groups and local communities were
involved in the early design of a project.
The need for this is highlighted by scientific studies showing that the 4
per cent annual deforestation rate will devour tropical forests of
north-west Ecuador in a decade or two, eliminating an estimated five animal
species per day.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Management: Digging out value for money - Union Miniere of
Belgium has employed a wide range of cost-cutting measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year Union Miniere, Belgium's big metals producer, found it was
paying membership fees for various trade associations totalling BFr165m
(Pounds 3m). The discovery was made as the new management dug into every
corner of head-office operations, primarily to see if UM was getting value
for money but also as part of a quest for further spending cuts.
Jean-Pierre Rodier, chief executive, says the divisional managers may still
join trade associations but the fees are no longer a corporate, head-office
expense. Managers must first justify the memberships and then pay from their
own budgets.
Rodier's cost-cutting exercise is an illustration of just how much money can
be saved by companies which really put their mind to the task. Individually
the initiatives can seem relatively minor - the group, for example, found it
could save BFr500,000 a year by installing water fountains rather than
sticking to tradition and distributing bottled water to staff. Cumulatively
the savings can add up.
UM used to take pride in the fact that, if any senior executive asked for
some information, it was usually provided within two hours. The company
found that BFr30m to BFr40m a year could be saved by assessing which data
banks were absolutely necessary to the group and by insisting that, whenever
possible, these should be accessed at night when rates were cheaper.
There was also scope for reducing the cost of employing outside consultants.
UM had so many on retainers that it took a great deal of head-office time to
manage them. Rodier has now set new guidelines for a 'just in time' system,
or 'using a consultant only when we are certain we need one', and reckons UM
will save BFr100m a year.
Then there was the question of whether Centre du Zinc, an organisation to
promote the use of zinc in France, was giving value for money. It was
costing UM and Metaleurope, another zinc group, BFr45m a year each to
finance the centre. Rodier says UM calculated that, to have justified this
outlay, zinc consumption in France would have to increase at 10 per cent a
year. 'Of course, this was not happening so we came to the conclusion that
we should close the association. It terminates in October.'
UM in its present form started life in 1989 when the hitherto autonomous
metals-related companies owned by Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's
biggest holding company, were brought together. Rodier decided to merge six
separate head offices, all in different cities, into one in a small office
on the outskirts of Brussels. This action reduced head-office staff numbers
from 460 to 235 and cut annual running costs by BFr700m.
Rodier says the measures mentioned above, and others, will save another
BFr400m a year.
The inspiration for these was a cost-value analysis where all spending was
itemised and a small management committee decided whether it was of value to
the company or not. The cost-value analysis was part of a group-wide
exercise to improve annual margins by BFr4bn by 1994-95 compared with 1991.
This BFr4bn figure was arrived at by establishing what was necessary to move
UM's historic return on equity from the average of 8 per cent which it has
achieved over the business cycle to the 14 per cent target which its parent,
SGB, sets all its operations.
UM, the world's biggest producer of refined zinc, with 11 per cent of the
world market and 23 per cent of the European market, also used benchmarking
for its manufacturing plants to establish what the targets should be.
Benchmarking is a systematic process for identifying, measuring and
improving the critical success factors of a business against competitors,
especially those recognised as industry leader.
This benchmarking exercise identified a BFr500m annual cost gap between the
best zinc businesses in the world and UM's - a finding which at first the UM
management found difficult to believe because the Belgian group uses some of
the best technology available.
But when UM looked more closely to see how the gap could be closed, it found
a host of very small differences which added up to BFr450m. 'We were not
paying enough attention to the day-to-day details of the business, probably
because of our excellent technology,' says Rodier.
Other areas that required attention included the way maintenance was carried
out, the number of people looking after raw materials and even the number of
people cleaning buildings.
UM's Balen refinery is now using an outside cleaning contractor which pays
its employees less than what UM paid each employee, and is expected to clean
50 per cent more area. UM has also changed its pay policy. Bonuses used to
be linked to financial results. As Rodier says: 'When zinc prices were high,
you got a bonus, when the dollar was high, you got a bonus - no matter what
you did.'
Now bonus payments are paid only if there is an improvement to bottom-line
profit compared with the previous year after the impact of the metal price
and dollar rate movements have been removed. Rodier stresses, bonuses are
not linked with budgeted figures.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Management: Are you an optimistic or pessimistic boss? -
Discover whether you are a benevolent autocrat, a cynic or a trusting
manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pessimist is an optimist with experience. Listen to the US management
gurus, who seem to model their delivery style and their beliefs on
TV-evangelists and you might believe that all workers are fundamentally
good, diligent and legal.
All that is required is a corporate vision, sincerity and a caring ethical
boss and the workforce will deliver.
The optimist, it is said, believes that we live in the best of all possible
worlds and the pessimist fears this is true. Is the pessimist one who, when
he has the choice of two evils chooses both, or is he a realist? Is a
pessimist one who feels bad when he feels good for fear he will feel worse
when he feels better, or simply a shrewd and accurate observer of life?
The British seem more reserved and sceptical than other nationalities. More
used to the threat of the stick than the promise of the carrot, they appear
not to hold such a rosy view of their fellow man and less still of their
fellow woman.
Followers of the French idealist Rousseau stand in sharp contrast to the
bleak perception of the Englishman Thomas Hobbes. The pessimistic, modern
manager might believe that 'man was born free everywhere is in trains', on
his way to a nasty, brutish, tedious and unsatisfying job.
For some, the experience of management is that people avoid work because
they inherently dislike it. They have to be completely controlled, directed,
bullied and threatened. They prefer not to show responsibility or
empowerment and need to be constantly monitored.
About 30 years ago a US academic called McGregor who was interested in what
determined a person's leadership style said managers were likely to hold one
of two 'philosophies' about workers. One, labelled theory X, maintained that
people do not like work, avoid it, have little ambition, try to avoid
responsibility and need firm direction, control and coercion. Subscribers to
theory Y maintained that under the right conditions people not only work
hard, showing commitment and talent, but also seek increased responsibility
and challenge.
Test yourself to see if you are a theory X or Y believer. Give yourself 4
points for strongly agree, 3 for agree, 1 for disagree and 0 for strongly
disagree.
1. Almost everyone could probably improve his or her job performance quite a
bit if he or she really wanted to.
2. It is unrealistic to expect people to show the same enthusiasm for their
work as for their favourite leisure-time activities.
3. Even when given encouragement by the boss, very few people show the
desire to improve themselves on the job.
4. If you give people enough money, they are less likely to worry about such
intangibles as status or individual recognition.
5. Usually when people talk about wanting more responsible jobs, they really
mean they want more money and status.
6. Being tough with people will usually get them to do what you want.
7. Because most people do not like to make decisions on their own, it's hard
to get them to assume responsibility.
8. A good way to get people to do more work is to crack down on them once in
a while.
9. It weakens a person's prestige to admit that a subordinate has been right
and he/she wrong.
10. The most effective supervisor is one who gets the results management
expects, regardless of the methods used in handling people.
11. It is too much to expect that people will try to do a good job without
being prodded by the boss.
12. The boss who expects his or her people to set their own standards for
superior performance will probably find they don't set them very high.
13. If people do not use much imagination or ingenuity on the job, it's
probably because relatively few people have much of either.
14. One problem in asking for the ideas of subordinates is that their
perspective is too limited for their suggestions to be of much practical
value.
15. It is only human nature for people to try to do as little work as they
can get away with.
Score under 20 and you are an optimist.
You probably trust your subordinates and use a wide range of rewards. You
may prefer group participation in decision making and like people to be well
informed.
Score 21 - 30 and we see more caution with substantial, but not complete,
confidence and trust in subordinates.
You wish to keep control of most important decisions.
Score 31 - 45 and some may consider you a benevolent autocrat. You have a
rather condescending confidence and trust such as a master has in a servant.
You tend to believe in economic motives and do not fraternise with your
staff.
Score 45 and above and face it you are a cynic about the average worker.
High scorers may even be exploitative autocrats who have no confidence in
their subordinates, preferring physical and economic security as a
motivational force. All stick and no carrot.
Top scorers despise 'soft' management techniques and maintain that the
department of hard knocks at the university of life taught them what they
know. Low scorers recoil in horror at the monster they see in the high
scorer, equally convinced that their experience at work tells them they are
right.
Neither side is prepared to concede.
Hence we need the understanding to know the things we cannot change about
workers; the courage to change and improve the things we can change; and the
wisdom to know the difference.

FT  01 SEP 93 / 'Fiddling' bias draws fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE IS one law for the rich who fiddle their taxes and another for the
poor who fiddle their social security payments, Ms Dee Cook, a lecturer at
the Department of Criminology at Keele University, told the British
Association meeting.
She said the scale of social security fraud was dwarfed by tax evasion, yet
more staff and resources went towards policing benefit claimants than
taxpayers.
Ms Cook said figures for money 'saved' by DSS investigators represented an
actuarial amount rather than an actual sum.
Fraud officers multiply a fraudster's weekly benefit payments by 32 (the
notional number of weeks the fraudulent claim may have lasted) to arrive at
the sum the DSS says it has saved.
Using this formula the DSS said it had saved Pounds 416m in 1991-92.
But in 1991-92 the Inland Revenue's investigation work yielded Pounds 4.9bn,
equivalent to between 2p and 3p on the basic rate of income tax.
There were 4,379 prosecutions for benefit fraud in 1991-92 compared with 249
for tax fraud.
Ms Cook said that in contrast to the high-profile crackdown on DSS fraud,
there had been little attempt to direct popular attention or additional
resources to the 'burgeoning problem of tax evasion'.
She added: 'Recent figures of yields from compliance work show an
unrelenting increase which on the one hand shows the effectiveness of the
investigating officers involved, but on the other hand indicates an
underlying disregard for tax law.'
In spite of this, she said, tax evaders were seen as victims of harassment
by the Revenue while benefit fraudsters were simply villains.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Lawson scorns doubts on capitalism: Inequality highlighted
at meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKET CAPITALISM may have triumphed worldwide over socialism since the
1970s but the 'atmosphere of hostility to capitalism is as pervasive as
ever', Lord Lawson of Blaby, the former chancellor of the exchequer, told
the British Association economics section.
He argued that it was essential for a capitalist market economy to sustain a
high-quality social security net to protect the impoverished.
Lord Lawson said the existence of an underclass did not demolish the case
for capitalism. He said: 'Just as the sensible, successful businessman who
seeks to help those less fortunate will do so not by changing the way he
runs his business but by applying part of his personal wealth to
philanthropy, so the wise government will best help the poor by not
interfering with the market but by creating a well-designed social security
net alongside it.
'At the very least, if we are to live within a market capitalist system, it
is unsatisfactory that we should have doubts about its moral foundations.
One or two recent speeches, even by some members of the present government,
betray a worrying insecurity.'
Lord Lawson expressed scorn for egalitarian arguments. He said: 'Once the
legitimacy of egalitarianism is accepted, however much equality there is,
the cry will always be for more of it.
'Once it is accepted that there must be inequality, the principle of
equality, if there ever was one, has been abandoned, and we are left not
with morality but with something that looks rather like an amalgam of
aesthetics and envy.'
Lord Lawson declined to give specific advice to the present chancellor, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, beyond saying: 'If the chancellor feels that some tax
increase is necessary, the rates of income tax and corporation tax should be
not changed.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Print union responds to pay threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END to all national agreements in the printing industry next year is
being threatened by the main print union.
Mr Tony Dubbins, the Graphical Paper and Media Union's general secretary,
warned yesterday that if the employers body, the British Printing Industries
Federation, decided to opt out of industry-wide wage bargaining for 1994, as
it has done this year, the union would pull out of all national-level deals.
This would mean the end of the union's participation in existing
arrangements with the employers' federation on training, efficiency and
productivity, disputes procedures, and health and safety.
'If the federation do opt out, then next year's campaign will make this
year's look like a picnic,' Mr Dubbins said.
'The employers can either return to the stability of a national agreement
which has served the industry so well in the past or they can opt for the
uncertainty of another year of plant-by-plant haggling.'
This year the employers' federation, which represents 2,600 printing
companies and negotiates directly and indirectly over pay for an estimated
80,000 workers, decided for the first time not to have a national wage
agreement with the union.
What concerns the union is that the federation might not return to a
national pay agreement for 1994.
The federation has just sent out a policy document to its affiliate
companies to explain the advantages and disadvantages of national pay
bargaining for the printing industry.
It argues that 'more and more companies want to make their own decisions
about pay and conditions and not leave it to the federation's negotiating
team'.
The document also suggests that union demands for longer holidays and higher
minimum wage rates might produce national deals at a level member companies
can neither afford nor accept.
It adds that strategic objectives such as a widening of pay differentials,
the creation of more flexibility in the workplace and cuts in unit labour
costs can no longer be dealt with at national level.
The federation says, however, that national deals have brought stability to
the printing industry and have enabled companies to save resources by
negotiating pay for them.
Such deals have also prevented wage undercutting between companies and
achieved wage settlements that have prevented wage escalation.
But the document makes it clear that the federation's industrial relations
strategy review group is not in favour of returning to a national pay
agreement next year.
Mr Colin Stanley, federation director general, denied that the document was
biased against national wage bargaining.
'We have been very careful to produce a balanced document for our members,'
he said yesterday. 'This is not a campaign for a 'no' to a national
agreement.'
He added that the federation's governing board would decide what to do on
September 28 after more than 46 district meetings across the country had
sounded out company opinion.
Yesterday the federation said just less than half its members had reported
details of their pay agreements for this year.
It said that two thirds of its membership had settled for less than the
union's claim of Pounds 6.50 a week plus an extra day of holiday.
The union said, however, that 1,800 companies had met its demands in full.

JAPANESE scientists are set to develop a machine as intelligent as a cat in

intelligent than humans, according to Professor Kevin Warwick of the
University of Reading's cybernetics department.
'Technically we know that certain aspects of human intelligence such as

but in fact the artificial form is much faster, more powerful, more flexible

INCREASING ONE'S intake of silicon could be influential in preventing
Alzheimer's disease, according to Professor Derek Birchall, professor of
inorganic chemistry at Keele University.
He said it had been suggested that water which was high in silicon could
prevent the absorption of aluminium through the stomach and intestines, and
recent tests had confirmed that blood plasma levels of the metal - which is
linked to Alzheimer's - were reduced by silicon's presence.
If aluminium's link with Alzheimer's was confirmed, water would need to be
treated to raise silicon levels, he added.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Humble rich make a meal of shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY believe themselves to be middle class and to be excluded from a
London or university-based upper-class establishment.
The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families show that many
rich people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
Leicester University interviewed Midlands families deriving fortunes from
new and old money. The families, from landed gentry to captains of industry
and commerce, each had at least Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets.
Professor John Scott said many interviewees claimed their biggest
extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's shopping bill or going out for a
meal - in spite owning a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities. In the others almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
said: 'It was his dream, my money.'
In a surprising result business people displayed a lack of concern about
passing on their companies to their children.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Pensioners' wealth gap causes concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between rich and poor pensioners will continue to widen unless
pension rules are changed, Professor Chris Phillipson, professor of applied
social studies at Keele University, warned at the conference yesterday. He
said the rules should be made to reflect shifts in employment patterns such
as the trend towards flexible contracts and early retirement.
Government policy was based on outdated assumptions about continued
participation in paid work, Prof Phillipson said. He put forward a plan for
reform of the social security system and for increased rights for older
workers, and called for:
Recognition that paid work is often concentrated into a limited number of
years.
Protection for older workers who are trapped between the end of employment
and receipt of state pensions.
Greater security in employment for older workers to stop them being treated
as a disposable element of the workforce.
Prof Phillipson said women were especially disadvantaged. 'If certain
groups, for example women, are not to lose out permanently, benefits should
be attached to individual citizen rights reflecting the variety of roles
undertaken by individuals during the course of their 'working' lives.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / MPs condemn renewed News at Ten threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV appears to have shot itself in the foot again over attempts to move News
at Ten, the main evening news programme on commercial television.
Comments by Mr Marcus Plantin, director of the ITV Network Centre, that ITV
executives were about to revive their plans to move News at Ten were
condemned yesterday by MPs.
One senior ITV chief executive conceded yesterday: 'This hasn't exactly
helped our case for relaxing ownership rules.' The rules prevent the largest
ITV companies taking each other over.
Downing Street yesterday said Mr John Major had not changed his mind since
he wrote to Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television
Commission, in June expressing displeasure at the ITV proposals.
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, attacked Mr Plantin's remarks,
which were made at the Edinburgh Television Festival.
'This is a snub for the prime minister, the leader of the opposition and the
100 MPs who signed my motion calling for News at Ten to be saved,' Mr
Mandelson said.
The Labour MP also warned that ITV chiefs will ultimately be the losers if
they confront the government and parliament over News at Ten.
Mr Plantin insisted that he and not the prime minister was the person
responsible for scheduling ITV.
Although the issue will come up before the next ITV Council meeting this
month, senior ITV executives believe there is little chance of moving the
main evening news to 6.30pm or 7pm this year. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of ITV,
has made it clear he would like to see the issue of who has the power to
decide the scheduling of main news clarified, in the courts if necessary.
The Independent Television Commission says eight of the 15 ITV companies
included News at Ten in their franchise application documents. It intends to
hold them to what it sees as commitments.
The hope within ITV is that eventually News at Ten will be moved so that
dramas and feature films can be shown uninterrupted after the 9pm watershed
for more adult viewing.

crime rate are back on the political agenda. The report by Sir Patrick
Sheehy urging radical changes to police employment has been attacked by
officers of all ranks while MPs and the public are calling for initiatives
against crime. FT writers sound out feelings in the city and in the country

MRS DOREEN McDonnell is 65, lives in a two-up, two-down terraced house near
Liverpool's Royal Seaforth container terminal and has been mugged twice in
broad daylight, once on a bus and once in the street.
She says she does not know what the Sheehy report is but has heard of moves
to end 'jobs for life' for police officers.
'It's totally wrong,' she said. 'They deserve their job security and early
pensions. They have to deal with crime and horrible people. I feel so much
better when I see a policeman in the street. They have always been good to
me and they really helped me face the world again after the muggings.'
But if the police were paid on performance criteria such as solving crime,
what happened to Mrs McDonnell might not help them score many points. A
couple were arrested for allegedly robbing Mrs McDonnell on the bus but she
failed to pick them out at an identity parade.
The other mugger was convicted, but no thanks to the police - a passing
motorist who saw the robbery made a citizen's arrest.
Nor did the police catch the men who mugged two of Mrs McDonnell's friends
from the local bingo hall, robbing one of her winnings and the other of her
pension. But police nevertheless scored highly with the victims for the
support, help and reassurance they gave.
It is this sort of attitude that gives the police comfort in their
opposition to the Sheehy report.
Apart from performance-related pay rises, Sheehy proposes lower starting
salaries and an end to overtime, abolition of three middle-management ranks,
fewer promotion prospects, less generous pensions and initial 10-year
contracts, renewable at five-year intervals.
At Copperas Hill police station, 140 police, including CID, cover the few
square miles of a Liverpool city centre with only 5,000 residents, but which
daily attracts more than 200,000 workers, shoppers, tourists and visitors.
The area includes 250 pubs and clubs with late-night drinks licences.
Policing the area can be dangerous. Comradeship is important and teamwork
essential.
Constable Mark Blundell, who joined from the building industry eight years
ago when he was 23, said his total pay would go down under Sheehy. 'Morale
would take a battering, especially if a colleague had so many more
performance points on his pay than you.' he said.
Superintendent Philip Joy is on a job-swap from his normal patch at
Llandudno, North Wales, and is in charge of Copperas Hill.
'It's the young constables I fear for,' he said. 'Many don't want to move
up. Others who are ambitious see opportunities threatened. I have been doing
staff appraisals here in the last two months and 10 per cent are talking
about changing their job because they fear for long-term security or
progress.'
Chief Inspector Ted Bennett, who is in day-to-day charge of operations at
Copperas Hill, feels especially vulnerable. Sheehy would abolish his rank -
together with those of deputy chief constable and chief superintendent - in
an attempt to streamline management and free resources to put more police on
the beat.
He is 51 and has 30 years' service. He wants to carry on to 55 but is afraid
the over-50s will be the first chopped in any slimming down.
Recruits under 22 get an annual salary of about Pounds 12,500 initially,
while those over 24 get nearly Pounds 14,800. Mr Jim Sharples, Merseyside's
chief constable, says this has improved the calibre of recruits and
attracted many graduates.
Sheehy would cut starting salaries to Pounds 10,500, which the Police
Federation - representing junior ranks - says is Pounds 200 less than
traffic wardens' starting pay, in spite of shiftwork and greater
responsibility and danger.
Mr Sharples likes the managerial streamlining and greater flexibility Sheehy
might bring, but is very unhappy about its long-term implications for
quality of personnel.
He said: 'You have to look at Sheehy as a package, but all the gains in
efficiency which might come from greater operational flexibility would be
lost if we substitute a form of institutionalised insecurity among police
officers.'
Sheehy has united the police of all ranks as nothing before. In the public
at large, however, there appears less demonstrable sympathy than for other
public servants.
What the police are relying on is the support of the so-called 'silent'
majority. By definition this is not vocal, although that is no fault of Mrs
McDonnell.

WITH ITS mellow stone buildings, immaculate floral displays and traditional
shops, the Northumberland village of Rothbury looks like an oasis in a
country troubled by crime.
Looks deceive. Even before last week's audacious raid on Rothbury's post
office, when masked men cut telephone lines to nearby homes and escaped with
a safe containing Pounds 24,000, the picturesque village was not immune to
crime.
Police and public attitudes to policing and the Sheehy reform proposals are
coloured in Rothbury by two geographical facts: the vastness of rural
Northumberland, in relation to police numbers, and its relative proximity
for urban criminals.
Detective Inspector John Hope, of Alnwick CID, estimates 50 per cent of
burglaries in rural Northumberland are committed by criminals travelling to
the area.
'They say they've got it so tight in the cities, they're coming out here,'
says Rothbury postmaster Mr George Ross.
Like many older people in Rothbury, he disapproves of Sheehy's suggested
fixed contracts for the police. 'If a policeman is only there for 10 years,
he won't put himself out.'
Younger people are less sympathetic to the concept of policing as a job for
life. Mrs Henrietta Hay, 26, an army officer's wife, questions why the
police should be immune from a general social trend: 'Everyone thought the
army was a job for life. But even in the army cuts are being made.'
Criticisms by villagers of local policing include too few officers,
difficulty in contacting them and slow response. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal
Democrat MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, said: 'At night the thin blue line is
almost non-existent.'
In spite of this, local police enjoy a level of support many of their inner
city colleagues would envy.
Constable Joe Chapman of Rothbury said: 'The people actually talk to you out
here.'
Mr Tim Shilton, who runs an upmarket outdoor clothing shop in Rothbury high
street, said: 'The standard of policing in rural areas is very high. The
level of policing is non-existent.'
He added: 'You can set your watch by the crime here. Burglaries are nearly
all after 1am.' The time is significant. Between 1am and 8am all six police
officers who cover Rothbury and many miles of surrounding countryside are
off-duty.
His store has bullet-proof glass and a ramraiding protection cage flanks the
window display. After nine attempted burglaries in the past four years he is
taking no chances.
For rural policemen especially, the idea of performance-related pay is
worrying. Mr John Stevens, Northumbria chief constable, has warned that it
could create 'two-tier' policing, with poorer pay for country police.
PC Chapman, based at Rothbury since 1987, estimated that performance-based
pay could cost him Pounds 5,000 a year, lowering his salary to Pounds
15,600. An unwanted move back to Newcastle might be necessary to achieve
higher arrest rates.
Among Rothbury shoppers there is concern that performance-related pay could
make the police over-zealous, making motorists an easy target.
Back at Alnwick, Det Insp Hope said: 'You'll have people thinking 'I need to
make so much money', and manufacturing arrests.'
He believes the police have to some extent brought Sheehy's fixed-term
contracts proposal on themselves by not taking steps to eliminate dead wood.
He also thinks the 'supervision mentality', which fosters bureaucracy and
hierarchy, needs reform. 'You send somebody out to arrest somebody, which is
a serious thing, but you can't trust him to take 45 minutes for his meal.'
Very few policemen, he insisted, object to change. 'But we're wondering why
it's got to be a big bang.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Graduate science scheme 'helps cut company costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG science graduates working for companies under the Teaching Company
Scheme have helped to reduce costs substantially, according to a report
published today.
Under the scheme, set up in 1975, universities and companies form groups of
recent graduates as 'associates', based full-time with the company. The
scheme, which last year distributed Pounds 12m in grant to 393 companies,
aims to encourage industrial investment in training, research and
development.
Companies received an average grant of Pounds 100,000, which led to average
annual savings in costs of about Pounds 220,000, according to the report
compiled by Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit.
Ms Jacqueline Senker, one of the report's authors, said the finding showed
that the criticism of school science teaching over the sharp drop in the
number of pupils taking science A-levels this year may have been misplaced.
'The failure is on the industrial side. There is very little policy to
encourage employers to use and apply scientific methods and theories,' she
said.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Monktonhall miners scrap Libya cash plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of coalminers which had been negotiating a financial lifeline
with the Libyan government performed a U-turn yesterday in the face of
public criticism from its financial advisers and opposition from local
politicians in Scotland.
Monktonhall Mineworkers, which leases the Monktonhall colliery near
Edinburgh from British Coal, announced that if it were to receive an offer
of finance from Libya it 'would not consider it or proceed if it were to
prove offensive to our customers, the public or any other party'.
Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of Monktonhall Mineworkers, confirmed that the
company had been in touch through a third party with the state-owned Arab
Foreign Investment Company (Lafico) about obtaining funding to enable it to
continue in business.
The intermediary had indicated that investment might be available, he said.
Earlier it emerged that Mr Ron Brown, former Labour MP for Leith, who has
long-standing contacts with the Libyan government, had put the miners in
touch with Lafico.
Quayle Munro, the quoted Edinburgh merchant bank being paid by Lothian
regional council to advise the consortium and help solve its financial
problems, issued a statement saying that the action taken by the miners'
representative was 'in all the circumstances ill-conceived'.
It said the business of Monktonhall Mineworkers depended on the goodwill of
the government, British Coal, power generators and other customers. Mr John
Elliot, a director, added that it was 'tactless, to say the least' to engage
Libyan support at a time when the Lockerbie bombing was still fresh in
people's minds in Scotland.
The government is attempting to secure the extradition to Scotland from
Libya of two men accused of being involved in the plot to bring down Pan Am
flight 101, which crashed on Lockerbie in 1988.
Mr David Costello, chairman of Lothian regional council's planning
committee, which is working to save Monktonhall, said that the action the
miners had taken had been 'absolutely disastrous'.
Quayle Munro said it had learned of the approach to Libya only just before
it was disclosed in the Scottish media.
The merchant bank said in June that Monktonhall needed a capital injection
of Pounds 3m to become viable. Although the pit has contracts to sell its
coal, it is crippled by lack of finance due to initial underfunding and
subsequent operating losses. Its only source of capital was the Pounds 1.8m
raised from subscriptions of Pounds 10,000 each from the 180 miners, which
has been exceeded by operating losses.
However yesterday Quayle Munro said: 'In recent days there may have emerged
a hope that a broadly satisfactory solution may be possible.'

The problem of unemployment is a question 'not of economics, but of social

<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil output rose by nearly 17 per cent in July to more than 2m
barrels a day for the first time this year, figures from the Royal Bank of
Scotland show.
The bank said the increase may have been because production was delayed
earlier in the year to take advantage of Budget changes, which took effect
in July and reduced petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent.
However falling prices meant oil-company revenues rose by just 5 per cent to
Pounds 22.5m a day.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Body Shop to develop windfarm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY SHOP International, the toiletries and cosmetics group, yesterday moved
towards its goal of energy self-sufficiency, placing contracts for a 10MW
windfarm in mid-Wales, Michael Smith writes.
The company, which prides itself on its environmental policies, is committed
to producing the equivalent of its UK energy needs through wind power.
The farm at Bryn Titli, near Rhayader, will have 22 wind turbines of
37-metre diameter on 30-metre towers. It will generate enough electricity to
supply more than 7,000 homes.
Radnorshire District Council gave planning permission in spite of objections
from groups including the Countryside Council for Wales.
Windfarms are becoming controversial as their number grows. There are 14 in
operation in the UK and another six under construction.
The Body Shop farm is being built by National Wind Power, a company owned by
National Power, the electricity generator, and Taylor Woodrow, the
construction group. Investment in the farm is expected to be Pounds 11m and
National Power is providing finance.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Acas workload set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORK of Acas, the independent conciliation service, for individual
workers is expected to fall as a result of changes introduced this week
under the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act.
Employees can now settle cases of unfair dismissal with legally binding
settlements with employers as long as they are represented by qualified
solicitors with insurance coverage.
In the past these could not be settled without Acas intervention and the
service has dealt with up to 80,000 cases a year.

BRITISH Pipe Coaters is shutting its 77-acre site at Invergordon, Ross and

FT  01 SEP 93 / Queen decrees pay by merit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Queen is introducing performance-related pay for the whole of the royal
household, it was confirmed yesterday.
But some of the staff, who are relatively low-paid, are said to be angry at
the move.
Buckingham Palace said that the system would be introduced gradually for all
the Queen's staff. Those most affected will be the 400 domestics employed as
butlers, maids, footmen, gardeners and chefs.
Pay levels at Buckingham Palace and other royal establishments remain low
compared with wages outside royal households. Maids receive pre-tax earnings
of about Pounds 6,000 a year, and footmen Pounds 7,000. Chefs earn Pounds
13,000 a year.
Performance-related pay will replace the current pay system, which is based
on annual increments.
The palace said last night that nobody in the Queen's employment would
receive less pay as a result of performance-related pay, and that some would
receive more for exceptional service.
The introduction of the system would come on top of annual cost-of-living
increases. At present these rises are capped by the government's limit of
1.5 per cent for all public-sector employees, which is due to end in the
autumn.
The popularity of performance-related pay is spreading. The BBC is thought
to be introducing a performance-related-pay scheme on top of the existing
pay structure. Merit-pay schemes have been agreed in the past two months at
a number of insurance companies.
It has been suggested that many royal household staff will not benefit from
a system which might encourage departmental heads at the palace to reward
some staff at the expense of others.
But a Buckingham Palace official said last night: 'I have not heard anybody
complaining about it.'
There is no suggestion that performance-related pay might be extended from
the Queen's staff to the members of her own family.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Privatised prison plans attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to extend the role of the private sector in the UK prison
service were yesterday attacked by the opposition, prison officers and penal
reform groups.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will announce a 'strategy for future
private-sector involvement' tomorrow, barely a week after publication of a
critical report on the first privatised prison.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said that the Labour party would
resist further privatisation of prisons until there had been a proper
assessment of privatisations which had already taken place.
Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said that it
was not yet clear that privately run prisons offered a genuine improvement
in the service.
Only two of the UK's 130 prisons have so far been privatised - Wolds remand
prison on Humberside and Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester. The contract
to run Strangeways prison in Manchester was put out to tender but the
contract was won by the in-house team.
Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, said last week that it
was impossible to determine the value for money of the privatisation
arrangements for the Wolds prison. He blamed weaknesses in the management
agreement and an absence of systems for checking financial aspects of the
contract.
Judge Tumim also attacked the 'lethargy' among the prison's inmates, who
were not encouraged to make good use of their time. These comments follow
controversy over recently leaked Home Office documents which suggested that
Mr Howard thought prisons were not 'austere' enough.
The Prison Officers' Association promised fierce opposition to any further
privatisation plans. Mr John Bartell, its chairman, said members would be
balloted on industrial action if more prisons were to be privatised.
Mr Adam Sampson of the Prison Reform Trust said that privatising existing
jails would fall foul of the European Community directive that protects the
jobs and conditions of staff whose work is contracted out.
However, Group 4, the private security company that manages Wolds, said it
would be happy to bid for existing prisons.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Support for Crest share reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST QUOTED companies are willing to give conditional support to the Crest
proposals for the reform of the stock market settlement system, a new survey
shows.
ProShare, established to encourage wider share ownership, wrote to 1,700
companies and received 224 responses. It found that 25 per cent of companies
strongly supported the Crest proposals and 49 per cent were marginally in
favour. Many respondents had reservations about some proposals.
The plan was outlined in a Bank of England taskforce report published in
July, after the costly breakdown of the Taurus project.
Most share transactions would be settled electronically but participation
would be voluntary with investors having the option to retain share
certificates, although at a cost.
About a third of corporate respondents marginally or strongly opposed the
voluntary nature of the system, arguing that a two-tier structure would be
complex and would eliminate some of the cost savings that might be gained
from electronic settlement. Cost is a key concern. One company said: 'It is
fundamental that major plcs and their shareholders do not become faced with
having to subsidise other sectors of the market.'
Nominee accounts are at the heart of an electronic settlement system and
many companies are concerned that, under Crest, they would face difficulties
in communicating with their private shareholders. Some are also concerned
that the private investor would find the new system too costly or
inconvenient.
Some companies believe the changes might lead to a reduction in the number
of private shareholders. Mr Stuart Valentine, director of research at
ProShare, said: 'It would be wrong if the tail of settlement wagged the dog
of share ownership.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / Big Lloyd's agency hit by cash fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERRETT HOLDINGS, one of the largest managing agencies at Lloyd's, is
turning to corporate investors to offset a sharp fall in popularity of its
syndicates among Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance
market.
The group's chairman, Mr Stephen Merrett, already under pressure to resign
as deputy chairman of the Lloyd's insurance market, has faced increasing
difficulty this year in persuading Names to back the group's nine
syndicates.
It emerged yesterday that members' agents - who handle the affairs of Names
and channel them on to syndicates - can supply only about Pounds 50m of
capital to the biggest of the Merrett syndicates, number 418, for next year,
about a third of the amount it has for 1993.
The syndicate, which underwrites US liability business, is one of the
Lloyd's market's most important but has declined steadily since 1988 when
its capacity amounted to Pounds 285m.
A second Merrett syndicate, number 1,067, has also suffered from a sharp
fall in popularity among Names and can expect only Pounds 22m in capacity
for 1994 compared with Pounds 55m in 1993.
Following yesterday's meeting the Merrett agency is stepping up its efforts
to attract corporate investors to support its business. Mr Stephen Cane,
managing director, said he was optimistic about the prospects of increasing
corporate investment in the group's syndicates.
Merrett is hoping to be able to convert a Bermuda-based company,
Underwriting Capital (Merrett), set up this year to provide reinsurance to
its syndicates, into a fully fledged incorporated Name as soon as Lloyd's
rules permit.
Even with the new company's backing, however, Merrett's problems may not be
over. Under Lloyd's provisional rules corporate investors are restricted
from supplying more than 50 per cent of a syndicate's capacity.

<TEXT>
AT LEAST 150 Lloyd's underwriters earned Pounds 100,000 or more last year,
according to figures to be published today by the Association of Lloyd's
Members, the biggest organisation of Names.
The scale of remuneration - only marginally less than that paid in 1991 - is
likely to cause controversy at the market, where many Names face ruin after
losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Economists warm to a late arrival as early-warning indicator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), published yesterday by the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply, caused barely a ripple in financial
markets.
The index indicates that manufacturing output is continuing to expand,
although at a slower rate than in previous months.
The good news is that the index remains above 50 per cent, indicating
expansion in manufacturing for the seventh consecutive month. But the August
reading of 51.8 per cent was the lowest since February, possibly indicating
a slowdown in the pace of expansion.
While it is valuable as an early indicator - the PMI shows trends several
weeks before official data - it is only two years old. This means that the
institute has not been able to develop a system of seasonal adjustment and
this lowers the value of the index in the eyes of some economists.
The PMI survey is modelled on one of the most closely tracked economic
indicators in the US, the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM)
index.
Economists believe the NAPM index, based on a survey of purchasing managers
who control the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate
cash each year, gives an early indication of the health of manufacturing.
The theory is that purchasing managers anticipate the needs of a growing
business and also cut spending when business slows. Their responses on
output, orders, purchases, delivery times, stocks and employment - which
make up the index - are a valuable early indicator of manufacturing output
trends.
The methodology of the survey, used in the US since 1931, has been pursued
by the UK institute since July 1991. It gathers the responses of 250
purchasing managers every month.
Mr Neil Williams, UK economist at County NatWest Investment Management,
said: 'We often refer to the PMI, but the major problem is that it does not
have much of a track record and is not seasonally adjusted. It is not as
accurate as the monthly Confederation of British Industry survey which has a
high correlation with manufacturing output.'
Nonetheless, the PMI is gaining fans. The survey results are watched by the
Treasury.
An article on business survey indicators in the latest Treasury bulletin
says the PMI is not forward-looking, but acts as an early-warning indicator.
The fit with month-on-month growth rates in manufacturing output is not
particularly close, it says, but 'this is perhaps not surprising given that
the PMI includes activity indicators other than output'.
However, the institute also constructs indices for individual components and
the Treasury concludes that the fit is somewhat better for the output
balance, 'though it lags actual output growth by a month or two over most of
the period'.
So far this year the index has proved fairly accurate in signalling robust
rises in manufacturing output. Given time, it may acquire the hallowed
status of the NAPM.

FT  01 SEP 93 / EC urged to ease regional aid rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday launched its bid to win EC regional aid aimed at
areas hit by defence spending cuts.
It called on the European Commission to relax rules that prevent funds being
allocated to prosperous parts of the country, such as the south-west, where
the decline in military orders has led to large job losses.
Submitting an outline bid for Pounds 15m of EC aid, the government said some
parts of Britain worst hit by defence cuts might not qualify for aid if the
Commission applied its structural funds objectives.
These objectives restrict aid spending to areas of industrial decline or
rural regions which need modernisation. The government is concerned that
adherence to the rules would mean counties such as Avon, where an estimated
7,000 defence-related jobs have been lost in the past six years, would not
be eligible for part of the Pounds 100m Konver fund.
The fund, announced in April by Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy
commissioner, is designed to be used for retraining, job-creation schemes
and the regeneration of disused military bases.
The Western Development Partnership, the public- and private-sector forum
which is supporting a joint bid for EC aid by Avon, Wiltshire and
Gloucestershire, said yesterday that thousands more jobs would be lost if
the Commission rejected the UK bid.
The partnership said: 'The three counties could expect to lose a further
7,000 MoD military and civilian jobs and over 12,000 from defence companies
by the year 2000 if the Konver initiative fails.'
Commission officials in Brussels yesterday signalled a willingness to accept
the UK call for flexibility on where aid could be spent, saying the funds
would reflect 'the special circumstances of the UK defence industry'.
The government outlined a six-point plan to encourage defence companies to
convert to civilian activities. This covers aid for start-up businesses;
technology transfer schemes; rehabilitation of military sites; vocational
training; joint projects to help companies diversify; and new economic
promotion agencies.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Link of jobs to growth queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICIES DESIGNED to increase the rate of economic growth in Europe will do
very little to cut unemployment, a former economics director of the Henley
Centre for Forecasting argues today.
Mr Paul Ormerod, a visiting professor at Manchester University, says the
problem of unemployment is a question 'not of economics, but of social
values and social relationships'.
The employed have operated in the European Community 'in an effective
cartel' against the unemployed.
In a paper prepared for a seminar on full employment in Europe to be held
this week in Sussex, Mr Ormerod says societies with low unemployment are
characterised by high levels of 'social cohesion'.
He pinpoints work-sharing as one valid 'technical' solution to high
unemployment, but says this would require the agreement of many people to
receive less income in exchange for more leisure.
In a challenge to 'orthodox' economic analysis - embraced by all main
political parties - which emphasises the need to generate economic growth to
bring unemployment down, Mr Ormerod argues that there is no such connection
between job creation and growth.
The US and the European Community have grown by 'almost identical' amounts
in the past 20 years, yet employment in the US is up by 45 per cent, against
only 7 per cent in Europe, he says.
The seminar - to be chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the
Commons social security committee - comes about a month after Mr David Hunt,
the employment secretary, called for a national consensus between the main
political parties on a strategy for tackling long-term unemployment.
The event will be attended both by Mr Hunt and Mr John Monks, the TUC
general secretary.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: 'Appalling' cost if trade talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, yesterday urged governments
to face down vested interests and 'place political leadership before
expediency' in a warning that the costs of failure to complete the world
trade talks would be 'appallingly high'.
Before leaving for Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior
ministers, he told Gatt's trade negotiations committee that the 116-nation
Uruguay Round would end 'for good or bad' on December 15, when US fast-track
negotiating authority expires. There would be no extension. The talks,
launched in Uruguay in 1986, are already three years behind schedule.
A ministerial conference has been tentatively scheduled for April 1994 at
which the Uruguay Round agreements would be signed, along with a declaration
and future work programme. These are expected to foreshadow negotiations on
such issues as competition policy and the links between trade and
environment, not covered by the present Round.
In a speech for delivery to German industrialists in Cologne last night, Mr
Sutherland called on German industrial and political leaders to stand up and
fight for a successful Uruguay Round. He said the Round was not an 'optional
extra' to the existing multilateral system but 'arguably the most important
and urgent issue' on the world agenda today.
'It is very hard to understand how some people can be so short-sighted as to
want to put all this at risk by pandering to a relatively small number of
inefficient producers,' Mr Sutherland said. He did not refer directly to
France, whose apparent recruitment of Mr Kohl last week in support of its
hardline stance on agriculture is seen as posing a serious threat to the
round.
Over the next two months, trade negotiators in Geneva will focus on reducing
tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services, finalising
the rules on services, and sorting out some institutional aspects of the
proposed multilateral trade organisation and dispute settlement mechanism.
Other problems with the draft package of Uruguay Round agreements would be
dealt with 'at the appropriate time', Mr Sutherland said.
Ariane Genillard adds from Bonn: Mr Sutherland carried his message in the
afternoon to Bonn, where he received full support from Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the economics minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign affairs minister.
Both have opposed a renegotiation of the Blair House agreement, despite Mr
Kohl's recent questioning of the validity of the accord.
Mr Rexrodt stressed yesterday that his position on the Blair House agreement
remained unchanged and called for a rapid conclusion of the Gatt trade
talks.
Mr Kinkel also reiterated yesterday his firm opposition to any renegotiation
of the accord.
The real test of Germany's determination to support French calls for a
watering down of the farm accord will come today as Mr Sutherland meets Mr
Kohl.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Paris seeks protection against EC imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission, which negotiated the Blair House deal, was
expecting to receive last night or today the formal French proposals for
changes. The main demands are understood to focus on ensuring adequate
protection against agriculture imports into the EC, and guarantees that cuts
in subsidised food exports will not bite deeper because of farm price and
currency fluctuations.
On imports, France can expect substantial support from its partners in
resisting US ambitions for guaranteed market access for American produce.
Neither Blair House nor the Uruguay Round 'final act' provides the sort of
guarantees Washington wants in any conclusion to the Round.
On farm prices and exchange rate fluctuations, France appears determined to
protect its exporting potential, sources in Brussels say. As a result of
last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, EC cereals prices
should converge on world market prices by 1997, meaning that the Community
will be able to reduce - and perhaps even do away with - export subsidies.
The 21 per cent cuts over six years in the volume of subsidised exports the
EC has agreed with the US would not then be applicable, since there is no
restraint on exports without subsidy.
France is therefore understood to want additional guarantees that:
relatively frequent big rises and falls in international farm prices will be
factored into the agreement on subsidised food export cuts;
there is a mechanism to ensure that currency fluctuations will not impede
the Community from reaching world prices.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S campaign for changes in Europe's draft farm trade accord with the
US yesterday gained ground when the Belgian presidency of the EC said it was
open to 'a certain renegotiation' of the transatlantic deal.
With two new French documents on Gatt in his pocket, Mr Willy Claes,
Belgium's foreign minister, came away yesterday from a meeting in Paris with
the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, saying that he had 'no objection in
principle' to renegotiating a farm trade agreement with which Belgium had
some difficulty itself.
One of the two French documents - on the need for strengthened EC defences
against unfair trade practices - will be unveiled by French ministers today.
It would place Commission trade negotiators under closer supervision by
national governments represented in the EC Council of Ministers, spur the
EC's executive commission into tougher action against dumping and give Gatt
reinforced powers as a means of reining in America's tendency to seek
unilateral trade remedies.
More controversial are France's proposals to water down constraints in last
November's Blair House accord on farm trade with the US. Paris is still
keeping these proposals confidential, but among them are two suggestions to
preserve Europe's exports and to reduce American inroads into the EC market.
Paris proposes that existing EC stocks - amounting to nearly 30m tonnes of
cereals and 1m tonnes of beef - should be exempt from the Blair House
accord, and that the 21 per cent cut in subsidised exports over six years
should apply only to future EC production. It has also sent a separate memo
to Brussels, suggesting curbs on imports of American corn gluten.

PRATT &amp; WHITNEY Canada, a subsidiary of the US enginemaker, announced
yesterday a deal with Klimov, the Russian company, to make aircraft power
plants.
Mr GilIes Ouimet, the Canadian company's executive vice-president, said the
two companies had agreed to create a joint venture which would produce its
first engine by the end of 1994. They planned to be able to build 100
engines a year, he said.
Having been one of the first western companies already to clinch a Russian
aircraft deal, by providing engines for a jointly-produced aeroplane with
Ilyushin, Pratt &amp; Whitney yesterday presented a first joint venture to
manufacture engines for helicopters and smaller aircraft.
The establishment of the joint venture by the Klimov design bureau in St
Petersburg and Pratt's Canadian offshoot highlights the demand for superior
engines to match superior Soviet aircraft frames.
Mr Alexander Sarkisov, general constructor of the state-owned Klimov, which
has designed 90 per cent of the engines in Russian helicopters, was unmoved
by suggestions he was betraying the Russian engine industry. 'We will devote
as much capacity as the market can take for making engines with Pratt &amp;
Whitney,' he said.
He also stressed, however, that the engines would be sold and serviced for
roubles, not hard currency, at prices which would make them attractive to
Russian manufacturers and foreign ventures.
Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of the French aircraft-maker Aerospatiale, told a
news conference in Moscow that Aero-spatiale, which was 'patiently building'
a foundation for future co-operation, would set up, by the end of the year,
a jointly-owned company with Russia's Mil enterprise to build the Mi-38
helicopter, a 13-tonne machine designed for heavy loads and public works.
If Pratt &amp; Whitney's joint venture produced concrete results, he added, the
Franco-Russian partners might consider buying engines from it.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: New company breaks into Polish telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEWLY formed Polish telecommunications company has joined US Sprint and
the International Finance Corporation to break the former state
telecommunications monopoly and invest up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in
modernising the telephones of eight Polish cities.
The new company, RP Telecom, is starting by building an Dollars 80m
telephone network for 100,000 subscribers at Pila, north-west Poland. A
similar network is planned for the southern industrial city of Katowice and
six other large towns.
US Sprint will provide technical assistance and be the major shareholder in
the operating company. Line installation at Pila will be undertaken by an
Israeli company, Israel Aircraft Industries.
The IFC, with Smith Barney, the US investment bank, helped to bring Sprint
into the deal. The IFC will provide 10-15 per cent of the Dollars 32m equity
of the new company and syndicate the bulk of the Dollars 48m debt raised to
finance the Pila operation.
The new company is structured on a 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent debt
basis which will be expanded in step with the planned building of new
networks in Polish cities.

<TEXT>
THE Canadian government has shut down virtually all of the east coast cod
fishery and announced deep quota cuts on other fish species, AP reports from
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The measures could put 12,000 people out of work.
Last year, Ottawa shut down the northern cod fishery off the east coast of
Newfoundland, affecting over 20,000 fishermen and plant workers.
Mr Ross Reid, federal fisheries minister, said yesterday he would ban cod
fishing in four more areas in the region and sharply reduce quotas on other
valuable species.
'We are facing an unprecedented ecological crisis in Atlantic groundfish
stocks,' Mr Reid said. 'Immediate action is needed to permit this fragile
resource to rebuild.'
The extended ban will cover cod on the eastern Scotian shelf off Nova
Scotia, the southern Gulf of St Lawrence, the Sydney Bight area off Cape
Breton and the south coast of Newfoundland.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Rejoin Unesco in two years, US is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TASK force has recommended that the US should rejoin the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, but suggested delaying
re-entry for another two years.
The task force, headed by Mr Douglas Bennet, assistant secretary of state
for international organisations, says Unesco has improved its management and
reversed its earlier politicisation.
State Department officials confirmed that the recommendation had been
forwarded to the White House National Security Council, but did not know
when President Bill Clinton might act on it.
The UK is also considering rejoining the organisation. The House of Commons
foreign affairs committee this month urged the government to do so.
The US withdrew from the Paris-based Unesco in 1984, complaining that the
organisation had 'extraneously politicised virtually every subject it deals
with; exhibits hostility towards the basic institutions of a free society,
especially a free market and a free press; and demonstrated unrestrained
budgetary expansion'.
The UK and Singapore followed suit a year later.
After a bitter political struggle, Unesco's controversial secretary-general,
Mr Amadou Mehtar M'Bow, was voted out in 1987 and succeeded by Mr Federico
Mayor, a Spanish former education minister, who has tried hard to persuade
the US and UK to rejoin.
State Department reports in 1990 and 1992 concluded that Unesco had made
little progress, but members of the US Congress from both parties said these
were dishonest assessments intended to justify a continued boycott.
Some senior members, including Mr Howard Berman, chairman of the House of
Representatives sub-committee on international organisations, have argued
for rejoining.
Finding the Dollars 65m annual US membership dues, from a foreign operations
budget that has shrunk by more than 20 per cent in two years, could be
difficult.
By delaying re-entry until October 1995, as the task force recommends, the
administration would be able to use money written into the budget baseline
for the next two years to pay off the considerable US arrears at the United
Nations.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of litigation has broken out between Exxon, the largest US oil
company, and a group of insurers, led by Lloyd's of London, over part of the
Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of clean-up and settlement costs arising from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989.
The insurers, which include American International Group and Cigna, among
others, have lodged an action in federal court in New York, seeking a
declaration from it that they are not liable for the costs of the oil spill.
Exxon said it believed the action was in response to a suit it had launched
in Texas state court at the beginning of August to recover a portion of its
costs arising from the Valdez spill.
'The insurance clearly covers the amount claimed,' Exxon said, adding that
it had resorted to litigation only after four years of discussions with the
insurers had failed to resolve the matter.
Neither side would disclose the amount under dispute, although Exxon said it
was 'substantial' and related to both 'expenses and liabilities' incurred by
the company as a result of the environmental disaster.

Mr Takao Ninomiya, managing director of Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the

The move to force open the Second Stage Expressway, through the middle of

THE US is willing to negotiate lifting sanctions worth Dollars 500m-Dollars
1bn (Pounds 660m) imposed last week on China and Pakistan over the sale of
components of M-11 missiles, according to a senior State Department
official, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
Mr Winston Lord, assistant US secretary of state for Asia and the Pacific,
yesterday said he was prepared to give China, which sold the components to
Pakistan, another chance because there were areas in the guidelines to the
Missiles Technology Control Regime that contained 'possible ambiguity'.
China, he pointed out, had consistently denied violating the MTCR, to which
it is not a signatory.

BRAZILIANS yesterday expressed outrage at news of the country's third
reported massacre in five weeks, as government officials met in Rio de
Janeiro to seek a solution to the outbreaks of violence, agencies report
from Rio de Janeiro.
Members of Congress have called for federal intervention in the city's
militarised police, who are under investigation for alleged participation in
the latest massacre, in which 21 slum-dwellers were gunned down on Sunday.
Such federal intervention would have precedent. Last month, the army was
brought in to tackle organised crime among the police of the north-eastern
state of Alagoas.
About 20 hooded gunmen armed with automatic weapons burst into the Vigario
Geral shantytown in northern Rio on Sunday. That appeared to be revenge for
the killings there of four police officers, possibly by drug traffickers,
the night before.

The move to force open the Second Stage Expressway, through the middle of
the capital, surprised and dismayed financiers. Some warned it might
alienate international investors just when Thailand is hoping to tap them
for a massive upgrading of its national infrastructure.
Mr Sukavich said foreign bankers had 'only' put in Dollars 100m compared to
local bankers' Dollars 700m so the move would have no effect on future
financing 'as long as they understand why we are doing this. I'm not forcing
anything. . . We will continue to negotiate afterwards.' BECL has said the
almost complete toll road should not open until the row over the
interpretation of the complex project finance contract signed in 1988 is
resolved.
The Thai authorities appear to have finally conceded it should charge the
original Bt30 (Dollars 1.20) toll per vehicle agreed in the contract rather
than the Bt20 more acceptable to Bangkok motorists. But BECL says it is owed
some Bt2bn in backdated revenues and is sceptical about the transport
authority's ability to adhere to the agreement for the remaining 27 years of
the concession.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Republicans buoyant - but still divided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US REPUBLICAN party bigwigs left Washington at the beginning of August, for
the summer vacation, in a mood of self-congratulation at the points they had
scored against President Bill Clinton in his gruelling battle to pass his
budget.
Mr Haley Barbour, the party chairman, crowed that Mr Clinton had 'done more
to unite the Republican party in the last 200 days than I'll do in four
years.'
But the pleasures of sniping at Mr Clinton have only covered the
philosophical rifts over issues such as 'family values' that the
presidential election campaign last year exposed. Some Republicans worry
about how their party will measure up when the time comes to say what it
stands for, instead of what it stands against.
Some of the criticism has come from the old testament prophets of US
conservatism. Mr Barry Goldwater, presidential candidate in 1964, has been
particularly scathing about his party's decline from fighting communism and
high taxes to fighting homosexuality.
But some of the most piercing comments have come from Congressman Bob
Michel, Republican leader in the House of Representatives. In an interview
this month with his hometown newspaper, the Peoria Journal Star, he wrung
his hands over his party's 'antagonistic' hardliners.
'Bob Michel is going to call it quits. Soon. Very soon,' says Republican
former congressman Mickey Edwards.
Mr Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House who would be best placed
to succeed Mr Michel, is temperamentally more suited to the confrontational
tactics his party now favours. His negligible legislative record suggests
that the party, under his leadership, would be even less of a partner in the
formulation of national policy.
The Republican leader in the Senate, Mr Bob Dole, has shown none of Mr
Michel's qualms about the confrontational approach. He is also much better
placed to make such tactics work, because the Senate's procedural rules
allow the Republican minority there much greater obstructive power than has
its counterpart in the House.
Mr Dole gives the appearance of having the time of his life in his role as
Washington's number one Republican. Despite his age - at 70 he is four
months younger than Mr Michel - he has spent his summer holiday glad-handing
the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa, the two states that vote first in
presidential primaries.
But even Mr Dole's somewhat improbable presidential ambitions reflect to
some extent the split in the Republican party.
His trips to New Hampshire and his hounding of Mr Clinton in Congress seem,
to some Republicans, designed principally to avoid being outflanked on the
right by Senator Phil Gramm, the abrasive Texan who is openly campaigning
for his party's intellectual leadership - and for its presidential
nomination in 1996.
Also, Republicans throughout the spectrum are wondering how to deal with Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas independent who could steal many of their best themes
and deliver them, in 1996, a repeat of the 1992 presidential election -
second place in a three-way race.
It is clear that Mr Clinton cannot expect to pass his next legislative
priorities, the North American Free Trade Agreement and healthcare reform,
without bipartisan support, but it is also clear that a sizeable body at the
centre of the Republican party believes that it, too, needs to be more
constructive in the next session of Congress.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Life under Bush better than it seemed: What lies behind the
biggest upward revision in American GDP figures in 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE WAS better than it seemed during the Bush years. That, at least, is the
conclusion of federal statisticians who today announced one of the biggest
upward revisions to US gross domestic product in 20 years.
According to the new figures, the recession of 1990/91 was rather a mild
affair, with gross domestic product falling only 1.6 per cent in real terms
from peak to trough, compared with a previous estimate of a decline of 2.2
per cent.
The recovery that began in the second quarter of 1991 was a lot stronger
than previously suspected with real GDP growth averaging 2.4 per cent at an
annual rate rather than 2 per cent.
For the three years from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of
1992, real growth was 55 per cent stronger than previously estimated: an
average annual rate of 1.4 per cent rather than 0.9 per cent.
The most striking revision was to 1992. In the year to the fourth quarter of
1992, the economy grew by a robust 3.9 per cent in real terms. Yet these
were the months when candidate Bill Clinton successfully portrayed George
Bush as a president who had failed the nation economically.
In the final quarter of last year, the economy surged ahead with real growth
at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent, rather than the 4.7 per cent previously
reported, the swiftest growth since the end of 1987 when the Reagan 'boom'
was still underway.
The most important factor in the revisions was large upward adjustments to
the figures on consumer spending on durable goods other than vehicles - for
example furniture, household equipment and clothes. These revisions in turn
mainly reflect new information from the Census Bureau which has just updated
its series for retail sales, an exercise undertaken every five years.
The other main upward revisions were for corporate expenditure on
non-residential fixed investment and for state and local government
spending.
The re-writing of economic history did not just affect GDP. The new figures
contradict claims that personal incomes stagnated during the Bush years.
After allowing for inflation, personal disposable income grew at an annual
rate of 2.2 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1992, not 1.3
per cent as originally estimated.
Corporate profits were also revised up sharply for each of the past three
years. In some sectors the revisions were huge. For example profits made by
financial companies were revised up by 38 per cent in 1991 and 42.5 per cent
last year. It seems that banks, savings and loans institutions and life
assurance companies were all financially stronger than previously estimated.
Last, Americans were a bit more thrifty than economists thought. The
personal savings rate last year was 5.3 per cent, not high, but better than
the 4.8 per cent at first estimated.
The statistical revisions also cast new light on the surge in growth at the
end of last year. To a considerable degree it reflected the bringing forward
of income from this year to avoid the expected increase in personal taxation
in President Clinton's first budget.
Statisticians had expected some Wall Street companies to bring forward
bonuses to avoid higher top rates of tax this year. They therefore made
allowance for an extra Dollars 1.5bn in accelerated bonus payments.
It now appears that tax avoidance was a national phenomenon affecting scores
of different industries.
The latest estimates indicate that bonus payments to the tune of Dollars
19bn (0.3 per cent of GDP) were brought forward from this year and paid in
the final months of the Bush administration.
The swollen bonus payments significantly distorted the personal income
figures and help explain why real consumer spending on durables grew at a
staggering annual rate of 13 per cent in the final quarter of last year. The
biggest puzzle raised by the revised figures is why public perceptions of
the economy were so weak in recent years. The conventional wisdom is that it
reflects the lack of job creation.
But this is only a partial answer because the jobs figures have also been
revised recently to show a smaller drop during the recession and a stronger
rebound during the subsequent recovery. The current jobless rate of 6.8 per
cent is not high by international standards, or by US standards for much of
the 1980s.
The answer seems to lie in dashed expectations. Even after the revisions,
growth since the recession has averaged less than 2.5 per cent at an annual
rate, a far cry from the rocket-like acceleration of growth experienced in
nearly all the previous post-war US business cycles.

FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Canadians sign aeroengine deal in Russia

PRATT &amp; WHITNEY Canada, a subsidiary of the US enginemaker, announced
yesterday a deal with Klimov, the Russian company, to make aircraft power
plants.
Mr GilIes Ouimet, the Canadian company's executive vice-president, said the
two companies had agreed to create a joint venture which would produce its
first engine by the end of 1994. The plan was to be able to build 100
engines a year, he said.
Having been one of the first western companies to clinch a deal that has
already yielded fruit, by providing engines for a jointly-produced plane
with Ilyushin, Pratt &amp; Whitney yesterday presented a first ever joint
venture to manufacture engines for helicopters and smaller aircraft.
The establishment of a joint venture with the Klimov design bureau in St
Petersburg and Pratt's Canadian offshoot highlights the demand for superior
engines to match superior Soviet aircraft frames.
For Russia, the web of contracts and resulting deals is providing an
encouraging, if sometimes irritating, model of what co-operation with the
west can bring. Mr Alexander Sarkisov, general constructor of the
state-owned Klimov, which has designed 90 per cent of the engines on Russian
helicopters, was unmoved by suggestions he was betraying the Russian engine
industry.
'We will devote as much capacity as the market can take for making engines
with Pratt &amp; Whitney,' he said, displaying the emerging capitalist toughness
of many Russian managers. He also stressed, however, that the engines would
be sold and serviced for roubles, not hard currency, at prices which would
make them attractive for Russian manufacturers and foreign ventures.
Executives from up to 200 foreign companies have converged on Moscow this
week for Russia's second annual aerospace show. All have come to be seen,
and to be heard, organising often lavish news conferences, even if they have
nothing new to say.
As for the French aircraft-maker Aerospatiale, at a news conference in a
Moscow luxury hotel, the chairman Mr Louis Gallois had little concrete
progress to report since a visit earlier this year when he signed a series
of protocols of intent with almost every major Russian aerospace company. He
revealed only that Aerospatiale had concluded 'contracts' on hypersonic
research with two Moscow institutes but could not give any details. He said
Aerospatiale was also keen to help Russia develop its potential for titanium
exports for the western aerospace industry.
He promised that Aerospatiale, which was 'patiently building' a foundation
for future co-operation, would by the end of the year set up a jointly-owned
company with Russia's Mil enterprise to build the Mi-38 helicopter, a
13-tonne machine designed for heavy loads and public works.
If Pratt &amp; Whitney's joint venture produced concrete results, he added, the
Franco-Russian partners might consider buying engines from it.
As Russia makes strides to a market economy, its aviation industry is seen
as one of the country's most promising sectors for foreign buyers, sellers
and investors.
The westerners are attracted by Russia's technical prowess, cheap labour and
the publicity to be generated by announcing deals with Russian companies,
even if they subsequently fall through.
Having been beaten to the announcement of a similar deal between the Mikoyan
Design Bureau and Thomson, France's Dassault Electronique will this week try
to present an agreement with Mikoyan to upgrade old MiG-21s as the first
such deal to be up and running. It has its eye on a Dollars 300m contract to
provide new electronics systems for India's fleet of 100 such aircraft.

CHIEF Ernest Shonekan, the head of Nigeria's military-installed government,
yesterday promised to call fresh elections within the next seven months as
pro-democracy strikes halted air and road transport and paralysed Lagos, the
country's commercial capital.
In his first national address since taking office last Thursday, Mr Shonekan
admitted that his stop-gap administration was a 'second-best solution' to
the political impasse created by Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the former military
ruler, when he annulled presidential elections in June.
But he appealed to Nigerians to give the new government a chance: 'We intend
to run an open government (with) a consensus approach to decision making'
and respecting human rights.
Mr Shonekan promised to 'improve the quality of governance, accept
transparency and accountability in the management of public finance'.
He appealed to trade unions and pro-democracy activists in Lagos to end the
strikes which have brought the city to a halt.
But with Chief Moshood Abiola, the winner of the annulled election, still
absent from the country and unlikely to return soon, the pro-democracy
movement may lose steam after a week of protests. 'If Shonekan can survive
through this week, Abiola will have lost his claim to the presidency,' one
diplomat said yesterday.
A decree yesterday ended speculation over the extent of Mr Shonekan's
authority by naming him head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
Military officers loyal to Gen Babangida, however, maintain key positions at
the head of the army and joint defence staff. The State Security Services,
Gen Babangida's feared secret police, have not been dismantled. Union
leaders from the National Labour Congress were due to meet Mr Shonekan today
in an attempt to end the strikes.
In addition to their political demands, unions want the government to repeal
its decision to raise petrol prices.
In his speech, Mr Shonekan said the National Electoral Commission and
Nigeria's two military-created political parties would draft a timetable for
new elections within a week. His government, he said, would lead a crusade
against corruption and the 'get-rich-quick mania' that lay at the root of
the country's social problems.

DIVISIONS appeared yesterday in Japan's coalition government, as Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, was told by a coalition partner not to be
distracted by economic and foreign policy at the expense of political
reform.
Mr Kazuo Aichi, director of policy for the Japan Renewal party (JRP), said
the government had promised to complete a reform of the electoral system by
the end of this year, and Mr Hosokawa must devote his energies to this
cause.
'The cabinet was formed to introduce political reforms. I don't think we
have the time to deal with other issues,' said Mr Aichi.
His answer reflects the difference in emphasis between Mr Hosokawa and the
JRP, formed by defectors from the Liberal Democratic party, who see the
present coalition as having a mandate only to introduce electoral changes.
Some JRP officials say the coalition is temporary and oppose the ambitions
of Mr Hosokawa to deregulate the economy, confront Japan's war history, and
discuss a fine-tuning of US relations.
The joint leader of the JRP, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former backroom operator at
the LDP, made clear that he does not expect the coalition to have a long
life by proposing that his party work towards the creation of a two-party
system.
'This (the coalition) is not the final form. The establishment of the
coalition was one step toward breaking up collusive politics, in which
politicians lie and yet manage to get away with skirting responsibility,' Mr
Ozawa said.
However, Mr Ozawa said the coalition should attempt to end the practice of
permitting bureaucrats to answer questions in parliament on behalf of
cabinet ministers, who are often not well enough prepared to discuss their
portfolio.
Meanwhile, an independent MP, Mr Shoji Shinma, was indicted yesterday for
misrepresenting details of his education during an election campaign for the
Upper House.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S parliament yesterday approved a law outlining repayment terms for a
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) bad debt problem which has handicapped the
economy for more than a decade, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
The law, which offers a 54 per cent debt write-off to the biggest borrowers
if they pay back the money within two years, follows a nine-month struggle
for a solution to the issue.
The law was submitted by a joint committee of the parliament's legal and
economic affairs committees last week. It won 34 out 43 votes after
yesterday's heated 12-hour debate.
Economists said long-term economic revival was impossible without a solution
to the issue, which stems from the crash in 1982 of an informal stock
exchange and from commercial losses aggravated by Iraq's 1990-91 occupation.
The 9,546 corporate and individual borrowers include big business concerns.
Their names have not been published.

the political impasse created by Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the former military

He appealed to labour unions and pro-democracy activists in Lagos to end the

town.
But with Chief Moshood Abiola, the winner of the annulled election, still
absent from the country and unlikely to return soon, the pro-democracy
movement may lose steam after a week of protests.
'If Shonekan can survive through this week, Abiola will have lost his claim

Trade union leaders from Nigeria's National Labour Congress were due to meet
Mr Shonekan today in an attempt to end the strikes.
In addition to their political demands, unions want the government to repeal
its decision to raise petrol prices. Mr Shonekan will be told that he can
expect riots in Lagos and other big cities if his government insists on
raising the cost of Nigeria's heavily-subsidised fuel 10-fold.
In his speech, Mr Shonekan said the National Electoral Commission and
Nigeria's two military-created political parties would draft a timetable for
new elections within a week. His government, he said, would lead a crusade
against corruption and the 'get-rich-quick mania' that lay at the root of
the country's social problems.
He promised the national assembly would be given legislative powers.
It was not immediately clear whether Mr Shonekan's speech would pacify
pro-democracy activists. Hostility to the new government is strongest in the
south-west, Chief Abiola's home, where Yorubas feel they were cheated of a
rare chance to lead a new civilian government.

'The cabinet was formed to introduce political reforms. I don't think we

His answer reflects the difference in emphasis between Mr Hosokawa and the

Some JRP officials say the coalition is intended to be temporary and oppose
the growing ambitions of Mr Hosokawa to deregulate the economy, confront
Japan's war history, and discuss a fine-tuning of US relations.
Mr Aichi suggested that Mr Hosokawa should abandon plans to address the
United Nations later this month, and spend his time thinking about political
reform. The prime minister is planning to speak on foreign policy matters.
The joint leader of the JRP, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former backroom operator at
the LDP, made clear that he does not expect the coalition to have a long

The coalition parties generally agree that parliamentary rules should be
changed to encourage debate.
Meanwhile, an independent MP was indicted yesterday for misrepresenting
personal details during an election campaign for the Upper House. Mr Shoji
Shinma, 58, a former radio personality, claimed that he studied at
prestigious Meiji University, but allegedly only took an entrance exam and
failed to gain admission.

<TEXT>
JUST as Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, is being urged by
the more senior of his coalition partners to concentrate on political
reform, the economy is threatening to shorten his government's life by
failing to recover.
Technically, Japan has not yet hit a recession, in that it has not seen two
consecutive quarters of decline in gross national product. The latest gloomy
indicators released yesterday, as ministers responsible for the economy met
in emergency session, were no surprise, but they do add weight to the theory
that the economy might fall into recession before recovering at the end of
this year or early next.
They included a 0.3 per cent decline in seasonally adjusted industrial
production from June to July, or 4.5 per cent down on the year. In
unadjusted terms, industrial output has fallen for a record 22 straight
months and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) forecasts
that it will be stagnant for the next few months.
Car and construction industry figures are even worse. A 33.6 per cent
year-on-year decline in construction industry orders in July was far worse
than expected.
Meanwhile, car exports plunged by 13.9 per cent last month, as against July
last year, the fourth monthly decline, according to Nikkei, the economic
newspaper. The outlook for a recovery is poor, as European Community
negotiators meet trade officials tomorrow and Friday to seek, and probably
get, further cuts in car exports to the EC.
There was one small cause for cheer in yesterday's figures, a better than
expected 4.6 per cent year-on-year rise in housing starts last month, the
14th consecutive monthly rise. Yet the overall picture confirms that the
signs of recovery seen early this year have vanished, stifled by the impact
of the yen's sharp rise on export earnings and by the continuing caution of
consumers.
Economic analysts have slashed their forecasts for GNP growth this year from
between 1.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, to between 0.3 per cent and 1.5 per
cent. There is one exception; the government's Economic Planning Agency is
staunchly sticking to its target of 3.3 per cent growth.
So what are the government's options?
Mr Hosokawa's coalition partners are applying pressure for a drop in income
taxes, favoured by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the real power behind the Japan Renewal
party, one of the main coalition members.
However, the powerful Finance Ministry, which is against cutting income tax,
appears to be gaining the upper hand, helped by the fact that one of its own
former bureaucrats, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, happens to be its minister. It argues
that in the short term a shortfall in tax income will hamper the
government's freedom to dole out any further spending packages and that in
the longer term Japan's ageing population will eat into the current budget
surplus.
Equally, the latest evidence of the failure of the expected recovery has
piled fresh pressure on the Bank of Japan, technically independent, to lower
interest rates. Its official discount rate has been at a post-war low of 2.5
per cent since early this year and it is desperately keen to avoid a repeat
of the liquidity-fed rise in asset prices that preceded this downturn.
However, some analysts believe the central bank might see fit to drop rates
if its next quarterly survey of business confidence, due on September 10,
shows a decline.
Mr Hosokawa knows that failure to take some kind of action against the
downturn could land him with two headaches. The first will be when he meets
Mr Bill Clinton, at the end of September, when the US president is expected
to require evidence that the Japanese government has made progress in
stimulating domestic demand and encouraging imports to make an impact on the
trade surplus.
The second will be at the next general election, where several observers
believe a real recession could well help the Liberal Democratic party to
make a surprise comeback.

FT  01 SEP 93 / NTT's cut of 10,000 jobs could pave way for others

NTT, the Japanese telecom company, said yesterday it is seeking to cut about
10,000 employees from its payroll through voluntary retirement by the end of
next year. The announcement could pave the way for other companies to
implement similar cuts. Many Japanese companies are feeling the pressures of
high labour costs amid the slowdown but are unable to carry out staff cuts
because of Japan's tradition of lifetime employment. NTT, which is Japan's
largest company in terms of the number of employees, said that the staff
cuts were part of a restructuring programme announced earlier this year
aimed at eventually reducing staff numbers from more than 230,000 to
200,000.
In fiscal 1992, NTT fell from second to third place in the rankings of
Japan's top earners, according to statistics compiled by the National Tax
Agency. The company's reported earnings fell 44 per cent last year to
Y205.8bn (Pounds 1.33bn) and was outranked by Toyota, the car company and
Sanwa Bank.
NTT, which became a private company in 1986, has been suffering the effects
of greater competition, but it is by no means the only company feeling the
need to cut jobs.
The Industrial Bank of Japan said in a recent report that Japanese companies
employed about 900,000 staff in excess of what they needed.

FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Hussein and Assad hide their misgivings

<TEXT>
KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday flew unexpectedly to Damascus for urgent
talks with President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, in the hope of
co-ordinating the two countries' response to the proposed Palestinian deal
with Israel - which took both leaders by surprise.
Neither Jordan nor Syria has yet ventured any formal reaction to the deal
apart, as one diplomat put it, for 'King Hussein's eloquent departure to
Damascus'. After yesterday's talks, a spokesman for President Assad would
say only that the leaders had been 'surprised' by the PLO-Israeli agreement,
and that there had been 'no co-ordination between the Arab parties'.
However, politicians and diplomats in Amman said that both leaders had been
displeased by the absence of consultation before the agreement, and that
King Hussein in particular feared that Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestinian Liberation Organisation, had conceded too much to Israel too
soon.
In Egypt, Mr Arafat denied there were any misgivings in Amman or Damascus
and said before talks yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian
leader, that it was 'completely incorrect that they (Syria and Jordan) are
not happy with the accord'.
But senior Jordanian officials said that the king first heard of the deal
over the telephone and was angered that Mr Arafat should have reached in
secret an agreement which bears directly on Jordan's national interests. 'If
governments are not aware of what neighbours are doing, they are not going
to be happy,' said one prominent Jordanian. 'The lack of co-ordination has
left everyone with questions to ask, and answers to expect.'
Both Jordan and Syria are understood to feel that the separate Palestinian
agreement will place both countries under greater pressure from Israel to
conclude their own bilateral peace agreements with Tel Aviv, while
compromising elements of their bargaining positions. King Hussein is also
understood to be concerned that the agreement has failed to win sufficient
Israeli concessions on the questions of Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories and on the status of Jerusalem - a city with deep significance
to the king's Hashemite monarchy.
Diplomats said King Hussein's talks in Damascus will have been aimed at
cementing a united response with Syria to the agreement. Both countries have
maintained they would not conclude separate peace deals with Israel without
the Palestinians having first won a satisfactory agreement of their own. The
king will now be anxious Jordan does not become exposed by any immediate
Syrian move to advance its own track of the Arab-Israeli negotiations on the
back of the PLO-Israeli deal.
Diplomats said neither country was likely to hurry declarations of
principles towards a full peace with Israel - the next stage in each
country's negotiations - without first fully digesting the detail of the new
agreement.
King Hussein in particular will also be anxious to gauge the degree of
opposition to the deal both within Jordan's majority Palestinian population
and in Jordan's teeming Palestinian camps.
However, Syrian negotiators in Washington said that progress in the
Palestinian talks with Israel would prompt progress in the Syrian-Israeli
track of the negotiations.
Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator, also said he believed Syria
and Israel would agree on a declaration of principles 'during this round or
next' of the talks.

PALESTINIANS preparing to assume interim self-government in the
Israeli-occupied territories will face a huge challenge to reverse the
economic decline of the West Bank and Gaza.
The economies of Israel and the territories are likely to remain closely
linked and Palestinian and Israeli economists believe both could benefit
from an influx of international aid and private investment into a
Palestinian entity. Opportunities for expanded trade, combined with economic
liberalisation and regional integration, could provide the basis for
sustainable peace and an economic boom.
The economy in the territories, however, is underdeveloped and depressed.
Combined gross national product per capita of the 1.7m residents of the West
Bank and Gaza in 1991 was Dollars 1,800 - 16 per cent of Israel's Dollars
10,878. Almost a third of the economy of the occupied territories is
derived, traditionally, from sales of Palestinian goods and labour into
Israel.
Agriculture contributes 25 per cent of the economy, absorbs 23 per cent of
the labour force and accounts for 60 per cent of exports. Israel's
dependence on the territories is small - they contribute less than 3 per
cent of Israel's gross national product - a figure that is declining with
the substitution of immigrant labourers in the place of Palestinians.
The Gaza economy - which will be the initial focus of an expanded
Palestinian authority - is much the worst hit with income per head of less
than Dollars 850. Gaza, a 360 sq km strip of land, is home to 780,000
Palestinians, many living in sprawling shanty refugee camps. Gaza has also
been more severely hit by the five-month closure of the territories which
has cut off at least 20,000 migrant labourers and their families from their
only source of income - work in Israel.
Before the latest closure, the economy was already suffering from a
long-term lack of job-creating investment, a restrictive trade regime with
Israel and a population growing at 4.7 per cent a year. Unemployment is
estimated at 40-50 per cent.
Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, will wish to
act swiftly to redress growing poverty in Gaza, a breeding ground for
Islamic fundamentalism and opposition to the PLO - a goal shared by Israel.
Palestinians are putting much faith in a Marshall-style investment plan of
several billion dollars over five years. The World Bank has recommended
Dollars 1bn over five years, a figure Palestinians and Israelis believe is
too small.
Israel is backing external investment because the peace process will be made
or broken by economic development. Many economists say the costs for the
territories of severing economic relationships with Israel would be
prohibitively high.
Mr Ezra Sadan, a former director-general of the finance ministry, has said:
'If Gaza disconnects from our economy it will become a mini-Bangladesh. It
will have a kamikaze economy. I wouldn't like to have a kamikaze as my
neighbour.'
Furthermore, any economic growth in the territories will help Israel by
increasing the demand for Israeli goods and services because Israel will
remain the Palestinians' key trading partner. Israel also hopes that
economic growth in the territories will create jobs for Palestinians,
thereby reducing migrant labour which would in turn free jobs for Israelis
suffering from 11 per cent unemployment.
However economists have said that the ability of the occupied territories to
absorb capital is limited, given the poor infrastructure and administration
and the size of the domestic economy.
Considerable job-creating investment could be soaked up in a public works
programme but industrial development will be much slower. Ambitious
Palestinian plans for an airport and port are likely to be uneconomic.
Most economists agree that, at least for a five-year period, Israel will
continue to have a powerful influence over the shape of Palestinian economic
policy, particularly regarding the development of industries which could
compete with Israel's protected markets.
A recent Harvard University report on economic transition recommended the
development of free trade between the Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian
economies as the key to mutual economic growth.
It recommended that Palestinians assume leadership and utilise the
institutions of Israel's civil administration in the territories, harmonise
the tax structure with Israel and introduce the Jordanian dinar as legal
tender.

FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Shocked Palestinians question price of deal
 -Arafat takes the biggest gamble of his life

MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the man
who has consistently amazed enemies and followers alike with his ability to
survive internal and external threats, is taking the biggest gamble of his
life.
By defying the opposition of segments of the Palestinian leadership to an
historic agreement with Israel, Mr Arafat is putting at stake his
credibility, his constituency and, perhaps, his life. At risk, many critics
believe, may be the very survival of the PLO and a united Palestinian quest
for what they consider their national rights.
Mr Arafat's decision to do a deal with Israel without consulting either the
main Palestinian decision-making bodies or other Arab participants to the
peace talks, shows that he and his confidants have decided to take the
Palestinian negotiations with Israel into their own hands.
The PLO chairman has been under considerable pressure to accommodate Israeli
demands, not only politically from some Arab states and the US but also by
virtue of the PLO's ruinous financial state. Yet, according to some of his
colleagues, rather than being concerned over concessions made, he is
euphoric over having finally got the Israeli government to negotiate
directly with the PLO.
But in many Palestinian eyes, Mr Arafat is paying a dear price for attaining
de facto Israeli recognition. It appears to entail his approval to postpone
negotiations over the status of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories.
Two prominent members of the Palestinian delegation, Ms Hanan Ashrawi and Mr
Saeb Erekat, indicated in statements yesterday in Washington that from now
on the PLO should take complete responsibility for the consequences of its
agreement with Israel.
Privately, many members of the delegation - which was hand-picked by the PLO
 -have repeatedly complained that Mr Arafat was not serious about the
Washington negotiations, except as a vehicle to compel the Israelis to talk
directly to the PLO, and for the US to resume its dialogue with the
organisation.
Such a view is gaining ground among Palestinian opponents who fear Mr Arafat
could now be forced to accept Israeli conditions which would, in their view,
strip from the PLO its historic role as the embodiment of Palestinian
national rights.
Such an argument highlights the difficulty inherent in Mr Arafat winning
recognition.
Central to this dilemma is Israel's apparent condition that the PLO modify
the Palestinian Charter, which calls for the liberation of all the lands
considered as Palestinian - a clause which has long been synonymous with a
call for the destruction of Israel.
To effect such changes, Mr Arafat would have to convene the Palestine
National Council (PNC), the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, something which
would, in turn, risk raising opposition within this broad body to any
participation in the negotiating process.
Other apparent Israeli conditions for recognition could prove stiffer still
to enact: a public renunciation of armed struggle, and the dropping of
demands for the repatriation and compensation of Palestinian refugees
displaced in 1948.
Mr Arafat is trying to sidestep the first condition by arguing that by
renouncing terrorism, as the PLO did in 1988, and by joining the peace
process, the PLO has already delivered this condition. But it far harder to
see how the PLO could issue a statement abandoning the rights of the 1948
refugees in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and Jordan.

THE plan for Palestinian self-rule foresees a permanent accord based on
Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands, according to versions of the draft
text, AP reports.
An elected Palestinian council would govern Jericho and Gaza for a
transitional period of no more than five years. The council will have some
legislative powers, and would be elected within nine months after the
agreement takes effect. A permanent accord would follow.
Within two months of the agreement becoming effective the two sides will
sign a deal on withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated Palestinian areas
in Gaza and Jericho, to be completed within four months. Talks on the
permanent status of the territories are to start no later than the beginning
of the third year of the interim period.

FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Settlers and Jericho Arabs cautious over
'first step'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Moshav (co-operative farm) of Na'ma - one of Israel's many settlements
in the occupied West Bank - lies in the floor of the sun-baked Jordan
Valley. The pre-fabricated houses, many unoccupied, and the empty plots of
ploughed earth bear witness to the desolate and temporary nature of Israel's
settlement policy in such a barren area.
If the Gaza-Jericho peace plan between Israel and Palestinians is signed in
Washington this week Israeli troops will withdraw from an enclave around
Jericho, a small, ancient dusty town of cafes, fruit stalls and curio shops
strewn with Pepsi-Cola bunting.
The 25 families who live in Na'ma, wedged in the middle of the future
Palestinian-controlled territory, will become guinea pigs for a new form of
co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians after decades of mistrust and
bloodshed.
'We are going to be the test here in Na'ma,' said Mrs Ana Meller a Russian
immigrant who has lived eight years on the farm. 'In the past five years
there has been a lot of hatred between us and the Arabs. Each time I took my
workers to the fields I was afraid they were going to stab me. I don't want
to live like this any more. We must change.'
Like Mrs Meller, many farmer-settlers in the Jericho area are supporters of
the Labour party, which leads Israel's coalition government, and their farm
is subsidised by the Labour movement. They moved to the Jordan Valley
largely because of economic incentives offered by previous governments. They
are not fanatical Zionists. A vast majority support the Gaza-Jericho plan,
despite fears about what the future may hold.
'If this is the price we have to pay so that my children don't have to go to
fight wars like I did and my father did and my grandfather did then its
okay,' said Mr Eyal Levi, a vegetable farmer living at Na'ma. 'Our main
problem is security. We just don't know what is going to happen. Just
yesterday we were enemies and tomorrow we will be brothers. We will have to
see what will happen. Maybe there will be a problem, maybe not. We hope
not.'
The Gaza-Jericho plan allows for continued existence of Na'ma and other
settlements whose agriculture depends on the underground springs running
through Jericho. Mr Levi and most of the settlers near Jericho would like to
stay after the Palestinians take control.
But Mr Levi and Mrs Meller say that if the security situation deteriorates
they are prepared to take government compensation and leave Na'ma.
Not all West Bank settlers are as moderate. A small minority in Na'ma -
supporters of the religious Tsomet party - threatened yesterday to burn
their houses if they were forced one day to leave.
A more fanatical Jewish group - aligned to the right-wing National Religious
party - has started a sit-in at the site of a sixth century synagogue on the
outskirts of Jericho.
'There was a Jewish community here 1,500 years ago and I think this land
belongs to the Israel nation,' said Mr Yaron Benzvi, a member of the Jericho
Yeshiva - a religious study group. 'This land was promised to the Jews by
God. We don't believe the government will give up Jericho. We want the
Jewish to wake up and make it not happen. Taking Jewish people out of this
land is going against God.'
Mr Benzvi represents a very small minority. Extremism in Jericho, however,
is not confined to the Jewish community. The Islamic fundamentalist Hamas
movement - which rejects talking peace with Israel - called a strike
yesterday to protest against the accord. Most shopkeepers ignored the call.
But in the poorer sections of Jericho businessmen closed their
graffiti-covered shutters.
Islamic extremism thrives in the economically decimated occupied-Gaza Strip
but is less strong in Jericho. Most of the Palestinians in Jericho yesterday
cautiously welcomed the peace deal. They hope the agreement will be followed
by aid inflows and investment to boost an economy dependent on farming and
tourists visiting the site of Christ's Baptism or the Mount of Temptation
where Jesus was said to have fasted for 40 days after his baptism.
'We see this as a first step towards peace,' said Mr Isaac Shawar, a grocer
who opened his shop yesterday. 'But this step must be followed by other
steps returning all occupied Palestinian lands. We want to live a better
life. Jews and Moslems were friends for centuries. My family used to live in
Beersheva next to Jews as brothers. The problems only started in 1948 and if
the problems are undone, maybe we can live like that again.'

FT  01 SEP 93 / EBRD risks criticism for Slovak loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering a
Dollars 125m (Pounds 84.4m) investment in a new aluminium smelter at Ziar
nad Hronom in Slovakia to replace the present high-pollution plant.
The investment, involving the first big loan since the resignation of Mr
Jacques Attali as head of the bank, is bound to create some controversy.
There is substantial over-capacity in the aluminium industry at present and
the republic has no bauxite - raw material for aluminium - and no source of
cheap energy for what is an energy-intensive process.
However, the bank suggests there would be only a marginal increase in
Europe's primary aluminium production capacity because two existing lines,
producing 70,000 tonnes a year, would be shut down to make way for the new
smelter, which would produce 108,500-132,000 tonnes annually. It also claims
the operating costs of the new smelter would be 'well within the lowest
third of all smelters' because of the technology employed and because of low
labour costs - about Dollars 120-Dollars 150 a tonne lower than the average
for the industry worldwide.
Aluminium prices are currently near their lowest levels but the bank says
that even if they drop further the smelter company would remain competitive.
If, as expected, prices recovered in the medium term, the company would be
highly profitable, enabling it to clean up past pollution and enabling ZSNP,
the state company which owns the existing metallurgical complex, to be
privatised.
If the bank's board approves, it would lend up to Dollars 110m and take an
equity investment of Dollars 15m in Slovalco, a new company established
specifically for the project, and which would employ 500 people. This would
give the bank 10 per cent of the issued capital but 20 per cent of the
votes.
Hydro Aluminium, a subsidiary of Norway's Norsk Hydro, which is supplying
key smelter technology, would also invest Dollars 15m for a 10 per cent
stake.
ZSNP, which would own the rest of Slovalco, has been producing alumina, an
intermediate material, aluminium and some aluminium products such as door
and window frames since 1953 and currently employs 6,000 people.
The plant started to replace its old smelters in 1986. However, it ran out
of money when the project was 65 per cent complete. The bank points out that
not completing the new smelter would probably result in a write-off of the
Dollars 185m already spent, with no possibility for local banks or the
National Property Fund to recover their investments in the project.
ZSNP would never be in a position to repay its existing debt and 'it would
result in the cessation of an industrial activity in which the Slovaks have
built over 40 years significant expertise and for which all the necessary
infrastructure is in place'.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Gap shrinks between Serbs and Moslems

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Serbs and Moslems appeared to be inching closer towards a settlement
yesterday after officials announced that Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian
president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, had agreed
to a ceasefire and an early prisoner exchange.
The moves are part of a five-point plan agreed by the two yesterday,
including establishment of a communications hot-line between Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, and Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold 10 miles to the
east.
The announcement came after the leaders of the three warring parties held
separate sessions as the Geneva peace talks resumed after an 11-day break.
Earlier in the day Mr Izetbegovic had criticised the proposed map for a
peace settlement as 'unfair'. But, after meeting his Bosnian Serb
adversaries, they agreed to order a ceasefire, according to Mr Nikola
Koljevic, a Bosnian Serb official.
The five-point plan was hailed as a positive sign for the future of wider
negotiations on an overall Bosnia peace accord.
In an attempt to increase pressure on the Moslem delegation, Lord Owen, the
EC's peace envoy, warned Mr Izetbegovic yesterday that renewed fighting
between Serb and Moslem forces would pose 'real dangers that the Serb forces
will cut the country in two'.
Bosnian Serbs have accepted the 'peace package' but refuse to make any more
concessions to the mainly Moslem republic which, under the plan, will form a
'union' along with the Croat and Serb republics. But wedged between the two
ethnic states, the Moslems fear that they will be at the mercy of their
foes.
Mr Izetbegovic's delegation wants restoration of key territory in eastern
Bosnia and the town of Prijedor, north-western Bosnia, which were mainly
Moslem before the war, when Serb forces seized control. They want access
roads to Neum, a fishing village on the Adriatic as well as connecting the
isolated eastern enclaves.
The Bosnian delegation has also demanded stronger international guarantees
that the plan will be enforced. Serb forces used the 1992 Vance peace plan
in Croatia to consolidate their territorial gains.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, today in Geneva amid signs that the allies are
stepping up their military plans for a deployment.
The international mediators had originally indicated that 40,000 extra
troops would be needed to police a partition.
But Nato officials in Brussels warned that the alliance was a long way from
making a firm commitment on troop numbers.
Meanwhile, in Mostar a UN protection force yesterday finally succeeded in
leaving the city, after it had been trapped there for several days by Moslem
demonstrators. The Moslems had refused to let the troops leave, fearing
their departure would trigger a fresh assault by the Croat forces, who have
been besieging the city for more than two months.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Bank may lose control over Russia budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is to set up a federal treasury, which could act as a
substitute for the central bank in the key area of budget implementation and
control.
The idea of creating a parallel structure which would take over the crucial
budgetary functions of the central bank has been long mooted. It has a legal
foundation in a decree signed last December by President Boris Yeltsin. Now,
according to reports in the daily Kommersant and the Interfax news agency,
the project is well advanced.
Kommersant said the treasury would 'supervise all operations which have to
do with budgetary resources' and would be 'like a bank, with government
funds being paid in and out'. It would be under the control of a deputy
finance minister, with its headquarters within the Finance Ministry, offices
in the regions and republics, and branches at district and city level.
As well as depriving the central bank of one of its main functions - that of
crediting budget expenditure - the government also plans to reduce
parliament's authority over the budget to merely confirming it once it has
been presented by the president.
The aim is to address the problem of the central bank authorising greater
expenditure than that provided for in the government budget. But it would do
so through the classic Russian method of sidestepping a problem by creating
a new organisation to deal with it.
Mr Yeltsin has vetoed a banking law passed by parliament in July which
ordered the central bank to review licences already granted to a handful of
foreign banks, including Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Dresdner Bank
and the Bank of China, on the grounds that it put 'unjust' limits on them.
The final 30 soldiers at Russia's last military base in Lithuania left their
barracks yesterday and headed for Kaunas railway station on their way home
from the Baltic state, Reuter reports.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Divided Ukraine sinks into 'hyper-depression': The patient
awaiting emergency treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 10 months Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, an energetic economist in his thirties,
tirelessly preached the twin gospel of fiscal restraint and privatisation to
his conservative colleagues in the Ukrainian cabinet. As Ukraine's soaring
inflation rate and sluggish privatisation programme attest, Mr Pynzenyk's
advice usually fell on deaf ears. On Friday, he gave up.
In an emotional live television address Mr Pynzenyk resigned from his post
as deputy prime minister responsible for economic policy, declaring that the
possibilities for introducing market reforms in the second-largest former
Soviet republic had been exhausted. He said the economy was 'catastrophic'.
Mr Pynzenyk was not resorting to the hyperbole beloved of resigning
politicians.
'Ukraine has entered a qualitatively new stage, which is unprecedented in
economic history. I call it hyper-depression,' said Mr Daniel Kaufmann, head
of the World Bank mission to Ukraine.
And yesterday Mr Leonid Kuchma, the prime minister, presented parliament
with an emergency programme of anti-inflationary measures to prevent the
total collapse of the financial system and warned of 'tragedy' ahead.
Mr Kuchma called for the centralisation of all power in the government's
hands, including control of the central bank.
'Emergency economic measures are absolutely vital,' he said. 'All of eastern
Europe has gone through crisis. It is difficult to change a shovel into a
computer.'
Inflation is more than 50 per cent a month, which has pushed the value of
the coupon from 2,000 to the dollar in March to nearly 6,000 in mid-August,
at a time when the Russian rouble has begun to appreciate against the
dollar.
On top of home-grown hyper-inflation - fueled by a policy of issuing credits
to agriculture and industry which have already exceeded the total gross
national product predicted by the government at the beginning of the year -
Ukraine has a balance of payments crisis, triggered by Russia's shift to
world prices for the oil and gas upon which it has traditionally been
dependent. Mr Kuchma predicts that by the end of the year the country's
trade deficit will exceed Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
In the second weekend of August Mr Kuchma was on the telephone at 10 o'clock
at night anxiously trying to reach the Russian prime minister to persuade
him to turn on the oil taps. Russia, which is owed Rbs850bn for oil it has
already supplied to Ukraine, cut off all supplies for the first 10 days of
August.
Informed that the Russian prime minister was en route to his dacha and could
not come to the telephone, a beleaguered Mr Kuchma described Ukraine's
economic predicament as 'a catastrophe'. (For the time being Russia has
resumed supplying oil to Ukraine, but future supplies are uncertain.)
'With this combination of economic problems, Ukraine has only two choices:
intended or unintended adjustment,' says Mr Kaufmann. Unless the government
adopts radical reforms soon, 'the likelihood of a significant economic
implosion is very high'.
The only good news is that the Ukrainian government, which has been
paralysed by internal divisions, has at last begun to grasp the seriousness
of the crisis, although it is clearly still divided over what to do about
it.
Ukrainian leaders hope they will manage to soften the economic blow by
persuading Russia - perhaps by dint of concessions over, for instance, the
Black Sea fleet - to back off from its plan to raise oil prices, currently
Dollars 80 a tonne, to Dollars 100 a tonne on January 1 1994. However,
pragmatists in the Ukrainian government doubt Russia can be dissuaded from
the shift to world prices, which the International Monetary Fund has
encouraged.
Meanwhile, Mr Kuchma's emergency plan will be hard to sell in cities such as
Kharkiv, where massive defence enterprises such as the Malyshev factory,
which built the Soviet Union's most advanced tanks but has had no military
orders for more than two years, are accustomed to surviving solely on
government subsidies.
Kharkiv's 'red directors' spent a tempestuous two-hour meeting with Mr
Kuchma recently railing against 'privatisation, commercialisation and
corporatisation, which have given us nothing' and urging the prime minister
to adopt a 'market' strategy 'based not on market forces but on the state'.
Kharkiv's industrialists do not lack sympathisers in the Ukrainian cabinet,
which earlier this month seriously debated one deputy prime minister's
proposal to return to central planning. But Mr Kuchma, himself the former
director of a missilefactory, warned his erstwhile colleagues that 'I must
underscore that in our programme there will not be a single element which
calls for a return to the command-administrative system'.
Mr Kuchma's plans could also be thwarted by President Leonid Kravchuk, who
is locked in a long-running political battle with his prime minister, and a
parliament dominated by ex-communists.
The only green shoot in the Ukrainian economic landscape - and the element
which could relieve Mr Kuchma's fear that Ukraine risks becoming 'a second
Yugoslavia' - is the booming agricultural sector.
Ukrainian farmers are reaping a bumper harvest, expected to exceed 40m
tonnes of grain. Unlike last year, when the government purchase price was
less than a twentieth of world rates, this summer the Ukrainian government
has been paying close to 80 per cent of the world price and farmers are
responding by selling enough to the state to ensure that Ukrainian cities
will not go hungry this winter.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Walloon protest flags Belgium's cultural divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AT 8am today a socialist member of the European parliament will hang a
black-bordered Walloon flag outside a town hall in eastern Belgium.
Mr Jose Happart's symbolic gesture is not a belated expression of grief at
the death a month ago of Belgium's much loved King Baudouin. He is mourning
the day, 30 years ago, when the Belgian government laid down the linguistic
frontier between French-speaking Walloons in the south, and Dutch-speaking
Flemings in the north.
Belgium's deep linguistic scars, which the late king often had to soothe,
run across the small cluster of villages where Mr Happart will stage his
protest - the Fourons, or, in Dutch, Voeren.
Equidistant from Maastricht in the Netherlands, Aachen in Germany and Liege
in Wallonia, most of the villages' 4,200 inhabitants speak a Germanic
dialect. Two-thirds also consider themselves French-speakers. But, in 1963,
it was decided that for administrative purposes the villages, instead of
staying in Wallonia, would become part of Flanders.
The francophone Happart family has been at the centre of resistance to that
decision, fighting for the right to French culture through the Action
Fouronnaise campaign. Recently, the tension has only come to the surface in
tame rows about which regional flag to hoist over the town hall. During the
1970s and early 1980s, however, the villages were caught up in violent
demonstrations between Walloon and Flemish militants. The Fourons/Voeren
problem was blamed for the collapse of several national coalitions.
Mr Happart and his allies claim that their constant pressure for special
treatment of the villages helped shape the recent constitutional reforms in
Belgium, which devolved more powers to the country's regional authorities.
But he warns: 'Every time there's an inter-institutional solution for the
rest of Belgium, people say the Fourons is no longer a problem. But there
isn't yet an acceptable solution, so whether it's in the short or medium
term, the problem is bound to erupt again.'
The French-speakers' blunt demand that the villages be returned to Wallonia,
however, seems to have been scaled back. In an interview with the
francophone daily, Le Soir, published yesterday, Mr Nico Droeven,
French-speaking mayor of the Fourons, said he could accept geographical
membership of Flanders, provided inhabitants had the right to choose between
Flemish or Walloon administrations.
Recent months have seen a surge in the national movement against separatism.
But with several Flemish politicians still openly backing independence for
Flanders, Mr Happart's protest will act as a warning to Belgium's new king,
Albert II, and the country's fragile centre-left coalition government that
they will have to work hard to keep Belgians together.

FT  01 SEP 93 / West putting east out of business: Germany's recession is
making internal competition fiercer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENTLY high production costs in eastern Germany are preventing the
region's companies from competing with their western counterparts and are
contributing to a high rate of insolvencies, according to a survey by the
Halle Institute for Economic Forecasting (IWH).
A survey of 300 eastern enterprises shows how the recession in western
Germany is encouraging companies there to compete for new markets in the
east of the country. Faced with 'this aggressive price policy', the east is
finding it impossible to compete because of its high production costs.
The latter are a result of unrealistically high wages in eastern Germany.
These are currently around 80 per cent of western levels, and will reach
parity by 1996, despite productivity levels which are lagging behind western
Lander, or states, by as much as 70 per cent in some sectors.
Many enterprises bought or set up by local, west German or foreign investors
have been cushioned from the effects of high wage costs by investment
subsidies.
Nevertheless, the level of insolvencies suggests that a stable and expanding
market is far from certain.
For instance, the IWH survey shows that private businesses have chosen to
concentrate on the local market, even for services. What is not clear is at
what point this market becomes saturated or, indeed, if the goods produced
will ever be competitive enough to gain a niche in the export sector.
More than 1,185 insolvencies were recorded in 1992 and had already reached
that level half way through this year. The rise reflects the end of the
consumer boom as indicated by the sharp rise in personal savings. For the
first six months of this year, savings rose by nearly DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn),
or 4.5 per cent, compared to the same period last year.
Insolvencies were most marked in construction, the main growth sector in
eastern Germany. The percentage of insolvencies was 30 per cent above the
1992 level.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Danish budget to bolster jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Danish government yesterday presented the most expansive budget in
decades in an attempt to shave a percentage point off the unemployment rate
of 12.1 per cent by the end of next year.
The draft 1994 budget will pump an extra DKr12bn (Pounds 1.1bn), equivalent
to about 1.4 per cent of 1993 GDP, into the economy through a combination of
tax cuts and increased expenditure.
The government predicts its fiscal policy will contribute to an increase in
real GDP of 2.9 per cent in 1994, compared with growth of only 0.2 per cent
this year. But the move will boost inflation, according to forecasts, with
the average rise in consumer prices increasing from 1.3 per cent in 1993 to
3 per cent next year.
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, Social Democratic finance minister in the centre-left
coalition, said the budget represented 'a responsible policy'. The
government of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was determined to cut unemployment.
Mr Lykketoft, who was presenting his first budget to the media yesterday
(the Folketing does not reassemble until October), described the easing of
fiscal policy as 'temporary'.
'Under no circumstances will we start out on a slide which can put the
surplus on the current balance of payments in danger or threaten the
stability of the exchange rate,' he said.
The current account returned to surplus in 1990 after 26 consecutive years
of deficit. The estimated surplus of DKr27bn this year equals 3.1 per cent
of GDP.
Referring to the importance of lower interest rates to stimulate employment,
Mr Lykketoft called for a return to a stable monetary system in Europe
following the recent chaos in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Private consumption next year is expected by the government to increase by
3.9 per cent and business investment, which has declined for three
consecutive years, by 6.5 per cent. The government hopes this will bring
unemployment down for the first time since 1986 from a 1993 average of 12.1
per cent, up from 11.1 per cent last year.
The stimulus elements of the budget package arise from a cut in net taxes
and social insurance revenue by DKr6bn, including a reduction of DKr19.3bn
in income taxes, following reform which went through the Folketing this
summer.
New expenditure of DKr6.3bn includes DKr3bn for infrastructure investments.
Total budget expenditure will increase by 7 per cent to DKr388.9bn from
DKr363.3bn this year, while revenue will increase by 8 per cent to
DKr333.2bn from DKr307.5bn, leaving the deficit virtually unchanged at
DKr55.7bn, about 6 per cent of GDP.
The total government sector financial deficit, including local government,
is increasing, rising from 22.1 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 38.2 per cent
this year and a government-forecast 44.6 per cent of GDP in 1994.

FT  01 SEP 93 / VW accusation over Opel secrets affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADAM OPEL is doing everything it can to prevent a 'factual' discussion of
its industrial espionage allegations against Volkswagen executives, while
fuelling rumours aimed at destabilising the Wolfsburg group, VW charged
yesterday.
Volkswagen employees might also be involved in spreading false stories and
media manipulation, in which Opel 'played a role', according to Mr Otto
Ferdinand Wachs, a VW spokesman.
Mr Wachs was responding to a newspaper report, promptly denied by the legal
authorities yesterday, that public prosecutors were considering arresting Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production director at the centre of
the row between the two automotive groups.
"Interested parties' - which did not include the prosecutors' office, Mr
Wachs stressed - might also have an interest in unsettling members of VW's
supervisory board, due to meet on Friday to hear a progress report on an
independent internal investigation of the allegations.
Meanwhile, Mr Lopez has cancelled at short notice a talk he was to have
delivered to a meeting of FDP Liberal Democrat MPs in Nuremberg this week.
It is understood he was urged to do so for fear of compromising efforts to
bring Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, to the negotiating table with Mr
Ferdinand Piech, VW head.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Bonn economics minister, who is trying to arrange a
meeting, is a senior FDP member; Mr Otto Lambsdorff, former party chairman,
is a member of the VW board of supervisors.
According to Mr Wachs, Mr Herman had shown 'no interest at all' in meeting
Mr Piech after further efforts by Mr Rexrodt last Thursday. 'Opel always
diverts the discussion with new arguments,' he said.
It was a great shame; Mr Rexrodt was trying to do his best for both
companies, he added, while admitting VW had most interest in a 'gentler'
process because it was suffering most from the affair.
According to legal experts, arrest warrants in such cases may be issued only
if there is reason to believe a suspected person may flee or commit a crime
such as obstruction of the course of justice.
'Where can Lopez go?' asked a spokesman for the criminal investigators,
noting that as a result of the publicity surrounding the case he had become
as recognisable as Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Opel officials could not be reached for comment.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Boost in view for French television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Balladur government is planning to give France's audiovisual industry a
regulatory and financial boost in an attempt to stem mounting competition
from the US.
The moves, according to Mr Alain Carignon, France's communications minister,
will include freer investment rules and easier licence renewal for France's
three main private TV stations, permission for French or European-made
programmes (as distinct from imports from Hollywood) to be interrupted more
frequently by advertising breaks, and the appointment of France's current
envoy to the UN to be its 'audiovisual ambassador' in the Gatt talks.
Mr Carignon complained this week that Britain had not incorporated recent EC
legislation recommending intra-Community broadcasters carry a majority of
EC-made programmes on their airwaves, into its rules on cable and satellite
transmission. He warned France might take Britain, which has authorised
broadcasts by the TNT and Cartoon satellite channels from September 17, to
the European Court of Justice.
His officials estimate that allowing the TF1 and M6 private TV stations to
increase the number of advertising breaks in French or EC-made programmes
from one to two would earn them an extra FFr200m (Pounds 22.7m) a year. The
French government already directly pays French feature film-makers nearly
FFr1bn a year, and local TV programme makers over FFr 700m a year.
The minister plans to present legislation this autumn to raise from 25 to 50
per cent the ceiling on a single shareholder's investment in private TV
stations. The government does not intend to privatise the state-owned France
2 and 3 channels. It aims, from autumn 1994, to put a station broadcasting
training skills to France's 3m jobless on the airwaves once occupied by the
La Cinq channel.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Ministers favour sale of British Coal in five sections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale in five separate sections under
proposals favoured for adoption by the government.
The latest plans were drawn up in the face of strong opposition by British
Coal, which wants the sale in one or two parts to give the industry a strong
negotiating position in dealing with the electricity generators, its main
customers.
Ministers want to inject maximum competition into the marketplace. They are
expected to announce plans for privatisation in the next month, although
details of any break-up have yet to be finalised.
Under the favoured proposals the five sections would be based around
Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the north-east of England, Scotland and Wales.
The two largest chunks would be Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
The other three areas would each have only a small number of deep mines  -
British Coal has only one pit left in Scotland. The smaller areas will be
sweetened for the private sector by the inclusion of open-cast operations.
The north-east sector, for example, could include the Stabswood open-cast
site in Northumberland.
The proposed division into five units will please private-sector companies,
such as RJB Mining, which have been lobbying for a break-up. In Scotland
there is strong support for the country's coal resources to be broken off
from the rest of British Coal.
It is believed ministers will not place restrictions on how many sections
each private-sector company can bid for. This opens up the possibility that
a large part of British Coal will be owned by one company after
privatisation.
Decisions on the number of mines to be closed before privatisation have
still to be made. Few analysts believe more than 15 British Coal pits are
viable in the long term. It is thought that private-sector operators will
have to match terms and conditions offered by British Coal.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Euro Disney considers rights issue to raise funds
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, plagued by financial problems since the opening of its theme
park outside Paris in April last year, is considering a rights issue as a
way of reviving its fortunes.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment company
which is its largest shareholder, stressed in an interview with the
Financial Times that the financial restructuring of Euro Disney was still at
a preparatory stage and the two companies had not yet decided on the final
package. Euro Disney announced in July it needed to restructure its
finances.
The group is expected by analysts to make a net loss of more than FFr1.8bn
(Pounds 200m) in the financial year which ends this month, up from a loss of
FFr188m last year. Its net debt has risen from FFr18.5bn to FFr20.3bn in
this financial year.
Euro Disney's shares closed last night down 45 centimes at FFr59.95. Floated
in 1989, they have fallen 63 per cent since a record high of FFr164.30 in
March 1992.

FT  01 SEP 93 / LWT's millionaires asked to pass the hat round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW millionaires of London Weekend Television have been asked to pass
the hat round for their less fortunate colleagues.
Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of the London ITV company, has asked 52 other
managers who have together netted shares worth Pounds 70m in a controversial
management share scheme to donate voluntarily a proportion of their profits
for distribution to the other 700 LWT employees.
Mr Dyke, who yesterday sold 211,000 of his total of just under 1.5m shares
worth nearly Pounds 7m, has written to his managerial colleagues pointing
out how fortunate they have been and asking for donations.
Mr Dyke has suggested that amounts ranging from 4p a share for modest
managerial beneficiaries to 14p a share for those in the millionaire class,
be offered.
If all 53 managers respond to Mr Dyke's suggestion it would raise a total of
Pounds 1.556m or 2.2 per cent of the total for distribution to employees not
invited to take part in the management share scheme.
More than 550 LWT employees signed a petition calling for a proportion of
the profits to go to them. The petition was never handed in after an
informal warning that this would jeopardise any chance of staff being given
a share.
One of the 52 who received the confidential letter from Mr Dyke said: 'It's
a good idea at the end of the day but I'm not sure everybody is over the
moon about it.'
The proposal has the support of both Mr Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland, the
LWT chairman who would donate shares worth Pounds 250,000 out of his total
worth more than Pounds 9m. Other leading beneficiaries such as arts
controller Melvyn Bragg have been sounded out about the scheme.
The LWT managers together put up Pounds 3m to buy management shares as part
of a company restructuring. After it retained its broadcasting licence and
cut costs, a four-for-one share issue was triggered by the ITV company's
share price staying above 278p for the 20 days since the company reported
its half-year financial results on July 29. The average price over the
period turned out to be 470.4p.
Yesterday a total of 3.9m shares were sold by the managers at 458p,
equivalent to 3.78 per cent of the ordinary shares. The LWT share price
closed yesterday at 465p.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Palestinians split on peace plan: Leaders in occupied
territories want talks on future of east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS within the Palestinian movement over a proposed peace agreement
with Israel widened yesterday as Israel started a further round of intense
secret contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Europe.
Senior PLO and Israeli officials continued to insist that a historic
agreement on Palestinian self-rule would be signed within two weeks. But
Palestinian negotiators from within the Israeli-occupied territories raised
serious objections to the deal.
The agreement provides for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and
West Bank town of Jericho, the handover of the two areas to full Palestinian
authority and a lesser degree of self-rule in the rest of the West Bank.
As the US-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations entered their 11th round
in Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, called the accord
'a conceptual breakthrough'. The European Community also welcomed the deal.
But Iran denounced the agreement as an Israeli bribe to the PLO. Jordan and
Syria were said to be concerned about it and Lebanon became the first Arab
state to make public its reservations.
Mr Mouwafaq al-Allaf, Syria's chief negotiator in Washington, accepted that
progress between Israel and the Palestinians would boost peace talks. His
optimism about an Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was echoed by Mr Itamar
Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria.
However, Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian political figure in the
occupied territories, yesterday insisted Israel should drop its refusal to
talk about occupied east Jerusalem. According to Israeli interpretations of
the deal, the PLO has given up its claims over east Jerusalem until final
status talks start two years after the interim period of self-rule begins.
'I cannot accept there will be no talks on the future of Jerusalem for two
years,' Mr Husseini told Liberation, the French newspaper. 'If anyone
believes we Palestinians can do without East Jerusalem, he is completely
mistaken. . . It is the stumbling block in the talks.'
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, also said a lot of details still
had to be worked out and she cautioned against 'getting carried away by
signals and symptoms before we have something really tied down'.
Israel was also last night moving closer to official recognition of the PLO
after a PLO official said the organisation's charter, which calls for the
return of all lands which now make up the Jewish state, was null and void.
Mr Uzi Baram, Israeli labour minister, said PLO recognition could be signed
in tandem with a preliminary peace package. But there were conflicting
signals over the conditions Israel might attach to such recognition.
Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said the PLO would have to drop
clauses from its founding charter which called for violent acts against a
Jewish state. Such a move would be extremely difficult for Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman, to take.
Both Mr Beilin and Mr Arafat said separately the agreement on self-rule
could be implemented within four months. Mr Beilin said Israel and the
Palestinians would establish three tracks of talks to discuss how to
implement the Gaza-Jericho scheme, how to achieve early empowerment of
Palestinians in the remainder of the West Bank, and how to hold Palestinian
elections.
Under the proposed agreement, the Palestinians would run nearly all aspects
of their lives in Gaza and Jericho, including policing the two areas, as
Israelitroops pulled out.
The Foreign Ministry yesterday said Mr Uri Savir, its director-general, had
left for secret talks in Europe with PLO officials to iron out final details
of an agreement and prepare a document for mutual recognition between Israel
and the PLO. Norwegian officials will also attend the talks.
Israeli officials ruled out a signing ceremony between Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat. Meanwhile, an opinion poll in a
Hebrew daily newspaper said 74 per cent of Palestinians supported the plan.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Hospital cleaners lose test case on transfer of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS yesterday welcomed a judgment from the Employment Appeals Tribunal
that appears to halt the progress of regulations which have confused the
contracting-out system for UK public services.
Britain's Transfer of Undertakings - Protection of Employment (Tupe)
regulations, based on the European Community's Acquired Rights Directive,
require that pay and working conditions are protected when jobs are
transferred from one employer to another. In many cases, this has
discouraged private companies from bidding for contracts.
Yesterday Mr Justice Wood, the outgoing president of the appeals tribunal,
upheld an industrial tribunal judgment that 107 cleaners at Orsett Hospital
in Basildon, Essex, were not covered by Tupe when their jobs were
transferred from Initial Health Care Services to the Pall Mall Services
Group. The cleaners' pay was cut as a result of the transfer.
The cleaners' union, Unison, said the judgment would prolong the confusion
about Tupe and threatened to take the case to the European Court of Justice.
According to Ms Melanie Tether, a Tupe expert and a partner of City
solicitors Norton Rose, the judgment runs against the grain of recent
decisions in the UK High Court and at the European Court of Justice.
However, the decision was welcomed by several employers' organisations. Mr
John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and Support Services
Association, said: 'It is very good news which we should be shouting from
the rooftops.'
He said the government should pursue with renewed vigour the attempt to
revise the original EC legislation.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, recently discussed with the new French
government the issue of revising the legislation to exclude contracting-out
from the public sector. France, which has a large programme of privatisation
and contracting-out, is sympathetic to the idea but several other EC
countries are likely to block any change.
The appeals tribunal's main reason for rejecting the claim that Tupe applied
is that only staff were transferred between the two contractors. Lawyers say
that Tupe is more likely to apply where equipment and goodwill are
transferred as well as staff.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Britain's rich see their lives as firmly middle class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY go shopping at Sainsbury, believe themselves to be excluded from
a London or university based upper-class establishment and claim that most
important decisions are taken by men in the family.
The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families published
yesterday at the British Association annual meeting show that many rich
people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
Leicester University, which published the findings, interviewed with
Midlands families deriving fortunes from new and old money. The families,
from landed gentry to captains of industry and commerce, each had at least
Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets. Several were worth tens of millions of
pounds.
Professor John Scott, in charge of the project, said that most of those
interviewed believed themselves to be middle class whatever the size of
their fortune.
Many claimed their biggest extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's
shopping bill or going out for a meal. This was in spite of the fact that
they might own a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Many complained they were excluded from an upper class establishment 'either
because it was London based or because entry depended upon a university
education', said Prof Scott.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities; in the others, almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
told the study: 'It was his dream, my money.'
Businessmen, in spite of their natural desire to hand down their wealth,
displayed a surprising lack of concern about passing on their companies to
their children.
Many took the view that the next generation had the right to pursue its own
path and that their businesses might do better under the control of
non-family members, said Prof Scott.
As a result, many owners planned to sell their businesses when they retired
although landed families were determined to keep their estates intact.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN troops are to be withdrawn from the Baltic republic of Lithuania
today on schedule, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian president, said
yesterday in a national radio address.
A spokesman for Russian Presdent Boris Yeltsin later confirmed the troops'
withdrawal, but refused to say if it would be today.
The normally good relations between Russia and Lithuania were soured earlier
this month when Russia said it would suspend the withdrawal of 2,500 service
personnel and their families because Lithuanian negotiators had insisted on
raising the issue of compensation for damage done since the first Soviet
occupation in 1940. No figure was mentioned, but Lithuanian newspapers
reported that a sum of about Dollars 150bn was mentioned.
Mr Brazauskas said the question of compensation would be 'the object of
further talks' - a formula which appears to have satisfied Moscow.
Russia is in neither the mood nor any condition to make reparations for a
Soviet past it disavows.
Evidence of this came yesterday when Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to Mr
Yeltsin and chairman of a commission to determine events which led up to the
shooting down in 1983 of the South Korean civilian airliner KAL007 over
Soviet airspace, said that the Soviet Union bore no guilt for the incident.
Mr Filatov said pilot error had taken the plane 350 miles off course, deep
into Soviet airspace.
Mr Hong Soon-young, South Korea's deputy foreign minister, said in Seoul
yesterday that his government would reschedule debts owing to South Korea on
cash loans of Dollars 1bn and tied credits of Dollars 470m, on which Russia
has paid only Dollars 12.7m interest from a promised Dollars 36.8m payback.
A further Dollars 1.53bn of a Dollars 3bn aid package extended to the former
Soviet Union in 1990 has been frozen at Russia's request, Mr Hong said.
'They have said the interest rates and other conditions on the South Korean
loans were unfavourable.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the leading magistrate behind Italy's
18-month political corruption investigation, will have to take urgent action
to restore the credibility of his magistrates when he returns to Milan
today.
Deep divisions emerged among magistrates after the revelation last week that
Mr Marcello Stefanini, treasurer of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS),
the former Communist Party (PCI), had been told he was under investigation
for alleged corruption and illegal political funding.
The PDS has consistently denied involvement in the bribes which have tainted
almost all Italy's big political parties.
Two magistrates argued on newspaper front pages over whether investigators
had deliberately held back from pursuing allegations against the PDS and the
Communists.
Ms Tiziana Parenti, the magistrate investigating the PDS, complained she had
been isolated by her colleagues.
The interview provoked a sharp response from Mr Gerardo d'Ambrosio, Milan's
assistant public attorney, who has been running matters in Mr Borrelli's
absence on holiday. Mr d'Ambrosio played down the allegations against Mr
Stefanini, a PDS senator who was treasurer of the Communist Party before its
metamorphosis into the PDS.
Mr Stefanini was alleged to have been the intended recipient of L621m
(Dollars 390,000) paid by Calcestruzzi, the building materials subsidiary of
the Ferruzzi group, to Mr Primo Greganti, a former PCI official. The money
was alleged to have been a bribe in return for contracts won by Calcestruzzi
from the Enel electricity generating authority.
While not denying the existence of the Swiss bank account into which the
money was paid, Mr Greganti, arrested this year, has consistently denied the
cash was for the PCI.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (16): Dr. Teh's rapid rise - Company
profile: ENG hardware engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE physician Teh Ah Ba set up ENG hardware engineering in 1974, with
just MDollars 500 (Dollars 200). Last month, the ENG group was listed on the
second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation
of around MDollars 120m.
In less than 20 years, the group has established itself as one of Penang's
leading computer components and precision engineering suppliers, employing
250 people in a MDollars 20m purpose-built factory.
Penang's transformation may have been built on foreign investment, but ENG
is typical of a growing breed of local companies that have flourished in the
wake of the multi-nationals.
'In Malaysia, we are pioneers. If we see a challenge, we meet it,' says
Alfred Teh, group executive director and son of the founder. But it is the
scale of ENG's success that makes it unusual. Mr Teh believes that at least
part of the reason for that has been his father's determination to prove
that a physician can succeed as an industrialist.
Teh Ah Ba still works in the medical profession today, although mostly on a
charity basis. Manufacturing, not medicine, has long since been the elder
Teh's main career.
He saw his chance with the arrival in Penang of the multi-national
semiconductor producers in the early 1970s. 'They provided the market for
local producers. It was up to local producers to match up, in terms of
investment and quality,' says Alfred Teh.
'That was our mission - man, method, money and market, that is what you
need, and we had them.'
In a climate of strong government encouragement of local sourcing, ENG began
in a small way, by servicing the multinationals' needs for engineered spares
and parts. But it quickly developed into something of a specialist as a
vendor to the semiconductor industry, concentrating on high-tech strong
carbine tooling and machining, and robotic automated systems.
By the mid-1980s, 30 per cent of ENG's sales revenue was coming from direct
exports: to Hyundai in Korea, Intel in the US and semiconductor assemblers
in Singapore and Thailand. The next target was the disk drive industry.
'We were already meeting the challenges of high value added precision
engineering, and were looking for further diversification. We also wanted to
move from jobbing into manufacturing,' Alfred Teh says.
'We got our first break with Maxtor, of the US, which was assembling disk
drives in Singapore, just an hour away. Then, Maxtor moved to Penang.'
Maxtor was followed by other disk drive manufacturers and support
industries, and ENG had broken into another market.
Since then, it has gone on to become the largest producer of E blocks for
disk drives in Malaysia, and one of the world's top 10 producers, supplying
four of the six leading multi-national disk drive manufacturers.
Growth in the group's sales over the last five years has left little room
for doubt about the scale of this breakthrough. Turnover of MDollars 6.035m
in 1988 had reached MDollars 17.736m by 1992. And with pre-tax profits in
1992 accounting for more than 40 per cent of turnover, and a 'pioneer'
status exempting the group from corporate tax, the group's performance ahead
of its listing was impressive.
Alfred Teh places much of the credit for this success with the family
ownership and style of management, which he says has acted as a strong
binding force.
'But this is a capital-intensive industry. If we wish to develop as the
local equivalent of a multi-national, we must look to the capital markets,'
he says. Another consideration in ENG's decision to go public has been the
political sensitivity attached to the domination of Malaysian business by
the ethnic Chinese. 'As good local Malaysian corporate citizens, we want to
comply with the government plans for the sharing of wealth. It is very fair
that we should structure the company so that it can be shared by the local
Malays,' he says.
Locals are also uppermost in Alfred Teh's thoughts as he grapples with the
labour shortage that has come with Penang's success. 'There is no denying
that it is a problem,' he says.
ENG's solution, at least for now, has been a greater commitment to training.
'Every human resources department must play its part when labour needs to be
as skilled as it is here.'
ENG recruits 20 school leavers a year as apprentice technicians, tending
towards long-term contracts as a means of retaining staff. 'I think in this
respect, as well, we are something of a role model for local industries,' he
says.
Although the group's main thrust to date has been as a vendor company to the
electronics industry, its plans are for further diversification. Its sights
are already set on the aerospace, automotive and telecommunications
industries.
'Our strength from the beginning has been our ability to evolve,' says
Alfred Teh. 'We have one of the best ranges of capital investment in
Malaysia, as well as the design capabilities, for a whole range of
micro-parts. All we need from elsewhere is the end-requirement.'
Even that is an area where ENG sees scope for development. It makes no bones
about its increasing involvement in initiating the development of products
for its customers, and its longer term aims are to attract more
professionals still, so that it can move into the higher-technology end of
the market. 'The point is that we are no longer just selling technical
services, we are selling our brains,' says Alfred Teh.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (17): Malaise in the plantations - Rubber
and tin have been displaced as the top currency earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT so long ago the price of rubber, tin and timber was the weathervane of
the Malaysian economy. Price rises and falls on the international market
determined Malaysia's overall economic health. Commodity traders represented
a powerful group, at the very centre of the country's economic activity. Not
any more.
Rapid industrialisation, particularly over the past five years, has
dramatically changed the structure of the Malaysian economy.
In the early 1970s agriculture, forestry and mining (including the petroleum
sector) accounted for about 80 per cent of the value of Malaysia's exports.
As recently as 1987 commodities and mining made up 55 per cent of export
values.
In 1992 manufactured goods accounted for 70 per cent of the total value of
exports. At the same time agricultural goods (including timber) slumped to
17.4 per cent of the value of exports.
Malaysia's manufacturing sector continues to achieve double digit growth
rates. Last year overall manufacturing output rose 10.5 per cent (13.9 per
cent in 1991).
Agriculture, forestry and fishing accounted for 16.3 per cent of total GDP
in 1992, down from 17.2 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile,
manufacturing's share of total GDP rose to nearly 29 per cent last year,
compared with 27 per cent in 1991.
For the industrialists times are good. But things have been increasingly
tough on the plantations.
International prices for many of Malaysia's commodities have failed to keep
pace with increased production costs. Investors are turning to the
relatively short term gains and opportunities offered by the industrial and
commercial sectors, rather than wait for years for returns from the
plantation sector.
Most seriously growing labour shortage problems are imposing serious
constraints on agriculture: workers are migrating to jobs in urban areas. In
many country areas production is falling with smallholders abandoning their
crops.
Malaysia was once the world's leading natural rubber producer. But in recent
years Thailand and Indonesia have both surpassed Malaysia in output terms.
In 1992 Malaysia produced 1.2m tonnes of natural rubber, a 3 per cent drop
on the previous year and the fourth consecutive year of falling output.
(Malaysia's 1992 output represented 22 per cent of total world production).
World natural rubber prices have been falling since the late 1980s. Rising
wage and land rates mean that Malaysia cannot compete with lower cost
producers such as Indonesia.
While Malaysia has made significant advances in mechanisation techniques,
thousands of foreign workers have to be employed to take the place of locals
who have opted for more comfortable - and better paid - jobs in the cities.
Several rubber plantations and smallholders have either converted their
lands to other more remunerative crops or they are selling it for real
estate development and golf courses. Others have transferred operations
overseas: Malaysian rubber planters are now investigating making investments
in plantations in Vietnam.
Malaysia, faced with the decline of a crop once at the heart of its economy,
has been at the forefront of efforts to negotiate a new international price
mechanism for natural rubber. 'We must have a new price structure,' says Mr
Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister for primary industries. 'Consumers cannot
be allowed to dictate prices. We cannot allow ourselves to be trampled on by
the rich and powerful.'
Cocoa, though a less significant crop than natural rubber in export terms,
has suffered a similar fate. Ten years ago Malaysian cocoa growers were
getting more than MDollars 13,000 (Dollars 5100 at present exchange rates)
per tonne for their crop. At one stage last year prices on the international
market dropped to under MDollars 2,000 per tonne.
Malaysia's tin miners have suffered even worse. In 1981 Malaysia was earning
between MDollars 32 and MDollars 34 per kg for its tin exports. In early
August prices on the Kuala Lumpur tin exchange were hovering around the
MDollars 12 per kg mark. With production costs estimated at MDollars 16 per
kg many mines have closed. In 1992 Malaysia's tin production fell by 31 per
cent on the 1991 figure to just over 14,000 tonnes.
Mr Hew See Tong, president of the All Malaya Chinese Mining Association,
says production is likely to fall further. 'The industry is doomed if
current prices and demand continue. Many miners will not be able to sustain
operations.'
The outlook for palm oil is brighter. With generally buoyant prices over the
past two years more land is being turned over to the crop. In 1992 Malaysia
produced 6.3m tonnes of palm oil, accounting for about 55 per cent of total
world output.
But rapidly expanding palm oil production by Indonesia is posing a threat.
Malaysia has to battle to find new export markets: the economic problems of
the former Soviet Union, once a big importer of Malaysia's palm oil (and its
cocoa and tin), has hurt the industry.
But labour shortages are the most serious problem. Mr Borge Bek-Nielsen is a
Dane who has been in the palm oil business in Malaysia since the 1950s and
now oversees operations on 94,000 acres of plantations on the west coast of
peninsular Malaysia.
'Estate workers cost three times as much in Malaysia as in Indonesia. On
some of our estates 70 per cent are foreign workers. Many just come for a
few months, get their training, but then leave for the towns or cities.'
There are those who feel that the government is too focused on the
manufacturing sector and does not pay enough attention to agriculture and
mining. They say the government should provide more facilities in country
areas in order to keep people on the land. A government MDollars 300 levy on
every foreign worker employed on plantations only adds to the financial
problems of the sector.
Commodities still play a vital role in the economy: the agricultural sector
(including timber) still employs 27 per cent of the workforce, compared with
20.5 per cent in manufacturing. The commodity lobbyists say the economy
should not be too overly dependent on one sector - and neglect agriculture.
In 1992 palm oil was one of Malaysia's biggest export items, bringing in
more than MDollars 6bn in revenues.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has no doubt that the move to
industrialise was a wise one. 'Just imagine what would have happened to us
today if we had continued depending on tin and rubber,' says Dr Mahathir.
Plantation owners and smallholders agree. But they warn of problems ahead if
precious natural resources are neglected.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (15): Chips oust snakes - Electronics in
Penang / The state which claims to be the world's top supplier of
semiconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
B BRAUN, the US medical manufacturer, already had four plants in Penang when
it chose to build another next to an ancient temple seething with snakes.
It was the land scarcity born of economic success that prompted the choice,
but it paid off. Eighteen months later the snakes have gone, with the jungle
that they came from, and B Braun is thriving.
But then, to thrive in Penang is not exceptional. The state claims it is the
world's leading exporter of semiconductors, with the list of companies
operating on the island reading like a roll call of the world's electronics
and electrical industry. It is also poised to assume pole position in the
disk drive industry, as companies relocate from Singapore and local industry
expands.
Growth has been rapid, with expansion in textile and food manufacturing
following hard on the heels of the electronics sector. Manufacturing
accounted for just 12.7 per cent of the state's GDP in 1970. Twenty years
later, that share had risen to 46 per cent.
In 1992, Penang's GDP growth is estimated to have been around 11.8 per cent,
with the manufacturing sector expanding by more than 15 per cent. The
state's chief minister, Mr Koh Tsu Koon, argues that even this figure may be
an underestimate.
However, Mr Koh concedes that the last two years have seen something of a
slowdown. The Penang Development Corporation (PDC), long the facilitator of
growth in Penang, says land sales to companies setting up in the state have
fallen in the last two years.
But the PDC argues that the recession in the global electronics industry has
served to enhance the state's appeal further as companies, often already
based in more costly Singapore, search for further savings.
Conner of the US already had a plant in Singapore when it set up its volume
producer in Penang in 1989. 'We reckon to save from Dollars 10 to Dollars 12
on every disk drive that we produce in Penang, over what it would have cost
us in Singapore,' says Mr Patrick Yeo, Conner's local managing director.
But relocating is a costly business and companies that make the leap are not
protected from disappointing sales. Conner admits to being one of many
Penang companies operating at well below capacity in the face of a world
recession.
Penang remains very much the junior partner compared with Singapore. But it
has started to bite into its southern neighbour's industrial base. A well
developed infrastructure, the capabilities that have come with its
prominence in semiconductors, and strong communications links have enhanced
Penang's standing in the electronics sector. But Penang's real edge over
Singapore is its relative freedom from Singapore's greatest problems:
shortages of land and labour.
Penang has also had its problems in these areas, but they are less acute,
and the scope for their solution seems to be greater.
The state's response to a land shortage that finally hit in 1992 was an
accelerated programme of land reclamation and great development of state
land on peninsular Malaysia - linked to the island by Asia's longest bridge.
The problem of labour shortages has been more difficult to solve. Not so
long ago unemployment was a serious problem in Penang. Now there are
shortages at virtually every level with companies reporting employee
turnover in some sectors of 7 to 8 per cent a month.
The competition for workers means that Penang can no longer boast cheap
workers as one of its selling points. But Mr Noor Ahmad Moktar Haniff,
general manager of the PDC, points out that at around MDollars 18 (Dollars
7) a day for semi-skilled labour, 'Penang's labour is not expensive either'.
The PDC is firing on all cylinders in its efforts to find more workers. The
PDC is trying to persuade Penang graduates, who went abroad to find work in
the days before the state's industrialisation, to come back home.
Women, just 44 per cent of whom participate in the labour force, have been
targeted, with the state encouraging both the development of child-care
facilities and the return to work of older women. 'We are also looking at
foreign workers as a possible temporary solution, although we are wary of
the social problems that this could bring,' says Mr Noor.
Workers must also be taught new skills to cater to the changing needs of
industry.
'In an area of rapidly developing technology there is the risk of the
workforce becoming redundant,' says Mr Boonler Somchit, executive director
of a special skills centre in Penang. 'We cannot allow that to happen. We
cannot afford to leave people marking time.'
The centre, a privately funded organisation set up in 1989, offers
facilities to Penang's companies to re-train their workers.
'We aim to train operators to be technicians, technicians to be engineers,
and release engineers into research and development,' says a PDC executive.
'The point is, there is a place in the sun for everyone.'
The labour shortage has, however, brought a change of direction in the
state's industrial strategy.
Mr Koh, the chief minister, says that Penang would rather not have labour
intensive industries. 'We would rather see a situation where Penang is the
centre for technology, the centre for operational headquarters, for research
and development, and for higher-end production. And the neighbouring states
or regions are areas for more labour intensive production, so that there can
be linkages.'
Penang is now trying to market itself and its surrounding states in the
north of peninsular Malaysia as a single, diverse, resource-rich investment
area, and lobbying the federal government for infrastructure and other
investments.
On a grander scale, the states are part of a recently agreed upon 'growth
triangle' linking north Sumatra in Indonesia and the southern states of
Thailand. Ministers from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have already
agreed on the relocation of some of Penang's electronics components
companies as the first stage in this project.
In future, the main difficulty for Penang will not be in turning away
labour-intensive investments, but in attracting higher technology producers.
Mr Yeo of Conner says Penang is like a rare gem. 'The polishing is done, but
the finer touches have yet to come.'
'At the end of the day, though, I am a businessman, and my vote is for this
place.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (13): A crucible of races and religions -
Sabah's delicate demographic balance is being steadily altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK for a meal in a cafe in Kota Kinabalu, the quiet, seaside capital of
Sabah, and the chances are that the waitress will be an Indonesian teenager;
glance at a building site, and half the construction workers you see are
probably Filipinos.
Since the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of casual migrant workers and
refugees have poured into Sabah, the state perched on the northern tip of
Borneo two and a half hours away from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur by
air across the South China Sea.
The immigrants, politely and inaccurately called 'the transient population'
in official documents, are now estimated to account for as much as 40 per
cent of the Sabah population of 1.8m and two thirds of the workforce; many
have lived in Sabah for two decades.
Their continued presence is yet another bone of contention between the
federal authorities and Sabah's predominantly Christian state government.
A large portion of the immigrants, numbering between 450,000 and 700,000,
are Moslems from the southern Philippines or Indonesia.
Sabah is one of only two states in the country led by opponents of Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the federal prime minister, and Sabah officials of local
Kadazan or ethnic Chinese origin suspect the federal government of wanting
to flood the state with Moslems who would be favourably inclined towards Dr
Mahathir and the Moslem-controlled national government.
'What Kuala Lumpur is trying to do is to legalise these people by the back
door by giving them the identity cards which signify your citizenship,' said
Mr Bernard Dompok, the Sabah finance minister, in an interview. 'We don't
mind the workers here, but we want them to be properly regulated.'
Like immigrants in so many countries, the 'illegals' of Sabah are needed but
also resented by the local population.
They work in plantations, building sites, restaurants and hotels and as
maids in the homes of richer Sabahans for wages which the local inhabitants
would not accept.
Tourism, for example, is an increasingly important foreign currency earner
for Sabah, as the logging industry inexorably declines after years of
deforestation and over-extraction of valuable timber. In the last five
years, visitor arrivals have doubled to more than 100,000. Many workers in
the tourism industry are of Filipino origin.
Plantations of oil palm and cocoa are also vital to the Sabah economy, with
the state accounting for 70 per cent of the Malaysian cocoa crop and 10 per
cent of palm oil output - a figure which is rising as more and more oil palm
plantation developers come in from peninsular Malaysia. In some areas as
many as 95 per cent of plantation workers are Indonesians.
Sabah's remoteness and internal transport problems can push costs for
businesses 20 or 30 per cent above the national average, and the Sabah
government acknowledges that cheap migrant labourers help to offset such
disadvantages.
'In many ways the economy of the state of Sabah moves because of them,' said
Mr Dompok. 'They are a source of cheap labour .. This is the only
competitive edge we have over west Malaysia and Singapore.'
Even the smuggling of cigarettes and other goods from the southern
Philippines - often on the same boats as the migrants - is welcomed by
Sabahan officials as a means of reducing costs, since most customs duties
are collected by the federal rather than the state government.
Sabah citizens, however, complain bitterly that the immigrants overload the
state's schools and hospitals (without paying taxes) and breed crime and
prostitution - to the extent that some areas, especially in the eastern
towns of Sandakan and Tawau, are said to be 'no-go' areas for the police.
The problem of coping with the immigrants is compounded by confusion over
who in Sabah really are Malaysian citizens and by widespread forging of
identity cards. Many Sabahans, especially the Kadazans in the interior, do
not have birth certificates and it is easy for an immigrant to bribe a
village headman into acknowledging him or her as a local.
'They are so integrated,' says one ethnic Chinese Sabahan of the immigrant
Filipinos. 'I myself can't tell the difference. Some people have been here
20 years.'
Mr Harris bin Mohamad Salleh, a former Sabah chief minister and a strong
supporter of Dr Mahathir, says that 10 to 20 per cent of immigrant Moslems
have become citizens over the years and claims proudly that more than half
the state's population is now Moslem. But if the federal government is
indeed encouraging the naturalisation of such people it is a tactic which
may backfire.
One of the dangers is that the presence of numerous Filipinos in Sabah will
revive a dormant territorial claim to Sabah by the Philippines; in the 19th
century the Sultan of the Sulu islands, now part of the Philippines, leased
Sabah for Dollars 5,000 a year to British businessmen. He never got it back.
Another danger for the federal government is that the influx of Moslems will
not have the desired political effect of boosting support for the United
Malays National Organisation (Umno), the dominant national party.
According to officials in Sabah, local Moslems are as resentful as anyone
else about the competition from immigrants, especially in the fishing and
fishmongering trades along the coast.
Nor is it certain that newly legalised Moslems will support the Kuala Lumpur
government. The immigrants often share the Sabahans' resentment of the
dictats of far away Kuala Lumpur. The Sabah state authorities, under Mr
Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, pride themselves on the
integration of races and religions in Sabah and have managed to lure some
Sabah Moslems into their fold.
'What it (the federal government) doesn't understand is that these people,
even if they are Moslems, are basically nominal Moslems,' said Mr Dompok of
the Filipinos who make up two thirds of the immigrants. 'Religion is
secondary.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (14): Warfare escalates over use of the
tropical forests - Timber exporters feel ecologists' wrath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE last year Austria made moves to introduce eco-labelling on tropical
timber products. Such was the reaction in Kuala Lumpur it seemed Malaysia
was about to dispatch its troops to hammer in protest on the gates of
Vienna.
'If the Austrian government insists on eco-labelling tropical timber based
products, Malaysia will retaliate in the same manner,' thundered Mr Lim Keng
Yaik, Malaysia's minister for primary industries. 'For example, we can
eco-label their chocolate products that are produced at dirty factories,'
said Mr Lim.
Austria has since modified its stand, but the tropical timber issue refuses
to go away. Various governments and environmental groups accuse Malaysia,
the world's biggest exporter of tropical timber, of raping its forests and
threatening the lives of forest dwellers.
Malaysia accuses its critics, particularly in the west, of hypocrisy and of
practising double standards.
Mr Wong Kum Choon is chief executive of the Malaysian timber industry
development council (MTIDC) a body set up by the government and timber
industry to counteract adverse publicity.
'Our critics often don't want to listen to the other side of the argument,'
says Mr Wong. 'They think we only look at forests in terms of money. They
don't realise Malaysia's own concerns about preserving its forests and
managing its timber industry effectively.'
Timber is an important part of the Malaysian economy. According to MTIDC
statistics, timber and timber products are the country's second biggest
commodity export earner after petroleum products. In 1992 Malaysia exported
more than MDollars 10bn (Dollars 4bn) worth of timber and products,
accounting for 10 per cent of total export earnings.
About 40 per cent of timber exports are in the form of logs. Sarawak, in
east Malaysia, accounts for nearly 80 per cent of log exports and it is here
that environmental attention is focused.
The statistical arguments go back and forth. The World Bank has estimated
that trees are being cut down in Sarawak at four times the sustainable rate.
The MTIDC says this is untrue: it says Sarawak has 70 per cent of its land
area under forests. Some areas are totally protected, other areas are being
cleared for various uses while about half is being logged on a selective,
sustainable, basis.
Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud, Sarawak's chief minister for more than 10 years,
recently said that logging in his state had been substantially reduced,
resulting in a loss of Dollars 50m per year in revenues to the state
government and the disappearance of thousands of jobs.
Critics do not believe Mr Taib. They accuse the chief minister of working
hand in glove with the logging companies and timber tycoons. They say that
the federal government allows Mr Taib free rein in exchange for his ongoing
support of the governing Barisan Nasional political grouping. The two sides
slug it out. There seems little room for compromise. 'Timber and human
rights are the most sensitive subjects in Malaysia,' says a former
government official. 'As long as there are forests and people the arguments
will continue.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (11): Blackouts are embarrassing - The
race to build more power stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON SEPTEMBER 29 last year the lights went out through most of peninsular
Malaysia. The blackout, blamed on a freak lightning strike and described
officially as an Act of God, left many parts of the country without power
for several days.
In subsequent months there were a growing number of power breakdowns.
Earlier this year what industrialists and others had been talking about for
months became official - Malaysia was in the midst of a power crisis.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, demanded prompt action. Mrs Rafidah
Aziz, minister of trade and industry, described the blackouts as
intolerable. Mrs Aziz deals with foreign investors in Malaysia: the fear was
that electricity shortages would have a damaging impact on the investment
climate.
Tenaga Nasional, the country's electricity utility which was partially
privatised early last year, has been taking steps to remedy the situation.
Maintenance work on existing facilities has been speeded up. Under a special
'fast track' energy programme, new power plants are being built.
The incidence of power shedding and blackouts has been reduced. Mr S Samy
Vellu, the energy minister, says that by the end of the year more than 500MW
of extra power will be available each day to meet maximum daily demands of
about 4,600MW.
But Malaysia's economic growth could run out of steam if power output is not
constantly expanded. Mr Samy Vellu estimates that Malaysia needs to invest
MDollars 10bn (Dollars 4bn) over the next 10 years to cope with increasing
electricity requirements. Over the next 25 years about MDollars 100bn will
have to be invested in the power sector.
Malaysia cannot meet these massive investment needs from its own resources:
it is therefore inviting independent power producers (IPPs) to participate
in building, owning and operating power plants.
Malaysia is the first country in the region to get such projects off the
ground. Already two IPPs have been granted power producing licences  - one
to build own and operate a 1,300MW plant at Lumut, in the northwest of
peninsular Malaysia, and the other for two plants with a combined capacity
of 1,230MW near Singapore in the south.
A variety of other IPP projects are also being considered. Foreign companies
are being encouraged to participate and are able to hold 25 per cent of
equity in the projects.
But there have been some hiccups. Foreign companies have complained that
there is a shortage of local expertise in the power sector and reliable
partners are difficult to find. There have also been accusations of
political favouritism in the government's granting of IPP licences.
Under new regulations the IPPs will purchase gas to feed their power plants
from Petronas, the state oil company, and sell power to Tenaga. These buying
and selling contracts, binding over an extended period, have proved very
difficult to negotiate. Financiers are also being cautious about extending
the large amounts of credit needed to build these IPP power plants.
However there are few who doubt that these plants will be built and
Malaysia's power output will be substantially expanded. 'It's got to
happen,' says an energy analyst. 'Without the power all the plans for
economic growth over the coming years will come to nothing.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (10): Rapid development takes its toll -
Infrastructure under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INHABITANTS of Kuala Lumpur have a habit of shaking their heads
sympathetically when they meet a visitor from Thailand. Are not the traffic
jams in Bangkok appalling, they ask, and is not Thailand's infrastructure
wholly inadequate?
Yet Malaysians too are starting to pay a high price for economic success
after six years of rapid growth.
Utilities are struggling to keep pace with demand. It can be difficult to
place a local telephone call. Power cuts have become more frequent because
of a shortage of generating capacity (something which has yet to hit
Thailand).
The streets of the Malaysian capital are increasingly congested and
polluted, to the extent that the government has launched a car-pooling
scheme with the slogan 'Get our city moving again'. It is true that the
roads of Kuala Lumpur are less crowded than those of Bangkok, but then
Bangkok's population of some 8m is four times as large as Kuala Lumpur's.
Both cities have promoted the cult of the motor car, failed to provide
adequate public transport, and are struggling now to build light commuter
railways. Both cities need new international airports, and each is about to
construct one.
As in Thailand, Malaysia's drive to remedy its infrastructural shortcomings
presents mouthwatering opportunities to local contractors and foreign
companies with the right skills; Malaysian officials cheerfully discuss
projects worth billions of dollars as they seek to bring everything from
telephone networks to sewage treatment plants up to standards adequate to
keep pace with continued economic growth.
Some economists are even concerned that the government's eagerness to
upgrade Malaysia's infrastructure and maintain high growth rates may itself
put further strains on the economy.
Building new roads, for example, deprives businesses of much needed workers
when unemployment is effectively zero across much of the country. 'People
look at growth rates here like they look at inflation rates in Germany,'
said an economist in Kuala Lumpur. 'It's a political question, not
economic.'
One thing that is not - so far - in short supply is capital, foreign or
local. Malaysia's foreign debt service ratio has declined to below six per
cent of export earnings. Local investors are as enthusiastic as foreign
banks to finance viable projects. But Malaysia could face stiff competition
for funds from other countries in the region who also face similar
infrastructure problems.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has taken his cue from Mrs Margaret
Thatcher's government in Britain in the 1980s and started to privatise
transport and utilities with an enthusiasm rarely matched elsewhere.
Portions of the electricity and telephone networks have been sold to the
public and the companies - Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia respectively
 -have been listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
Faced with serious power shortages, the government has also strongarmed
Tenaga into agreeing to buy electricity from independent power producers
known as IPPs, some of which may eventually be listed on the stock exchange.
Sixty proposals for power stations have already been made by various joint
ventures, but only five have so far been approved and financing constraints
will probably mean that not all the approved projects actually proceed.
Private sector responsibility for infrastructure projects does not make
Malaysia a wholly free market.
Many of the companies which have won big contracts for roads and other
infrastructure developments, like Renong and Berjaya, have strong
connections with government, either through personal friendships or because
they are linked to the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the
dominant party in the government.
Eyebrows were raised, for example, when the Berjaya group, in association
with Britain's North West Water, won, without a public tender, a preliminary
MDollars 6bn agreement to build and upgrade urban sewage facilities. Berjaya
has little experience of such contracting work, but it is an influential
company and Mr Vincent Tan, the group's chief, is said to be close to
leading figures in government.
Some businessmen have criticised the use of funds from organisations such as
the Employees' Provident Fund, or the police and army pension funds (the
last two have stakes in the sewage venture) to finance infrastructure
projects with Umno connections, but others believe there is no problem as
long as the project concerned is bankable; such organisations have to invest
their money somewhere.
Although there is no doubt that some companies benefit from government
largesse in such deals, Malaysia does not suffer as badly as Indonesia or
Thailand from the corrosive effects of corruption and official indecision.
Infrastructure projects, says a banker, 'are not so obviously overpriced'.
Existing and proposed projects include:
Airports and ports: About MDollars 20bn is to be spent on a new
international airport at Sepang, south of Kuala Lumpur, with the first phase
costing about MDollars 10bn and an express rail link to the capital a
further MDollars 1.2bn. A masterplan study drawn up by an Anglo-Japanese
consortium, comprising Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar House Construction, Gammon
of Hong Kong, G-MATS and Marubeni, forecast that the number of passengers
passing through Kuala Lumpur could rise to between 55m and 60m by the year
2020, compared with 8.8m in 1991. Other airports and sea ports are also
being upgraded.
Telecommunications: Malaysian officials say about Dollars 10bn of
investments will be needed over the next decade. Demand is expected to rise
sharply, with international traffic growing by as much as 30 per cent a
year. There is scope for expansion; at the end of last year there were 11.6
lines per 100 inhabitants, a third of Singapore's ratio.
Railways and roads: The Malayan Railway Administration (KTM) has embarked on
a programme to double-track busy lines. Work is underway in the Klang valley
between Kuala Lumpur and its seaport at Port Klang, and there are plans
eventually to double-track the entire distance between Johor in the south
and Butterworth, opposite the island of Penang, in the north. There are also
plans for a light rail transit system in Kuala Lumpur. An Anglo-German
consortium led by Taylor Woodrow this month raised Pounds 300m to finance
the first 12 kilometre link which will take 34 months to build. As for the
road network, the north-south highway, a toll road, is expected to be
completed next year after the securing of additional funds to meet cost
overruns. A second causeway is planned for the crossing to Singapore.
Construction and property: United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), a company
connected to the Renong group, plans to build a MDollars 450m stadium and
village for the 1998 Commonwealth Games outside Kuala Lumpur, in exchange
for property with development potential in the capital, including the old
national stadium. Other developments include a huge twin-tower office
complex in central Kuala Lumpur, and private and state hospitals.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (12): Remnants of empires - The exotic
mixture that is old Malacca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THAT is Christ. You know who Christ is?' says the Portuguese descendant as
he points to an altar clearly lit up inside his home.
We are in the Portuguese settlement, a mile outside Malacca on the west
coast of Malaysia. It is the night of the cultural show, and Portuguese
Square, remnant of a long-gone empire, is strung with lights to attract the
tourists.
Malacca first grew up as a port in the 15th century. It has always known how
to market itself. When traders needed a well run port, where rules were made
and kept, Malacca offered it. The town prospered as one of the earliest
gateways to the east, home to wave upon wave of settlers and colonial
powers.
The city is still selling itself today, but its audience now are tourists
rather than merchants. Malaysia's only designated 'historical city', its
past is now providing for its future.
In the central museum an entire hall is filled with colourful tableaux
showing the wedding ceremonies of the many ethnic groups that came to the
city. In reality, five centuries as a Straits settlement gave birth to a
hybrid people.
The Malay bride of Malacca wears anything from seven to 13 national costumes
on her wedding day, parading in each.
In the Portuguese settlement, the speciality, advertised on the Lisbon
Restaurant's neon sign, is prawn sambal, a traditional Malay dish; and the
dancers in the cultural show are dressed in Malay costumes.
In old Malacca, Malaysia's oldest Chinese temple, a mosque and an Indian
temple all stand within yards of one another. The Chinese houses have
Portuguese tiles on their front walls, Portuguese homes are built on stilts,
Malay-style.
But the authorities are determined to make things easy for the busy tourist.
The answer is the Malacca theme park, where all can be sated.
On a bend by the river there is a Malay kampong, or village, housing two
further miniaturised villages.
In the old quarter, and equally stylised, is the world of the Baba-Nyonya
people, the Chinese who settled here and took up local ways. Here, the
Straits Chinese present a mix of cultures, replete with Venetian mirrors,
Victorian chandeliers, and ornate Chinese furniture. In a warren of nearby
antique shops, artifacts are piled high. The charm is real, but the goods
look a little short on history.
The other side of the river is the Dutch town hall and church, painted deep
red. And, in case of doubt, a 15-foot-high model windmill. Beyond these, for
those seeking global norms, there is the shopping mall, bowling alley and
leisure complex, built on land reclaimed from the sea.
In the city centre, modern-day China town, with its stores full of bicycle
wheels and jars of pickle, draws the bargain hunter away from the confusion
of cultures. But, back at the remnants of the Portuguese fort and the old
British planters club - now an independence memorial - huge concrete models
of Malay bullock carts quickly restore the feel of fantasy.
Here, every night, an hour-long sound and light show puts the whole picture
into a new perspective. Suddenly, six cultures are no longer six, but one.
Like a litany the narrator returns every few minutes to his driving theme:
Malacca is where it all began. And what began in Malacca was not the blend
that is Baba Nyonga, which is never mentioned. What began in Malacca was
Islam, and Malay nationalism.
Now the tourist is made to understand that it is the Malay identity that is,
was and always will be at the heart of Malacca.
Arab traders brought Islam to Malacca, from where the city's people spread
the word of Allah throughout south-east Asia, the 'spectacular' explains.
And it was the people of Naning, just inland of Malacca, who most fiercely
defended the Malay way, by rising up against the Portuguese, Dutch and
British colonialists. Here, too, is where the independence movement began.
In the flash of a light, the ancient port's flow of Indian and Chinese
traders is negated, as the show explains that the British introduced racial
tension to Malaysia by importing workers from the sub-continents.
The courting of tourism seems forgotten as the need for political
correctness comes to the fore. Ironically, though officialdom may point to
the city as a monument to all that is Malay, it is the descendants of the
Straits Chinese that come in their droves to rediscover their roots. More
than 3m tourists came to Malacca in 1992, of whom nearly two-thirds were
daytrippers from Singapore. The opening of a second crossing from Singapore
should see their numbers rise still further, as the travel time by road
comes down to 2 1/2 hours.
Old Singapore may be hard to find, but old Malacca is not. In fact nothing
could be easier. The city has recognised a niche market. Its heritage has
not just been retained, it has been improved upon. The developers have been
held at bay in much of the city's heart, although its fringes have given way
to the obligatory high-rise hotels.
More than 1m tourists stayed in the city in 1992, spending Dollars 350m,
equivalent to more than 15 per cent of the state's gross domestic product.
There are hopes for more tourist dollars in 1994. The success of the 'Visit
Malaysia Year' in 1990 was too good not to be repeated, and the government
is full steam ahead to repeat the exercise next year.
In the meantime, one people or six, the Malaccans' cash registers are
ringing out.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (8): From peak to shining peak -
Temperatures run high at the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuala Lumpur stock exchange has been breaking records this year. The
composite index has reached successive peaks and the number of shares traded
has sometimes exceeded levels in New York and Tokyo.
Following a round of privatisations which brought companies such as Telekom
(the telecommunications network) and Tenaga (the electricity utility) on to
the market, the KLSE's market capitalisation of more than Dollars 100bn is
now comfortably ahead of regional rivals Bangkok and Singapore.
The increased volumes and the rise in the index, however, have not always
moved in step.
The first half of the year was characterised by frenzied activity from local
speculators, largely in secondary stocks. Volumes soared - on April 15 more
than 1bn shares worth about Dollars 1bn changed hands - but the index,
dominated by blue chips, responded only sluggishly.
Trading patterns were typical for a developing market in a booming economy;
as in Bangkok a few months earlier, investors piled into a maelstrom of
speculation and share-ramping by syndicates. Some brokers slept in their
offices at night as they struggled to keep up with the paperwork, and
chartered helicopters to shift scrip around the country.
'Before they would buy 10 lots (of 1,000 shares), now it's 100 lots,' said
one stockbroker of his clients. Money held offshore by ethnic Chinese
businessmen flooded back into the country as confidence in the ringgit, the
Malaysian dollar, strengthened. A lack of rights issues as a result of a
reorganisation of the market's regulatory system has left investors with
plenty of cash, although that is likely to change in the remaining months of
this year.
Each political rumour, each hint of a tenuous business deal in China
produced a flurry of activity in the stock concerned, a trend encouraged by
a series of tentative agreements signed by Malaysian businessmen during a
visit to China in June by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.
It was the smaller stocks that were attracting the most attention. The price
of a small property company called Granite, with a handful of employees and
an unimpressive track record, increased more than tenfold on the back of an
agreement to install thousands of gambling machines in north-east China.
Other China gaming plays soared as well. Timber stocks rose as the price of
logs on the international market climbed sharply. Companies with strong
government connections, such as Renong, were bought heavily, with
speculators assuming they would benefit from contracts for large
infrastructure projects; sometimes several competitors for the same deal
were ramped one after the other, brokers said.
Political manoeuvering ahead of elections in November for posts in the
United Malays National Organisation (Umno, the dominant party in the
government) has added further zest to the stock market. Attention is focused
on an expected tussle between Mr Abdul Ghafar Baba, the incumbent party
deputy president and deputy prime minister, and his undeclared challenger Mr
Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister.
Speculators buy stocks in companies linked to politicians they believe will
do well in the election. Conversely, they also buy companies connected to
probable losers, on the grounds that the losers will be persuaded to
withdraw in return for financial favours from the eventual winners.
Stockbrokers believe that the finance ministry will, before the election,
rush through a plan to list the state Heavy Industries Corporation of
Malaysia (Hicom), probably by means of a reverse takeover involving New
Serendah, a small listed rubber company whose share price has jumped in
anticipation; an allocation of 30 per cent of the shares to Bumiputras
(Malays) at a substantial discount is likely to give the Malay community a
pre-election windfall.
Perhaps inevitably, the bull market has been marked by an element of greed.
Traditional blue chip stocks such as the Sime Darby conglomerate are
considered too dull for speculators interested only in quick profits.
'When you tell a client the upside of a share is 20 to 30 per cent, they say
they're not interested - they want 100 per cent,' said a local stockbroker.
The dangers of such a febrile market were demonstrated recently by a fiasco
involving Union Paper, a small toilet paper manufacturer thought to be a
target of a reverse takeover bid by a property and financial cooperative
dominated by Umno members. The shares soared to more than 10 times their
original value and then plunged, leaving some speculators in default,
apparently because of illegal short-selling.
The new Securities Commission, established earlier this year, has
investigated the affair and is expected to make an announcement soon. Union
Paper's shares were suspended.
It was a salutary lesson for small investors, who subsequently lost some of
their enthusiasm for second board stocks and took more interest in blue
chips. Both the KLSE and the Commission are attempting to tighten regulation
of the market to curb share manipulation and put a stop to misleading
company announcements, although foreign and local brokers have yet to be
convinced that the regulators have teeth.
'People start to feel that there is one place where they can make quick and
big money,' acknowledged Mr Nik Mohamed Din, KLSE executive chairman.
'When the market becomes bullish there are bound to be some problems that
come up. We are very concerned and very vigilant to avoid situations where
people benefit through manipulation,' he said. 'If we do not check this kind
of activity then the market will not be sustained. One of these days it will
just burst.'
While the KLSE is demanding more frequent and accurate announcements from
companies - about, say, their deals in China - the Commission is tasked with
investigating other misdemeanours and with streamlining the hitherto
bureaucratic procedures for new listings.
Other developments include the proposed establishment of the Kuala Lumpur
Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Kloffe) by a politically
well-connected private sector consortium (in the face of initial opposition
from the Kuala Lumpur Commodities Exchange and the KLSE), and the slow
implementation by the KLSE of its central depository system for immobilising
scrip and reducing paper transfers; 11 shares from the second board have
been included so far and the KLSE wants to bring in the other 60 or so
second board companies by the end of 1993, and to complete the entire
process within five years. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, has issued call and put
warrants on the composite index.
Although some foreign brokers are unsure whether Kuala Lumpur needs complex
derivatives markets at this stage in its development, they are confident in
the underlying strength of the KLSE, which now has nearly 400 companies
quoted on its main and second boards.
Brokers in the Malaysian capital also believe that the threat to their
turnover posed by the over-the-counter CLOB market in Singapore - which Mr
Nik Mohamed describes as a 'black market' - is gradually diminishing,
especially as CLOB does not deal in newer arrivals on the KLSE such as
Tenaga or Telekom.
The KLSE itself says there are 69 foreign funds with investments in the
Kuala Lumpur exchange, and foreign interest has increased since the middle
of the year, pushing up the index - if not the volume - after the local
speculators eased off.
'In the first half of the year, it was retail-driven, but in the past month
or two it's swung around the other way towards institutional buying,' said
Mr Eugene Marais of Baring Research (Malaysia). 'Foreign interest has
surged.'
Even if much of the trading by Malaysian investors on the exchange is purely
speculative, the economy remains robust and continues to grow at eight per
cent or more a year. Average earnings per share are forecast to rise 13.5
per cent this year and 15 per cent in 1994.
By mid-August, however, Kuala Lumpur shares were starting to look pricey to
investors interested in fundamentals, especially when compared with rival
stocks in Asia's other fast-growing economies. The KLSE's prospective
price/earnings ratio for 1993 was more than 22, and even for 1994 it stood
at 20. 'It's quite expensive,' said one broker.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (9): Asian centre for offshore finance -
Labuan Island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY the sign at the gate of the 'Financial Park' on Labuan island leads
only to a muddy building site and a cluster of pile drivers, but by the end
of 1995 the island's small town should be overshadowed by at least MDollars
400m worth of office, condominium and commercial buildings.
The creation of the Financial Park - by a consortium of the Malaysian
central bank and commercial banks - underlines the determination of the
federal authorities to make Labuan a thriving international offshore
financial centre (IOFC) in the face of widespread scepticism among bankers
in south-east Asia.
Labuan's shortcomings are well known: office space is in short supply on
this 92 square kilometre island off the coast of Borneo and clerical staff
are hard to find. Only small aircraft such as the Boeing 737 can land at the
airport, and the government has deferred plans to lengthen the runway.
Since declaring Labuan an IOFC in 1990, however, the Malaysian government
has devoted much time and millions of ringgit to ensure that Labuan
succeeds.
'We the authorities are quite worried that it's moving too fast,' says Mr
Mohamad Khir Abd Rahman, manager of the bank regulation department at Bank
Negara, the central bank. 'New offshore banks are fighting for new office
space.'
That problem should be solved when the Financial Park is finished - the
developers say a third of the office space has already been informally
booked - and in the meantime banks are allowed to manage their offshore
units from Kuala Lumpur, although they must also maintain an office on the
island.
So far 13 banks have been licensed to establish offshore units in Labuan,
including Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank, two Japanese banks and the main
Malaysian banks. Bank Negara officials say total loans and deposits have
each reached about Dollars 1bn - tiny by comparison with Hong Kong or
Singapore but growing fast. There are also three insurance companies and 139
other companies licensed to operate offshore in Labuan.
The Labuan economy, previously reliant on regional entrepot trade based on
its free port status, services to the oil and shipping industries, has
profited from the government-inspired building boom.
Officials of the opposition state government in Sabah argue that the federal
authorities are pouring money into Labuan to persuade voters that
cooperation with Kuala Lumpur is better than confrontation: Labuan was part
of Sabah but became federal territory in 1984. 'Perhaps the idea is to show
it's a success if you cooperate with the feds,' says one banker.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister and driving force behind the
development of Labuan as an IOFC, also looks at the project as a way of
stimulating Malaysia's financial sector.
The Malaysian government urges most state companies to raise foreign loans
through Labuan. Bank Negara officials say Labuan is centrally located among
the countries of Asean, the Association of South East Asian Nations. They
are hoping the island will benefit from capital flight from Hong Kong in the
lead up to China rule in 1997.
Labuan compares favourably with its regional rivals on tax concessions.
There is no withholding tax on bank interest, and offshore companies are
given the choice of a three per cent tax on net profits, or a flat rate of
MDollars 20,000. Secrecy for offshore companies is assured.
But international bankers are still sceptical about Labuan. In Singapore or
Bangkok, they say, customers can conduct their regular as well as their
offshore business. Bermuda and Jersey are millionaires' playgrounds as well
as offshore centres. (Mr Khir has an answer to that: 'Labuan might just turn
out to be that way - a Monte Carlo for instance').
But Labuan is difficult to reach and has few facilities, the bankers say.
Why, they ask, does an 'offshore' tax haven need to be physically offshore
at all?
Although Malaysian officials put a brave face on it, they were taken aback
by the almost casual way in which the Thais established their own offshore
business earlier this year - called the Bangkok International Banking
Facility - and quickly attracted applications from more than 50 local and
foreign banks; Thailand granted licences to 47.
Even the few foreign banks already establishing their offshore units in
Labuan - with a handful of staff - are believed to be doing so as a kind of
political insurance.
Those with domestic networks in Malaysia want to protect their interests by
pleasing the authorities; those without operations in the restricted
Malaysian banking market hope that supporting Labuan might help them in the
future. 'People are assuming that this is a good way to score points,' says
one economist in Kuala Lumpur.
Although this attitude is widely acknowledged, bankers say it does not
necessarily mean that Labuan will fail as an offshore centre; the
government's financial 'pump-priming' and its real or imagined efforts at
persuasion could easily give the island's offshore industry the critical
mass it needs to succeed.
'It's almost at the stage when they can't afford for it not to work,' says
one banker.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (6): Vehicle of growth - The role of the
car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has a dream, called Vision 2020. The idea is to achieve the
economic status of an industrialised nation by the year 2020.
Its car industry is one of the ways that it sees of getting there.
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional, or Proton, produced its first car in 1985. The
country's 'First National Car Project' was seen as the means of expanding
the nation's engineering skills and manufacturing capabilities.
In conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan, the government set up the plant and
Proton began to motor.
By 1992, the company accounted for more than 67 per cent of the domestic car
market, was exporting to 17 countries, and had established a sizeable sales
network in the UK. Delighted at this progress, the Malaysian government
announced Proton's partial privatisation and a second car project.
From the beginning, the government's intention has been to use its car
industry as a way to develop an engineering sector. By supplying its own
industry, it hoped to iron out any start-up problems, so that it could move
on to the world stage as a fully geared up supplier of cars and subsequently
of components.
Local content was the name of the game, and Proton was playing well.
British consultant engineers were imported, to the disappointment of the
manufacturer's Japanese partners, and Hicom, the government controlled heavy
industrial holding company, began manufacturing car parts.
Fuel tanks followed radiators and exhaust systems on to the local content
list.
Success is measured only partially in the 102,800 units that Proton produced
in the year to March 31 1993. More significant for the government were the
200 car component companies that emerged, including more than 70 which were
producing for the original equipment market.
A ban on external sourcing of more than 30 components had helped to take the
local content of motorcycles assembled in Malaysia to more than 75 per cent,
Proton to over 60 per cent and other passenger and commercial vehicles to
more than 30 per cent by the beginning of this year.
By 1993, the country could boast 13 vehicle assemblers, including Proton,
with a total installed capacity of 306,000 units of motorcycles per year,
and 202,000 units of passenger and commercial vehicles, none of which was
100 per cent externally sourced.
As for the second national car project, the government claims that it will
not eat into Proton's sales but will offer a variant of a Japanese 660c
model aimed at the market below the Proton's price range. In collaboration
with Daihatsu of Japan, it aims at a 1994 start-up to produce 20,000 cars a
year.
The government has taken steps to ensure that any market contraction will be
felt first by imported vehicles. Hire purchase limits, introduced in 1991 to
moderate domestic demand, were amended in April 1992 to exempt cars costing
less than MDollars 40,000, which Protons do.
The rules were subsequently lifted altogether, but the slowdown they
prompted cut the sales of the dearer imported cars. Sales of non-Protons
fell by 25 per cent between 1991 and 1992.
Import tariffs have also been used to sharpen the price differential between
locally assembled cars, parts for which are charged at between 13 and 40 per
cent, and completely built car imports, charged at 140 to 300 per cent: and
are anyway limited to 10 per cent of the market.
But Proton has been ailing in its own right of late. Sales in the financial
year to the end of March 1993 were down nearly 2 per cent on the previous
year.
The setting for the decline was a slowdown in Malaysia's motor industry as a
whole, after marked growth from 1988 to 1991. In terms of sales, commercial
vehicles fell by nearly 57 per cent to 35,054 in 1992, compared with 81,099
in 1991, while passenger vehicles fell 13.5 per cent to 117,773.
The decline at home made Proton all the more determined to export. By the
end of April 1993, it had exported 66,183 cars, of which 56,821 were to the
UK, where it has gained from the demand for cheaper cars in recessionary
times. There is even talk of an overseas plant, in Indonesia, or maybe in
Chile.
The outlook for Proton certainly rests on its success as an exporter.
Malaysia's own demand could not support one car manufacturer, let alone two.
It is also exposed to foreign exchange risk because of its yen-based costs,
which one industry analyst suggests were as high as 45 to 50 per cent in
1992.
It can offer cheaper labour costs than many of its competitors, but lacks
economies of scale.
At the end of the day, Proton is an anomaly. It exists to feed a nation's
greater need, and it is likely to receive all the protection it needs to
survive, until its survival is no longer tied up with Malaysia's Vision.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (7): Youth in the driving seat - Profile:
Mohamad Nadzmi, head of the Proton company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mohamad Nadzmi Mohamad Salleh has one of the most difficult jobs in
Malaysia. At only 39, he is head of Proton, Malaysia's national car company.
Proton is the pride of Malaysia and the project most dear to Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister.
'It's tough now and it's going to get a lot tougher,' says Mr Nadzmi, who
has been in his new post since mid July. 'Proton is the cornerstone of the
country's industrialisation programme. It's daunting to take such a job on.
If things go wrong then that's the end of my career. There's no turning
back. We have to succeed.'
Mr Nadzmi describes himself as a professional manager rather than a
technician or engineer. He studied economics, chemistry and mathematics in
the US, then returned to Malaysia to work for Petronas, the state oil
company, and HICOM, the government controlled heavy industrial holding
company.
Mitsubishi, Proton's Japanese partner, has had its men at the head of the
national car project for most of time since the first car rolled off the
assembly line in the mid 1980s.
But there has been talk of friction between the partners, with the Malaysian
side dissatisfied about the slow rate of Japanese technology transfer, while
Mitsubishi apparently disapproved of Proton's ambitious export plans -
fearing competition overseas from the Malaysian car.
Mr Nadzmi was catapulted into the managing director's seat on the insistence
of Dr Mahathir. 'It was always realised that the Japanese could not go on
running the company indefinitely. It was felt that now was the time for
Malaysians themselves to take control,' says Mr Nadzmi.
A Malaysian did head Proton for a time five years ago. But the Japanese
reassumed control as various problems threatened the project's future.
In Malaysia, questions of politics and race are part of almost every
activity. Mr Nadzmi has to have the right political allies if his authority
is to be maintained. Part of Mr Nadzmi's brief is to encourage more
bumiputra or Malay participation in the industry. He has to do this while
not offending other groups.
'I know people will be watching to see if I perform well. I think I have
about five years to really prove myself. Proton has achieved so much but the
next phase will be harder. We've got to find new markets so we can expand
production and bring costs down. We've got to introduce more competition in
our supply network. That means I'm going to make enemies and offend some
politically well connected people. But it's got to be done.'
Mr Nadzmi has already proved himself as a businessman. Before his present
job he built up Edaran Otomobil Nasional (EON), Proton's distributing
company, into one of Malaysia's most successful conglomerates, with a
listing on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
'I'm not going to disregard what the Japanese have done at Proton. We can't
reinvent the wheel. The Japanese have introduced their proven production
methods. But as a Malaysian I think I know how to motivate people better.'
Mr Nadzmi feels Malaysians have a great flair for design, They are also good
innovators. But making sure people stick to modern industrial working
practices is not easy.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (4): Consolidation is the new priority -
After record growth rates, the economy has reached a plateau of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN most countries, a yearly 8 per cent economic growth figure would throw
finance ministers and central bankers into paroxysms of joy. Not so in
Malaysia.
Last year Malaysia's overall GDP growth was indeed 8 per cent, but the
figure was described merely as 'creditable' by Bank Negara, the country's
central bank.
Malaysia has been used to flying in the clear skies of economic success,
with soaring GDP growth rates of 9 per cent in 1988, 8.7 in 1989, nearly 10
per cent in 1990 and 8.6 per cent in 1991.
The buzz word now is consolidation. The economy, say the official planners,
is taking a breather. A combination of continuing tight counter-inflationary
policies at home and a less than buoyant market abroad means that GDP growth
will further moderate to between 7.5 - 7.8 per cent this year.
'The prospects for a slow and moderate recovery in the major industrial
countries could well be a blessing in disguise,' says Bank Negara. 'It would
provide some much needed respite for the Malaysian economy to consolidate
its position - to alleviate outstanding infrastructural and supply
impediments and pave the way for sustainable growth with stability over the
medium term.'
But overcoming those impediments, which include serious labour shortages,
infrastructure bottlenecks, a drop in investments growth and weak markets
for various export sectors, will not be easy. Malaysia has been climbing
fast. Last year per capita income increased a further 11 per cent to
MDollars 7,541 (Dollars 2,950).
Malaysia's long term plan is to be a fully industrialised country by the
year 2020. The government has set an average annual growth target for the
next 27 years of 7 per cent. Achieving these targets is likely to become
progressively tougher.
The fundamentals of the economy are still sound. The main achievement of
1992 was on the balance of payments front. At the end of 1991 the finance
ministry had predicted a 1992 merchandise trade deficit of MDollars 3.7bn.
In the event the merchandise account recorded a surplus of MDollars 7.3bn
last year, compared with a deficit of MDollars 461m in 1991.
A sharp fall in imports rather than export growth was the main reason for
the merchandise account improvement. The value of imports tripled in the
years 1987 to 1991. In 1992 the value of imports increased by only 0.4 per
cent.
The deficit in the services account, mainly due to freight and insurance
payments, narrowed slightly to MDollars 12bn last year, giving an overall
current account deficit of MDollars 4.4bn, representing 3.1 per cent of GNP,
compared with a deficit of MDollars 12.5bn or 10.1 per cent of GNP in 1991.
Officials are now predicting a small current account surplus of MDollars
350m for this year, the first since 1988.
The international reserves position also improved. Reserves stood at
MDollars 47.2bn at the end of 1992, up from MDollars 31bn the previous year
and topping the country's external debt of MDollars 41.4bn.
In recent months the overriding concern of economic policy - and the factor
which has been chiefly responsible for the moderation in growth rates - has
been the fight against inflation. Traditionally Malaysia has had low
inflation: when inflation was rising above 5 per cent at one stage last year
the alarm bells started to ring.
High interest rates were maintained through 1992. This lessened demand for
domestic credit but caused a large inflow of funds from abroad. As a result
Bank Negara was forced to mop up more than MDollars 15bn of excess liquidity
from the domestic banking system.
Restrictions were imposed on hire purchase and credit card use. Government
spending in a number of areas was cut back. Investment projects in the
private sector were curtailed. As a result there was a sharp drop in the
growth of private sector spending - from 16.5 per cent in 1991 to 2.3 per
cent in 1992. (Car sales in 1992 dropped by 15 per cent - compared with a
growth in sales of 14 per cent the previous year.)
The battle against inflation continues: Bank Negara says the overall
inflation rate last year was 4.7 per cent compared with 4.4 per cent in
1991. 'The real issue for us is to build a strong foundation for our economy
to make a leap towards the next phase of industrialisation,' says Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, the minister of finance. 'Unless we are firm in our resolve to
break the back of inflation, that foundation will be shaky and our future
progress will be jeopardised.' There seems little room to dampen down
domestic demand further without damaging overall growth prospects. Officials
see little likelihood of bringing price rises down to under 4 per cent by
the end of the year.
Malaysia is vitally dependent on trade: two way merchandise trade is equal
to nearly 60 per cent of GDP. For the first time in several years export
earnings in 1992 failed to achieve double digit growth rates. Exports
earnings for the year were MDollars 102.8bn, an increase of 8.8 per cent
compared with growth of 18.6 per cent in 1991.
The moderation in export growth was mainly due to the continuing problems
being faced in Malaysia's main markets - Japan, the US and the EC.
Malaysia's commodity export earnings also declined due to generally low
world prices. Exporters were hit further by the appreciation of the ringgit,
the Malaysian dollar, against the major currencies.
Official predictions of a better export performance this year seem to be
right: in the first four months of the year exports were up 24 per cent as
against 8 per cent in the previous corresponding period. Meanwhile imports
rose by 9 per cent.
One of the main reasons for Malaysia's economic growth over the last five
years has been due to its success in attracting millions of dollars worth of
investments - both from overseas, and more recently, from internal sources.
According to government figures total investment approvals rose from
MDollars 3.9bn in 1987 to MDollars 9bn in 1988, to MDollars 12.2 in 1989 and
MDollars 28bn in 1990.
In 1991 investments peaked at MDollars 30.8bn. Last year they dropped to
MDollars 27.7bn. Of that figure MDollars 17.7bn was foreign sourced - an
increase of 2 per cent over the foreign content in the 1991 figure  - while
MDollars 10bn was domestic - representing a fall of more than 30 per cent
from the previous year.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister of trade and industry, says Malaysia
has already achieved more than 70 per cent of its investment target under
the present five year plan (1991-95). But there is no doubting the official
concern about the investment downturn.
Other countries in the region, in particular China and Vietnam, are
attracting investments away from Malaysia. In 1991 Taiwan was one of
Malaysia's biggest investors, with investments of MDollars 3.6bn. Last year
Taiwan invested less than half that amount.
Foreign investment approvals in the first six months of 1992 were MDollars
7.5bn. This year the figure for the equivalent period was MDollars 1.6bn.
Over the same period last year approved domestic investments were MDollars
4.1bn. This year the figure was MDollars 2.7bn.
'It is important for the government to come on more aggressively to promote
domestic private investment in the absence of a strong inflow of direct
foreign investment,' says the mainly privately funded Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research. In a budget later this year the government might lower
corporate tax from its present 34 per cent as an added incentive to
investors.
A key problem with attracting investments is Malaysia's contracting labour
supply. The official unemployment rate is 4 per cent but in many parts of
the country it is zero. Industrialists have become frustrated with a high
rate of job hopping and upward pressures on wages.
In some areas 70 per cent of workers on rubber and palm oil estates are
foreigners - mainly from Indonesia or Bangladesh. The government is nervous
about the implications of the presence of a large immigrant population -
estimated at up to one million - and the possible upsetting of the country's
delicate racial balance.
No one is suggesting that Malaysia's economy is about to take a dive. But
there are many who forecast economic turbulence ahead as the country runs
into constraints on investments and labour - and braces itself for a more
competitive regional environment.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (5): On the road to development - Pahang
and Terengganu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mountain range that runs from north to south in peninsular Malaysia
serves more effectively than any border in carving out separate nations of
the east and west, writes Jenny Luesby.
Peninsular Malaysia's largest state of Pahang is only 40km from Kuala Lumpur
at its western border, but in terms of development the distance is far
greater.
Where much of the west coast is heavily industrialised, the east remains an
agricultural economy where timber and rubber are supporting the first
tentative moves into resource-based industry.
The development of oilfields off the east coast at Kemaman, in the coastal
state of Terengganu, has given the region a leg-up, and its natural beauty
has brought in the tourists, but its growth remains in its infancy.
The official line is candid: 'Ten years ago, Terengganu had virtually
nothing to offer,' says Mamat Ghazalee bin abd Rahman, chairman of the state
committee for petroleum, industry and human resources. But, things have
changed, he says, with the arrival of oil and gas.
And they have. The state has built a port, upgraded its roads, expanded
power and water supplies, improved communications and set up the obligatory
crop of industrial estates.
The oil revenue has also brought ornate local government, police and state
assembly buildings, heavy with marble. Mining and quarrying, which includes
the oil industry, accounted for 63.8 per cent of Terengganu's Gross Domestic
Product in 1990.
Manufacturing remains thin on the ground. So too does employment. 'We have
had many inquiries,' says Haji Mohd Zaki bin Haji Yusoff, director of the
Terengganu development corporation, 'but people generally locate elsewhere.'
In neighbouring Pahang, more than 40 per cent of investments up until
December 1991 fell within the public sector, highlighting further the
investors' shyness.
The less educated population on the eastern side of the peninsula and the
limits on its infrastructure may have deterred some, but the states of
Pahang and Terengganu probably have a point when they suggest that people do
not come because they do not know what is there.
Both Pahang and Terengganu have abundant supplies of power. They also have
products such as polyethylene, for producing plastics, which have come with
the petrochemicals industry. The states seem to have the potential for
developing a sound industrial base.
'We see Vietnam and China as competitors really,' says Haji Mohd Zaki. But
facing them across the South China Sea, the region may find its location an
added advantage.
Serviced to western standards in every area from legal and accounting
services through to cargo facilities, the east coast offers a haven of order
next door to what could be the world's fastest growing markets in years to
come.
The east coast's facilities include two new ports, a deep-water natural
harbour at Kemaman, capable of taking vessels up to 120,000 dwt, and a small
and efficient operation at Pahang's state capital, Kuantan. These could be
used as transshipment centres.
And while the official downgrading of Kuantan airport from international
status has brought irritation in Pahang, and a degree of inconvenience as
air cargo heads to Kuala Lumpur, the decision could be reversed if air
traffic picks up.
In the meantime, local ambitions are subdued. There is the occasional
mention of electronics and high-technology, but conviction is absent. The
area's real thrust for development is through industry rooted in the
region's ample resources.
Agriculture is expected to account for nearly 40 per cent of GDP in Pahang
in 1993, and more than 40 per cent of employment. Oil palm, rubber and
timber made up its bulk, with oil palm alone accounting for an estimated 20
per cent of the state's GDP.
Both Pahang and Terengganu also offer an enviable range of minerals, which
as well as tin, include mercury, silica, tungsten and graphite.
'We do not want loggers, we want chipboard, and even furniture
manufacturers,' says a local official. Unlike the west coast, the region is
also interested in heavy and labour-intensive industry.
But, for now, the region's manufacturing is small - in 1992, manufacturing
accounted for 14 per cent of GDP in Pahang. In the somewhat information shy
state of Terengganu the most recent figures available are for 1990, when
manufacturing accounted for just 8.2 per cent of GDP.
Tourism has been the states' true testing ground. Tourist arrivals in Pahang
rose by 77 per cent between 1986 and 1991, to reach 1,712,647. The length of
stay also increased, and hotel occupancy rates improved from an average 50
per cent to 80 per cent.
In this context, the states, both predominately Moslem, are at pains to
emphasise their religious tolerance. The balance is a delicate one,
especially with the recent switch to a more fundamentalist government -
opposed to the federal authorities - in the state of Kelantan, north of
Terengganu. But the fact that nearly half of Pahang's tourist spending is in
the rural Genting highlands, notable for the fact that it houses the one and
only gaming casino in Malaysia, would tend to bear out the assertion that
tolerance is high: gambling is contrary to Islamic teachings.
The rural casino is not the region's most off-beat venture. There is also an
eel farm set up by a Taiwanese investor, which boasts of being the largest
in the world. Odder still is the imminent arrival of the kit from the
recently closed Ravenscraig steel plant from Scotland.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (2): The political cauldron is simmering
 -Premier Mahathir is in no hurry to retire, but there is talk of who will
succeed him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN mid July Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, arrived back
in Kuala Lumpur after a three day official visit to Albania. The prime
minister's jet touched down at 7.20am. By 9am Dr Mahathir was in his office,
chairing a cabinet meeting.
Dr Mahathir, 67, sets a bruising pace. Though he had open heart surgery in
1989, the prime minister, in power for the past 12 years, shows no sign of
wishing to retire. 'As long as I'm welcome and the people want me, I'll
serve,' said Dr Mahathir in a recent interview.
Yet these days Malaysia is bubbling with talk about the succession. The
political temperature is rising, the rumour mill is working overtime.
At issue are elections in November in the United Malays National
Organisation (UMNO), the country's dominant political party and main
grouping within the ruling Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition
government.
By tradition, the head of UMNO is also prime minister. It's very unlikely
that Dr Mahathir's position as party head will be challenged in these
elections. But there is an increasingly bitter battle for the posts
immediately below Dr Mahathir, particularly the number two position. The
theory is that whoever emerges as deputy will one day inherit the Mahathir
mantle.
There are two main contenders for the position of UMNO deputy leader - Mr
Ghafar Babar, the present incumbent, and Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance
minister.
A genial, rotund man who makes no claims to great intellectualism, Mr
Ghafar, 68, describes himself as 'just a kampong (village) boy'. He has been
an UMNO party stalwart for many years. Look at the old black and white
pictures of the early Malay leaders and Mr Ghafar is there, urging the
crowds to fight for independence from British colonial rule.
More recently Mr Ghafar has proved himself as a Mahathir loyalist. Renowned
for his political contacts with UMNO's traditional bedrock of support in
rural areas, Mr Ghafar was used by the prime minister to build up a new,
Mahathir aligned, UMNO after a party split in 1987-88.
Earlier this year Mr Ghafar was at the forefront of pushing through
controversial constitutional reforms limiting the powers of the sultans, the
Malay rulers.
Mr Anwar is a very different politician, said to represent the 'Malay baru'
 -or the new breed of Malay. The finance minister, still only in his mid
forties, has had a meteoric rise through the party ranks, propelled in no
small way by Dr Mahathir.
He was once regarded as a firebrand and, as a former head of ABIM, the
Islamic youth movement, a vocal government critic. For a time in the mid
1970s the present finance minister was detained under Malaysia's powerful
internal security act.
His image has changed since those days. To visitors he is genial and
relaxed, his conversation ranging from literature and music to the problems
of third world debt.
But no one doubts the presence of an extremely astute and ambitious
politician behind the finance minister's urbane exterior.
Mr Anwar is felt to reflect the opinions and aspirations of an increasingly
powerful part of the Malay community - the urbanised, sophisticated Malays
who, it is felt, will be at the forefront of the country's next economic
leap forward.
Dr Mahathir has said he would prefer if Mr Ghafar's position as party number
two were not challenged in the November elections. But for once it seems the
prime minister's word is not being obeyed.
Mr Ghafar's and Mr Anwar's political stormtroopers are already out in the
towns and countryside rounding up support.
Some have warned of a party schism. Mr Anwar has said he is a Mahathir
loyalist - but feels he must obey party sentiment and stand for election.
'There will be no disunity in UMNO,' said Mr Anwar announcing his candidacy
earlier this month.
Meanwhile Mr Ghafar seems determined to retain his post, and with it the
possibility of becoming Malaysia's next prime minister. 'I don't care if
anyone says that I'm not prime ministerial stuff but please don't think that
I'm not qualified enough to handle UMNO's deputy presidential post or even
the presidential post,' says Mr Ghafar. 'I have been in UMNO long enough. I
know exactly what UMNO is all about. I will defend the post even if only two
party divisions nominate me.'
Each candidate has his powerful backers, with the older hands in cabinet
generally favouring Mr Ghafar, the younger, rising stars such as the state
chief ministers, backing Mr Anwar.
At a rally in Kuala Lumpur about 8,000 turned up to voice support for Mr
Ghafar. Less than friendly words are being exchanged between the two sides.
There is open talk of 'money politics' with funds being used to influence
delegates' voting patterns. Mr Anwar, in particular, is charged with
accumulating a vast monetary war chest to further his cause - a charge he
vigorously denies.
But it is clear that the impact of these elections is being felt well
outside UMNO ranks. Politics and business have long been closely related in
Malaysia. Though the UMNO leadership denies party involvement in business,
the party is immensely rich. Brokers - and corporate leaders - talk openly
of 'UMNO connected companies'. Stock market analysts look as much at who is
in or out of political favour as they do at company balance sheets in
assessing market performance.
Race remains a key factor in Malaysia's political life. To an outsider it
might appear strange that UMNO - a party which is, as its name implies,
strictly Malay - is alone deciding who will run the country. The Chinese,
Indians and other races, who together make up nearly 50 per cent of the
population, are not involved in the process.
The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress
(MIC), are UMNO's main partners in the Barisan Nasional. But neither party
has much political clout.
'If you are a rich or ambitious Chinese or Indian you don't get involved
with MCA or MIC politics,' says a local academic. 'Instead you quietly seek
to align yourself with the main forces in UMNO - and give generously to UMNO
party funds.'
Opposition is limited to the Democratic Action Party (DAP), headed by
veteran Chinese politician Mr Lim Kit Siang, and remnants of the old UMNO
headed by Mr Razaleigh Hamzah, once a close colleague of Dr Mahathir, but
now a fierce critic.
The Barisan Nasional has 127 of the 180 seats in the lower house of
parliament and the opposition parties can do little but snipe at Dr
Mahathir's government.
The DAP says there is an increasingly undemocratic trend in Malaysia, citing
Dr Mahathir's enthusiasm for tinkering with the constitution as evidence
that the basis of the country's democracy is being undermined. The DAP has
also been forthright in attacking what it considers to be the increasingly
cosy relations between senior government figures and leading businesspeople.
The Barisan Nasional faces a more formidable opposition threat at state
level - in the northern state of Kelantan, where the strongly Islamic Parti
Islam Malaysia (PAS) holds power, and in Sabah in East Malaysia, which is
controlled by the Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS).
Dr Mahathir remains deeply suspicious of any opposition to his rule and has
made considerable efforts to undermine both PAS and the PBS. But in deeply
conservative Kelantan PAS remains strong. In Sabah, some senior politicians
formerly aligned with UMNO have switched to join the PBS.
While not a direct threat to the Barisan Nasional's rule, such developments
are worrisome for Dr Mahathir's government. Many analysts forecast an early
general election being called in the first half of next year: UMNO would not
only seek to renew Dr Mahathir's mandate but also to unite the party after
what many fear will be a bruising and divisive internal election contest.
Dr Mahathir himself tries to play down the intensity of political feeling
within UMNO. 'It might look like a bubbling cauldron of political activity
but I don't think it's all that bad,' he said.
'We (in UMNO) are quite rational people. We have been quite rational all
this while. We don't have that kind of very violent antagonism towards each
other or total inability to work with each other,' said Dr Mahathir.
Not everyone would agree.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (1): Sweet smell of success - For five
years Malaysia's GDP has grown by more than 8 per cent a year as it switched
to manufacturing from a commodities-based economy. But it is now proving
much harder to capture overseas investment for its next phase of expansion
</HEADLINE>

THE earth movers and diggers are hard at work on the old racetrack in the
centre of Kuala Lumpur. A new city centre is being built which will include
what is being billed as one of the world's tallest buildings - a 450 metre
twin tower complex which, when completed in 1996, will be higher than New
York's World Trade Centre or the Sears Tower in Chicago.
Critics say the city centre project is proof that the government of Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, is carried away by its own economic
success, full of grandiose, ill conceived, schemes.
To the government and its many supporters, the new city centre will be a
monument to the new Malaysia, a country standing tall with its economy
growing to join the ranks of industrialised nations.
Even the critics cannot ignore the considerable progress made in Malaysia in
recent years. Overall GDP has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the
last five years.
Malaysia has been transformed from a commodity based to a manufacturing
economy. In the mid 1960s tin and rubber accounted for nearly 80 per cent of
export earnings. Last year the manufacturing sector accounted for 70 per
cent of the value of exports.
'There is no doubt that had we remained with tin and rubber, we would be a
basket case today,' said Dr Mahathir recently. 'Moving into manufacturing
saved us.'
Living standards have improved: per capita incomes have increased from
Dollars 350 in 1970 to nearly Dollars 3,000 last year.
Foreign investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Malaysia,
attracted by the country's political stability and its generally low wage
regime.
The government's goal now - called 'Vision 2020' - is full industrialisation
by the year 2020 - with an economic growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the
next 27 years. There are few more compelling images of modern Malaysia than
that of Dr Mahathir, sitting confidently in the back of his official
limousine, a Malaysia made Proton car: the number plate on the car is 2020.
But there are those who question whether Dr Mahathir's vision can be turned
into reality.
One of the key factors in Malaysia's recent success has been foreign
investment. In 1990/91 foreign companies were investing about MDollars 17bn
(Dollars 6.6bn) per year in Malaysia, representing well over half annual
total investments.
In the first six months of 1993 foreign investments were only MDollars
1.6bn.
The continuing problems being faced by the industrialised countries is one
reason for the decline in inward investment. But Malaysia is also in danger
of losing out in the competitiveness stakes, particularly to the fast
emerging economies in the region such as China and Vietnam.
Recently productivity has not been keeping pace with wage rises. This not
only deters investors - it also jeopardises Malaysia's export
competitiveness.
Dr Mahathir and his officials constantly preach the need to restrain wage
increases. Union activity is strictly controlled. But having been told so
often of their country's economic success, workers want to have a share of
the benefits.
The situation is exacerbated by growing labour shortages which, in many
industries, have become a serious impediment to further growth.
The short term solution is the government's tacit acceptance of about 1m
illegal foreign workers in the country. But the long term presence of such a
large group of foreigners could lead to serious social problems and upset
Malaysia's delicate racial balance.
The more lasting solution proposed by the government is to go into more
capital intensive, sophisticated, value added industries - much as Singapore
decided to do some years ago. But while Malaysia has developed expertise in
a number of fields - mainly in the commodities sector - much of its industry
still lacks depth and know how.
The problems are well recognised. 'Malaysia is lamentably weak in research
and the application of new technology,' says Dr Mahathir.
Education is a problem area. For the next phase of its development Malaysia
needs an ever bigger pool of highly qualified engineers, technicians and
managers. But these are not being produced in anything like sufficient
numbers.
Government critics blame the New Economic Policy (NEP), introduced in the
early 1970s, for many present problems. The NEP emphasised discrimination in
favour of the Malays, the dominant racial group in the country. The Chinese,
who make up about 35 per cent of the population, controlled most economic
activity in the country. The idea was to give the Malays a greater share of
the economic cake.
The policy was a partial success. According to official figures Malays
controlled about 20 per cent of corporate equity by 1990.
But critics say the NEP gave rise to more problems than it solved. With
Malays favoured in education, for jobs in both government and the private
sector, a large measure of competitiveness was removed from the system and
standards fell. Meanwhile the Chinese, Indians and other groups were made to
feel like second class citizens.
The NEP is also blamed for giving rise to an uncompetitive business culture.
Dr Mahathir himself frequently berates the Malays for their 'get rich quick'
attitude and their lack of entrepreneurial zeal.
Government policy has now changed, emphasising growth rather than
discrimination as the principal means of achieving a level of economic
equality between the races. But the old ways live on. In business, political
connections with the Malay dominated government are often more important
than commercial competitiveness.
In part economic success has helped alleviate some of the tensions between
the races. But there is still a question mark over whether government policy
has made Malaysia a more equal, less racially segregated society.
The Chinese still control a large slice of the country's economic life and
sit on a considerable pile of capital. That capital now needs to be invested
in the country's future.
The government speaks of the need to 'wean' the country off foreign
investment and depend more on domestic capital resources. But many Chinese
remain hesitant, still wondering about their place in Malaysian society.
Last year domestic investment fell by more than 30 per cent and shows signs
of an even steeper fall this year.
Sensitivities about racial or political questions and a heavily government
influenced media mean that there is little or no public debate on these
issues. Government opponents accuse the government of sensing conspiracy in
any criticism - even when things have gone obviously wrong.
In March it was revealed that Bank Negara, the central bank, had incurred a
'paper loss' of about MDollars 12.8bn (Dollars 4bn) last year, most of it
due to speculations on the foreign exchange markets.
Dr Mahathir dismissed criticism of the bank's operations. Opposition calls
for a full inquiry into the bank's activities were brushed aside. Yet there
is no doubting the disquiet the issue caused in both the local and foreign
financial community.
Sensitivity to criticism is also evident in Malaysia's dealings with the
outside world. Dr Mahathir has tilted at many windmills: he continues to
attack the industrialised world, the US in particular, for what he considers
to be double standards on human rights and environmental questions.
Malaysia remains deeply suspicious of what it feels is a protectionist trade
campaign directed against developing countries by the richer nations.
Dr Mahathir continues to lobby hard for recognition of an 'East Asia
Economic Caucus' (EAEC) - to counter the activities of perceived western
trading blocs. Other nations in the region tend to feel Malaysia has, at
times, a rather exaggerated view of its own importance and do not
necessarily share Dr Mahathir's views. So far the EAEC has met with a only a
guarded response.
But, hubris or not, Malaysia marches on. Its economy seems likely to grow at
close to 8 per cent again this year. Kuala Lumpur's new city centre project
is going ahead full steam.
Malaysia is still breathless from its first sprint up the economic ladder.
But as it loses many of the competitive advantages it has enjoyed in the
past, the upward climb will get considerably tougher.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Read Clinton's lips: No more welfare: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's pledge to 'end welfare as we know it' was one of
the most popular lines in last year's election campaign. His idea of a
strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters (especially
'Reagan democrats') not just as a way of cutting government spending and
thus reducing taxes, but as a solution to the nation's most pressing social
problems.
In the American mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban
decay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. By promising
radical welfare reform, Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal
message: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban
society.
Since becoming president, Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare,
raising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former
President George Bush's 'read my lips: no new taxes' pledge.
The White House insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just
had to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities: the deficit
reduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform
scheduled for September. It claims both measures will help shift people off
welfare by 'making work pay.'
The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a
kind of negative income tax). This gives poor working families a cash bonus
of up to Dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid
jobs. If healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers,
welfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that
they stand to lose their health care benefits.
In addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of
welfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to
support their children financially.
Such measures should help. But they are hardly going to solve America's
welfare problem, which differs substantially from that in Europe.
In keeping with Franklin Roosevelt's dictum that a permanent dole is 'a
narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit', the US has never provided
permanent welfare support for single, able-bodied adults. When pundits talk
of a 'culture of welfare' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn
spent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, a benefit received by 5m
single-parent families. The objection is not that some families in
straitened circumstances need AFDC as a short-term prop, but that half of
those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life.
So what should Mr Clinton do?
Many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit. Once people
accept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely, they argue,
behaviour will change. Teenagers will stop having babies and start
recognising the economic advantages of marriage. Those whose welfare
benefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand
over children for adoption. At first the adjustment will be horribly painful
but in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive
lifestyles will no longer be underwritten. With its economic life support
system (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel.
But no modern president would contemplate so brutal a social experiment. If
welfare stops, something has to take its place. One suggestion is that Mr
Clinton should follow the example of Roosevelt's Works Progress
Administration, an agency that at its peak created over 3m public sector
jobs. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer
of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage.
Mothers with young children would also be offered state child care
facilities. According to one advocate, this would amount to replacing the
welfare state by the 'work ethic state'.
This solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits. But it
would involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps
Dollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the Clinton administration is willing
to spend on welfare reform.
Fortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton: the bipartisan
Family Support Act of 1988, which he helped steer through Congress. This
recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set
targets for the gradual introduction of 'workfare'. Next year states will
receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of
the 'employable' welfare case load is working or in training programmes; by
1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent. These seemingly undemanding
targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take
jobs at some point during the year.
Mr Clinton could tighten the definition of 'employable', so as to include
mothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding
workfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare
recipients should be working or in training by the year 2000. Such a
gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective. The only
trouble is that it falls far short of the presidential promise to 'end
welfare as we know it'. Like Mr Bush, Mr Clinton may have raised
expecta-tions that simply cannot be met.

FT  31 AUG 93 / China's wounded spirits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Saturday night in a gloomy Beijing hall. Dozens of men and women line
the walls, observing and chatting while a few couples waltz to the music of
Strauss.
This is a Beijing singles club, and the atmosphere could hardly be further
removed from the raucous karaoke bar culture that has mushroomed in Chinese
cities: nor does the scene bear much relation to the image of modern China
projected by the media.
To an extent, the club is a casualty ward of the enormous social change
sweeping China that is producing its share of wounded spirits and broken
dreams. Madam Wen, a 37-year-old accountant, becomes tearful as she explains
that, after 12 years of marriage, her husband has abandoned her for another
woman. 'Traditional values are being swept away,' she says.
Madam Wang Xingjuan, a women's activist and founder of the Beijing singles
club, believes that, while economic liberalisation and opening to the
outside world have brought many benefits to China, some women have been
victims of change.
For a start, the divorce rate has gone up sharply, especially in urban
centres like Beijing, rising from 2.1 per cent of marriages in 1981 to 17.7
per cent in 1992. Nationally, marriage failures reached 8.7 per cent last
year, low by international standards, but a big increase on previous rates
and still rising.
One of the main causes of the rapid increase in the divorce rate, according
to Madam Wang, is growing affluence, which is loosening family bonds. 'Men
are better off and are looking for lovers. They are losing their sense of
responsibility,' she says. 'They are being influenced by western television
programmes with their sexy scenes. Extramarital sex is commonplace.'
Prostitution on a fairly big scale has also returned to Chinese cities,
perhaps further complicating family relationships. According to Madam Wang,
some 200,000 prostitutes were detained last year throughout China, but she
estimates that numbers of prostitutes nationwide exceed 1m.
Reaction to a National Women's Hot Line reveals a widespread desperation
among urban women over the enormous change in their lives. While life might
have been fairly drab in the past, there was more certainty, more stability.
Forty per cent of callers wish to talk about marriage problems, including
divorce. Madam Wang and her assistants urge conciliation, but if the
marriage has broken down irretrievably they advocate divorce, which has
become much simpler in China since the passage in 1980 of a new divorce law.
Previously, social and political pressures, plus the difficulty of securing
legal approval for a divorce, had condemned many unhappy couples to stay
together. During the Mao era divorce was denounced as bourgeois, and the
careers of those who dared to separate were jeopard-ised.
Madam Chen Yiyun, a sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
and one of China's leading researchers on women's issues, says that, before
China's opening to the outside world in 1978, there were basically two
categories of women: urban and rural. Now she identifies four types of urban
women.
These include those who have gone into business themselves or who work for
joint venture companies; middle-aged women who are relatively uneducated and
who have most difficulty coping with change; professional women who are
established and do not feel threatened by the changes; and older women whose
marriages and lives are fairly settled, and therefore are relatively
unaffected.
It is women in the second category who are proving most vulnerable. 'Many of
these middle-aged women feel lost and confused,' says Madam Chen. 'Many have
worked in state-run factories, but have been fired. It's very hard for them
to find a job, and start a new life.' Estimates suggest there are 20m excess
labourers in Chinese factories, 70 per cent of whom are women.
Another problem in urban Chinese society is the surfeit of well-educated
single women, and this in turn is adding to pressures on existing families.
This excess of women in their 30s and early 40s can be attributed to several
factors, among them that many young men sent to the countryside in the 1960s
during the Cultural Revolution never returned to the cities. Thousands of
men have also drifted away from cities like Beijing to make their fortunes
in the booming southern coastal towns like Shenzhen and Hainan island.
Of the 1,000 members of the Beijing singles club, 60 per cent are women, and
almost all are professionals. Most, if not all, are looking for a husband.
Typical is 39-year-old Miss Sun, a magazine editor, who feels under pressure
from her family to marry, but has been unable to find the right man.
'The situation is difficult for women today in Chinese society,' she says.
'We are still governed by traditional values, where society looks up to men
and down on women. In the allocation of housing, for example, women are
always last to get their own place.' Miss Sun is obliged to live in a
dormitory, sharing a room with another girl.
Madam Chen says that while it seems that men have benefited from the radical
changes in Chinese society more than women, many men are feeling stressed by
the pressures of the new consumer age.
'You get so much, earn so much, but you also sacrifice so much,' she says.
'Men are complaining that their wives are buying more clothes and cosmetics.
Before, men did not feel so pressured.'
At the Beijing club each Saturday, couples in their best clothes dance on,
hoping that this might be their lucky day.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The FT Interview: Germany's young pretender - Rudolf
Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the wall of the state premier's office in Mainz, capital of Germany's
Rhineland-Palatinate, hangs a large and rather faded Gobelin tapestry. It
has been there since the days when Mr Helmut Kohl, German chancellor, was
the first man in the Land.
I confess that I don't find it very beautiful,' says Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the current incumbent of the office. 'I'm planning to replace it with this,'
he says, producing from behind his desk an austere but striking Andy Warhol
original, recently presented by a friend.
The painting features three champagne glasses, two of them overturned, one
upright. 'It seems rather appropriate,' he says.
Just so. For Mr Scharping emerged in June as the clear victor in a three-way
race for the leadership of Germany's opposition Social Democrats. Since then
he has moved rapidly to consolidate his position, persuading his principal
rivals to back him as party candidate for Chancellor.
The fact that he has still not quite set his personal seal on his office in
Mainz, since he defeated Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in state
elections in April 1991, is also perhaps appropriate. For his sights are now
set on Bonn, and the race to displace Mr Kohl in next year's national
elections.
It is going to be an uphill struggle, the young pretender against the old
campaigner. The SPD has been floundering in the opinion polls, locked in
inner-party debates, and shaken by the resignation of its former leader, Mr
Bjo rn Engholm, because of a local political scandal, just when it should
have been leading the CDU. The economy is in the doldrums; unification, Mr
Kohl's great achievement, is proving painful in both east and west; and Mr
Kohl himself, in office for 11 years, is blamed for lack of leadership.
Yet Mr Scharping, dapper, neatly-bearded and articulate, but uninspiring in
delivery, immodestly sees his own election as SPD leader  - in the first
poll of grassroots party members - as a potential turning-point. He could be
right.
'The SPD is suddenly more hopeful,' he says. 'June 13 (the day of the
leadership poll) was a great relief. All this discontent and anxiety, if not
completely wiped out, has at least become much less important. Now we must
try to use this new enthusiasm.'
He has to overcome the natural inclination of the left-wing Social Democrats
to self-destruct in internecine warfare; to counter the impression that
social democracy has no role, since the collapse of communism; and to
shake-off an immediate inclination of the media to label him as a
mini-Helmut Kohl - a cautious man of consensus and career politician,
leading from behind.
Since June he has shown he can act decisively, swiftly appointing an
election team to unite the the party.
Now he has to deal with the issues, and raise his public profile. It is
easier said than done. Last week he suffered his first reverse, when his
party colleagues refused to back a move to relax their objections to the
Bundeswehr (military) becoming a full participant in UN operations.
'It is embarrassing,' he admits, 'but it is also absurd that a significant
part of our whole debate on foreign relations should be concerned
exclusively with military matters: that is a dangerous limitation. A foreign
policy which fails to keep focused on the economic, social and political
stabilisation of eastern Europe, which loses sight of the north-south
divide, and therefore loses sight of the real causes of worldwide migration
of peoples, that is no foreign policy at all.'
He argues that the answer lies in strengthening the UN itself. 'As it gets
stronger, and its activities become UN activities, and not merely the
extended arm of a single member state, then it will be easier to see its
activities as part of a genuine common security. That is a concept the SPD
has always had in mind.'
The next tough issue he has to deal with is the question of curbing the
explosion of social welfare costs. He knows that his party cannot continue
simply to oppose all cuts in social spending, at a time when the budget
deficit, fuelled by the costs of unification, is soaring.
'The government is trying to cut social spending at the expense of the
people who can least afford it, the homeless and the unemployed,' he says.
'That is unacceptable. It won't create more jobs or houses. We need to ask
what payments are necessary, which people need them, and at what income
level should they be paid.' That means more means testing. As a state
premier responsible for attracting investment to his own area, he is acutely
conscious of the debate over the high costs, and declining competitiveness,
of Germany as an investment location. He does not think the answer lies in
going back to a 40-hour week. He does think there should be far more
flexibility.
'Some international companies are much more imaginative about this than the
political establishment,' he says, citing the example of IBM in Mainz.
He sees the idea of 'social dumping' - seeking to attract new investment by
offering lower wage costs, including social costs, to companies - as
self-defeating. 'It won't work in Germany, France, the Benelux countries or
Great Britain,' he says.
He wants the Maastricht treaty put into effect, and he wants Britain to sign
on to the social chapter. 'But I don't have any advice to give,' he insists.
'Britain must decide for itself.' As for economic and monetary union,
'Nobody in Europe should make themselves slaves to a timetable.'
What European co-operation needs to focus on is joint action to tackle the
technological deficit. 'I remember 15 years ago books appeared in the US
calling Europe the sclerotic continent. We were dying of old age, and would
perish. It has not happened.
'But I am in favour of the Europeans discovering their common interests. One
problem we all share is that in product innovation we must make greater
efforts. We should do that together. Our key industries of the future, like
micro-technology, computers, electronics, genetic technology and
bio-technology, are too weak. We cannot just sit back. If we do, we will
learn very painfully that these strengths can be acquired by others, too.'
Mr Scharping's predecessor as SPD leader, Mr Engholm, was probably more
telegenic. He was also an instinctively gloomy, pipe-smoking northerner. Mr
Scharping doesn't fiddle with a pipe. Instead, he sits calmly eating a peach
in the middle of the interview.
Unlike Mr Engholm, he also knows the dangers of excessive pessimism. It lost
the SPD the last election, because they spelt out the costs of unification
all too bluntly.
'There are far too many people in Germany who just talk in terms of tasks
and problems and difficulties, and not about opportunities and challenges,'
he says. 'I don't underplay the problems, but for me, unification is not
just an historic opportunity, it is also an extraordinary challenge.
'That should not prevent one saying what needs to be done, in order to turn
that opportunity into reality. Most people who vote in elections are voting
for a hope, for a vision of a future, not a reckoning with the past. It's
the job of the SPD to give a realistic hope for the future.'
The media is obsessed with the likelihood of Scharping and Kohl working
together in a grand coalition after the next election. But the SPD man won't
be drawn. 'The chances are very small,' he says. 'The polls don't tell us
much about what could happen next year. If I believed the polls I would
never be sitting here.
'Things will only get better in Germany if the SPD gets stronger. That is
what I am concentrating on right now. Whoever eventually may offer to help
the SPD take power, that can be decided after the next elections.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE recent debacle in the European exchange rate mechanism, there are
signs that the market's attention could focus more intensely on the dollar,
writes James Blitz.
The US currency appeared to be at a turning point against the D-Mark on
Friday night. For the second day running, it closed below the DM1.67 level
against the German currency.
Some analysts have seen that as an important level. The dollar spent the
first six months of this year trying to break through that chart point.
Two sets of data in the US will determine whether the dollar chooses the
upside or downside from this level. Tomorrow's National Association of
Purchasing Managers' survey could point to only moderate output growth.
An even more significant indicator will be the August non-farm payroll, with
the market expecting a rise of 150,000 on the month.
This is regularly seen as the most important indicator for the dollar in the
US market. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS, believes a
strong figure will give the US currency strong support.
The research team at Swiss Bank is more sceptical about the dollar. In its
new weekly bulletin on investment strategy, Swiss Bank forecasts that a
break towards or below its year-end target of DM1.60 will take place next
month.
Much will depend, of course, on data coming out of Germany. The Bundesbank
has given a very strong indication that it intends to keep policy on hold
for some time. However, the industrial output indicator for July is due out
this week.
This is expected to show an 8 per cent drop on the year, adding to pressure
on the Bundesbank to stimulate the German economy by easing interest rates.

FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow starts new week mildly
firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended slightly firmer after moderate trading yesterday,
aided by stronger overseas markets and further declines in domestic bond
yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.36 at 3,643.99. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.36 higher at 461.90, while
the American SE composite gained 1.28 at 456.27 and the Nasdaq composite
added 3.31 at 737.38. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 194m
shares.
At the end of last week, profit-taking brought leading indices a few points
down from their record highs, so analysts were expecting this week to start
on an upbeat note. Those expectations were met, partly due to gains in
Japanese, German and French equity markets, and to fresh strength in the US
bond market.
In recent months lower bond yields have been the main driving force behind
the equity markets' record-breaking run, and yesterday the benchmark 30-year
government bond edged higher once again, lowering the yield on the issue to
6.115 per cent, near its historic low.
The day's only major economic news - the 5.0 per cent drop in July new home
sales - had no apparent impact upon investor sentiment. Investors will get a
much better picture of the state of the economy later this week when a raft
of key data, including second-quarter real gross domestic product and the
August employment report, is released.
Technology issues were in demand, with Motorola firming Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 96 1/2 , IBM adding Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 44 5/8 , Digital
Equipment rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 and Compaq, which launched
new models on one of its range of personal computers and lowered prices on
others, gaining Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 .
Chubb fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 88 1/4 as investors responded to news
that the big insurance company will be taking an after-tax charge of Dollars
358m, or Dollars 3.95 a share, in the third quarter to cover an agreement
that one of its units has struck to settle certain asbestos-related
insurance claims.
Profit-taking took the shine off car manufacturing issues, which were among
the market leaders last week. Chrysler eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4
, Ford shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 and General Motors dipped Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 47.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars
33 1/2 in volume of 3.5m shares after broking house Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette upgraded its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'moderately
attractive', citing the strength and breadth of the company's products.
Other technology stocks were also firmer, with Microsoft up Dollars 3/4 at
Dollars 72 5/8 , Intel Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 64 and Sun
Microsystems Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 25 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a small rise in relatively light trading. The TSE 300 index
finished 5.4 higher at another record closing peak of 4,138.8 as advances
led declines by 382 to 330 after volume of 45.6m shares.
The gold shares index added 1.44 per cent as the New York bullion price
gained USDollars 1 an ounce. Minings also registered a solid gain.

FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris equities soar to another
record close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of UK traders for the August bank holiday affected bourse
turnover, writes Our Markets Staff, leading in some cases to increased
sensitivity at share price level.
PARIS, hoping for an interest rate cut by the Bank of France, which failed
to materialise, nevertheless maintained its heady optimism for economic
recovery, and the CAC-40 index soared to another record close. The index
advanced 21.79, or 1 per cent, to 2,205.67 in turnover of FFr2.7bn.
Even a rise in unemployment data, which came in at a record high of some
3.2m, did not dent the market's enthusiasm, as the Matif also rose to unseen
levels. Some technical trading ahead of today's expiry of August futures and
options was another contributory factor behind the gains.
There were technical reasons, too, for the rise in St Gobain and L'Oreal
stock, with the index weighting of the two groups due to be increased today
as new shares are listed. St Gobain rose FFr7 to FFr584 and L'Oreal FFr27 to
FFr1,183.
Canal Plus was one of the day's few fallers, off FFr7 to FFr1,295, as the
government announced plans to raise the limit on stakes held in television
companies from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.
FRANKFURT overcame a couple of minor disappointments to close higher, led by
Allianz on technical grounds and Daimler on fundamentals. The DAX index rose
17.29 to 1,921.89 with Allianz up DM58 at DM2,570 and Daimler DM18.50 higher
at DM748.50 - both at new highs for the year.
Turnover fell from DM6.7bn to DM5.8bn. DB Research said that it liked the
Allianz chart, now that the insurer has broken firmly through the DM2,500
level; a technical analyst saw the next resistance level at DM2,800.
Daimler figured in a weekend report by Manager magazine which said that its
Mercedes operating unit wanted to cut costs by DM3bn in the current year, in
addition to job cuts already announced. Daimler said there was nothing new
of substance in the report.
Hoechst, the third of the big three chemical groups to report half year
profits, lost DM1.10 to DM280.10 after a 31 per cent fall at pre-tax level.
Some traders called this marginally disappointing; others said that the
results were in line with expectations after the BASF and Bayer declines
last week.
A more dramatic fall was seen at Linotype-Hell, the printing machinery
company, which lost DM32 to a new 1993 low of DM378 after a heavy first half
loss. It recovered from an intraday low of DM365 after the company announced
a wide-ranging job cuts programme to reduce its workforce by 15 per cent.
ZURICH featured recovery hopes at the employment agency group, Adia, and the
forecast of a marked 1993 loss at the telecommunications equipment
manufacturer, Ascom, as the SMI index maintained its equilibrium to close
2.5 higher at 2,481.0.
Both Adia and Ascom had been seen as turnround situations, said Mr Frederick
Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank in Zurich, but yesterday's news sent them in
opposite directions with Adia SFr4 higher at SFr175 and Ascom SFr70, or 5.3
per cent lower at SFr1,250.
AMSTERDAM set new records, with the CBS Tendency index gaining 1.8 or 1.4
per cent to 129.9. The financial sector was strong following ABN Amro's good
results last week: its shares advanced Fl 2.00 to Fl 69.20, while ING was up
Fl 2.20 to Fl 73.90.
IHC Caland, the dredging group, added Fl 2.50 to Fl 38.00 in advance of a
forecast of 14 per cent profits growth in 1993, which came after the close.
MILAN saw some activity in Montedison and Ferfin as the former's
shareholders meeting was held, with the latter's due today. Montedison
picked up L41 or 5 per cent to L845 as fears that there might be an
announcement of a merger between the two groups abated. Ferfin's shares
advanced L4.75 to L245.
The Comit index rose by 4.95 to 632.86.
Analysts at InterEuropa added that strength in banks yesterday might also
have been due to a number of foreign investors coming into the market. Banca
Commerciale rose L47 to L5,432 and Credito Italiano L70 to L2,850.
BRUSSELS sounded despondent as the Bel-20 index ended 8.88 down at 1,306.25
in lower than usual turnover of BFr704m. The market has retreated from the
highs it achieved nearly three weeks ago; some dealers said that investors
were unwilling to move on Belgian shares until the country's social pact is
on track, and a solution is found to its burgeoning pubic debt.
STOCKHOLM's equities, especially its interest rate sensitive ones, defied a
rise in bond yields as the Affarsvarlden general index recovered 22.00, or
1.7 per cent to 1,292.20 with the financial index up 4.4 per cent.
Volvo Bs closed SKr14 better at SKr484 on speculation about a merger with
the French Renault, and on last week's unexpectedly strong six-month
earnings report.
VIENNA continued to move forward, although prices ended off earlier highs.
The ATX index rose 3.51 to 1,007.75.
WARSAW fell by some 7 per cent as as investors took profits after the
market's recent heavy gains. The WIG index fell 503.4 to 6,970.7 in active
turnover of 1,000bn zlotys.
The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the
holiday in the UK.

HOPES of an imminent cut in the official discount rate helped the Nikkei
average to register its fifth consecutive gain, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 121.01 to 20,912.69. Index-linked trading supported activity
in the morning session, but lost steam later, the index falling to a day's
low of 20,747.67 in the afternoon before rising to a high of 20,924.09 just
before the close.
Volume came to 205m shares and advances led declines by 615 to 332, with 217
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 7.09 at
1,677.63.
Market participants hoped that the government's flotation of East Japan
Railway shares, which will be listed in October, would revive trading. The
public offering price for the 1.4m shares was fixed at Y380,000 after the
market closed.
Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, firmed Y5 to Y839, supported by hopes
about the government's investment in telecommunication infrastructure, and
the company's development of a shopping cart with a scanner which reads bar
codes. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone appreciated Y8,000 to Y955,000.
Strong demand in semiconductor chips boosted Nikon, which climbed Y12 to
Y937. The company is likely to revise upwards its sales forecasts
forchipmaking equipment for the year to next March.
Housing issues were strong on hopes of renewed demand in the near term.
Sekisui House rose Y30 to Y1,440 and Daiwa House Y40 to Y1,710.
Steels were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel shed Y6 to Y375 and
Kawasaki Steel lost Y9 to Y365.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 27.50 to 22,773.75 in volume of 20.2m shares.
Roundup
THE REGION was quiet and mixed yesterday, reflecting the UK holiday and
other closures in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.
AUSTRALIA set a six-year high, the All Ordinaries index adding 7.4 at
1,956.0, its best since before the global stock market crash in October
1987.
Turnover fell from ADollars 810m to ADollars 366m, but brokers reported
US-based buying on a combination of a higher gold bullion price and a
favourable interpretation of Australia's current account deficit.
Media stocks were among the star performers, the media shares sub-index
rising 265.1, or 1.8 per cent, to 14,353.0 after weekend claims that they
were undervalued. News Corp moved forward 10 cents to ADollars 10.04 and
John Fairfax was 19 cents higher at ADollars 2.95.
SEOUL tumbled in thin trading as it extended last week's 6 per cent decline,
the composite index falling a further 17.70, or 2.6 per cent, to 672.12 in
volume of 12.9m shares.
Share prices were hit by speculation that the government will not include
measures to boost the stock market today when it unveils a package of
follow-up measures aimed at minimising the adverse effect of the newly
enforced financial system, requiring the use of proper identities in all
financial transactions.
NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by falls in Telecom, Carter Holt Harvey and
Fletcher Challenge, although Brierley Investments bucked the trend, rising 4
cents to a 1993 high of NZDollars 1.25 on speculation about a large asset
sale, later denied by chief executive Mr Paul Collins. The NZSE-40 index
finished 14.40 down at 1,984.10 in turnover of NZDollars 65m.
SINGAPORE consolidated, a 12.82 fall to 1,995.10 in the Straits Times
Industrial index aggravated by a decline in Metro Holdings, which traded
ex-rights for the first time.
MANILA was lifted by Friday's advance of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 in
Philippine Long Distance Telephone on the American Stock Exchange. The
composite index rose 10.28 to 1,776.07.
BOMBAY, closed today for a Moslem holiday, fell 35.17 to 2,633.79 in thin
trading.

FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan's hopes rise for a second-half
rally - Prospects favour equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's equity market could be ready for an upturn helped by improved
prospects for export-oriented manufacturers and financial companies.
Confidence may also revive on political grounds: worries over a possible
split in the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party were eased earlier this month.
Some analysts believe that the TSE weighted index could again reach the
5,000 level that it hit at the beginning of April this year, although others
more cautiously forecast a move to about 4,400.
Since April the index has fallen back, before stabilising around the 3,800
to 4,100 area, closing yesterday at 3,923.
The market's prospects may also be helped by a recommendation last week by
Baring Securities, rating Taiwan as the most attractive of the world's
emerging markets, with performance in the short term being assisted by the
strength of the dollar.
The market's first-quarter rally coincided with the resignation of Mr Hau
Pei-tsun as prime minister and his replacement by Mr Lien Chan, who has
adopted a more pro-business style of government.
However, indications of an economic slowdown emerged in the second quarter,
while the start of an economic contraction in mainland China also hurt a
number of manufacturing companies exporting to or investing there.
As a result, the weighted index fell back, recording a year's low of
3,135.56 on July 7.
Earlier hopes for brighter economic prospects in the second half have been
dampened by the most recent government forecast, which anticipates a slight
decline in growth in the last six months of the year. Nevertheless, the
recent depreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against the US dollar has
begun to have a positive impact on export orders.
'This factor will boost the performance of export-oriented sectors, such as
electronics,' says Mr George Hou, deputy manager of the fund department of
Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management. He adds that the performance
of Taiwanese electronics companies will also be helped by the intense
competition raging in the personal computer sector in the US and Japan.
'US and Japanese makers are coming to Taiwan to order low cost but high
quality components, or to set up original equipment manufacturing
arrangements,' he notes.
The most positive development for equities has been the recent decision by
the Central Bank of China to relax its usually tight monetary policy in an
effort to spur a sluggish economy.
Mr Lin Yung-kui, manager of SG Warburg's research department in Taipei,
believes that this decision will be 'a very major factor' in boosting the
market.
The Central Bank of China began to lower interest rates on secured loans
from banks to encourage local banks to reduce their own rates.
But after major local banks showed a reluctance to make rate reductions, the
CBC relaxed selective credit restrictions on August 14. These had been
imposed in February 1990 to cool speculation in equities, the property
sector and foreign exchange markets at a time when the TSE hit its all-time
high of more than 12,000.
'This measure, and lower deposit rates, will make stock market investments
more attractive,' says Mr Hou.
Taipei is also trying to attract more foreign capital into the local market,
mainly through liberalising the regulatory environment.
Mr Yu Ping-nan, assistant general manager of CBC's foreign exchange bureau,
says the bank, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, decided to introduce several measures to encourage
foreign investment in the equity market.
Mr Yu says the Ministry of Finance will soon announce a rise in the total
quota for investment by foreign securities houses in the stock market from
Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 5bn. Approved foreign securities investment has
already surpassed Dollars 2.1bn.
'Foreign investment is far below the proposed new quota, but the move
indicates a positive attitude,' says Mr Huang Shu-shen, vice-president of
the international department of National Securities.
The CBC also announced recently a rule which allows each foreign investor to
invest up to Dollars 100m at a time, instead of having to divide investments
in lots of Dollars 50m. The CBC also asked the Ministry of Finance to
liberalise rules on the repatriation of capital and earnings.
At present, each investor can repatriate earnings or invested capital a year
after entry and only once each year.
The new draft rules, which may take effect by the end of the year, will
allow foreign investors to repatriate earnings or invested capital within
three months of entry, and will not place limits on the number of
transactions.
Mr Lin Yung-kui, manager of SG Warburg's research department in Taipei, is
impressed: 'Unless the results of the local elections in late November are
very bad for the KMT, political apprehension should be relaxed, producing a
strong performance in the last month of the year.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Risk and Reward: Wreckage of ERM may signal end to era of
easy profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE wake of the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands earlier
this month, European political leaders - and in particular the French - have
talked of getting their own back on the speculators who sabotaged their
cherished system. But the politicians may not have to wait very long before
they get some revenge.
Over the last year, currency dealers have made substantial profits by taking
successful one-way bets on the devaluations of sterling, the Italian lira,
and the Iberian currencies. But the latest ERM crisis does not appear to
have been a source of unqualified joy for foreign exchange players.
Unexpected exchange rate movements in the French franc and Danish krone have
trimmed some of the profits of speculators who were selling these
currencies.
At the same time, the greater fluctuations now seen in European exchange
rates have forced some speculative players to abandon long-standing
techniques for making huge profits out of Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate
system.
In recent weeks, some dealers in London and New York have talked of how
movements in European currencies have taken them by surprise and caused them
to give back some of their profits.
The French franc has performed far more strongly against the D-Mark than had
been anticipated when the ERM bands were first widened. Instead of the
immediate move down to FFr3.60 against the D-Mark that had been expected,
the franc bottomed out at FFr3.5300 immediately after the ERM bands were
widened.
The franc has been supported by France's policy of slowly reducing interest
rates, and analysts think that the French currency will soon be forced to
new lows against the D-Mark. But some traders who borrowed francs and sold
them near the FFr3.5300 level have closed their positions and taken a loss.
A number of US investment banks have operated funds in recent years which
allowed customers to use low interest rate currencies, like the US dollar,
to invest in high-yielding ones like theDanish krone and Spanish peseta.
These investments were bound to lead to high returns because there was
little chance of a depreciation in the value of the currencies that had been
purchased while they were in the narrow bands of the ERM.
Using the technique of margin trading, an investment bank could enhance
profits by taking positions in these currencies which were up to 10 times
the size of the original sum deposited by clients.
But the recent changes in the ERM, and the greater volatility in exchange
rates, has made these funds far riskier to operate.
Last week, Bankers Trust, the US investment bank, revealed that it was
seeking a vote from investors to liquidate a fund called 'The Diversified
Currency Management Fund' which had made substantial gains by investing in
European currency markets.
Bankers Trust said it was also seeking to change the nature of operations of
another fund which had gained from differentials in interest rates. Its
investment objectives were now to become more 'opportunistic'.
Both funds had assets of Dollars 640m invested in them by the bank's
customers. The funds were used to take leveraged positions up to 10 times
that size, and could therefore have been responsible for pushing as much as
Dollars 6bn through the currency market.
Mr Bill Tazza, managing director at Bankers Trust, said the investment bank
had been 'pro-active' in its decision, and that the widening of the ERM
bands had made this interest rate play more difficult. He said the decision
to change the nature of these funds had not been taken against a background
of losses.
'There are quite a number of these sorts of fund in the market place,' he
said, 'but the risk/reward ratio of this trade has now changed
considerably'.
European governments should not take the view that the crisis in the fixed
exchange rate system was entirely in the interests of currency speculators.
For some players in this market, the wreckage of the ERM may have signalled
the end to an era of easy profits.

FT  31 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Brightening prospects for Nordic
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGING by the recent flurry of international bond issues from Finland and
Sweden, a significant thaw is under way in investor sentiment which a few
months ago was as frozen as the Baltic Sea in winter.
'If I count the number of foreign investment banks that call me and send me
proposals compared to 10 months ago, then, yes, it is clear that attitudes
have changed,' a senior Stockholm banker remarked last week.
Late last year, when the extent of the losses run up by Nordic banks became
clear and the region was wracked by a deep economic and currency crisis,
foreign investors turned their backs on what had previously been among the
world's best credit risks.
But pledges by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Finland to support
their respective banking systems, as well as mounting evidence that the
banks are coming off the critical list, has enabled investors to adopt a
more balanced view on Nordic borrowers
'I think it is a crucial factor for foreign investors that they see the
level of government support behind the banks,' says an official at Finland's
Okobank, whose Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes (FRNs) in July
marked a turning-point for Nordic credits.
The most obvious indicator of the extent of the rehabilitation of Swedish
and Finnish borrowers has been the sharp cut in the margin or 'spread' they
have to pay over the yield on underlying government paper. Last week,
Finland achieved its best pricing in three years when it raised Dollars 250m
through an offering of three-year Eurobonds priced to yield 28 basis points
over underlying US Treasuries. During the financial crisis last year,
spreads on Finnish sovereign paper widened to around 90 basis points.
Sweden is now able to raise funds at 10 basis points below the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) compared with around 25 basis points over
Libor late last year when, like Finland, it had to raise large amounts
quickly.
Now that the sovereign borrowers have accomplished a large part of their
international funding programmes, there is room in the market again for the
banks and the spreads they have to pay have come back down.
Last week Spintab, the Swedish domestic mortgage association owned by
Swedbank, raised Dollars 250m through an issue of five-year FRNs at an
all-in cost of 33 basis points over Libor, less than half the spread on a
similar offering launched in February.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankke (KOP), the leading Finnish bank, also tapped the
market last week with a Dollars 150m issue of perpetual subordinated notes.
This would have been virtually impossible several months ago when investors
were reluctant to buy even senior Nordic debt.
Mr Jean-Francois Tapprest, who deals with international funding at KOP,
says: 'The access to funds has opened totally and the spread which KOP has
to pay over Libor for three to five-year maturities has halved.'
The rehabilitation of Nordic borrowers is being helped by a hunger among
investors for high-yielding assets. Despite the improvement in pricing,
Nordic issues still offer a substantial pick-up over the yields on other
bonds. In addition, investors are now eager to buy Nordic bank debt in
anticipation of an upgrading of their credit ratings.
Their hopes have been fanned by the recent crop of good news from the
banking sector. Earlier this month Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's
leading bank, said it had returned to profit in the second quarter and had
withdrawn its request for state support.
Norway's two biggest banks, Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, reported a
return to profit in the first half. In Finland, KOP and Unitas, the
second-largest bank, say they will cut their losses this year.
So far, the two biggest Swedish players, SE Banken and Svenska
Handelsbanken, have not moved back into the bond market, concentrating
instead on rights issues in order to rebuild their capital.
The only Swedish corporate borrower this year has been Vattenfall, the
national power group, which raised Dollars 500m through an issue of
five-year Eurobonds in May.
Syndicate managers and borrowers alike believe spreads will continue to
tighten, but there are two factors which could interrupt this trend. One
worry is the huge borrowing requirements of the Swedish and Finnish
governments stemming from their budget deficits.
They are spreading their borrowing among different instruments, but there is
some concern that non-sovereign borrowers could be crowded out once again,
in which case spreads would go back up.
The second is the depth of demand for Nordic issues, despite the improvement
in investor sentiment. 'Certainly there is a window of opportunity now,'
says an official at a senior Swedish bank. 'But if a lot more banks come out
with issues rapidly, the market could become saturated.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Bonds' strength unnerves analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that 30-year bond yields, currently at 6.1 per cent and falling, look as
if they will breeze through the 6 per cent barrier, some Wall Street
analysts are beginning to have second thoughts about the robustness of the
market's rally.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette is one broking house clearly unnerved by the
bond market's strength. In its latest weekly report, it warned: 'We regard
the long end of the fixed income market as severely overbought and
vulnerable to a 35-45 basis point intermediate-term back-up in rates.' It
predicted a sharp upturn in yields would follow on the heels of this week's
economic data.
The people at Bear Stearns have similar reservations, although they believe
any upturn in bond yields is probably a bit further down the road. In a
report entitled 'Bond Overshoot,' Bear Stearns economists wrote: 'It is our
judgment that people are underestimating the US economy at present . . . We
believe that the pace of growth in the second half of this year will be
stronger than many people think. Based on the fundamentals, the bond market
will face a correction later in the year.'
Mr Robert Brusca, the chief economist of Nikko Securities who has long been
unconvinced by the bond market's rally, took a similar track. His argument
is that inflationary pressures are lurking in the economy, ready to
reappear.
Some of these remarks must have been prompted by last week's bond market
performance, which was nothing short of remarkable. It was a week when no
important economic data was published, and when nothing new about the
direction of monetary policy was said.
Yet it was a week when the 30-year bond gained one and a quarter points, and
yields dropped from 6.22 per cent to 6.1 per cent. All of this was achieved
without any particular support from fundamentals, or even the technicals -
it seemed that the momentum of the market's summer rally was the only thing
keeping prices moving higher.
At least this week dealers and investors should have something substantial
to get their teeth into, in the form of a fresh supply of economic data. If
bond yields are to drop quickly under 6 per cent, the economic news will
have to be consistently bearish.
Today's release of preliminary second-quarter real GDP figures should cause
a stir. Two weeks ago, the government announced an unexpectedly wide June
trade deficit, since when economists have been predicting that the real GDP
numbers would be revised downward to reflect the drop in export sales.
Consequently, analysts expect real GDP growth to come in between 0.8 per
cent and 1.0 per cent, down from the original estimate of 1.6 per cent.
These revisions are already priced into bonds, but any figure under 0.5 per
cent would probably prompt heavy buying, and could well send the 30-year
yield below 6 per cent for the first time.
Tomorrow's purchasing managers' index for August will also be closely
watched, and the consensus of forecasts shows the NAPM index of
manufacturing activity edging above 50 per cent for the first time since
May.
The most important number of all arrives on Friday. The August employment
data will provide the latest look at the still-depressed labour market.
Economists, however, anticipate broad improvement in the data, with non-farm
payrolls rising between 85,000 and 200,000.
An increase in the civilian labour force, however, will probably have pushed
the national unemployment rate up from 6.8 per cent in July to 6.9 per cent
or 7.0 per cent.

FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Sun still shines on the long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when you think it is time to get out of the water, the sun comes out
again.
So it has been with the UK government bond market. The rally that had
extended for the past three months taking long-dated maturities to record
highs was, by the early part of last week, beginning to look slightly
waterlogged.
Dealers at some UK investment houses said overseas investors, particularly
from the Middle East, were pocketing profits. Overseas buyers have been one
of the mainstays of the rally with gilts seemingly offering a way into a
strengthening pound plus an economy growing with low inflation.
Thus it had begun to look comparatively chilly for long gilts even before
the German Bundesbank's decision to leave its discount rate unchanged at
6.75 per cent.
Economists had expected a cut of at least a quarter percentage point which
would have given an opportunity for hard-pressed European economies, such as
France, Belgium and Denmark, to cut rates.
In the event UK gilts were sidelined after the news but sterling jumped
sharply and the FT-SE 100 index hit record highs. Then, on Friday, the sun
came out again with a 1.25 point surge in 10-year gilts and heavier gains at
the ultra-long end of the curve.
Part of those gains represented position taking before the long bank holiday
weekend but there was also a view that if ERM interest rate cuts are being
pushed further back a UK cut is also less likely. The receding prospects for
monetary easing encouraged investors to move assets towards the long end of
the yield curve, which reflects the prospects for low inflation.
The question that continues to hover over the long-dated end of the curve is
whether gilts are nearing the end of their bull run. UK institutional
investors, used to years of domestic boom-bust economics, have been
particularly wary of the argument that low inflation is here to stay.
However, Mr George Magnus, of SG Warburg, believes that long yields have
further to fall and could break through 7 per cent before the end of the
year. 'We are revising our forecasts for yields of all the long-dated
maturities. As people become more accustomed to the idea of low inflation
yield curves will continue to flatten,' he says.
He views both domestic and global factors as perpetuating the rise and the
main four reasons he cites for a continuation of the trend are:
The subdued outlook for UK inflation
The possibility of fiscal tightening at the November budget
A downgrading of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement forecasts
The generally favourable environment for longer dated bonds.
Ms Jane Sargent, Hoare Govett's head of fixed interest research, agrees that
any weakness in the gilts market will be short-lived and cites the strong
demand for BT's Pounds 500m Eurosterling issue last week as underlining the
seemingly insatiable appetite of overseas investors for sterling bonds.
The Bank of England took advantage of Friday's gilts surge to announce
Pounds 800m worth of taps consisting of Pounds 400m of 9 per cent conversion
stock maturing in 2000 and Pounds 400m of 8 per cent Treasury stock expiring
in 2009.
Even Mr John Shepperd, of Yamaichi, who takes a pessimistic view on the
future of the UK government bond market, acknowledged that the overseas
buyers were back in force on Friday. However, he says their impact was
exaggerated because dealers were unwilling to upset their books before the
weekend and consequently prices were squeezed higher than the buying would
normally have taken them.
Much depends on whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer,
is prepared to cut base rates again within the next few months. Whatever the
outcome Mr Shepperd feels that the sunshine is unlikely to continue and long
yields have fallen as far as they can. 'A base rate cut has already been
discounted,' he says. 'We are at the bottom of the inflationary cycle and
although PSBR pressures have been reduced, that reduction has already been
taken on board.
'Also the government won't tighten fiscal policy and we are in a fairly
robust recovery which is bound to have some impact on the inflation rate.'
Yamaichi has lowered its current long yield forecast to take into account
what it sees as the short-term move to long gilts following Germany's
discount rate stance. However, the revised figure is 7.7 per cent, some 40
basis points higher than current levels.
Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a fall in yields of about 13 basis points
to 6.84 per cent. Further out, the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in
2017 was quoted at 116 5/32, yielding 7.3 per cent compared with 115 3/8.
Index-linked gilts also rose sharply.

FT  31 AUG 93 / European High-Yield Bonds: Foreign demand underpins rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's high-yielding bond markets may soon no longer deserve their name.
This month, 10-year bond yields in Spain, Italy and Portugal all fell below
10 per cent, the most important psychological barrier for investors.
It is the first time in their short history that Spanish and Portuguese
markets have reached these levels.
The strong rally in the last month was achieved despite the fact that the
Bundesbank did not cut German interest rates, confounding many traders'
expectations.
The breaching of the 10 per cent barrier represents a remarkable shift of
sentiment within a short space of time - as recently as last October Spanish
10-year yields were above 14 per cent.
While there is nothing fundamental to stop further appreciation of the
Italian and Spanish markets, analysts are becoming rather edgy about the
prospects for a correction. However, the recovery following the lack of
action by the Bundesbank on Thursday, despite an initial sell-off by
traders, reflects that underlying demand from investors, including the
retail end of the market, remains firm.
Mr Michael Burke, bond economist at Citibank, favours Italy over Spain.
'Italy has much better inflation prospects,' he argues, with wage growth of
2.6 per cent compared with 7.5 per cent in Spain.
'Spain has some serious structural problems which the minority government is
ill-placed to address,' he says. He cites rigidities in the labour market
which have allowed wage inflation to advance unimpeded.
Spain is also faced with a burgeoning budget deficit, fuelled by regional
government spending, which is difficult to curb without offending
nationalist parties.
The deficit could well be as much as 7 per cent of Spain's GDP by the end of
the year, from just 4.4 per cent in 1992, according to analysts.
Of course, the size of Spain's debt is dwarfed by Italy's debt mountain. But
the market is quite aware of the structural problems facing Italy, and it
could be argued that these are well discounted.
'I still don't feel comfortable with the budget situation and the progress
on electoral reform,' said Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit
Lyonnais.
Also he argues that the 120 basis point rally in 10-year bond yields in the
last month has been overdone considering that three-month rates have fallen
only 25 basis points. 'The long bonds have discounted a lot of easing,' he
said.
Mr Burke at Citibank takes a more positive view of the Italian picture.
While Italy's debt burden remains a serious concern, he believes there is
room for some improvement, since a large portion of Italy's obligations are
in the form of interest payments. However, since more than 80 per cent of
Italy's public sector deficit is in the form of short-term bills, 'much of
the problem is easily curable with lower short-term interest rates,' Mr
Burke argues.
Whatever the logic of the rally, it has undoubtedly been fuelled by foreign
investors, in search of higher yielding paper, who have rarely been such
active buyers of Italy and Spain. According to statistics, foreign investors
now hold around a third of the Spanish market. It remains to be seen whether
or not they will soon decide that the yields on offer are no longer high
enough to justify the extra risk of buying more volatile markets.

<TEXT>
SHIMADZU, a leading Japanese precision equipment maker, and Allied-Signal of
the US have agreed a wide-ranging partnership for the joint development and
production of jet engine parts. The Japanese group said the deal might lead
eventually to an equity relationship between the two companies.
The bilateral accord calls for Shimadzu and the aerospace division of
Allied-Signal to adopt a risk-revenue sharing system in the tie-up whereby
profits are split between the two companies according to the respective
share of funds injected into the product development of particular projects.
It follows a deal made last October for Shimadzu to supply engine gearboxes
to Allied-Signal, which is headed by Mr Lawrence Bossidy. The Japanese
company will start shipping gearboxes to Allied-Signal next month.
The two will also co-operate in developing market opportunities in China and
other Asian countries, which are expected to be growing markets.
Furthermore, they are considering taking equity stakes in each other or
setting up a joint venture company.
The latest agreement between the two companies reflects the growing
pressures aerospace groups are experiencing in the post-cold war
environment. The worldwide economic slump is also dampening demand from
commercial customers and the deal between the two groups is an example of
the restructuring that is likely to spread in the aerospace industry.
Shimadzu, which has supplied components mainly to Japan's defence forces, is
facing a slowdown in business for its aircraft equipment.
The two companies will set up respective teams to discuss specific projects
in which they might be able to co-operate in the autumn.

KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, is linking with L'Air
Liquide of France to produce and market industrial gases in Finland.
The two companies are setting up a joint venture, Polargas, which will be 70
per cent owned by the French group.
The venture will take over Kemira's industrial gas production and
distribution facilities in Oulu and Raahe on the west coast of Finland. The
operations mainly produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon and have a FM100m
(Dollars 17.1m) annual turnover.
L'Air Liquide will contribute know-how and make a payment of unspecified
size for its holding in the new company.
Kemira said it was optimistic about growth possibilities for industrial
gases, but did not want to expand its operations in this area on its own.

FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re joins US bank in
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group, is
following the growing trend of creating companies which specialise in
natural catastrophe insurance.
The group has joined John Head &amp; Partners, a New York merchant bank
specialised in the insurance field, to form Partner Reinsurance.
Swiss Re will put Dollars 100m into the venture, which will be based in
Bermuda, John Head Dollars 25m, and other founder institutional investors
Dollars 130m.
Partner Reinsurance then plans to raise Dollars 500m from the US, European
and Japanese equity markets in an initial public offering as early as
October.
The move follows a series of similar ventures created by leading reinsurers
in recent months. The idea is to respond the soaring demand for natural
catastrophe insurance following the sharp increase in damage caused by
earthquakes and hurricanes around the world in recent years.
Paradoxically, while soaring insurance claims have hurt all reinsurers in
the short term, they have also led to a fundamental improvement in trading
conditions by shaking out weaker competitors.
As a result, the US capital market has become more enthusiastic about
insurance securities, making it possible for ventures like the new Partner
Re to raise equity.
Swiss Re said the new venture would differ from its rivals in that it would
concentrate more on markets outside of the US.
'Our wide experience in other parts of the world will be of great value,' Mr
Walter Kielholz, a Swiss Re director said.
Partner also differed from others in that Swiss Re would not control it. Its
stake, initially 13 per cent, would not exceed 20 per cent. Swiss Re said it
deliberately sought to maximise outside capital. 'Our aim is to generate as
much new capacity as possible,' Mr Kielholz said.
Also, Swiss Re itself did not want to raise its exposure to the natural
catastrophe market.
The public share issue, of 66 per cent of the initial share capital, is
being arranged by Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley International.

FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Exchange rate gains help Atlas
Copco climb 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATLAS Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, said lower interest
rates and exchange rate gains contributed to a 12 per cent rise in
first-half profits, despite a substantial fall in sales and orders.
Profits after financial items climbed to SKr661m (Dollars 449m) from
SKr590m. The favourable interest rate trend produced SKr21m in net interest
income, compared with an outlay of SKr87m in the same period of 1992.
Exchange rate gains increased to SKr24m from SKr10m.
The group's underlying business was flattered by the depreciation of the
Swedish krona, which lifted sales by 13 per cent to SKr8.93bn from SKr7.87bn
and orders by 9 per cent to SKr9.34bn.
Sales were sharply lower in volume terms, which pushed operating income
after depreciation down 8 per cent to SKr604m.
The group said improved sales in the US, south-east Asia, the Middle East
and Australia failed to compensate for weak demand in most European
countries. However, second-quarter operating income at SKr319m was SKr34m
higher than in the first three months.
Orders were also down, particularly in Europe, which only accounted for 54
per cent of orders in the latest six months, compared with 61 per cent a
year ago. Orders rose in North America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and
Australia.
The group's industrial technique division lifted operating profits to
SKr125m from SKr88m due to rationalisation while construction and mining
technique profits were unchanged at SKr84m. Profits within the compressor
technique division slumped to SKr457m from SKr548m.
Mr Michael Treschow, chief executive, said he expects the weak demand trend
in Europe to persist, but he still forecasts 1993 profits in excess of the
SKr1bn level reached last year.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Linotype-Hell, the German print technology group, tumbled 8 per
cent yesterday after an alarming half-year report announced a plunge into
loss and a drastic overhaul of the business.
The 'unexpected' deficit of DM57m (Dollars 33.7m) following a first-half
profit of DM16m last time, had 'cast a shadow over the whole year', the
company said.
The company's shares dropped DM33 in Frankfurt to close at DM377. Group
sales were down 3 per cent to DM471m.
Aiming to return to the black by 1994, Linotype plans to cut its
international workforce by about 15 per cent, reduce its product range, and
reorganise management and production structures.
The report hinted at possible domestic capacity closures with a statement
that efforts to reduce manufacturing costs would be actively pursued,
especially to tackle problems associated with production within Germany.
While there had been no sign of problems in the first quarter, the company
said, its customers were now complaining of falling advertising revenues and
profits.
Incoming orders fell 7 per cent, stemming partly from a 17 per cent slump in
Germany, although demand in other European markets was down by as much as 50
per cent. Orders from Japan, the third-biggest market after the US and
Germany, were down 15 per cent.
Announcing job losses of 500 in Germany and 200 abroad, the company said it
might not be able to avoid compulsory redundancies.

FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mortgage-backed issue from Bank
of Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO important deals launched on Friday in the growing sterling asset-backed
bond market may herald a quickening of the pace of securitisation in the UK.
Securitisation allows companies to remove assets from their balance sheets,
by repackaging and selling them as bonds.
Two landmark deals - a mortgage securitisation by National Westminster Bank
and a loan securitisation by Barclays Bank - are widely expected to emerge
in the next few months.
Last Friday, Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages, the Bank of Ireland's UK
mortgage subsidiary, returned to the sterling mortgage-backed securities
market after a five-year absence in order to fund its expanding Pounds 2.6bn
mortgage book.
The Bank of Ireland's third public mortgage-backed offering consisted of a
Pounds 250m issue of floating-rate notes issued through a special purpose
company, Residential Property Securities No. 3, and arranged by NatWest
Capital Markets. It had previously completed two private placements.
The Bank of Ireland bought Bank America Finance's mortgage business in 1987.
Mr Tom O'Neill, finance director at Bank of Ireland Mortgages, described the
securitisation as 'a very attractive way of financing our business,' and
said the bank would continue to tap the market.
Also in the sterling market, Anglo Leasing, a subsidiary of the Summit
Group, a UK leasing company, launched the first issue in the UK backed
solely by lease receivables. Lease receivables have been used to back
commercial paper. The Pounds 165m issue of FRNs, arranged by Kleinwort
Benson, is backed by leases on business equipment such as photocopiers,
vending machines and computers.

<TEXT>
THE PRICE at which shares in East Japan Railway, one of seven regional
railway companies created in 1987 by the break-up of the national system,
are to be offered for sale was yesterday fixed at Y380,000 (Dollars 3,656) a
share.
JR East, which will be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange in October, will
be the first state flotation since Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the 65.7
per cent government-owned telecommunications giant, went public in 1987.
The flotation, initially scheduled for last year, was postponed as a result
of stock market weakness. Half of JR East's 4m shares, with a face value of
Y50,000, will be sold in the first tranche.
The success of JR East's listing is seen in Tokyo as crucial for other
semi-privatised companies, such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining six
railway groups.
The price was based on the auction of 600,000 shares last week, where the
weighted average of successful bids came to Y379,806. The accepted bids
ranged from Y352,000 to Y623,000.
Over 17,000 bids were placed for the auction, with 3,993 successful bids,
including 52 from foreign investors. The 10 largest buyers were all major
financial institutions led by Fuji Bank with 30,000 shares and Long Term
Credit Bank with 21,500 shares.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roger Rutz, the president of the Chicago Board of Trade Clearing
Corporation, has resigned after 10 years at the head of the Chicago
exchange's independent clearing organisation.
Mr Rutz, 40, cited personal reasons for his departure. Mr William Feldman,
the Clearing Corporation's chairman, named Ms Denise Hagerty as interim
chief executive while an international search is conducted for Mr Rutz's
replacement.
Ms Hagerty, presently chief operating officer, joined the Clearing
Corporation in January after 12 years managing clearing operations for a
prominent Chicago brokerage firm.
Mr Rutz's departure comes at a critical time for the Chicago Board of Trade.
The Clearing Corporation guarantees trades for the exchange, and maintains
its top quality credit rating. A year ago, the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered exploratory talks to merge their
clearing operations.
Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the CBoT, said Mr Rutz's departure should not
affect those discussions.
'The board of directors of the Clearing Corporation are fully committed to
unified clearing,' Mr Arbor said. 'They will choose a successor (to Mr Rutz)
with that goal in mind.'
The new Clearing Corporation president will have to contend with the
professional differences that have impeded progress in those talks, industry
sources said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMALCO, the Australian integrated aluminium producer, has raised its
interim dividend from 2 cents to 3 cents a share after overcoming lower
prices to record a marginal earnings increase in the six months ended June.
Operating profit rose from ADollars 15m to ADollars 15.7m (USDollars 10.5m)
on a 10.4 per cent revenue lift to ADollars 1.09bn.
But the result was transformed by abnormal items and a superannuation fund
adjustment which boosted earnings available to shareholders from ADollars
8.5m to ADollars 50.3m.
Directors said the average London Metal Exchange three month price for
aluminium was USDollars 1,182 per tonne for the reporting period, compared
with an average of USDollars 1,296 per tonne previously.
'This first-alf average price is the lowest for any half-year period since
the LME high grade three month contract began in June, 1987,' they said.

dip into the red in the final quarter, but the group reported only a
marginal decline in operating earnings for the full year to the end of June,
writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Operating earnings fell marginally from ADollars 87m to ADollars 85.1m
(USDollars 56.8m) on an 8 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars
2.02bn. The dividend is being held at 5 cents a share.
Abnormal items including large divestments, write-offs and currency
fluctuations, had a substantial influence on earnings available to
shareholders. This caused bottom line earnings to fall 30.4 per cent to
ADollars 74.0m.

SOPHUS Berendsen, majority shareholder in Rentokil, the UK environmental and
property services group, reports an increase in first-half net profits to
DKr269m (Dollars 39m) from DKr250m a year earlier, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The results were adversely affected by the strength of the krone. Group
sales, of which about 60 per cent are accounted for by Rentokil, advanced
8.5 per cent to DKr4.20bn.
Berendsen said that full-year results will be significantly influenced by
two important investments earlier this year, Rentokil's acquisition of the
Securigard Group and the Berendsen industrial division's acquisition of the
UK's Lucas Fluid Power Group.

FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Asbestos claims hit US insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIRD-QUARTER results of two US insurance groups, Chubb and CNA Financial
Corp, will suffer as a result of an agreement on settling certain claims
related to asbestos products manufactured by the Fibreboard Corp.
As a result of the accord, Chubb yesterday warned that it would post a loss
in the third quarter after taking an after-tax charge of Dollars 358m
relating to the settlement. However, the company expects to report a net
profit for the first nine months of 1993 and for the full year.
The expected quarterly loss, which works through at Dollars 3.95 a share,
would follow the company's announcement of second-quarter net income of
Dollars 168.5m or Dollars 1.89 a share. For the first half, Chubb posted net
income of Dollars 294.3m, or Dollars 3.31.
CNA Financial, which is 83 per cent-owned by Loews Corporation, said it
would take a Dollars 325m after-tax charge, or Dollars 5.26 a share, in the
third quarter because of asbestos-related claims.
Loews, in turn, warned that the agreement would reduce its third-quarter
earnings by about Dollars 270m, or Dollars 4.17. In last year's third
quarter, Loews, which also owns Lorillard, which markets tobacco products,
posted net income of Dollars 128.6m, or Dollars 1.98. The figure included a
Dollars 109.7m charge relating to claims at CNA from damage caused by
Hurricane Andrew.
Chubb said it was boosting its reserves for Fibreboard claims by Dollars
675m, to Dollars 1.25bn.

FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sale of RTZ's Nerco assets to fetch Dollars
600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining company, is putting the
finishing touches to the sale of assets acquired only in June when it bought
Nerco, the floundering US natural resources group, and says total proceeds
will be about Dollars 600m (Pounds 405m).
That compares with RTZ's outlay of Dollars 470m plus the assumption of
Dollars 692m debt when it bought Nerco which was 82 per cent owned by
PacifiCorp of the US. Also, RTZ's cash outlay was reduced to Dollars 245m by
a loan from PacifiCorp to be repaid from Nerco contract revenues.
One of the outstanding details RTZ previously has held back concerns the
expected proceeds from the sale of the Con gold mine in Canada's North West
Territories. However, it now says it expects this will bring at least
Dollars 25m.
When RTZ first announced in February that it was negotiating to buy Nerco it
made clear that it wanted only Nerco's coal operations in the Powder River
Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was retained to offload Nerco's oil and
gas interests and definitive agreements for their sale to two US energy
groups, Western Gas Resources and Louisiana Land and Exploration Company for
a total of Dollars 510m were announced in July.
Even before that, arrangements had been made to sell Nerco's gold and silver
mines - which Nerco had previously decided to put on the market.
Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, is paying Dollars 21m cash for Nerco's Pikes
Peak Mining Company which owns 80 per cent of the Cripple Creek mine in
Colorado. And Kinross Gold, a US group, is paying Dollars 16.8m cash for the
DeLamar gold-silver mine in south-west Idaho and the Candelaria silver mine
in western Nevada.
RTZ says negotiations are in progress about the sale of the Con gold mine to
Red Lion Management, a private Vancouver-based conglomerate controlled by Mr
Walter Berukoff. Red Lion has arranged to sell on the Con mine to Miramar
Mining, another Vancouver company. Red Lion says it exercised its option to
buy the Con on August 15 and has 60 days from that time to complete the
acquisition.
RTZ also expects to raise Pounds 900m from the sale of its Pillar industrial
division, mainly to MB-Caradon, which, with the Nerco disposals, will
reduced the group's gearing to 14 per cent compared with the 63 per cent to
which it briefly rose after the Nerco acquisition.

FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Allders and BAA deal will spread risk more
equally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLDERS International, the tax and duty free retailer which is part of the
Allders Group, has signed a deal with BAA covering all its shops in BAA's UK
airports. The contract runs until 1999 and replaces individual contracts for
each store, some of which were due to run out this year.
The new agreement also changes the way in which each side makes profits from
retailing, sharing risks more equally between them. It will give Allders,
which is hoping to float in the next few months, a more stable flow of
profits from its BAA shops. BAA said that as well as long-term security it
would enable the two sides to work together on new ideas while sharing the
risk.
About a quarter of Allders' turnover is being secured by the deal with BAA.
Its BAA shops had sales of Pounds 161.1m in the year to March 1993, while
Allders International's turnover was Pounds 296.5m in its financial year to
September 1992. Allders other activity, department stores, had sales of
Pounds 259.1m in that period.
Usually airport shops are run under five-year contracts at the end of which
they are put out to bidders. Allders 1992 profits were adversely affected by
the loss of a large contract to run a shop at Sydney airport.
Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive of Allders, said 'there is always a bit
of nervousness about contracts. This deal allows us to target other
geographical areas without covering our backs all the time.'
He said the new system of payment 'should benefit both parties and make it
much easier to predict profitability.' Until now Allders has been paying BAA
a rent based on turnover with a guaranteed minimum. Now BAA will pay Allders
a management fee, more than covering Allders International's costs. A profit
target will be set, and profits above that will be split between the two.
Mr Lipsith said this shifted the balance of risk away from Allders
International, and gave it a greater incentive to drive the business for
growth.
BAA said it had struck a similar deal with Forte, the hotels and catering
group, which had been operating since January with benefits to both sides'
profits.
BAA's strategy is to expand the space in its airports devoted to shops over
the next three years. Tax and duty free shops are central to this plan, and
Sir John Egan, chairman, said they provided 'an important source of revenue
to BAA' as well as offering customers 'choice and value'.
Allders International is the largest retailer in BAA's airports.

FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pressure to switch from appliances - A look
at allegations that power companies subsidise their retail arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in any other industrial sector would have been tempted to call it
a day.
Year after year UK electricity companies and their pre-privatisation
predecessors have struggled to make significant profits on their retailing
operations, and some have recorded losses. Yet still most of them persevere.
Now their competitors, including Dixons and Kingfisher, are trying to force
a re-think. They say the retail results of the regional electricity
companies and the Scottish power companies have been exaggerated and have
demanded an investigation.
At their prompting, Offer, the electricity industry regulator and the Office
of Fair Trading are looking at whether power companies cross subsidise their
retail operations from other businesses and obstruct fair trade.
If the inquiries confirm this is the case, more electricity companies may
follow the lead of London Electricity and South Wales Electricity which have
ended or are ending their direct involvement in retailing.
Whatever the profitability, power company retailing is big business. With
more than 1,100 shops, electricity groups collectively own the second
largest group of electrical goods outlets in the UK after Dixons, which also
owns the Currys chain. Their market share is about 13 per cent.
Such a presence is not common internationally. In neither France nor the US
do power distributors feel the need to sell goods in high street shops.
The retailing tradition in the UK stems in part from an industry culture
which has promoted increases in electricity volume sales as the main aim of
the power industry.
'The logic is that the more appliances are sold, the more electricity
volumes will rise,' says one power company executive.
Retailing has also grown alongside customer service facilities which
customers use to make complaints and pay their bills. Almost every power
company shop in the UK has a services counter, and they are highly valued by
customers.
That is one source of complaint from rival retailers. They believe that in
many cases the customer services units do not contribute a fair share of the
rent of the showroom they occupy.
More serious, they say, are the cross subsidies from the recs' main
businesses to their retailing arms. 'The problem is that many shops are not
being charged fully for the services they use,' says one rival company
executive.
'Rents are more realistic than they were in the late 1980s when we estimate
the regional boards (electricity companies predecessors before
privatisation) were charged a third of the market rate.
'But most recs are still not charging their retail operations fully, if at
all, for the capital used in special promotions. That is why their shops can
offer so much interest free credit.'
Not so, say the regional companies. Seeboard is typical in its response. 'We
negotiate with electrical manufacturers for supporting promotions just like
any other retailer,' says Mr John Weight, retailing head. 'One hundred per
cent of costs associated with Seeboard's business are charged to the
business.'
If the recs are robust in their defence of the way they apportion costs for
their shops, few are able to declare retail profits with pride. Norweb,
serving the north west of England, is generally considered the most
impressive retailer, and last year made operating profits of Pounds 6m from
the business, on turnover of Pounds 139m, against operating profits in the
company as a whole of Pounds 155m. It is planning significant expansion from
its 88 stores.
Other companies are less bullish. Most declared operating profits for last
year on retailing, in contrast to the previous year when most recorded
losses. But the amounts were small - typical examples were East Midlands'
Pounds 200,000 and Manweb's Pounds 500,000 - and some lost money, including
Sweb which declared losses of Pounds 1.9m.
In addition, several companies made significant provisions for restructuring
which wiped out any profits.
So why persist? One answer is that the companies have taken action aimed at
significantly improving retailing performance.
Since the break-up of national collective bargaining last year, most power
companies have negotiated deals with retailing staff which either freeze or
reduce wages.
Several companies have also merged their retailing business with other recs
and are seeking to improve service and transform the dowdy image of the rec
stores by hiring specialist retailers. The new alliances include East
Midlands and Yorkshire in one unit and Eastern, Southern and Midlands in
another.
Another factor in keeping stores open is the fear of customer reaction to
closure plans. 'If we were starting again we would not go into retailing but
there is more work in closing one shop than there is in re-organising our
entire company,' one power company chief executive says.
He adds: 'Closures get the chambers of commerce and local business up in
arms. We closed one branch four years ago and we are still getting
petitions.
'There is also the complication that you still have to provide some kind of
a high street presence for people who want to pay bills. We do not have the
direct debit culture of the US.'
For these reasons, most recs believe that the decisions of Offer and the OFT
will make only marginal difference to the number of high street stores.
They also point out that if cross subsidisation was found and the regulatory
authorities order change, the effect on the overall businesses of each
company would be minimal since it would simply transfer profitability from
one business arm to another.
Competitors are unconvinced. According to one: 'If the power company
businesses become as transparent as they should be, shareholders will be
able to see what is happening and the pressure to get out of retailing will
intensify.'

   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENNIS Stevenson, chairman of SRU Group and the Tate Gallery, is expected
to take over as chairman of a restructured GPA Group following the signing
of its rescue deal with GE Capital, the financial services arm of General
Electric of the US.
Mr Stevenson, who is also a member of the Takeover Panel and a non-executive
director of Pearson, has been invited to succeed Mr Tony Ryan and is
expected to accept the appointment.
Under the terms of the rescue deal GPA's Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 3.48bn)
borrowings are being separated from its assets and a new company, GE Capital
Aviation Management, is being set up.
GECAM will be responsible for the combined leasing business of GPA and GE's
subsidiary, Polaris Aircraft leasing, including the day-to-day management of
GPA's 470 aircraft.
Mr Ryan, GPA's founder, is expected to be appointed executive chairman of
the new company working with a chief executive appointed by GE.
Another two non-executive directors are to be announced soon, replacing Lord
Lawson, former chancellor, Mr Garret FitzGerald, former Irish Prime
Minister, and Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI chairman.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Securities firms enjoy a year of living easily: Currencies,
bonds and equities combine to give good profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year has been so good for the securities industry that it has tested Mr
Mark Houghton-Berry's faith in an old adage.
'There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but this one has at least been
heavily-subsidised,' he says.
Mr Houghton-Berry is head of bond trading at Goldman Sachs in London. For
nearly a year, he has watched foreign exchange, equity and bond markets
combine to provide international banks and securities houses with one of
their most profitable and least risky trading environments for a decade.
The results have become evident in Europe and the US over the past month, as
banks have reported large rises in income despite subdued lending business.
The US house Morgan Stanley is the latest beneficiary, disclosing record
second-quarter profits of Dollars 224.2m (Pounds 151m), driven by a huge
leap in trading.
The US securities firms have not been alone. The European universal banks
have offset large bad debt provisions and sluggish lending with dealing
income. Swiss and German banks have benefited, while among UK banks Barclays
made Pounds 234m on the Pounds 1.3bn in capital in its BZW securities
business.
'It is unusual to have equities and bonds going strongly at once. Usually
you expect one or other cylinder to be firing, but we've had both,' says Mr
David Band, BZW chief executive. While much public attention has been on
foreign exchange, securities trading has been at least as strong.
The industry has benefited from a mix of short, medium and long-term trends.
The near-collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism created currency
volatility; falls in European interest rates led to a bonds and equity
rally; and the shift towards lower inflation sparked a 'search for yield'.
This has created a series of effects that have helped banks and securities
houses:
Re-rating of equities and rising bond prices have all led to large amounts
of trading on behalf of customers. 'Volumes have been high in continental
Europe and the UK, and a lot of US money has flowed this way,' says Mr
Michael Sargent, head of equities at SG Warburg, the British investment
bank.
Mr Band says equities trading has been boosted by switches in asset
allocation caused by political uncertainties and the shift in European
interest rates. 'As long as political paths are not clear, institutions can
change their big picture views of the world quite a lot, and quite rapidly,'
he says.
The breakdown of currency and interest-rate stability has led to demand for
risk management services, as companies seek ways of hedging risks through
derivatives. 'They are becoming aware that we can sell them insurance,' says
Mr Michael Davis, a senior vice-president at Chase Manhattan in New York.
As interest rates have fallen, companies have issued bonds and even equity
to re-finance higher interest bank debt. This has been good for the 'bulge
bracket' Wall Street firms that have picked up higher-margin equity
origination business as well as the tighter-margin distribution of bonds.
Integrated securities houses with the capacity to design and sell over-the
counter derivatives have been able to stimulate business though what Mr Band
calls 'reverse origination'. This means designing a product to suit
investors, and using swaps to translate it into a form that attracts debt
issuers.
This has helped increase debt issues by companies which do not have a
pressing need to re-finance, but are attracted by the chance to 'lock in'
lower interest rates. Derivatives have given companies of all sizes more
access to debt markets, so adding to the shift away from traditional bank
finance.
The size of the market for equity and debt has been raised by the shift
towards privatisation of state assets both in west and east Europe. French
bank privatisation this autumn follows Warburg's handling of the BT3 share
offer, and the growing sale of assets from former communist countries.
These trends have allowed large trading profits, which have been underpinned
by the emergence of positive yield curves - higher yields for long-term than
short-term bonds - in Europe. A positive yield curve in the US led to banks
investing their short-term liabilities in longer-term government bonds.
The shift towards similar conditions in Europe raises the question of how
much risk banks and securities houses have taken on through proprietary
trading in addition to handling customers' business. Most participants agree
that market buoyancy has led to a rise in proprietary trading.
Mr Houghton-Berry says that proprietary trading has been encouraged by the
narrowing of margins on client business, and customers wanting to know
whether a bank is confident in its own market view. 'Firms are increasingly
being asked to put their own money where their mouth is,' he says.
This in turn means that firms will be exposed to more risk when the
exceptional market conditions turn down. The easiest profits have probably
passed, since currency volatility is now easing. Yet a longer-term shift to
lower interest rates would provide good trading conditions for bonds and
equities.
Mr Rod Barrett, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London, says the market
cannot carry on for ever, but may have some way to go yet. 'Maybe we will
have another year of it, who knows?' he says, 'Eventually if rates settle
down, the market will adjust to a trading range, and things will get
quieter.'
A gradual tailing-off of exceptional profits would be the best outcome for
the industry. The alternative would be a sharp reversal of inflationary
expectations or interest rate trends that would expose firms to losses on
their proprietary trading positions in equities, bonds or derivatives.
'The easiest money has been made already. Sooner or later there will be a
correction and someone could come unstuck. At the moment, people are still
encouraged to go on,' says Mr Houghton-Berry.
Even if he retains the subsidy on his own lunch, others could yet end up
paying for theirs.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: An eery calm as new realities of the ERM
sink in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT battles are often followed by a phoney war: and such has been the case
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The dramatic events that ended in the early hours of August 2 in the
widening of ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent gave way to an eery calm
in exchange markets and a deafening silence about the future of the system
from policy makers.
But new realities are slowly taking hold. The Bundesbank's decision last
Thursday to leave its discount rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent and its
action on Friday setting a short-term 'repo' rate at 6.9 per cent against
6.8 per cent previously were blows for those who believed that the ERM might
be able to count on falling German interest rates for quieter times ahead.
The idea that former 'hard core' ERM currencies such as the French franc,
Danish krone, Irish punt and Belgian franc might be able to move back within
a 2.25 per cent range against the D-Mark is implausible for the time being
at least.
The Bundesbank made clear last week that it would use the freedom of the
wider bands to strengthen its fight against domestic inflation.
Last week's public flexing of the Bundesbank's muscles merely confirmed the
reports that have seeped out of meetings of July 31 and August 1 of a brutal
crushing of French monetary aspirations.
France opened the discussions in the European Community's monetary committee
on July 31 with demands that the Bundesbank should intervene
unconditionally, intramarginally and on its own account to keep the franc in
the 2.25 per cent range. France also urged an immediate cut in Germany's
repo rate to be followed by reductions in official interest rates as soon as
the Bundesbank's decision-making council could meet.
It is unclear whether the French negotiators truly believed the Bundesbank
would acquiesce to their demands.
If they did, they were quickly disabused of the idea. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank vice president and president designate, interrupted Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the French Treasury and monetary committee
chairman, as he enumerated the French proposals with the observation that
France had forgotten one item: that Germany abandon the D-Mark and its
monetary sovereignty.
Mr Tietmeyer's emergence as the hard man of the Brussels talks lends
credence to reports that circulated shortly after the first great ERM crisis
of September last year. It was rumoured among highly-placed European
monetary officials that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had warned Mr Tietmeyer that
he could forget about becoming Bundesbank president if the Franco-German
currency link were broken.
The old D-Mark-French franc parity survived successive crises that included
the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM and the
devaluations of the Iberian currencies and Irish punt.
However, when the most recent wave of speculation began against the ERM in
July, Mr Tietmeyer's promotion to Bundesbank president on October 1 had been
confirmed and he was well clear of any possible move by Bonn to curb his
room for manoeuvre.
But there were also practical reasons for yielding to market pressures and
moving to a 15 per cent ERM fluctuation band for all currencies except the
D-Mark and Dutch guilder.
The flow of funds out of the French franc at the end of July was
unprecedented. The ERM was protected by exchange controls in most member
states when it started operating in March 1979. The past year showed that it
was no longer capable of dealing with the pressure of deregulated
international currency trading.
In the light of recent circumstances, it is no surprise that policy makers
are still somewhat shell-shocked and disinclined to advocate new steps to
reform or restore the old system. Conversations last week with monetary
officials in Germany and some of Germany's neighbouring countries revealed
an almost universal rejection of the idea of moving rapidly back to 2.25 per
cent fluctuation margins for the ERM.
Pride and embarrassment are contributing to a do-nothing approach. Last
September's crisis spawned two official reports - one from the EC central
bank governors' committee and the other from the EC monetary committee -
which concluded that the ERM was broadly sound.
Those reports, which look ridiculous today, were the result of lengthly
horse trading among officials which eliminated all but the blandest remarks
from the final texts. Officials do not want to reopen old wounds with a
thorough-going examination of recent ERM developments.
But inaction may not be a sustainable policy. The quest for European
Monetary Union will not go away despite the past year of crisis in European
exchange markets. Even Emu sceptics among continental policy makers are
uncomfortable with a monetary free-for-all which could easily subvert the
EC's single market.
One central banker last week suggested that the Maastricht convergence
criteria for low inflation, government debt and interest rates could be used
to guide EC member states back towards the narrow bands in the coming years
after which they could move swiftly to Emu.
The financial markets are a more pressing issue. August has been quiet
because many speculators went on holiday after banking huge profits from the
ERM debacle.
Market operators return in force this week for the 'autumn term'. The
reluctance of France and Germany's ERM satellites to cut their most
important interest rates and stimulate their recession-hit economies in the
past weeks will be the subject of as much critical scrutiny as the
Bundesbank's determination to maintain its tight monetary policy.
Few of the expectations that followed the most recent ERM crisis have been
fulfilled. That means new speculative activity could easily get underway,
particularly in the run up to the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of September.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Five TNT directors resign after split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS at the top of TNT, the Australian transport group, spilled over
into a boardroom split yesterday with the abrupt resignation of five
directors, including the company's founder and former chief executive, Sir
Peter Abeles.
TNT chairman, Mr F. W. Millar, indicated yesterday that the resignations
reflected disagreement over strategy for the company which has racked up
losses, including write-offs, totalling more than ADollars 260m (Pounds
118m) in the latest two reporting years. Further heavy losses are likely
when the company reports for the latest year, ended June.
Mr Millar said TNT's strategy for the past year had been very clear,
following agreement by the then board early last financial year.
'It concentrates on improving operating earnings, selling non-core assets
and reducing debt,' he said.
'It focused management's efforts on our very strong core transport
businesses.
'The directors who resigned sought a change in that strategy. That change
was not adopted by the board.
'I regret the resignations, but I must say that management can now proceed
to implement the continuing strategy with confidence.'
Analysts said yesterday that Sir Peter and the other resigning directors
were believed to be pushing for a more expansionary strategy, possibly
involving a renewed increase in the company's debt levels.
It was heavy debt and rapid expansion that pushed the company close to
failure in 1991. Observers further speculated that Sir Peter's continued
presence on the board since stepping aside as chief executive last September
may have sat uneasily with the new chief executive, Mr David Mortimer.
The other resigning directors are Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman
of Hambros Bank, the UK merchant bank, Mr John Landerer, Mr Evan Cameron and
Mr Gilles Kryger.
TNT shares added 5 cents to ADollars 1.27 yesterday.
Mr Millar said the directors would soon consider board replacements.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Thornton to purchase Aetna unit trust arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORNTON, the fund management group owned by Dresdner Bank, plans to acquire
Aetna UK's unit trust business in a move which signals further consolidation
in the retail investment fund industry.
The group, which is chaired by Lord Peter Walker, the former Cabinet
minister, is expected to announce a deal under which it will pay Pounds 13m
for Aetna UK's unit trust operations which have Pounds 240m of funds under
management.
The deal, which is expected to be announced once due diligence
investigations are completed, will lift Thornton's total funds under
management to above the Pounds 1bn mark.
Negotiations are understood to have been completed, however Lord Walker, who
was brought in by Dresdner two years ago to restructure and expand the
business, said yesterday he could not divulge details until the
due-diligence process was complete.
The deal would be Thornton's biggest purchase since it was acquired by
Dresdner in 1988 and another important step towards its goal of becoming a
leading investment group.
If confirmed, the Pounds 13m price tag on the deal represents about 5.4 per
cent of funds under management. This compares with the Pounds 2.5m paid by
Edinburgh Fund Managers when it acquired the 10 unit trusts of Target Life
Assurance Company in January - equivalent to just 2.25 per cent of the
Pounds 110m in unit trust funds under management.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Hoechst falls 31% on weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST, the big German chemicals group, yesterday blamed a 31 per cent
slump in first-half earnings on weak domestic demand and restructuring
costs.
The German parent company recorded an unspecified operating loss, while its
pre-tax profit fell by almost 50 per cent to DM342m (Pounds 136m) the group
said yesterday.
Business had continued to be weak in the first two months of the second
half, and there were no signs of improvement. Forecasting a 'very difficult'
six months ahead, it said cost-reduction and rationalisation measures would
continue at speed.
Group pre-tax profits of DM781m for the first half were worse than expected
by most analysts, but fitted the pattern established last week when rival
chemical groups Bayer and BASF reported pre-tax declines of 20 per cent and
50 per cent respectively.
All have been hit by low demand, weak prices, the effects of health service
spending cuts in Germany, and adverse movements in foreign exchange markets.
Hoechst said that more than a third of its 2.4 per cent sales decline in the
first six months to DM22.9bn was due to currency movements and lower prices.
In the US, Hoechst Celanese reported a 6 per cent sales drop to Dollars
3.1bn (Pounds 2.09bn), attributable to lower volumes in pharmaceuticals
markets and the effects of last year's sale of its polyethylene business.
In Germany, the company said, its healthcare business was hit by an overall
6 per cent fall in pharmaceutical sales.
Turnover in the European Community, which accounts for almost half annual
sales, dropped 10 per cent.
While government and economists claim the domestic recession bottomed out in
the second quarter of the year, Hoechst's figures showed the situation
worsening. In the three months to the end of June the group earned DM345m
pre-tax, down 34 per cent on the comparable period of 1992. It blamed
further deterioration in home markets, which had cancelled out an overall
improvement in foreign business.
First-quarter earnings of DM436m were 28 per cent lower on the year.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Union pledges pay fight as Timex plant shuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMEX UK faces a legal challenge from its dismissed workers after announcing
at the weekend the closure of its circuit board production plant in Dundee.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, national officer for the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (AEEU) in Scotland, said yesterday that the union planned
to take the company to court seeking redundancy payments and financial
compensation for its dismissed workforce.
'It is an absolute scandal that a company can provoke a dispute to force its
workers to accept vastly inferior pay and conditions and avoid the normal
costs of a plant closure,' he said. 'It is time something was done about
situations like this. Timex provides us with a test case.'
The union intends to press the cases of the 343 Timex workers before
industrial tribunals with claims of unfair dismissal. The existing pension
rights of the Timex workforce were safeguarded but none of those dismissed
last February will receive any redundancy pay. The AEEU has been taking
legal advice throughout the dispute.
Timex also went to court on numerous occasions to safeguard its legal rights
against what it saw as intimidation and violence through mass picketing. But
the union won a number of judgments during the often fierce legal battles.
Timex was compelled last week to lodge Pounds 40,000 as security in advance
of any compensation awards made by industrial tribunals.
Timex said on Sunday it deeply regretted closing its production facilities
in Dundee after 47 years. Local strike leaders vowed to continue their
campaign against Timex by encouraging a global boycott of its products.
Timex's decision to hasten closure reflects the bitterness surrounding a
dispute that produced some of the worst scenes of picket line violence in
Britain for years. The Timex workers were all dismissed on February 18 when
they refused to support a management-imposed wage freeze and fringe benefits
cuts which the company argued would secure their jobs and ensure
competitiveness.

FT  31 AUG 93 / EC to press Japan for further car export cuts: Brussels
renews pressure as European sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC trade negotiators will renew pressure on Japan this week to rein in car
exports to the Community, in the light of worsening monthly figures for new
car sales in Europe.
European Commission officials fly to Tokyo today to persuade Japan to
improve on the commitment made in April to cut exports by 9.4 per cent this
year.
The Japanese have hinted they are ready to agree a further reduction, so
Thursday and Friday's discussions will focus on the scale of new cuts. EC
officials have not revealed their new target, but after meeting the Japanese
in Brussels last month, they indicated they were hoping for an 18 per cent
reduction this year.
The Commission says sales figures released or confirmed since the
inconclusive Brussels meeting show the situation has worsened. According to
one Commission official, there would now have to be 'an incredible boom in
the second half of the year' to fulfil the Japanese forecast that 1993 sales
will decline by 12 per cent. The same officials said even the Commission
estimate of 16 per cent - in line with industry forecasts in July - was
'becoming an optimistic number'.
Industry estimates published earlier this month suggested that new car sales
in western Europe had dropped by an estimated 20.1 per cent in July,
contributing to a fall of 17.7 per cent over the first seven months of the
year, compared with the equivalent period.
In the last week, DRI, the UK-based automotive analyst, has forecast a 16
per cent decline in west European sales of new cars this year; Volkswagen
and Renault have announced poor financial results for the first half of the
year; and Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has said that its UK plant may not
achieve the increase in output forecast for this year.
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association plans to release
provisional figures for August sales shortly. 'A little upturn in the UK has
certainly not been enough to offset the terrible picture everywhere else,'
said a spokesman yesterday.
Under the terms of a 1991 'understanding' between the EC and Japan, Tokyo
and Brussels agree informal annual limits on the export of cars and light
commercial vehicles to the EC, to allow the Community to gradually open its
market to full competition. The 1991 deal does not directly cover Japanese
vehicles manufactured in Europe.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that the Securities and Investments Board is looking again at
regulation of the UK equity market is certainly welcome. After the
controversy over market manipulation and the degree of control exercised by
SG Warburg during the BT3 issue, some clear and widely accepted guidelines
need to be established before further large equity issues come to market.
Yet the SIB and the Stock Exchange seem to have retained the leisurely
approach which led to the BT3 problem in the first place. Almost a year
elapsed between the Wellcome and BT3 issues during which time little was
agreed.
Now the SIB has given itself until the turn of the year to produce a
discussion document, while the secondary offer of the generators' shares may
well take place in the spring.
The Stock Exchange, which scarcely covered itself in glory over BT3, is now
not prepared even to venture an opinion on the subject.
The self-regulatory framework has attracted great criticism, and
practitioners must now prove that they have something to add to the
operation of the system. If some of the simpler problems cannot be quickly
resolved, inefficiency may be added to the charge of ineffectiveness.
Utility regulators work reasonably well without the presence of water or
electricity company chief executives on their panels. The time is fast
approaching when the financial services industry will have to demonstrate
why it is so very different.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been false dawns before during the great derating of the
pharmaceuticals sector. But recent gains against a rising stock market
suggest that drug stocks are at least attracting bargain hunters. Since the
outlook for the industry has barely changed, there is no obvious reason for
a renewed burst of optimism. Although President Clinton's healthcare reforms
look unlikely to include direct price controls, the concentration of power
among big buyers of healthcare is having the same effect. The worst of the
pain arising from reform in Germany and Italy may be over, but France and
Spain have yet to show their hands.
The question, then, is whether drug shares offer fair compensation for the
continued risk of government intervention. Earnings growth will certainly be
below the heady levels of the 1980s, and little better than that achieved by
other industries during recovery. Price earnings multiples below the market
average now reflect that. More importantly given the dwindling returns on
cash, Glaxo and Zeneca yield more than the market average. With a good
record of cash generation, and a large cash pile in the case of Glaxo,
dividend growth looks assured.
If investors are starting to look at drugs companies in terms of total
returns rather than just earnings growth, the recent rally in the shares may
have further to run. The fog of uncertainty should clear when the details of
President Clinton's reforms are unveiled in the autumn. But while the
industry reshapes to accommodate whatever new world order appears, it would
not do to expect too much.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After their decline of more than a full percentage point this summer, it
seems nothing can stop long-gilt yields falling further. Not only has
recovery got under way at home without rekindling inflation; the climate
also looks unusually positive abroad. US bonds have been boosted by
dwindling inflationary fears, while in Europe the Bundesbank stands
determined. Its reluctance to cut its discount rate does not help
short-dated European bonds, but, by damping inflationary expectations, it
does maintain downward pressure on long-term yields.
A sense that the UK may have beaten inflation, too, has reduced the yield
premium international investors traditionally demand to hold gilts. This has
happened just when long-term rates are anyway falling elsewhere. The Bank of
England has further helped by restricting supply to the long end of the gilt
market so that UK institutions are short of paper.
In theory, there could be room for further gains if inflationary
expectations are poised to settle at 3 per cent or even less. Real rates
could fall as uncertainty abates, a development which would benefit
index-linked as well as conventional gilts. Just the same, the fact that the
market has continued to advance amid diminishing expectations of tax
increases in November suggests an air of unreality. Not just in the UK, but
around the industrialised world, government finances are in a mess. Bond
markets are in dangerous territory when they start believing that does not
matter.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: A gamble at Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the financial strains on Ladbroke, it is worth asking whether the
board would be wise to choose between a rights issue and a dividend cut with
its interim figures this week. Balance sheet gearing and total outstanding
debt are both uncomfortably high, while potential disposals would fetch
little more than book value and cut gearing only marginally. A rights issue
would bring greater comfort to the company's finances.
On the other hand, the dividend is clearly out of line with the underlying
trading prospects of the group. If the company were to follow Forte's lead,
it would cut its dividend to a sustainable level, then try to regain
credibility with the market before deciding how to proceed. Certainly
attempting a rights issue while the threat of a dividend cut was still in
the air would make many institutions gag - all the more so if it were below
the level of the 220p issue in 1991.
Then again, Ladbroke's chairman, Mr Cyril Stein, is proud of his unbroken
dividend record over a generation. He will be loath to spoil that in the
latter part of his career. The temptation will be to soldier on until things
improve. That, however, will mean more shareholder value leaking away to the
banks through high interest charges. Perhaps the company might risk further
market displeasure by cutting the cash outflow of dividends and sneak in a
mini-rights issue through another enhanced scrip dividend. It may even be
tempted to follow the lead of Rank, and roll the full-year dividend into the
interim as a larger enhanced scrip. With Ladbroke's high yield, however,
that would mean adding more than 10 per cent to the equity which needs to be
serviced in future years.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Delors warns of risk to Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, has issued a new
call to arms to the partisans of a federal European union. He warned that
unless a bold 'new initiative' emerges quickly, the Maastricht treaty and
its envisaged economic and monetary union will be a dead letter.
'Why should we hide it? If we go on like this, there will be no convergence
in economic policies and, consequently, no single currency. The commitments
in the Maastricht treaty will come to nothing,' Mr Delors told a weekend
meeting of his French Socialist supporters in Brittany.
The Commission president, politically bruised by the year-long delay in
ratifying Maastricht and the damage to the credibility of the Emu project
caused by this month's near implosion of the European exchange rate
mechanism, warned that Europe faced sinking into decline through 'the
absence of a broad and long-term vision'.
'This risk is so obvious in the light of Europe's powerlessness that one
might well expect a startled rebound on the part of certain heads of state
and government,' Mr Delors said, in implicit reference to the hopes now
placed in the EC's traditional Bonn-Paris axis to get European integration
back on the rails.
The Commission president's wide-ranging speech was more analytical than
prescriptive, peppered with references to the 'myopia and insouciance' of
some nationalist and 'ultra-liberal' EC governments which he said saw Europe
merely as a giant free trade zone. He derided the embryonic common foreign
and security policy contained in Maastricht as a racing car with a
two-stroke engine, incapable of handling a crisis like Yugoslavia, even if a
joint foreign policy structure were fully functional.
He said that the EC's classic strategy of 'small steps forward' had 'reached
its limits', and that the time had come 'to spell out the political Europe
that we want'. This was 'the federal approach, which alone sets limits to
the powers of European institutions, and guarantees the powers of the
nation-states and regions'. On Emu, he insisted there was no remedy in
reorganising the ERM, 'even if that in itself would be welcome'.
This remark squares with the EC's formal agenda of getting the second stage
of Emu - with a European Monetary Institute as forerunner to a European
central bank - set up by January. But some observers yesterday saw Mr
Delors' call as encouragement for a mini-Emu with harder currencies grouping
around the D-Mark.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Supply, demand and scientists
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARNINGS about the decline in Britain's science base
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the dire implications for the country's competitiveness - have been a
feature of the British Association annual meeting for at least three
decades. A particular theme this year at Keele is that the UK is producing
too few trained scientists and breeding a scient-ifically illiterate younger
generation.
The sharp decline in numbers taking science A-levels is causing alarm. So is
the glaring contrast between empty places on university science courses and
serious overloading in the arts and social sciences. And in the background
is a sense of anticlimax following the science white paper three months ago;
although it contained some good ideas, the government has not built on the
opportunity it created to lead the case for British science.
The debate about how to attract more bright young people to the subject  -
and at the same time increase public understanding of science - contains so
many strands, knitted together by so many people over such a long period,
that it is sometimes hard to disentangle prejudice, anecdote and special
pleading from soundly based argument.
For example, if it were true as alleged that the British education system
had systematically, over many years, produced fewer scientists than business
and academia needs, there is no doubt that their price would rise. And yet
evidence from the UK job market points to a higher graduate unemployment
rate in science than in arts and yields abundant evidence of poor salaries
in scientific research. Manifest shortages do exist, but only in
well-defined areas, such as top quality pharmaceutical scientists for the
drugs industry.
Fundamental issue
There does not seem to be too much point in increasing the supply of
scientists, if there is no demand for them. But that, of course, raises the
question of whether Britain is using as many scientists as it should.
Apart from the fundamental issue of the relative size of its research and
development effort, where Britain lags, there is the well-documented
shortage of scientists in the upper reaches of management in British
companies, as well as in the public sector. Research recently sponsored by
the Economic and Social Research Council suggests that companies perform
better if they have senior managers with scientific backgrounds.
Here the government is in a position to help - by making the civil service
give a higher priority to science graduates when recruiting administrative
trainees. This might also improve government's skill in handling the wide
range of policy issues that touch on science and technology, from
reprocessing nuclear waste to investing in new trains for British Rail.
Primary focus
On the supply side, action is certainly needed at all levels of the
educational system, with perhaps a primary focus upon the 11 to 15 age
range. Strong anecdotal evidence suggests that many older scientists working
today were inspired originally by excellent science teaching in the early
years of secondary school. Those teachers have retired and their successors
are, on the whole, less inspiring; so the current generation of
schoolchildren is being turned off science by dull lessons that seem both
pointless and more difficult than other subjects. The government's bursary
scheme for trainee science teachers is beginning to turn the tide here, but
better financial incentives are still required to attract good scientists to
teaching.
Further up the educational ladder, science would benefit from a broadening
of the A-level system, so that all candidates studied at least one arts and
one science subject to the age of 18. It should be recognised that such a
change would increase the teaching burden on universities; most science
students would start off knowing less than someone today with maths, physics
and chemistry at A-level. It might even be necessary to add an extra year to
many three-year undergraduate courses.
Change to the A-level system is something which the government has
vigorously resisted for years. If it is serious about bringing science and
scientists to greater prominence in education and business, it will have to
change its mind.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Peace plan poised on a hair trigger: A look at the
potentially momentous outcome of secret Israeli-PLO talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jericho, for all that its name resonates with history, now seems just
another sleepy, dusty Palestinian town in the Israeli-occupied part of the
Jordan valley. But if an extraordinary deal hammered out in secret by
Israeli and Palestinian representatives in recent weeks becomes reality, it
may just be in for something of a revival.
If it is consummated and implemented, Israeli troops will withdraw from the
Jericho area and from the Gaza Strip, both of which they have occupied since
the six-day war of June 1967. For the first time since the foundation of the
state of Israel in 1948, their Arab inhabitants will be allowed substantial
control over their own affairs as part of a five-year interim arrangement
for Palestinian self-rule.
And with a lot of luck, a conflict that has claimed thousands of lives and
several times brought the world close to war in the past 45 years will have
taken a small but momentous step towards resolution.
A signed accord between Israel and the Palestinians would itself be of
enormous psychological significance, especially if it entails mutual
recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, a body
that Israelis have grown used to excoriating as a terrorist group bent on
their destruction. Progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks could also trigger
movement in separate peace negotiations between Israel and Syria, which
could - eventually - open the way to a comprehensive Middle East peace
agreement.
These developments would have seemed all but inconceivable even a few weeks
ago. The Arab-Israeli peace talks launched in Madrid in November 1991 had
dragged on for 22 months with little tangible sign of progress, and no sign
of preparedness by the Israelis or Palestinians to budge from
long-entrenched positions. Now, all of a sudden, almost anything seems
possible - even, someone suggested yesterday, a summit meeting between Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's dour, growling prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat,
mercurial chairman of the PLO.
Small wonder that seasoned Middle Eastern observers were yesterday reeling
in disbelief - or that sceptics were pointing to the many hurdles that have
still to be surmounted.
What has stimulated the current anticipation is the fact that Israel - in
the person of Mr Shimon Peres, the country's veteran foreign minister - and
the PLO have already apparently reached an outline agreement. According to
Israeli and Palestinian officials, the document was finalised at a secret
meeting last week in Norway between Mr Peres and Abu Mazen, the PLO official
responsible for peace talks. It is expected to be signed formally at the
Washington peace talks, which enter their eleventh round this week.
Many of the most difficult and sensitive details remain obscure. But what is
known is that it outlines a comprehensive plan for a five-year period of
interim Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two or three
years into which 'confidence-building' phase, talks about the final status
of a Palestinian 'entity', probably in confederation with Jordan, will
begin.
At the heart of the agreement is the so-called 'Gaza-Jericho First' plan
which envisages an Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and from
a hitherto undefined enclave around Jericho. Gaza, a 360 sq km sliver of
land, is home to 780,000 economically deprived Palestinians, many living in
sprawling squalid shanty towns. A Palestinian elected interim authority will
assume full control over Palestinian affairs in Gaza-Jericho but its powers
will fall short of a Palestinian mini-state. In the rest of the occupied
West Bank, excluding east Jerusalem, the Palestinians will have lesser
powers over their affairs.
There are sufficient uncertainties to warrant caution about whether the deal
will stick. The extent of Israeli withdrawal, for example, remains unclear.
The PLO has said the agreement provides for a full withdrawal of Israeli
troops and military administration. Jerusalem says the agreement means a
troop redeployment away from the population centres in Gaza-Jericho but
leaves the Israeli army with a security role for settlers in Gaza and for
the critical road between Jerusalem and the Allenby bridge border crossing
into Jordan. It is also unclear whether Israel will agree to PLO
interpretations of the agreement that as soon as the document is signed the
PLO leadership, including Mr Arafat, will be able to relocate to either
Jericho or Gaza.
Despite the doubts, however, the agreement may be different from the dozens
of other peace plans that have littered the map of the Middle East - partly
through its design, and partly as a result of the atmosphere in which it has
been constructed.
Mr Arafat, in particular, has been under intense pressure to strike a deal.
As a result it was the the PLO, bereft of powerful friends, crippled by
internal dissension, mounting criticism from extremists, and a cash crisis,
that played the key role in bringing both sides to a draft settlement.
From Mr Rabin's point of view, the deal is carefully crafted to deflect
potential domestic criticism. Firstly, it leaves untouched the largest
potentially hostile community - the estimated 120,000 Jewish settlers in the
West Bank. The most directly affected settlers - the small community of
4,000 in Gaza - have long been told that they will eventually have to move.
Secondly the agreement has no serious impact on Israel's borders or its
security arrangements. Indeed, Mr Rabin can exploit widespread enthusiasm
for getting rid of Israel's major security headache - the Gaza Strip, which
has long been the scene of the worse Pales-tinian attacks against Israeli
soldiers.
Thirdly the Israeli public has become gradually accustomed to the government
talking to the PLO - a move Mr Rabin argues was implicitly sanctioned by the
previous Likud government at the 1991 Madrid conference.
Nor - despite mounting accusations of betrayal from the right yesterday -
does Mr Rabin need to worry that the proposed deal poses a threat to his
coalition. For the moment he has an unshakeable majority in the Knesset of
67 votes to 53. Although his coalition is fragile owing to a continuing row
with a small religious party, the Knesset coalition for peace is much more
solid.
All these factors have led the government to believe it has a window of
opportunity now to do a deal with relatively small concessions to the
Palestinians.
Its attractions to the Israelis are many. It seems to contain PLO
concessions on the ultra-sensitive question of who should control Jerusalem,
long claimed by Israel as its 'eternal and indivisible capital'. Also, the
autonomy arrangements for Gaza-Jericho provide maximum reassurance: although
the Palestinians will have full internal powers over education, health,
economic policy and housing over the estimated 900,000 population of
Gaza-Jericho, Israel will continue to be the predominant authority by virtue
of the enclaves' dependence on Israel proper. It is bound to exploit this
economic dependence to the limit as a way of ensuring that the interim
Palestinian authority toes the line.
But the agreement does have its attractions for the 64-year-old Mr Arafat as
well. It appears to deliver a tangible and rapid step towards Palestinian
self-rule. And it should allow the PLO to make a quick start in tackling the
deteriorating conditions of Palestinians in the territories who have been
drawn to the Islamic fundamentalism of the Hamas movement.
The challenge - to deliver rapid economic improvement to Palestinians in the
territories - is herculean. If the PLO fails, Israel would have no reason to
cede control over any more of the West Bank. If it succeeds in Gaza-Jericho,
however, the Palestinian people may be on the road to claiming a respectable
portion of its rightful inheritance.

A burglar rifling a house was suddenly surprised by a voice saying: 'Me and

desperately until he spotted the culprit, a parrot.
Recovering his composure, the burglar asked the parrot what it was called.
'Imogen', replied the bird. 'That's a silly name for a parrot', said the
burglar.
'Not half as silly as calling a rottweiler Jesus', chirped the bird.

Glad to hear bassoonist and economist Bill Robinson has found another
opportunity to earn a crust, three months after losing the last one as
special adviser to Norman Lamont.
Robinson starts work tomorrow with London Economics, run by John Kay and
Nick Morris, where his main task will be to extend the consultancy's
established reputation in microeconomics into the macro arena.
So how is the jobs market for former advisers to sacked chancellors? Working
in a think tank did not appeal - 'I've done that before at the Institute of
Fiscal Studies', says the ever-affable Robinson. And talks with three City
firms 'did not work out'.
Meanwhile, will London Economics' corporate clients be prepared to pay good
money for forecasts of inflation rates and trade deficits?
'We want to develop techniques for macroeconomic risk management', he says.
'People are a bit disillusioned with forecasting.'

Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, whose troops control about 70 per cent
of Bosnia, is not a name usually identified with peace and ethnic harmony.
So some surprise to see that the Greek Orthodox Church has appointed him a
member of the 900-year-old Knights' order of the first rank of Saint
Dionysius of Xanthe for 'his contribution to peace in the world'.
However, the medal probably says more about the ever-blossoming
Greco-Serbian alliance than Karadzic's contributions to humanity.
Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, a close friend of Greek prime minister
Mitsotakis, who has lobbied for his Slavic neighbour, is planning to visit
Greece early next month.

Which world leader watched 50 of the 52 matches televised in the 1990 soccer
World Cup, is an avid bridge player and saw his son paralysed by being
thrown out of a window by his own guards?
Despite his public disapproval of the cult of personality, Deng Xiaoping,
China's paramount leader, has allowed the Chinese taboo against publishing
an account of the life of someone still alive to be infringed with the
publication of his biography. Written by his daughter, Deng Rong, it is now
being serialised in mass-circulation Chinese newspapers.
But Rong's rose-coloured prose allows for no hint of scandal in her beloved
father's life. She provides some details of his student days in France -
where he developed decidedly bourgeois tastes for wine, cheese, coffee,
bridge and his life-long interest in soccer - and in Moscow.
Deng had three wives; the first died in childbirth in 1930, the second left
him after a political disagreement in 1933, and the third, whom he married
in 1939, produced five children. Rong is the youngest.
Having just turned 89, his 'meeting with Karl Marx' cannot be far off; the
tone of the book suggests that Deng is moving from the realm of earthly
being towards communist sainthood.

Now that Barclays has roundly trumped National Westminster, bringing in
41-year-old Martin Taylor, who beats Derek Wanless by four years in the
chief executive youth stakes, the question of succession at Lloyds recurs,
both men being a generation younger than Lloyds' 61-year-old boss.
Brian Pitman, a wise old bird who has avoided some of the obvious pitfalls
of the last decade, will bow out in 1995, three years after the bank's
retirement age.
Inside favourites as next-in-command include 51-year-old Paul Brown, a
talented linguist, now heading retail banking. Another front-runner, David
Pirrie, three years his senior and in charge of international and private
banking, was in 1986 tipped to run Standard Chartered had that eccentric bid
gone through. John Anderson, boss of Lloyds' National Bank of New Zealand,
is also thought to be in with a chance, even if his British banking
experience is limited.
None, however, is a sure-fire custodian of Lloyds' daunting reputation as
the UK's best-managed bank, so perhaps it is time to search the younger
echelons. There are a couple of bright regional heads; Gordon Pell, 43, in
charge of Thames Valley, and Dennis Holt, 44, for the south-west. Or perhaps
Michael Hepher, 49, who departed for British Telecom two years ago, could be
lured back.
The real, but unlikely, trump would be a female candidate. Prominent as City
regulators - think of Frances Heaton of the Takeover Panel or Rosalind
Gilmore at the Building Societies Commission - women have yet to breach the
formidable terrain of the senior clearing bank hierarchies.
Nor is the current fad for ex-journalists - Taylor, but also Rupert
Pennant-Rea - a rich vein. Sarah Hogg, ex-Telegraph journalist turned Number
Ten policy unit head, was an outsider as the next Bank of England governor,
but running number three of Britain's 'big four' clearers might be a
come-down for one sometimes assumed to be running the country.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLESS NIGERIA'S civilian leaders settle their differences, the grip of the
military will tighten and the country's crisis will deepen.
The promise by Chief Moshood Abiola to return to Lagos this week and claim
the presidency denied him is dangerous and impractical. The bellicose
response from Chief Ernest Shonekan's new interim government, equating such
an act with insurrection, smacks of a military diktat. Neither serves the
interests of 80 million anxious Nigerians.
United the two men are better placed to demand that the military fulfill its
promise to hand-over to civilian rule; divided they may provide General
Ibrahim Babangida with a pretext to return.
The general, who ostensibly stepped down last Thursday as Nigeria's military
leader, has left a dangerous legacy. The new interim civilian government has
little popular support, and the military regime behind it is divided.
Babangida loyalists wish to extend military rule, some officers are anxious
to return to barracks, while others believe it is their turn to plunder
state coffers.
Meanwhile the economy continues its rapid deterioration. The country's
structural adjustment programme has lapsed, and mounting arrears push
external debt towards Dollars 34bn, well beyond the country's capacity to
service. A general strike called in support of Chief Abiola paralyses Lagos
and threatens to disrupt vital oil exports. Last week's announcement of a
ten-fold increase in the price of a new premium grade of petrol coincided
with a nation-wide shortage of the lower grade fuel, infuriating the public
and risking massive protests when the holiday weekend finishes today
Confronted by the country's worst crisis since the Biafran civil war in the
1960s, civilian politicians are split into two camps.
Pragmatic argument
One supports the interim government led by Chief Shonekan, albeit with
generals in charge, but has promised fresh elections by March next year. The
other insists that Chief Abiola's victory in the annulled June presidential
poll be put into effect.
Both have a case. The former is based on the pragmatic argument that
civilians must make the best of the army's terms; the latter rests on the
principle that the electorate's verdict should be respected, and maintains
that the army's record of broken promises warrants confrontation.
Ethnic rivalries
But underlying a division over tactics are tense ethnic rivalries, with the
Yoruba south lining up behind Mr Abiola, and the Hausa-Fulani north seeking
a second chance to win the presidency.
Before Mr Abiola risks a confrontation that could split the nation, Mr
Shonekan should be given time to show that his alternative could work.
Admittedly there is good reason to be sceptical. The previous interim
government was also led by Mr Shonekan. Within weeks it became clear that
the civilians were powerless.
Nor does the new cabinet inspire confidence. It includes a minister of
information who enthusiastically endorsed the recent banning of several
newspapers. The proposed minister of planning is a vociferous critic of the
economic reforms Mr Shonekan tried unsuccessfully to revive.
If Nigerians are to be convinced that this time round things are different,
he has to act swiftly. He has already taken some first steps, persuading the
military to shorten the transition period from 12 to six months. Over the
weekend he released jailed journalists and human rights campaigners. He
should follow this by lifting the newspaper ban.
But above all he should seek an accommodation with Chief Abiola, in which
together they keep up pressure on the military. The chief should be
guaranteed safe passage when he returns home, together with the right to
contest the March election. In return Mr Abiola should suspend his threat to
form a Lagos-based government.
The generals may object: in which case the interim government is exposed as
a sham, and Nigeria's prospects are bleak indeed. But in the meantime Mr
Shonekan annd Mr Abiola owe it to their country to exchange olive branches,
not epithets. The sooner the two men find common cause, the better the
chance that democracy will finally come to Nigeria.

FT  31 AUG 93 / United in disunity: The Arab mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and LAMIS ANDONI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never in the 22 months of the Middle East peace process have minds been more
wonderfully concentrated. To its advocates, the 'Gaza-Jericho first'
proposal offers for the first time the prospect of Palestinian autonomy in
the lands occupied by Israel in 1967. To its opponents, it is a
'catastrophe', in the words yesterday of Mr Abdul Aziz Rantisi, the exiled
leader of Hamas, the Palestinians' militant Islamic movement. The next few
weeks will show whether Mr Rantisi and other rejectionists can avert this
'catastrophe'.
For the moderate Arab governments who have pressured the Palestinian
leadership to agree to this first, limited form of autonomy, the
'Gaza-Jericho first' proposal is the start of the endgame. Mr Amr Moussa,
the Egyptian foreign minister, welcomed the proposed deal as such yesterday,
saying any withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied lands was welcome,
though only so if it was the first step in a greater disengagement.
But the rejectionists within the Palestinian fold signalled their profound
distaste for a deal which they see as a sell-out by a beleaguered Mr Yassir
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Can organisations
such as Mr Ahmed Jibril's radical PFLP-GC and Hamas, which has been the main
beneficiary within Gaza and the West Bank of the long stalemate in the peace
process, muster the force to stop the proposal? The answer will lie partly
in the hands of the sponsors of these groups, who have a habit of playing
the rejectionist card for their own ends - most particularly Syria and Iran.
Very little is ever clear about the strategy of Syria's President Hafez
al-Assad, except that it involves patience and caution. But he has already
shown willingness to rein in rejectionist groups his government sponsors in
the interests of an eventual peace. The recent decision to lean on
Hizbollah, the pro-Iranian and deeply rejectionist guerrilla group, after
its attacks on Israel prompted a week-long bombardment of south Lebanon, was
the most telling example - and seems to have cleared the air in the
Syria-Israel peace talks.
But whether Syria would be prepared to act similarly with respect to groups
such as Mr Jibril's is unclear. Equally, there is doubt as to whether either
Syria or Iran can decisively control rejectionist groups which have garnered
increasingly strong grass-roots support in the occupied territories.
Mr Assad is not in a strong position to argue with them, given that many
Palestinians see him as hastening to conclude a 'separate peace' with Israel
involving the return of all or part of the Golan Heights, captured by the
Israelis in the 1967 war. The Syrian leader's repeated assertions that he
has no intention of proceeding to a full peace with Israel without them do
not cut much ice with Palestinians mindful of the violent history of their
relations with Damascus.
Those who oppose the current peace plan argue that once a limited autonomy
deal is concluded, Syria will move full-speed to a broad normalisation of
relations with Israel. The result, say the critics, could be a matter of
'Gaza-Jericho last' as well as first, with the Palestinians having to settle
for exercising self-rule only in those two small enclaves. Syria's attitude
 -and Jordan's, a country whose own peace deal with Israel is all but done -
may also be influenced by the way the present proposal was reached
substantially without their consultation. Some observers suggested yesterday
that this could prompt both countries to take a harder line with Israel,
partly so as to resist pressure to make greater concessions themselves. Both
Amman and Damascus were notably muted yesterday in their response to the
proposal.
Much will depend on the contents of an eventual 'Gaza-Jericho' agreement. If
it appears to open the way for direct linkage between an interim period of
Palestinian autonomy and a final agreement - one which would address the
still unresolved issue of the status of Jerusalem - it would be hard for
either Syria or Jordan to hold out against the PLO-negotiated deal.
But if opposition to the deal deepens and widens, both within the occupied
territories and among the hundreds of thousands of diaspora Palestinians in
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, then Jordan, in particular, could decide to
position itself for a broader agreement giving it greater control over the
occupied West Bank. Syria, too, might then decide that it cannot peg its own
peace with Israel to an interim agreement which proves to have broad,
grass-roots opposition among the Palestinians.
The key, in both cases, will be the degree of Palestinian opposition to the
agreement. Many independent Palestinian groups, and even many in the
mainstream Fatah group, have already voiced doubts about 'Gaza-Jericho'.
Mr Arafat will have to demonstrate to the Palestinian rejectionists that
this deal will be tightly linked to a comprehensive settlement leading to a
total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, and recognising the
right of diaspora refugees to return.
Whatever else the 'Gaza-Jericho' proposal will achieve, it appears already
to have shifted the fundamental axis on which the peace process will turn.
As Mr Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, the Egyptian commentator, noted yesterday: 'We
are no longer looking simply at an Arab-Israeli confrontation - now the
confrontation is within the Palestinian camp.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor (2): No illusions over Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D A A FAGANDINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir In your leader of August 27 you point belatedly to the fact that the
financial world is overwhelmed by English-speaking analysts and
commentators. Nevertheless, your standpoint remains unchanged as you try to
interpret the policies of the German central bank.
You continue to underestimate two considerations that influence the
Bundesbank's decisions over and above its current statutory duties: first,
that if there is to be a single European currency it will have to be
indistinguishable from the D-Mark; and second, that the central bank
responsible for a European currency will have to demonstrate - and be able
to defend - its independence, not only from politicians but above all from
the market.
It is obvious that the attitude in Frankfurt is that, if possible, no
significant reduction in base rates should occur under market pressures and
that, for as long as thunder continues to roll in New York and London, such
corrections will be resisted. Too much is at stake.
It should be equally obvious that a majority of continental politicians are
under no illusions. There is a deep-seated, if unstructured, demand for a
higher degree of unity; it may be naive but it is a political reality that
the UK has never fully appreciated.
Matters would be quite different if the cohorts of English-speaking analysts
could point to decades of successful economic management where their advice
was taken seriously.
Regrettably that is not the case. Those with whom we have felt most
comfortable in the marketplace will always have the strength to safeguard
their dollar.
Sterling, our once proud unit, will be left to its fate, and we to ask
ourselves how that came about. No reasons are to be found in any of the
memoirs of our politicians.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALLAN SAUNDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the editor of the only English-language newsletter focusing on
German monetary policy I have to take issue with your contention that it is
almost impossible for non-German analysts to understand what the Bundesbank
is about ('Bundesbank stays tough', leading article, August 27).
It is very simple really. The Bundesbank has a legal mandate to combat
domestic inflation. Its 1957 constitution makes no mention of cross-border
responsibilities. And domestic growth and employment are accorded
considerably lower priority. So why the puzzlement as to Bundesbank motives?
Two further points. First, there is a growing case for questioning if high
nominal short rates are, under the present circumstances, the best method of
bringing German money supply and inflation back under control.
They are artificially inflating time deposits (32.5 per cent of M3) to the
detriment of longer-term forms of savings, and they are inducing speculative
capital inflows that expand overall domestic liquidity.
Second, non-German financial professionals constantly overlook the fact that
credit policy decisions in Germany are made by a Bundesbank council
consisting of 16 members, each with one vote and an individual political
affiliation.
Rate decisions are a matter of high politics in both a partisan and a
personal sense within this closed forum - whatever the Bundesbank itself
tries to maintain.
As long as many in the council, including its current president, continue to
believe that high rates are the solution to unacceptably high inflation, the
absence of cuts on July 29 and last week completely fulfils the Bundesbank's
constitutional mandate.
There are, however, signs that a rethink of the current high-rate policy is
being kindled by the newly appointed senior Bundesbank officials,
particularly vice-president designate Johann Wilhelm Gaddum.
Such arguments have yet to win the hearts and minds of the council majority.
But we believe that they will do so well before the end of the year.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Quest for a strategy: A look at the debates in Nato over its
future shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As President Bill Clinton returns to Washington this week after his seaside
holiday, domestic and economic problems, such as the ambitious reform of the
healthcare system or the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
loom largest on his agenda for the autumn.
But the clocks are running on a more international task, the transformation
of the Atlantic alliance to meet a new set of needs and perils after the end
of the Cold War.
One clock is of Mr Clinton's own setting: the summit of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation scheduled for January 10, called at the US's request,
demands an effort to spell out a new future for the alliance.
Ticking more insistently, however, is the festering disaster that confronts
Nato and the world community in Bosnia.
If Bosnia is the model for the kind of regional and ethnic conflict that
will replace the monolithic threat of the Warsaw Pact in Nato's strategic
planning, it has posed uncomfortable questions that have received few good
answers.
'It is a terrible model but it is the first one,' commented Mr Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington and
formerly a senior foreign policy official in the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
Mr Sonnenfeldt is one of many observers who join General John Shalikashvili,
the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe who has just been appointed to the
chairmanship of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, in arguing that Nato has, at
least on the technical and military level, done well in the face of the
Bosnian crisis.
'On a military level the institution has performed very effectively. What
has not happened are the political decisions that trigger action,' Mr
Sonnenfeldt said, pointing to the plans drawn up, but never implemented, for
the policing of the Vance-Owen peace plan as well as for air strikes against
the Serbs.
Colonel Don Snider, director of political-military affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research centre, sees a
need for further changes to Nato's command structure and conventional
forces, but agrees that the greatest challenge is in the political area.
'The political transformation of the alliance is not complete,' he said.
In the search for a broader political vision of the future of Nato, clear
leadership has yet to emerge from the governments of member countries, and
especially from the US; for the moment, at least, the debate is taking place
mostly among academics.
One contribution to the debate, by Messrs Ronald Asmus, Richard Kugler and
Stephen Larrabee of the Rand Corporation, a California-based think tank, is
published today in the journal Foreign Affairs.
The authors have worked closely with Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana
Republican who is one of the few members of Congress to have grappled with
the issue, and who has trademarked the catchy phrase 'out of area or out of
business' to summarise Nato's dilemma.
They argue that Nato desperately needs to address the conflicts along its
southern and eastern flanks if it is not to become irrelevant, and spell out
six political steps they see as necessary 'to forge a new transatlantic
bargain'.
The first is 'to transform Nato from an alliance based on collective defence
against a specific threat into an alliance committed to projecting
democracy, stability and crisis management in a broader strategic sense'.
Nato also needs a more harmonious balance between the US and Europe and a
strong Germany fully participating in the alliance.
Asmus, Kugler and Larrabee also urge a constructive security relationship
with both Russia and the Ukraine, and a co-ordinated strategy for the
integration of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and possibly Slovakia as
members of the alliance.
The call for Nato to extend its membership to the east is now widely echoed
in US academic circles, though hotly contested in the same issue of Foreign
Affairs by Mr Owen Harries, formerly a senior Australian diplomat.
Poland last week renewed its urgings to Nato to make a formal statement that
it viewed the country as a future member after President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia declared Polish membership would not be contrary to Russia's
interests.
But although the proposal is gaining ground in the US Congress, where
Senator Lugar has warmly endorsed it, and also among some German
politicians, in the US administration ideas about 'outreach' to eastern
Europe stop well short of early Nato membership.
Most European governments, meanwhile, are too preoccupied with ensuring the
US does not leave the alliance to be much interested in new members.
Academics and think-tank analysts in Washington complain bitterly that the
Clinton administration is still a very long way from formulating anything
like a comprehensive approach to Nato's future - although many are hopeful
that General Shalikashvili has thought hard about the problem and may inject
a new sense of urgency.
'Right now I don't think anybody in the administration can tell you what
they are going to do at the Nato summit,' says Colonel Snider.
So far, haphazard defence budget cuts in the US and Europe have done more to
reforge Nato than any clear strategic conception.
Because it was he who called for the meeting - and because his claim to
leadership on the world stage remains sparse - Mr Clinton stands in
particular need of turning next January's summit into a success.
But if Nato continues to play the grand old Duke of York in Bosnia, marching
its troops to the top of the hill and then marching them back down again, it
seems likely to be seen to have failed its first big post-Cold War test -
whatever the effectiveness of its military planning.
If the Bosnian crisis continues to fester, Nato's perceived failure there
could cloud the summit, and the alliance's future.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Dilution measures for acid rain: The UK's awkward diplomacy
may be tarnishing a hard-won record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of whose pollution is producing acid rain, causing European
forests to wither and fish to die, is one of the longest-running
international environmental disputes. Officals from 36 countries meeting in
Geneva this week will try to find an answer.
The issue is particularly sensitive for Britain, which has been accused of
jeopardising a United Nations-backed treaty to curb the pollution. Britain's
refusal in 1985 to sign an earlier agreement curbing sulphur emissions, one
of the leading causes of acid rain, earned it the tag of 'dirty man of
Europe'. The UK has found it hard to shrug off the label, despite
introducing expensive measures to clean up power stations, the main
polluters.
Now Britain's resistance to the latest, more stringent targets proposed by
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva, which includes
western and eastern Europe as well as the US and Canada, is drawing new
venom from its neighbours. Earlier this month, , Mr Thorbjoern Berntsen,
Norway's environment minister, hurled personal abuse at Mr John Gummer, his
UK counterpart.
The British reluctance is prompted by the desire to protect the already
shrunken demand for British coal from power generators. Tighter emission
standards might force them to burn less British coal. But some government
officials privately fear that the UK is sacrificing its hard-won
environmental record for nothing.
The programme to close mines and to generate a greater proportion of
electricity from gas means that the UK may meet the proposed targets, in the
same way that it has now met the terms of the 1985 protocol it once
resisted. 'The negotiating position on acid rain is not taking account of
the actual run-down of the coal industry,' according to one observer of the
talks.
International disputes over acid rain first emerged at the end of the 1970s
when the Scandinavians sought explanations for why some of their forests
were turning brown. Acid rain is caused mainly by sulphur dioxide, which is
emitted when coal and oil are burnt, and by nitrogen oxides, emitted by
power stations and transport. The acidity is generally slight, 'about the
same as a can of Coca-Cola', says Professor Ian Fells of Nottingham
University. But the gases, sometimes dissolved in rain, can travel thousands
of miles - across national borders - before being deposited, making disputes
particularly hard to resolve.
Scientists generally agree about the harmful effect of the acid on water
quality and fish, and its role in corroding buildings. However, 'there is
more doubt about the mechanism of damage to trees - it can be hard to
distinguish the effects (of acid rain) from those of drought', says Prof
Fells.
The source of acid rain is clear, however. In Britain, coal-burning power
stations are the main culprits, spewing out 72 per cent of total sulphur
emissions in 1990. They also discharged 28 per cent of nitrogen oxides in
the same year, though this is less than the amount discharged by traffic.
Nevertheless, Britain's emissions have been falling because the decline of
heavy manufacturing has reduced industrial energy demand, and there has been
a switch by domestic users from coal and oil to gas. Sulphur dioxide
emissions
dropped from 6.4m tonnes in 1970 to 4.9m tonnes in 1980 and 3.5m tonnes last
year.
Emissions are now set to fall further, partly because of the need to fall
into line with the European Commission's large combustion plant directive, a
treaty covering power stations. National Power, one of the two main
generators in the UK, emitted 1.3m tonnes of sulphur dioxide last year; it
must halve that level by 2003. PowerGen, the second-biggest generator, last
year produced slightly less than 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide and must cut
levels to 669,000 tonnes by 1998.
These targets will be reached by two routes. The first - fitting old,
coal-fired power stations with equipment to remove sulphur and other
pollution - is expensive. Between them, the generators expect to spend more
than Pounds 3bn on such improvements during the 1990s. But power companies
find it cheaper to switch to cleaner fuels such as natural gas or imported
coal, which has roughly half the sulphur content.
The result of these changes, environment ministers say, is that the UK will
not only meet the EC directive on large plants, but also the terms of the
1985 United Nations treaty it refused to sign. That prediction holds firm,
ministers say, despite the government's decision this month to license the
use of orimulsion, dubbed the 'world's dirtiest fuel'.
Despite such optimism, Britain is arguing in Geneva that it would have
difficulty meeting the proposed terms. The UK's neighbours are pressing for
it to make a 79 per cent cut in sulphur emissions on 1980 levels possibly by
2000. Britain is countering with a bid of a 70 per cent cut by 2005.
Other countries derive the 79 per cent figure from the model developed by
the Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, the
most-quoted of the three scientific models used by the UN. According to Ms
Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group,
Britain's reluctance to accept the 79 per cent target implies that it is
abandoning 'the principle of basing standards on good science'.
Government officials reject this claim, saying that Britain's resistance
stems from disagreement with the model. They argue that another UN model,
run by Imperial College in London, recommends a lower target for UK
emis-sions.
But officials also concede that the principal force behind the British
position in Geneva is the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to
protect British Coal, after the political storm aroused by this year's pit
closures. The DTI fears that power generators would turn to imported coal or
shut down ageing coal-fired power stations prematurely rather than fit
expensive pollution-control equipment.
Some independent forecasters endorse this view. Mr Jim Skea, energy
specialist with the Sussex University-based Science Policy Research Unit,
says: 'If the government signed up to a 79 per cent reduction by 2005, that
would probably be the nail in the coffin for what is left of the British
coal industry.'
The DTI argues, though, that its caution is warranted. Its officials believe
the decision not to sign the 1985 protocol was right at the time - a fall in
emissions during the 1980s was not anticipated.
But some officials in the UK environment department point out that the
dispute on targets may be unnecessary. The irony, they suggest, is that many
coal-fired power stations are scheduled to be taken out of commission only a
few years after the date set for pollution reductions. Britain will then see
a further sharp fall in emissions, and may, after all, meet the toughest
proposed targets.
If this is the case, the UK government's awkward diplomacy on acid rain
will, for a second time, have tarnished the appearance of a respectable
environmental record. In the meantime, by insisting on keeping its options
open, Britain is dealing itself a difficult hand, and its neighbours'
frustration is unsurprising. If 'drittsekk' is the only insult hurled at
British cabinet ministers on the road to a new sulphur protocol, and
Norwegian the only European language in which abuse is uttered, the
government may consider that it has got off lightly.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Go for less accuracy in forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST J FREYHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, July's lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement figure
(not, please, 'number') followed hard on the heels of last year's lower than
estimated current account deficit. Once again, this underlines the
precariousness of short-term economic forecasts. And because of the growing
likelihood of a lower than budgeted PSBR out-turn for the current financial
year as a whole, it also points to inaccuracy in long-term forecasting.
So why can't forecasters take the hint and hedge their bets more safely by
forsaking the dare-devilry of decimal-point precision, in favour of nothing
more ambitious than half, or at most quarter percentage-point gradations
only? (As if the difference between actual or forecast 1.2 and 1.3 per cent
gross domestic product growth was at all meaningful.)
Let them remember, first, that the greater the accuracy aimed at, the poorer
the accuracy likely to be achieved, quite apart from the ricketiness of
underlying data.
Second, let awareness of their fallibility encourage more humility on their
part and less gullibility on ours - both, admittedly, tall orders.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Satellite and cable offer excellent
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN BURKITT-GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So who does have original programming on television these days,
Christopher Dunkley could have asked before he savaged cable and satellite
channels ('Scrambled Sky at a premium', August 25).
Look at the schedules for that day. At peak time, 9.30pm, all four
terrestrial channels had repeats. Of course they also produce lots of their
own material. So, in time, will the cable and satellite channels in the UK -
just as, for example, Discovery's US parent is doing after only a few years
in business. It already has fresh programming: last month it showed the
four-part series, The Dinosaurs, later repeated by Channel Four.
Both Sky News and CNN International carry original programming of the most
expensive kind all day (including FT Reports). I, for one, would not be
without them. Meanwhile, this weekend the cable and satellite sports
channels had live cycling, motor racing, motorcycle racing, horse racing,
golf, tennis, athletics, soccer and rugby league. Not to my taste, perhaps
not to Mr Dunkley's. But to offer such programmes is hardly 'repackaging
parasites'.
What is wrong with repeats, anyway? The BBC has revived a 1960s cult by
digging out Thunderbirds and today it is dedicating the whole day to a
celebration of that decade. Is this very different from having Sunday's
choice of The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Oliver Twist on UK Gold, Brighton
Rock and Loot on Bravo?

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Canadian Opera Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the splash-making themes of this year's Edinburgh festival is the
representation of four internationally 'hot' theatre-directors: Peter
Sellars, Bob Wilson, Robert Lepage, and - the focus of this final week -
Peter Stein. This is the sort of high-wire planning and achievement that (in
this country at least) now go on nowhere else. And certainly, the Canadian
Opera Company double bill of Lepage-produced one-act operas by Bartok and
Schoenberg - shown at the Edinburgh Playhouse at the weekend (for two
performances only]) - proved the very stuff of festival art: fresh, daring,
full of striking ideas executed on a level well beyond the quotidian
mundane.
It was an occasion full of firsts: the first British sojourn of Canada's
leading opera company, Lepage's first encounters with opera, the first
performances at the restored Playhouse after the eve-of-festival backstage
fire. The French-Canadian Lepage, whose in-the-mud Midsummer Night's Dream
was recently staged at the Royal National Theatre, is a theatre magician,
conjuror of a floating succession of picturesque images, sometimes haunting
and sometimes startling, through which narrative is advanced.
Bartok's duo-drama Bluebeard's Castle and Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung -
two crypto-autobiographical masterpieces from the first decade of our
century in which the deepest human passions are analysed in music and
through psycho-symbolic stagecraft - would seem to offer him rich
opportunities for just such conjuring.
Both operas, designed (by Michael Levine, brilliantly) to operate different
features of the same setting, here colonise different corners of the same
dream-world. In both the stage, fronted by a gauze scrim, is lined along the
right by the same large block-built wall, a surface pregnant with
possibilities - in Bartok, for reflecting the light-images thrown by the
seven-fold door-opening on the opposite stage side; in Schoenberg, for
suddenly releasing surreal visions through unexpected apertures and for
supporting marvellous slow-motion body-tricks with gravity.
Fluid patterns of imagery are set in motion by cinematic changes of lighting
(or should have been: at the Playhouse neither Robert Thomson 's
lighting-plot nor the general level of stage management was expertly
seamless as one guesses they were meant to be). The unfolding of both
operas, indeed, borrows from film method and manner: in grossly
oversimplified terms, Eisenstein-cum-Disney.
In principle the style would appear ideally devised to unlock the tortured
poetic secrets of both pieces. In practice I found it unexpectedly erratic '
partly because banal moments (advert-style autumn leaves and over-used plays
with water-reflection) mingle with the magical, partly because a certain
intellectual shallowness can be detected in Lepage's larger response to both
operas.
The Bartok couple, though handsomely personated by Victor Braun and Jane
Gilbert, are prone to obvious, melodramatic gesturing. More simple-minded
still, in the Schoenberg, is the framing of the whole piece as an asylum
patient's pathological fantasy - a straitjacket, a hospital bed, a
psychiatrist with notebook are some of the ways in which Lepage, by
'explaining' the opera's content, robs its symbolic substance of
multi-layered suggestiveness. Blood-links between the worlds of Schoenberg
and Freud may be numerous and easily instanced, but that is no excuse for a
cartoon-ish reductiveness in treatment of Erwartung.
If the reason was a determination to make more accessible a supposedly
'difficult' opera by a famously tough-nut composer, why then the singing of
both Schoenberg and Bartok in the original languages, with surtitles high up
and far away on the Playhouse proscenium arch? The total effect - of
production style linked to the distancing impact of language-choice and of
gauze limiting the performers' expressiveness of acting detail - was, I
would say, the opposite: concealment as much as revelation.
Happily, however, the excellence of the purely musical realisation worked
its own countervailing action. The Canadian Opera Company orchestra, plainly
of very high quality, showed itself in complete command of the Bartok's
floods of colour no less than Schoenberg's nerve-end refinements of musical
imagery; under Richard Bradshaw (COC chief conductor) both scores were
revealed in depth.
Victor Braun, though lacking lowest-register solidity, is a superbly dark,
noble Bluebeard, Jane Gilbert a vocally lustrous, wide-ranging mezzo Judith.
The Erwartung protagonist, Rebecca Blankenship, used an uneven dramatic
soprano with admirable warmth, commitment and emotional urgency. In spite of
my cavils, it all added up to a genuine festival-event.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Edinburgh circus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look on this circus and on this. Here we see smiling fresh-faced young
performers, dressed in fairy tale costumes juggling cheerfully as they spin
across the ice. There we see a grotesquely tattooed man known as The Enigma,
crunching live locusts and chewing worms.
Circus has always been generous in its range, presenting the height of human
endeavour in the ring while embracing freaks in its side shows. Today
political correctness has forced circuses to specialise and the great
Russian Circus on Ice offers escapist delight for children, while Jim Rose's
American Circus Sideshow provides acts that usually surface in a Hammer
move.
Both have their attractions. A man on a monocycle (yawn, yawn); a man on a
monocycle skipping (yawn); but a man on a monocycle skipping on ice - now
that's entertainment. The performance is sugary in the extreme, but its
expertise and physical precision hold the interest, and you expect some camp
in a tent.
I only closed my eyes once in Jim Rose's tent, erected on Carlton Hill with
its stunning views over Edinburgh. That was when the Torture King put
needles through his eyes. But it is all done against a backdrop of Rose's
genially hysterical commentary which by the end had convinced me with its
mock Gothic that at least some of the bodily defying deeds were tricks. This
'circus of the scars' was in its way as camp as its rival in The Meadows.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Exhibitions away from the festival - Art at Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all that the festival proper would rather have nothing to do with such
things, Edinburgh is currently full of worthwhile exhibitions, with the
National Galleries of Scotland offering a substantial quiverfull. The
Queen's Holbeins at the National Gallery apart, the most important is the
show of early-modern Russian painting put together by the Musee des Beaux
Arts de Nantes, which has come to the Museum of Modern Art for its sole
British showing.
Its subject is the heroic period of Russian modernism from the turn of the
century to the first years of the Communist state. The subject has been
thoroughly investigated since the spirit of glasnost threw open Russian
collections locked away these 60 years. Even so, drawn as it is for the most
part from regional museums from Samara to Novgorod, this remarkable show
brings us many works for the first time, fresh and fascinating.
Not that it breaks new ground exactly: the expected names are here and no
new reputations are made, no accepted critical analysis overturned. It is
but an open celebration of the work as it is, in all its variety, and a
poignant memorial to an historic moment and opportunity lost. For here was a
national school of such vigour and originality that, had it remained within
the mainstream of modernist development, might have profoundly moderated its
course. Would the assumed authority of the Paris school have remained so
persuasive for so long? Would the habit, now ingrained, of assuming there to
be at any moment a single significant centre of activity, have taken such a
hold? The questions hang in the air.
As it was the Russians had influence enough, on the course of abstraction
and constructivism especially, through such as Kandinsky and Malevich, and
such work as remained in the west. The greater loss was to expressionism,
which in its Russian manifestation - alive to developments elsewhere, in
Germany especially, in the years before 1914  - brought to it a zest and
geniality, wonderfully angst-free, derived from its alternative sources in
the profound folk tradition.
Goncharova, Popova, Rozanova, Stepanova - how important the women are -
Falk, Filanov, Kravchenko, Larianov, Shevchenko, and Chagall, Malevich,
Kandinsky and so many more besides: Cubist still-lifes, suprematist
abstraction, streets in the snow, country villages, men talking, women
working - it is a lovely show.
* The National Galleries have also taken over the Royal Scottish Academy,
filling its ample spaces with an ambitious historical survey of drawings,
water-colours and prints by Scottish artists from 1700 to 1990. It is a
dense and constantly intriguing show that holds many beautiful and
remarkable things, yet it has to be said that it over-reaches itself. Set up
under such a heading as The Line of Tradition,it invites an expectation of
continuity and thematic consistency that in the event is simply not
sustained.
The landscape, the portrait and the figure, the colourist instinct,
objectivity, romanticism - any one of these would have supplied a proper
theme for a smaller, more concentrated and particular show. I am all for a
miscellany, openly acknowledged, but even that would have been better for a
shorter historical span. In this respect this show simply tails off into a
token presentation of a few currently fashionable names allowed a
disproportionate amount of space. None of this should put off the visitor
prepared to immerse himself in the material and indulge his own interests
and enjoyments. Scottish painting and graphic art from the 1880s well into
the 1960s was especially strong and too readily disregarded by the world at
large. There are many fine examples here - James Cowie's studies of his
students, William Gillies' landscapes, James MacBey's first world war
etchings, Walton's Black Bull beneath its tree. The large and so deceptively
free water-colours of Arthur Melville alone are worth the visit.
Much the same ground is covered by the Scottish Gallery in its truly
miscellaneous survey of work by artists associated, as teachers or students,
with the Edinburgh College of Art, since its foundation in 1909. In recent
years especially the college has been a bastion of the painterly and graphic
disciplines too lightly abandoned in the name of creative liberality south
of the border some 30 years ago. With such mentors to hand as Gillies, Anne
Redpath, Robin Philipson, John Houston, David Michie and Elizabeth
Blackadder, it has remained a policy of creative conservatism beyond price.
* Back at the Academy, the RSA itself has given over its basement gallery to
the Imperial War Museum, to put up a small display of works commissioned
lately from contemporary artists. The point it makes is important but could
all too easily go by default. War remains a legitimate subject for the
artist, whether we are engaged in any formal war or not. Without engaging in
the artist's own particular polemic or moral debate, the museum is surely
right to monitor the currency of such response on our behalf.
Finally I have room only to recommend Phoebe Anna Traquair - Scottish
decorative artist within the arts &amp; crafts movement and Celtic revival at
the turn of the century - at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery until
November 7, (sponsored by Baillie Gifford &amp; Co., General Accident, and
Mobil).
Russian Painting of the Avant-garde 1906-1924: Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art, Belford Rd, until September 5, sponsored by Scottish Power and
the Foundation for Sport and the Arts.
The Line of Tradition: Royal Scottish Academy, The Mound, until September
12, sponsored by Dawson International, BSIS, Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise,
and the Esmee Fairburn and Hope Scott Trusts.
The Edinburgh School: The Scottish Gallery, 16 Dundas Street, until
September 8.
No More Heroes Anymore: Royal Scottish Academy, until September 12.

<TEXT>
John Lill is the soloist in Brahms' Piano Concerto No 2 in the first half of
today's BBC Proms (7.30 Radio 3). The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is
conducted by Kurt Masur. In the second half (8.40) they play Mendelssohn's
Overture &amp; Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Mulberry was one of those quirky comedies which can take a long time to
catch on. Karl Howman played a charming jack-of-all-trades who becomes a
servant to Miss Farnaby (the endlessly watchable Geraldine McEwan). It never
really had time to become a hit, so writers Esmonde and Larbey wrote a final
episode which was missed by many of the dedicated band who had been
watching. So today (8.30) BBC1 provides a repeat.
Storm From The East, telling the story of Genghis Khan and his descendants,
has had some good pictures of galloping armies and crusader castles, but has
never really gripped the imagination. The last episode (9.45 BBC2) tells the
story of 'the most illustrious of all the Mongol Khans' - Genghis's
grandson, Khubilai who inspired Coleridge.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Vale of Glamorgan festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Proms and Edinburgh may overshadow August, but there are some idyllic
outlying festivals. You could do worse than sample the charms of Presteigne,
a small town astride the picturesque mid-Wales border, where a modest,
friendly bank holiday chamber music event has taken off during the last few
years. But for the charged atmosphere of live contemporary music-making,
make for coastal St Donat's.
This summer's Vale of Glamorgan festival is a minimalist's paradise. David
Williams, the festival chairman, who, with another hat on, helped sway a
healthy Pounds 25,000 grant from the Welsh Arts Council, explains: 'We felt
we should do something constructive, not just for new music in broader
terms, but for living composers. It seemed more positive to concentrate
resources rather than dissipate them, and promote a worthwhile series
focusing on the diversity of contemporary works in particular,
post-modernist music since the '70s.'
The principal sponsors, Allied Steel and Wire (ASW), have proved an added
lifeline, injecting several thousands and, no less important, setting up
gatherings to help widen the sponsorship net.
At Cardiff's unspoiled Victorian Coal Exchange on Bute Square (the city's
former commercial heart), John Metcalf's decidedly adventurous programme was
launched last week with a mesmerising, sold-out evening by the American
composer Steve Reich, fresh from his South Bank triumph with The Cave.
Llandaff Cathedral offers an ampler venue tonight for a full-scale John
Adams concert, climaxing with his celebrated Whitman Civil War setting The
Wound Dresser - like his operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer,
something of a cult piece.
Getting to the outside-Cardiff events is easiest - be warned - by car. But
it's well worth the effort. These attractive smaller venues bring their own
rewards, be it the atmospheric oak-rafted fourteenth century Bradenstoke
Hall, part of St Donat's Castle within the Atlantic College campus, or the
medieval wall-painted St Illtud's Church in Llanylltud Faur (Llantwit
Major), an early Celtic Christian site with the added merits of an adjacent
pub-studded square and a good surfing beach a mere two miles' distance.
Minimalist the diet may have been - but by no means monochrome. The Smith
Quartet, one of Britain's answers to the Kronos, made appearances at both
venues, the hall marginally the better for sound and paradoxically more
intimate, thanks largely to the players being raised on a dais.
Like the 'modernism' it purports to replace, postmodern and minimalist fare
is a mixed bag. The Smiths' reading of the now legendary Different Trains
was somewhat differently balanced from Reich's own - not quite as haunted,
perhaps, but clear and forceful. The South African-born,
Princeton-associated Kevin Volans' Second Quartet, Hunting/Gathering, seemed
to be questing for a style as much as anything. Its repeating motifs and
unfinished paragraphs have all the intensity of a short-running sitcom.
Bones stick out balefully, rather as Steve Martland's Patrol is all sinew -
laborious invention, oddly conventional and quintessentially dull.
But nothing can take away from the dedication of these players. Volans'
Third Quartet, Songlines, like his Rimbaud (and Bruce Chatwin) inspired
Almeida chamber opera The Man who strides the wind (L'Homme aux Semelles de
Vent), was a revelation: riddled with imaginative ideas, well teased out, an
array of string sounds that 'delight the ear and hurt not', that constantly
challenge, dazzle and amaze. And Graham Fitkin's quartet Servant, like the
Michael Nyman encore the following night, gave clear evidence of how
minimalism can successfully subsume native and wider traditions.
You can still catch John Adams tonight at 7.30. Next summer's festival
includes Australian Peter Sculthorpe and - yes - Gorecki. So book early
(Tel. 0446 794848 792151).

FT  31 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Heathrow Express project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airport operator BAA is to use the New Engineering Contract (NEC) for the
main tunnel for the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express scheme. This is believed to
represent the biggest UK civil engineering project to adopt the new form of
contract.
The New Engineering Contract (NEC) is a standard form of contract suitable
for use in the design and construction (including erection) of new works
involving any, or all, of the building disciplines.
BAA is a leading proponent of the NEC having already used this form of
contract on a number of successfully completed projects at Heathrow and
Southampton airports.
The contract for a new terminal and car park at Southampton will be the
first UK building contract to use the NEC.
Explaining the benefits of the new form of contract, BAA's project director,
David H. Williams said 'We see the radical and less adversarial approach
which is required to administer this contract as improving the pre-planning
productivity and project performance generally.
The use of the NEC is one of a number of initiatives currently being
embraced by BAA as part of a continuous improvement process for its Pounds
300m a year capital investment programme.

FT  31 AUG 93 / People: Reeves' rehabilitation complete
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Reeves, who was chief executive of Morgan Grenfell at the time
of the Guinness affair, has seemingly been fully rehabilitated by the City
now that he has been promoted to chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe/Middle
East.
Nearly two years after resigning from Morgan Grenfell in 1987, he had joined
the US investment banking group as senior adviser to Jerry Kenney, then
president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets; Reeves later moved on to become
vice chairman of Merrill Lynch International.
When he first joined, Merrill denied that the Bank of England had blocked
his appointment as chief executive of the European operations on account of
his connections with the Guinness affair, but at the end of last week a
spokesman indicated that 'certain restrictions' on his activities previously
in place had now been lifted, and that approval for the current appointment
had been secured from both the Securities and Futures Authority and the Bank
of England.
No-one has held the title of chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe since Stani
Yassukovich left two and a half years ago, although Mike Giles, chairman of
Merrill Lynch International Bank had taken effective responsibility.
Reeves says that his new title means that he will be 'much more executive
rather than advisery' and will be allowed 'to do more things', notably
chairing the executive committee in charge of the region, a position that
Giles had also previously held.
He adds that Merrill is 'so much bigger and more active that it is more
necessary to have someone in this role'. It has expanded its capital raising
activities generally, has applied to become a market-maker in gilts and is
growing on the Continent, particularly in France and Germany.
Reeves says he himself has developed a special interest in India which,
despite his job title, is in fact 'on the extremity' of his region, and he
sits on the board of the India Fund and the India Growth Fund.'
Asked if he was now receiving the million pound salary that reports
suggested he had had to turn down in 1988, he commented: 'Sadly not'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SISTEM TRANSIT ALIRAN RINGAN (STAR), has raised Pounds 300m of funding for
work on Phase One of the project to develop a light rail transit system
(LRT) for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Over 18 months ago, the Anglo-German consortium of Taylor Woodrow
International and AEG Westinghouse Transport Systeme GmbH formed STAR to
raise private investment capital for the first phase of the LRT project.
Having secured capital, STAR would then own and operate the system under a
franchise agreement with the Malaysian government.
STAR now has in place the required funds to begin work on the project. Over
60 per cent is sourced from commercial bank loans, around 10 per cent from a
government support loan and the balance in the form of equity from Malaysian
and foreign investors.
This project represents the first phase of an integrated light rail network
for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas.
Taylor Woodrow International and AEG Westinghouse Transport Systeme GmbH,
together form the Kuala Lumpur Transit Group Sdn Bhd (KLTG), which has
entered into a Pounds 225m contract with STAR to undertake the design,
construction, delivery, installation and testing of the LRT system.

<TEXT>
The Plymouth Urban Development Corporation in Devon, set up by the
government five months ago to regenerate unwanted Ministry of Defence sites
including the Royal William naval yard, will begin to pick up steam tomorrow
with the arrival of a chief executive, John Collinson.
The corporation, the 12th UDC in England, came into being on April 1 with a
projected budget of Pounds 45m over its intended five-year lifespan.
Collinson, recruited after the advertised post attracted over 200
applications, has been working out his notice as property director of the
Black Country Development Corporation, where he has been for five years.
Collinson, who is 43, spent five years before that with Salford city
council, but in his new post he will be returning to his home county. He was
born in Exeter.
His first priority in Plymouth will be the UDC's business plan which is due
to go to the Department of Environment within a month of his arrival. The
next priority, he says, is 'hands on deck' in terms of staff. One necessary
appointment, that of finance and administration director, is expected to be
made shortly.
Already on deck is Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Gerken as chairman and board
members include the leaders of Plymouth city council and Devon county
council. The UDC covers 165 acres and it is envisaged that there will be
mixed development including offices, shops, restaurants and housing.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Don't fall foul of
computer data - Many companies using personal details of individuals are
breaking the law by failing to register their activities with the Data
Protection Registrar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be the last message that the thousands of small UK businesses
struggling to survive want to hear. But there is an excellent chance they
are committing a criminal offence each time they switch on their computer
terminals.
The reason is they are ignoring, or are not even aware of, their obligations
under the Data Protection Act 1984.
The legislation was the first in the UK to address the use or potential
misuse of computers. Nine years on, enormous confusion and uncertainty
surrounds its workings.
Under the act, which does not cover information held and processed manually,
organisations using data about people are required to register details of
their activities and to adhere to a code of good practice.
The same applies to computer agencies which might handle the data for them.
Any organisation which fails to register - it costs Pounds 75 for three
years - or does so and then breaks the code can face fines of up to Pounds
5,000 in a magistrates court. Unlimited fines apply in higher courts.
More than 100 companies and individuals have so far been prosecuted.
Under the legislation, private individuals have the right of access to
information held about them and can demand compensation for any damage or
distress arising from the storage of inaccurate data or from unauthorised
disclosure of the information.
The potential for financial penalties arising from non-compliance, is
therefore immense.
The enforcement of data protection is made more difficult because who is and
who is not covered by the legislation often remains unclear.
Even Eric Howe, the Data Protection Registrar, acknowledges he has found no
satisfactory or reliable way of establishing exactly the number of data
users who should be on his books.
Howe, who is an independent officer reporting directly to parliament, says
he recognises the complexities involved in interpreting the act and in
analysing the diversity of situations in which it can apply. He has only 100
staff and limited finances to enforce the legislation throughout the UK.
Small wonder then that the most unsuspecting candidates have fallen foul of
the law.
In one recent case, a local newsagent's shop found itself on the receiving
end of an official visit, following a formal complaint from a local customer
that a computer screen on full display was broadcasting the names and
addresses of some of its customers, many of whom were elderly and
vulnerable.
The business was told to register under the act; the computer was
immediately moved out of sight.
In another example, a ticket agency was fined Pounds 250 with costs after a
customer who had purchased cinema tickets then received unsolicited mail
from a third party.
The agency had sold on customers' personal information.
A recent report from the National Audit Office, the public spending
watchdog, said that as many as 100,000 data users who should be registered
under the act have not done so.
The NAO believes that the total may be considerably higher.
A further problem is that organisations are failing to re-register after the
initial three years.
The registrar has consequently concentrated resources on this area. In doing
so, however, and because of limited resources, other areas have failed to be
adequately monitored, resulting in the growing number of qualifying
companies which have yet to make a first registration.
Howe believes that one-third of all small companies are unaware of their
statutory obligation to register and more than two-thirds of all small
businesses are believed to have no idea about the obligations which are
imposed upon them as a result of the legislation.
There is clear need for government departments and other public bodies to
maintain the confiden-tiality of personal information on their files. The
same arguably goes for the police, local authorities, educational centres
and professional organisations. Less obvious perhaps is the requirement for
smaller businesses - from travel agents, employment bureaux and ticket
agencies - to register.
According to the registrar's office, the general guideline is that 'anyone
holding information about living individuals on computer is a data user and
therefore needs to register.
'The information in question need not be particularly sensitive and it can
be as little as a name and address'.
Howe says: 'The act as it stands makes no particular allowance for small
businesses. It requires every organisation to register and comply in exactly
the same way, regardless of size or type of business.'
In an attempt to improve on the general lack of awareness of registration
requirements among small companies, a new information pack and free video
designed to explain the act has just been produced.
There are exemptions for some types of data handlers but they are very
narrow and subject to strict conditions.
Registration may not be necessary if, for example, the information is used
only for calculating wages and pensions or for keeping accounts. Sports or
recreational clubs which do not have limited company status are also exempt.
The best advice for small organisations unsure as to whether they qualify or
not is to register anyway.
Once businesses are on the registrar's books, the code of good practice
demands that they adhere to a list of guiding principles.
The guidance includes obtaining and processing information 'fairly and
lawfully', keeping it safe and up-to-date and not holding it any longer than
is necessary.
An information pack tailored for the small business is available from the
registrar's office at Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF.
Individual advice can also be obtained from Richard Ansell, the small
business officer at the same address.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Cautious times for
entrepreneurs - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Owner-managed businesses appear to be optimistic about their future, but
would-be entrepreneurs appear to be more cautious.
That is the impression given in this month's Touche Ross survey of
owner-managed businesses and National Westminster Bank's latest quarterly
start-up index.
According to Touche Ross, 74 per cent of respondents are anticipating a
positive growth in turnover over the next 12 months.
This confidence is backed up by improved sales and order levels in the last
quarter at more than half the 197 businesses polled.
Most promisingly 48 per cent are anticipating increasing staff over the next
year, compared with 9 per cent expecting to reduce them and the remainder
expecting no change.
NatWest's figures, meanwhile, show that the number of small business
start-ups in the second quarter of 1993 - around 90,000 - showed a slight
dip on the 95,000 estimated for the first quarter.
However, the six-month total of 185,000 was the same as that for the second
half of 1992.
'New, small-business owners are thinking very carefully about the
commitments they are prepared to take on, especially when other people's
livelihoods are at risk as well as their own', according to Jane Bradford,
who is head of small business services at NatWest.
'On average they spend nearly eight months planning their business venture
before they actually start up'.

to crime - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The risks for small shopkeepers from violent crime in some parts of Britain
have been highlighted by researchers at the University of Sheffield.
A total of 92 shopkeepers in one part of London and 70 shopkeepers in part
of a large Midlands city were interviewed, among them newsagents,
off-licences, grocery stores and small supermarkets.
In the London area a quarter of respondents had been the victim of a robbery
or attempted robbery (with a knife or gun/imitation gun) in the past 12
months.
In the Midlands area, the figure was 17 per cent.
Some 24 per cent of London shopkeepers and 34 per cent of Midlands
shopkeepers had suffered acts of deliberate vandalism to the shop or its
property.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Focusing on UK ethnic
communities - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bulk of small business research work in the UK has been focused on
Asians and West Indians.
However, besides Bangladeshis and Afro-Caribbeans, a new study on ethnic
enterprise and the high street bank includes interviews with Greek-Cypriots.
The authors of the report* - James Curran and Robert Blackburn of Kingston
University - point out that Greek-Cypriots are the longest established of
the UK minorities and have the most diverse pattern of ownership.
Their businesses are the largest, and the most likely to have broken out of
the ethnic market.
The report is generally sceptical about the importance of ethnic communities
as alternative sources of finance.
It says that the Greek-Cypriots are the most frequent users of bank advice,
have expanded their businesses more than the other two minorities, and are
likely to perform similarly to white-owned firms.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECASTS vary sharply over the interim results of HSBC Holdings, the parent
of Midland Bank, to be announced today. Pre-tax profit estimates range from
about Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 1.3bn, both substantially higher than last
time's Pounds 521m.
Midland has already revealed profits up at Pounds 385m (Pounds 60m) and Hang
Seng Bank has weighed in with HKDollars 2.75bn (HKDollars 2.34bn). Some
Pounds 200m from a favourable HK dollar exchange rate will also be included.
The only possible black cloud could be China's cooling economy.
Sun Alliance, the composite insurance company, is expected to post a return
to interim pre-tax profits on Thursday of Pounds 30m-Pounds 80m compared
with a loss of Pounds 114.1m a year earlier. Rises in premium rates, falling
expenses and lower claims frequency are behind the turnround. Sun Alliance's
balance sheet should also show a considerable improvement following the
strong rise in the UK equity market to which the group is heavily exposed.
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, is expected to announce a
strong increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.4m to between
Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m on Thursday. Much of the rise is likely to be
accounted for by the contribution from Specialty Coatings International, the
US coatings company bought for Dollars 434m earlier this year, although
estimates differ of how large this contribution will be.
Analysts are hoping for evidence from the company that SCI has been
integrated into the group and is performing well. The interim dividend is
forecast at 5p, from a restated 4.7p last year.
Analysts expect Ladbroke Group to report a fall in pre-tax profits for the
first half on Thursday. Last time's profits will be restated under FRS 3 to
about Pounds 81.5m to account for estimated hotel disposals and this time
forecasts range from about Pounds 68m, if there is a higher interest charge,
to around Pounds 74m. The one bright spot should be UK racing. The dividend
should be held at 4.92p.
Rolls-Royce, also reporting on Thursday, is set to reveal operating profits
sharply lower at about Pounds 30m (Pounds 44m), affected by the conditions
in the aerospace and industrial power markets. Including exceptionals should
result in flattish pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20m.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the mustard-to-lavatory cleaner group, is expected to show
an increase in interim pre-tax profits to around Pounds 150m (Pounds 134.2m)
when it reports on Thursday. The shares have been poor performers with
worries about prices squeezed by retailers, the slowdown in the European
economies, and longer term concerns about the value of brands.
Burmah Castrol is reporting interim results the same day and is expected to
announce net profits of between Pounds 44m and Pounds 46m. The group's
German operations, which since April have had a contribution from Tribol,
the industrial lubricants bought from ICI for Pounds 31.7m, are going to be
watched carefully.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Economics: Markets seek evidence of US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH of statistical and survey data this week should enable economists and
investors to reappraise the state of the US recovery and establish whether
the Wall Street's recent strength is anchored in fundamentals.
Markets will be on tenterhooks for Friday's key employment data for August
although economists warn that the important non-farm payrolls figure may be
inflated by temporary summer hiring. Tomorrow's National Association of
Purchasing Managers' survey is expected to point to only moderate output
growth as manufacturers approach the autumn, while a slight softening is
forecast in today's consumer confidence index.
In Europe, attention will focus on France's unemployment report and whether
the expected poor outturn will prompt the government of Mr Edouard Balladur
to exploit the increased room for manoeuvre in the European Monetary System
and ease French monetary conditions.
A quiet week is expected in the UK with one bullish indicator: the M0 narrow
money figures on Friday are expected to keep growing faster than the
government's 0 to 4 per cent monitoring range.
The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, the
financial information company.

</HEADLINE>

   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTINGUISHED economists leapt to the defence of much-maligned currency
speculators at the meeting.
Sir Samuel Brittan, principal economic commentator of the Financial Times
and this year's president of the association's economics section, said:
'George Soros did a certain amount of good and people shouldn't condemn him
as an evil speculator.' Mr Soros is the US-based financier who was said to
have made Dollars 1bn at the time of sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism last year.
Sir Samuel quoted Milton Friedman's 'beautifully simple theory that either
speculators exercised a stabilising influence, or they lost money and
damaged themselves'.
Professor Amartya Sen of Harvard University agreed with Sir Samuel about the
benign effect of speculators. But his main theme was that 'codes of
behaviour' have been central to the achievements of capitalism.
'Capitalism has made it possible to raise productivity by teamwork, by
co-ordination and co-operation, and ultimately by trust in each other's
behaviour in economic and business relationships,' Prof Sen said.
Mr John Flemming, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, said that in the former Soviet Union: 'Mafia capitalism is
better than no capitalism at all.'
Mr Flemming said that, in their journey from a very heavily regulated state
to the moderate regulation typical of western Europe, 'the formerly
centrally planned economies should probably plan to move temporarily further
in the direction of deregulation than may be the long-run goal.
'The reason for this is that the human and moral capital required for the
institutions to run even a moderate regulatory regime is not readily
available.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Life and cynical times of the thirtysomethings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGLE parenthood is not a matter of choice but a result of marital
breakdown, according to a survey of 11,000 'thirty-somethings'.
The survey, part of the National Child Development Study that has tracked
the 11,000 since they were born in March 1958, was released at the meeting.
It shows that most single parents are impoverished.
Dr Angela Dale, deputy director of the Social Statistics Research Unit at
City University in London, said: 'When women have children they leave the
labour market, and as a result they have a permanent loss of earning power.
'If their marriage breaks down they become dependent on the state because
prior to becoming a lone parent they lost the ability to earn a living
wage.'
The survey makes depressing reading for women, showing that their gross
hourly earnings are 85 per cent of their male counterparts, despite the
Equal Pay Act of 1975.
Women who work part time are even worse off, with hourly earnings 51 per
cent of those for men in full-time jobs.
Women suffer more from depression than men, with one in eight having been
clinically depressed at some time compared with one in 14 men.
Overall the survey shows the 'thirtysomethings' in as much of a flux as the
characters in the soap opera of the same name. Nearly 20 per cent of the
sample have been divorced, with 12 per cent of divorced men and 11 per cent
of divorced women having lived with three or more partners.
More than 80 per cent of the sample owned their own homes, and despite much
publicised difficulties over mortgage arrears, only 8 per cent had ever been
more than two months behind with payments.
Other attitudes include:
90 per cent thought politicians are in politics for their own good.
29 per cent thought it did not matter which party was in power.
62 per cent thought there was one rule for the rich and another for the
poor.
50 per cent believed the government should redistribute income from the
better-off to the less well-off.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Longer life 'need not increase human suffering'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDICAL science will be able to extend the average human lifespan by several
years and may be able to lengthen the maximum lifetime of the species -
which is now about 115 years - the meeting was told.
Professor Grimley Evans, head of the geriatric medicine division at Oxford
University, attacked politicians 'who assume that any means of extending
lifespan must be expensive' because very old people need more health care.
He said that there were 'no grounds for assuming that prolonging healthy
life will ultimately increase human suffering and its costs.' For example,
if someone has a stroke in their 80s, then the period of suffering
afterwards is much less than that following a stroke suffered in the 60s.
Extending average lifespan is a matter of improving medical care, continuing
economic development and persuading people to following sensible lifestyles
 -above all, by not smoking.
'We know how to lengthen average lifespan but can we lengthen maximum
lifespan?' Prof Evans asked. He suggested three possible approaches:
The eugenic approach would be to breed selectively from deep-frozen sperm of
men who ultimately achieve great age.
It may be possible to identify specific human genes that are associated with
longevity, and modify them in some way. Such genes have been found in
nematode worms but not yet in higher animals.
A third approach would be to reduce the damage that is done to cells by
bio-chemical processes in the body, such as free radical oxidation.
'The crucial issue,' Prof Evans said, 'will be what manipulations to
increase longevity do to the pattern of disease and disability preceding
death. An intervention that postponed death without postponing Alzheimer's
disease might not be a good investment for individuals or for society.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Clean-up crops tested for work on toxic soils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANTS which take up toxic metals as nutrients could be used to clean
contaminated soils. The crop would then be harvested and metal extracted for
recycling.
Professor Steven McGrath of the Agricultural and Food Research Council's
Institute of Arable Crops Research described the experimental process -
called green remediation - to the British Association meeting.
His research team has tested a number of plants for zinc uptake on soils
polluted by heavy metals from London sewage over 20 years.
The most efficient plant, alpine pennycress, reduced zinc to acceptable
levels after nine croppings. Prof McGrath said this could be achieved in
three years, using intensive cultivation.
Existing methods of physical and chemical treatment to remove soil pollution
are expensive and also alter the soil structure, leaving it unsuitable for
cultivation.
Using green remediation techniques, a hectare of contaminated soil could be
cleaned up for Pounds 5,000, leaving it fertile, whereas conventional
treatment by vitrification costs Pounds 18,000 per hectare.
At present the potential of the technique is limited by the productivity of
the plants. Prof McGrath suggests that plants could be genetically
engineered to speed up the rate of remediation and to improve the plants'
take-up of toxic metals to levels where the metals could be harvested
economically.
Du Pont, the international chemical company, is interested in using the
technique to clean up lead contamination around factories where the petrol
additive tetra ethyl lead was produced, and a smelting company plans a test
to produce pure metals from harvested material.
Plants which have the ability to handle toxic metals are scarce and need to
be protected, Prof McGrath said.
One of the champion natural accumulators is Sebertia acuminata, a tree that
lives on nickel-rich soils. 'An obvious application would be to 'tap' such
trees for nickel, in an analogous way to that for rubber.' Prof McGrath said
green remediation could be combined with bioremediation, the technique in
which bacteria are used to break down organic pollutants such as pesticides
to produce a one-stage clean-up.
He said he would also like to study plants in areas where there is a high
level of radioactivity, to see if they accumulated radioactive materials.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Medical advances 'threatened': Annual meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science opens with warning on health
policy and defence of old age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-SCIENCE feelings among the public, politicians and health policymakers
are threatening the progress of medical sciences into 'the most exciting and
productive phase in their long history', Sir David Weatherall, Regius
Professor of Medicine at Oxford, warned last night.
In his presidential address to the meeting at Keele University,
Staffordshire, Sir David said: 'It would be a tragedy if this mood of
disillusionment with the basic medical sciences, and science in general,
were to impede progress as we move into the next millenium.'
Policymakers were taking an increasingly short-term view of improving
patient care. They were also turning their backs on research. A sign of this
was the recent white paper on the National Health Service, Working for
Patients, 'in which research is barely mentioned'. He added: 'In the
resulting marketplace economy of some of our teaching hospital trusts, it is
already clear that, presumably because it poses a risk to competitiveness,
research is going to be very low on the agenda.'
The government's new research strategy was founded on 'a feeling that
high-technology medicine is having a dehumanising effect and that we should
be directing much more effort into preventive medicine and the needs of
individual patients,' he said.
'Because these changes are occurring at a time when society is disillusioned
with science, and when support for medical research is so limited, there is
a genuine danger that the pendulum may swing too far and that, in our new
customer-driven approach to medical research, the vital role of the basic
medical sciences may be neglected.'
Sir David, who is a leading geneticist, sketched out his field of research's
potential. 'It will help us to understand the acquired defects in our genes
which lead to . . . the generation of cancer. It offers us a completely new
way of developing diagnostic and therapeutic agents.'
But Sir David warned against unrealistic expectations. 'Claims by molecular
biologists that within the next five or 10 years we will be able to identify
the major genes involved and somehow alter our susceptibility to our common
killers (such as heart disease) are naive and misleading, based as they are
on a complete misunderstanding of the enormous complexity of these
diseases.'
The public disillusionment with medical science was due partly to
over-optimistic claims about the speed with which research breakthroughs
would benefit patients.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Ballots cut down on strikes, say unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of secret strike ballots has been an important cause of the
decline in industrial conflict over the past 10 years.
This is the main conclusion of a survey of opinions of negotiators from 25
large and medium-sized trade unions representing more than 5m workers
carried out by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of
Economics.
Since 1984 the law has required trade unions to hold pre-strike ballots.
This obligation 'stands out as the most important of the changes made by
government's labour legislation', say Mr Bob Simpson and Ms Jane Elgar, the
survey's authors.
Sixty three per cent of the respondents said they thought the law 'had been
the most important factor affecting industrial action'.
Eighty-four per cent thought their members were 'now more reluctant to take
industrial action'. Only 18 per cent agreed that there is now more
unofficial industrial action, with a majority believing members were less
likely to take unofficial industrial action.
The survey found employers remain unwilling to take legal action against
unions. 'Legal proceedings - or even a solicitor's letter - are still
clearly the exception,' it says. Even so, one in four of the respondents
said employers had threatened to use the law over industrial action,
although only 25 per cent of them had begun legal proceedings.
On the other hand, 93 per cent of the sample said that employers 'had become
more hardline in their dealings with unions'. Threats of dismissal against
members by employers has become widespread. Where striking was seriously
considered, 35 per cent of respondents said dismissal threats had occurred.
The survey says the 'weak legal position' of individual workers going on
strike and 'fear for job security in an adverse economic climate' have
helped to reduce conflict.
There was widespread support among union negotiators for pre-strike ballots
with 68 per cent of them saying they were 'a good thing for trade unions'.
The survey found that where ballots had been held there was 'strong
evidence' that they had 'assisted negotiators in bargaining'. Although 75
per cent of ballots were won by the unions, this did not necessarily lead to
industrial action but most brought a negotiated settlement.

FT  31 AUG 93 / IoD wants scope of labour law extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANNING of all public-sector strikes that breach procedure agreements
and the introduction of legally binding, compulsory arbitration for
Britain's essential services are being demanded by the Institute of
Directors.
With the implementation yesterday of many of the provisions in the new Trade
Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, the IoD will use a meeting with
ministers this week to step up its campaign for further changes in
employment laws.
Its demands are:
The removal of all remaining legal immunities from liability in tort enjoyed
by trade unions. This would deprive unions of protection from civil actions
and resulting financial damages for involvement in industrial disputes.
The abolition of the current licensing system for employment agencies which
is seen as an unnecessary burden on business which inhibits the use of
contract labour.
The removal of the legal monopoly enjoyed by the Advisory Conciliation and
Arbitration Service's conciliation activities in disputes brought to it by
industrial tribunals.
The IoD also wants to see whether Acas services could be market tested or
made subject to competition by private-sector providers. In addition, it
favours changes to employment protection law to enable further deregulation.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has so far shown no sign that he is
ready to introduce further legislation in the labour market.
But yesterday he did not rule out legislation when he spoke of 'the
government's continuing commitment to legislate so as to create and maintain
a fair balance between protecting the rights of employees, while avoiding
excessive costs and administrative burdens on business'.
The institute is to press the government on its attitude to the European
Community's social action programme.
It wants to know how ministers intend to protect British business interests
if an EC draft directive on the introduction of European works councils for
companies that operate across the Continent is considered under the social
chapter protocol of the Maastricht treaty.
The institute is concerned that British multinationals will be affected
proportionately more by the directive than companies based in other member
states.

FT  31 AUG 93 / 'Warnings came thick and fast': Homes Assured retrial
considered after two former directors convicted of fraudulent trading but
jury fails to reach a verdict on one other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMES ASSURED was the most cruelly ironic of names. The company was launched
to capitalise on the sale of council houses to their tenants, and seemed
poised to take advantage of one of the most powerful legacies of the
Thatcher years.
Within two years of its creation it had run up debts of Pounds 10.7m before
going into liquidation in August 1989. The collapse left more than 1,500
creditors out of pocket and ultimately led to the convictions at the weekend
of two of the company's directors.
Homes Assured was established in 1987 by Mr Anthony Dobson, a man described
by the judge as 'a Walter Mitty' and 'the ideas man rather than the
administrator'.
The idea was to tap the class of new homeowners emerging from Britain's 6m
council tenants who had been given the chance to buy their properties under
the 1980 Housing Act.
Homes Assured intended making money in several ways: from selling
commissions on endowment policies for mortgages, from top-up loans, from
mortgage protection policies and from home improvement loans.
The potential seemed enormous. The company used an aggressive commissions
policy to encourage sales staff to win business. It also recruited to the
board Sir Edward du Cann, the former Conservative party chairman, who
resigned as a non-executive director of Homes Assured before liquidators
were appointed.
But economic conditions began to change. Mortgage rates rose and the housing
market started to cool. Delays were caused by councils, which were
unexpectedly swamped by applications or opposed the right-to-buy
legislation.
More significantly, the company ran into internal difficulties. It was
created with enormous overheads, quickly spending large sums on computers,
offices, cars, entertainment and other expenses.
It expanded rapidly, operating four principal subsidiaries and 11 branches
and employing up to 400 staff. The quality of the accounting systems varied
widely.
But Homes Assured's greatest failing was to underestimate cancellations on
the endowments it sold. It had budgeted for only 20 per cent to 25 per cent,
but 15,000 of the 20,000 policies were cancelled.
Early in 1988 Mr Dobson received loans of Pounds 250,000 each from Bank of
Boston and Anderson and Company. He failed to mention in his applications
that he had reached a voluntary arrangement with his creditors to stave off
bankruptcy - a factor which Bank of Boston said would have stopped it
providing the money.
As the year progressed, there were growing signs that the company was in
financial difficulties. Mr Douglas Dunkley, an accountant appointed to the
company in April 1988, expressed grave concerns over the quality of the
accounting information. He was still struggling to prepare the 1987 accounts
in the summer of 1988.
Homes Assured was bombarded by creditors demanding the return of their
money. Hundreds of reimbursement cheques bounced.
In November 1988 Stoy Hayward, the auditors, wrote to advise the directors
of the risks of trading while insolvent. 'It seems the warnings were coming
thick and fast from every possible direction,' Judge John Rogers QC told the
jury in his summing up at the trial last week.
Mr Keith Woodward, an accountant who became a director, prepared a statement
of the company's affairs which was presented to the courts to stave off an
attempt to put it into liquidation in November.
There was just one board meeting between November 1988 and April 1989. Yet
the company continued to trade in spite of all the difficulties. It was not
placed into liquidation until the end of August 1989.
Two months later the police began an investigation into the collapse. That
led to initial charges in May 1991 against Mr Dobson, Mr Woodward and Mr
Michael Robinson. The jury was unable to reach a decision on Mr Robinson.
None of the defendants gave evidence at the trial. Their counsels argued
that they had acted not dishonestly, but ignorantly or in the belief that
Homes Assured would be able to continue trading successfully.
They blamed the collapse of Homes Assured on others - including the
assurance company Legal &amp; General, which had a tied-agents agreement with
the company - for inefficiency and 'poaching' of policies.
The trial lasted four months, took evidence from more than 100 witnesses and
required a huge number of documents.
With the trial complete, the Department of Trade and Industry can proceed
with the disqualification orders it is pursuing against seven of the former
directors of Homes Assured - including Sir Edward du Cann. The Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has been monitoring the case
closely and is likely to exclude Mr Woodward from membership. But the
creditors of Homes Assured remain out of pocket.

FT  31 AUG 93 / SFO may renew home fraud probe: Homes Assured retrial
considered after two former directors convicted of fraudulent trading but
jury fails to reach a verdict on one other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office is to consider a fresh prosecution of Mr Michael
Robinson, the former managing director of collapsed mortgage broker Homes
Assured, after the conviction of two of his fellow directors for fraudulent
trading.
The SFO, which handled both the investigation and the prosecution of Homes
Assured's directors following its collapse in 1989 owing Pounds 10.7m to
creditors, said it would decide on the matter within the next month.
The Department of Trade and Industry may also restart civil actions against
seven former Homes Assured directors, including Sir Edward du Cann, the
former Conservative party chairman, to bar them from holding directorships.
The Homes Assured trial concluded on Saturday with the conviction of Mr
Anthony Dobson, 60, founder of the company that helped council tenants to
buy their properties, and Mr Keith Woodward, 56, its former finance
director.
The two men were convicted of trading while the company was insolvent. Mr
Dobson was also found guilty of two charges of procuring the execution of a
security by deception, and Mr Woodward was convicted of furnishing false
information.
The convictions came at the end of a four-month trial, but the jury was
unable to reach a verdict on Mr Robinson on the charge of fraudulent
trading. The company traded between November 1988 and August 1989 while
insolvent.
Mr Dobson and Mr Woodward are due to be sentenced by Southwark Crown Court
on October 1.
The jury was told during the trial that Homes Assured had been burdened by
inadequate funds. Mr Michael Kalisher QC, the prosecuting counsel, said it
had stumbled along 'borrowing from Peter to pay Paul' to stave off
inevitable failure.
Witnesses described Mr Dobson, who had been involved in four liquidations,
as prone to exaggeration. He had avoided personal bankruptcy through a
voluntary agreement before launching Homes Assured.
While the company was insolvent a total of Pounds 116,000 was paid to
companies owned by Mr Dobson or members of his family.
None of the directors charged gave evidence, but their barristers argued
they had honestly believed that sufficient funds would be available to
justify staying in business.
Mr Dobson's QC said that the group's late chairman Mr Eric Orbell, Sir
Edward, and Mr Douglas Perryman, another director, had all decided to
continue trading.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Ministers soften BR line to head off rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT MINISTERS are examining whether British Rail's role in the process
of bidding for franchises could be 'formalised' to avoid a confrontation
with rebel Tories at Westminster.
Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, yesterday emphasised the
government's determination not to delay or abandon its rail privatisation
plans.
He insisted that ministers would not let a House of Lords amendment allowing
BR to bid for franchises stand in their way. He dismissed speculation that
the government might defer the proposals in order to avoid defeat.
In July the Lords insisted - against the government's advice - that BR
should be allowed to bid. Ministers described it then as a 'wrecking'
amendment which attacked the heart of the plans.
Mr Norris made it clear, however, that if there was a way the government
could maintain the basis of its proposals while avoiding the need to fight
the cross-party alliance among opposition and Tory peers and MPs, then
ministers would welcome it.
The more conciliatory tone now is based on the government's argument that BR
is already involved in the bidding process: unless potential franchisees
from the private sector can show they would run services on lower subsidies
than BR, then BR will continue to operate them.
'BR is bidding - it is there constantly as the benchmark against which we
should gauge other people's performance,' Mr Norris said yesterday.
His comments suggest that the government will urge outright rejection of the
Lords amendment only if it is told that devising a way of assessing BR's
costs for the bidding process is too complex.
He added: 'Ministers don't want any more difficulties with the process than
they already have. If we can live with it, we will.'
Mr Norris's comments come after renewed warnings of dissent from Tory MPs
who rebelled against the privatisation plans when the bill was being
discussed earlier this year.
Last week a leaked paper from within BR suggesting that there could be fare
increases of up to 16 per cent intensified the calls from some Conservative
MPs in the south-east for further concessions from the government to
safeguard fare levels after privatisation.
The limited time available to conclude debate before the end of the session
will add to the pressure on ministers to find a way to avoid a full-scale
clash with the Lords. The legislation must go through parliament in the
month or so from mid-October when peers resume their discussion of the bill.

FT  31 AUG 93 / More long-term pay deals as inflation stabilises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STABLE inflation is encouraging negotiators to reconsider long-term pay
deals, according to a study from Incomes Data Services, the research
organisation, Lisa Wood writes.
Agreements for two years and more are now a significant feature of pay
bargaining for manual workers in a number of manufacturing sectors. These
include motor vehicles and components, shipbuilding, general engineering and
chemicals.
The study found that while most of the new long-term deals applied for two
years, a number of three-year agreements had been reached at companies such
as Avon Rubber, BAT, Borden (UK), Rhone-Poulenc and Royal Ordnance. The
study also recorded one four-year deal.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Public to be involved in war against crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE AUTHORITIES are to be given a new and specific duty to involve the
public in the fight against crime, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
said yesterday.
His comment came after a Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph found
three-quarters of those questioned believed vigilante action was sometimes
justified. The poll also found widespread dissatisfaction with the way crime
is handled by the police and the criminal justice system.
The Tories see tough action to tackle crime as a key part of efforts to
restore their political fortunes but the survey showed that there was little
belief their plans would have much effect. Only 15 per cent believed that
promises to get tough on law and order in the coming months would have any
impact on crime.
Mr Howard will also announce later this week the next phase of putting the
running of prisons out to private-sector tenders.
The move comes in spite of the critical report last week by Judge Stephen
Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, on the Wolds remand jail  - Britain's
first privately run prison.
Ministers intend to make measures on law and order the centrepiece of the
next parliamentary session. Apart from the bill to implement the
government's conclusions on the Sheehy report on the police and the changes
to police authorities, there will be a criminal justice bill, which will
include tougher action against those who re-offend while on bail.
The restructured police authorities will have to prepare plans giving local
people a role in helping the police, for example through taking part in
neighbourhood watch schemes or by becoming special constables.
Mr Howard did not condone taking the law into one's own hands. He said on
BBC radio: 'We do not want vigilantes but we do want vigilance.'
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the poll showed 'the huge
sense of frustration and despair that underlies a lot of people's feelings
towards the criminal justice system and towards rising crime'.

FT  31 AUG 93 / City security tighter after bomb find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE are likely to be more vigilant in checking people entering the City
of London today following an attempted bombing in Bishopsgate on Saturday.
Terrorists breached the security ring and planted what police called a
'small device' behind a hoarding in Wormwood Street.
Police were alerted to the attempted bombing by a call from a man with an
Irish accent who used a recognised code word. The bomb squad carried out a
controlled explosion. There were no injuries.
The latest attempt follows the setting up last month of checkpoints around
the City, and the blocking of many entrances to it, in response to previous
terrorist explosions.
The alert will intensify a debate over the effectiveness of the measures
which are considered too disruptive by some critics and as a propaganda coup
for the IRA by others.
Saturday's explosion came just 48 hours after a warning from Mr Owen Kelly,
City of London police commissioner, that the area was still at risk from
hand-carried bombs.
'Clearly it would be rash to claim that we have 100 per cent security, but I
do know that we have reduced drastically the risk of another large
vehicle-borne bomb getting into the financial heart of the City,' Mr Kelly
said.
He added: 'Hand-carried bombs may in the future be planted in the zone and
the less well-informed will claim that our arrangements have failed.
'Of course we have never claimed that we could ever detect or prevent any
one of the hundreds of thousands of people who come into the City daily,
most of whom carry bags or cases of some sort, from bringing in a bomb.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Campaign to fight counterfeit Pounds 1bn sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday set up shop in London's Spitalfields market to
launch a campaign against counterfeit goods, John Griffiths writes.
It says they cost 100,000 UK jobs and Pounds 1bn in lost sales to British
companies each year.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said some of the goods
were dangerous and could even kill.
Markets are a main channel for selling such goods. The party displayed
recently seized counterfeit goods, including designer-label clothes,
computer games, music cassettes, videos and replacement car parts.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, said legislation left
a loophole which acted as a 'counterfeiter's charter'.

FT  31 AUG 93 / School finance change urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIMITS ON investments in state schools should be abolished to allow more
investment from the private sector, Mr Michael Fallon, the former schools
minister, argues in a pamphlet published today.
His move extends the debate on the private finance initiative announced by
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in the last autumn statement to the
education sector.
Mr Fallon describes the current system of capital investment in schools as
'bureaucratic and fossilised'. He adds: 'Worse still, it cuts across the
government's central objective of extending parental choice.'
He proposes that schools themselves, rather than local authorities, should
be given access to private-sector capital investment. This liberalisation
could lead to joint ventures and leasing arrangements with private
developers and other educational institutions.
The private sector could also build and run language laboratories, sports
halls and drama workshops which could then be contracted for use by a range
of state schools and local companies, Mr Fallon suggests. Schools, he adds,
could work with universities, colleges and the private sector to create
'education parks' for multiple educational use.
Mr Fallon also attacks planning arrangements which stop schools being built
if other nearby schools have unused capacity. He describes this as the
'thrombosis at the heart of the system' and suggests that full reform would
'encourage new schools quite irrespective of over supply provided that they
can demonstrate sufficient commitment on the part of local parents to
transfer from existing schools'.
The pamphlet suggests that when a new school is needed in an area it should
be put out to tender with either existing schools or private promoters free
to bid for a contract.

THE ROYAL College of Nursing will announce shortly that its total membership
has reached a record level.
However, its claim that membership is increasing at the expense of Unison,
the new public service union formed by the amalgamation of Cohse, Nupe and
Nalgo, has been disputed by Unison.
There are about 641,749 qualified individuals registered with the Central
Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting, of which 384,000 are
working in the National Health Service. The total nursing workforce in the
NHS is about 543,000, a figure which includes 159,000 nursing auxiliaries
and nursing assistants.
The college admits only qualified nurses while Unison includes nursing
auxiliaries and assistants in its 235,000 nursing membership. In the year to
last December the college's membership grew from 292,180 to 297,719 and next
month it is expected to be a record at more than 300,000.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Company property valuations criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN 10 companies are providing users of company accounts with property
valuations that bear little comparison with market values, a survey by
Company Reporting, an Edinburgh-based journal, says.
The report adds that only a third of company accounts show signs of recent
property revaluations. A total of 62 per cent of companies are continuing to
revalue at least some of their properties and half of these have done so
within the last three years.
The report criticises the accounting standards for tangible assets. It says
a strong lobby would prefer to see a return to a historical cost approach
because once a business occupied a property it was no longer subject to
property market forces.
The survey covered 565 company accounts published in the last year.

FT  31 AUG 93 / News at Ten move 'still on agenda'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV LAST night signalled its renewed determination to move News at Ten to an
earlier slot.
Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV network director, indicated at the Edinburgh
television festival that he would be taking on politicians, including Mr
John Major, the prime minister, who said in June that they wanted the
programme kept in its present 10pm slot.
Mr Plantin said: 'News at Ten is still very much on the agenda and we must
be able to make ITV scheduling more dynamic by being able to switch
programmes around.'
Politicians opposed an earlier slot because the programme, made by ITN,
would not have the opportunity to react to late-breaking news from around
the world. Mr Plantin said of Mr Major's intervention: 'For a moment I
thought he wanted my job.'
After the intervention it had been thought the programme would not be moved
but its future is to be discussed by the ITV board next month.
The ITV companies say they can sell more advertising and attract more
viewers by screening big films unbroken, rather than splitting them round a
news slot at 10pm.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Redundancy fear survives upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST HALF the people in work remain concerned about the prospect of being
made redundant or becoming unemployed during the next 12 months in spite of
signs of an economic revival.
This is the key finding in the latest monthly survey on redundancy
commissioned for the Financial Times and Industrial Relations Services and
conducted by MORI, the polling organisation.
The findings suggest there remains widespread and continuing scepticism
among the workforce about the strength of the economic upturn.
This month 47 per cent of the sample said they were very or fairly concerned
at losing their job.
This figure has dropped from 51 per cent in July but is the second highest
level of concern shown among people at work in the survey since it began in
April.
By contrast 49 per cent said they were not at all or not very concerned
about losing their job and joining the unemployed, compared with 45 per cent
in July.
Over the past five months some distinctive trends can be seen. The
proportion of workers under 24 who are concerned about redundancy and
unemployment has risen from 40 per cent in April to 50 per cent last month.
A sharp rise is also apparent among people at work from social
classifications A and B. This has climbed from 28 per cent five months ago
to 37 per cent in August. The proportion of unskilled and semi-skilled
manual workers concerned about redundancy and unemployment has also gone up
from 44 to 53 per cent over the same period.
Scotland and northern England have suffered a sizeable growth in concern
from 38 per cent to 48 per cent between April and August as has the Midlands
 -up from 40 per cent to 48 per cent. Concern in southern England has
remained stable.
MORI interviewed 1,007 adults aged 18 and over.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Small-business optimism higher than on Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALLER companies in Britain are more confident of economic recovery than
their counterparts in the rest of Europe, a survey has found.
The survey by 3i, the investment capital group, and Cranfield School of
Management found that while fewer Spanish and German companies expect a
decline in profitability over the next six months, French and Italian
businesses have become more pessimistic since the last survey six months
ago.
The different views are reflected in investment plans over the next six
months. UK companies plan to spend more on training, marketing, and research
and development.
In France, by contrast, budgets are falling in these areas and a majority of
companies expect to cut their training programmes.
Professor Paul Burn of the Cranfield School of Management said: 'UK
companies are anticipating recovery and are doing things that will
contribute to it.'
But he warned against complacency, pointing to differences in expectations
on prices.
French companies expect falling prices and low wage increases while UK
companies envisage price rises and Germany has the highest proportion of
companies expecting wage rises.
A report today from the National Westminster Bank says that growth in the
north of the UK will match that in the south over the next few years, thanks
to the manufacturing sector.
Mr David Kern, NatWest's chief economist, says in a preview of the September
issue of the bank's Economic and Financial Outlook: 'Over the period 1994 to
1998, I expect growth to average 2.1 per cent (per year) in the northern and
southern UK regions against 2.5 per cent in central Britain.'
He expects manufacturing output to grow at an above-average 3.5 per cent and
that northern and central Britain will have an above-average share of
manufacturing. The share of GDP taken by manufacturing will rise from 19.9
per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent in 1998.
Mr Kern says: 'The south-east will be relatively subdued - reflecting the
continued impact of high indebtedness and some further relocations from the
region.'

Less than a third of children enjoy reading in the classroom compared with
more than half their grandparents in their schooldays. But in Scotland the
popularity of reading has grown from 33 per cent two generations ago to 43
per cent.
Some 52% of grandparents looking back on their schooldays said reading had
been one of their favourite subjects. But for primary school children today
the figure is 30 per cent.
Reading for pleasure at home has suffered a similar fall in popularity, down
from 43 per cent to 32 per cent.
In all, 679 children aged between five and 11 and 570 grandparents across
Britain were surveyed by Birds Eye frozen foods at the start of its free

SIR JOHN Harvey-Jones, the former chairman of ICI and the presenter of the
BBC television series Troubleshooter on business efficiency, yesterday gave
his qualified support to BBC chiefs embroiled in arguments over changes
being made to the corporation.
He told the Edinburgh television festival it was 'no good shooting the poor
devils' trying to change things before the BBC charter comes up for renewal
in 1996.
He said: 'One of the problems that the BBC is struggling with is that it has
not changed in the past. If organisations do not change fast enough, when
change comes it is cataclysmic and very painful.'
Sir John has in the past been outspoken in his views on the BBC, which he
has described as inefficient. He believes the BBC should reduce costs by a
third and cut many management posts.

THE ROYAL College of Nursing will announce shortly that its total membership
has reached a record level, in spite of a general decline in trade union
membership.
However, a claim by the college that its membership is increasing at the
expense of Unison, the public service union which incorporates Cohse, Nupe
and Nalgo, has been disputed by the new union.
There are about 641,749 qualified individuals registered with the UK Central
Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting, of which 384,000 are
working in the National Health Service. The total nursing workforce in the
NHS is about 543,000, which includes 159,000 nursing auxilaries and nursing
assistants.
The college admits only qualified nurses, while Unison includes nursing
auxilaries and assistants in its 235,000 nursing membership.
The college is one of the few unions that has grown over the past few years.
Between December 1991 and December last year its membership rose from
292,180 to 297,719. Next month it will be a record at over 300,000.
Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the college, said: 'There is some
evidence that we have been recruiting from nurses in other unions, most
notably nurses from Cohse who could not see themselves as part of a large
generalist trade union.'
The RCN has no factual evidence yet to support its contention but Ms Hancock
said her claim was based on reports from local branch officials. If it is
accurate, the RCN claim would provide the first evidence that the creation
of Unison in July is having an adverse effect on membership.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: US cautious on peace hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US remains outwardly cautious about the prospects for a preliminary
self-rule agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, but US officials
are more excited than they have been for some time about the chances of a
breakthrough in the peace process.
As delegates gathered in Washington for the 11th round of Middle East talks,
President Bill Clinton warned that apparent good news had often turned into
disappointment. 'We've still got a long way to go,' he said.
Mr Clinton said he could not comment until progress was more concrete. He
said: 'I don't know if I would call it an intervention, but we have
certainly worked hard to be a handmaiden, or whatever the appropriate term
is. We are involved, but our position is not at issue here and should not be
discussed until the parties themselves work out their differences.'
State Department officials, however, said that a meeting in California on
Friday between Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Shimon
Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, had made it clear that 'the parties are
focused on choices that could produce real progress'.
Mr Christopher's aides are clearly elated at the possibility that their
boss, who has been vilified in the US press over his handling of the Bosnia
crisis as a passive and unprincipled administrator, might score a diplomatic
victory.
Officials told the New York Times that it was Mr Christopher's trip to the
Middle East at the beginning of this month that gave new momentum to the
peace talks.
'They needed the US to stimulate things. They have all needed an awful lot
of assurance and hand-holding from the US,' the newspaper reported a US
official as saying.
Mr Christopher's trip turned into an exercise in damage control, as he
sought to negotiate an end to Israel's assault on southern Lebanon, and even
his aides found little heart to defend his confident assertion that the
fighting in Lebanon had in fact 'given a new burst of energy to the
negotiations'.
US officials said that the crucial success of the trip was in persuading
President Hafez al Assad of Syria to advance talks with Israel on the future
of the Golan Heights. They suggested that this might have encouraged Mr
Yassir Arafat and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation to participate
more actively in talks with Israel.
This explanation is not universally shared in Washington, however.
'The main pressures on Arafat are financial. The people who have leaned on
him are the Saudis and the Egyptians,' said Dr Michael Hudson, professor of
Arab studies at Georgetown University.
Dr Hudson warned that Israel's proposal to give the Palestinians limited
self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip faced serious opposition among
Palestinians in the occupied territories, and not just in the militant Hamas
movement.
'Much depends on how the US interprets its role as a full partner in the
peace process, and how far they are willing to go to make sure this is not
the last stop on the road,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Self-rule will begin first in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho, where Palestinians will have what Israel describes as full
autonomy. They will take over most functions of the Israeli military
government including internal security and policing.
The principle of 'early empowerment' will apply to the rest of the West
Bank. Palestinians will take control of five spheres of daily life - health,
education, welfare, tourism and culture - and perhaps others, depending on
the outcome of negotiations.
The Israeli army will redeploy to agreed areas, withdrawing from all
Palestinian population centres but remaining to protect Jewish settlements
on the outskirts of Gaza and Jericho.
Israel will keep control of the border crossing from Gaza to Egypt and the
Allenby bridge near Jericho, which links the occupied West Bank to Jordan.
The status of Jerusalem, which thwarted earlier talks on self-rule, will be
left to negotiations on the permanent arrangement for the occupied
territories, which will begin two years after the signing of the joint
declaration of principles.
Expanded authority over Gaza and Jericho as well as early empowerment in the
rest of the West Bank could be implemented within weeks of signing the
document on the table at the 11th round of Middle East peace talks, starting
today in Washington.
Palestinians will elect a council to administer self-rule at least nine
months after the declaration of principles is implemented.
The seat of the administrative council will be in the West Bank town of
Bethlehem.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: 'The world has changed completely' - Peres
defends agreements before an astonished Knesset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'THIS is the beginning of the end of our 100-year dispute with the
Palestinians. And you, yesterday's men, can't see five steps forward.'
With these words, before a raucous Israeli Knesset yesterday, Israel's
foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, hit back at his critics on the opposition
benches, and defended agreements for granting Palestinian autonomy in the
occupied territories. 'The world has changed completely,' shouted Mr Peres
at members of the opposition Likud, 'and only you haven't realised it.'
News of the agreements between Mr Peres and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) stunned almost everyone. When Mr Peres first disclosed
the agreements to his cabinet colleagues on Sunday morning, jaws dropped. Mr
Elyakim Rubinstein, the man who has led Israel's negotiators through almost
two years of unproductive dialogue with the Palestinians in Washington, was
said to have been 'flabbergasted' at what had been achieved behind his back,
and threatened to resign.
No sooner had the first shock waves passed, than the opposition reacted
furiously. Settlers' leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were
unimpressed by government assurances that not a single settlement would be
moved during the planned five-year autonomy period.
Right-wing Knesset members have been united in their demands for new
elections, claiming that the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, has no
mandate for making deals with the PLO. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud
leader, urged the government in yesterday's stormy Knesset debate to 'go to
the people. Tell them the truth.' Mr Netanyahu has accused Messrs Rabin and
Peres of betraying their country by offering the PLO 'a headquarters 15
minutes from Jerusalem' from which to plot Israel's destruction.
The secretary-general of the Labour party, Mr Nissim Zvilli, told the French
TV station TF1 he did not think it was yet the time for Israel to recognise
the PLO.
Mr Peres's cabinet colleagues, by contrast, have been almost unanimous in
their delight at the foreign minister's progress, many echoing his own talk
of a 'major breakthrough'. Well aware that public opinion here remains
sensitive to both the idea of territorial compromise and direct contacts
with the PLO, several ministers - including Mr Rabin himself - have taken
pains to stress that the agreements are not a harbinger of a PLO state and
that Israel will not formally recognise the PLO unless it renounces
terrorism and deletes various anti-Israeli sections of its charter.
Almost two decades of general elections have shown that public opinion is
divided between those who regard Israeli control of the territories as
crucial to its security and those who believe the state can only prosper
once the Palestinians are given self-rule. An instant survey, conducted
overnight by the Yediot Ahronot tabloid, showed that this division persists,
with 53 per cent of those polled saying they support the 'Gaza and Jericho
first' autonomy proposals, and 45 per cent against.

PALESTINIAN rifts came swiftly into the open yesterday following signs of
progress in the Middle East peace talks, report David Horovitz and agencies.
Conflicting signals emerged from the Palestine Liberation Organisation -
euphoria from Mr Bassam Abu Sharif and Mr Yasser Abed-Rabbo, aides to the
chairman Mr Yassir Arafat, contrasting with pessimism from political
department head Mr Farouk Khaddoumi.
The Hamas Islamic Resistance movement has said it will do everything to
block a deal. The fundamentalist group is the main rival of the PLO in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Mr Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the spokesman for the 400 deported Palestinian
radicals stranded since last December in southern Lebanon, said that Moslems
throughout the world rejected any deal recognising Israel.

FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: Future of Jewish settlements in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Jewish settlers demonstrated last night in Jerusalem, vowing to
block proposals for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories by all
means possible, David Horovitz reports.
'(Yassir) Arafat will not be allowed to take control,' said settler leader
Uri Ariel. 'Rabin has no mandate for this deal. He must go home and we must
have new elections.'
The clashes, in which three protesters and two police were injured, indicate
that the settlements may become a flashpoint for right-wing Israeli
opposition to the deal expected to be signed shortly between Israel and the
Palestinians. More than 100,000 Jews live in about 150 settlements dotted
throughout the occupied territories.
Mr Rabin told his coalition partners yesterday that no settler would be
forced to leave home under the five-year interim autonomy proposals. 'The
settlements will remain - none will be uprooted,' Mr Rabin stressed.
However, the long-term future of the settlements is uncertain.
In its 14 months in office Mr Rabin's government has demonstrated that the
settlers are far lower on its list of priorities than under previous Likud
governments. State funding has been sharply reduced, and Mr Rabin has said
more than once that his main concern is to maintain the security of
residents of 'sovereign Israel'.
About 20 Israeli settlements are located in the Gaza Strip and Jericho,
where Palestinian self-rule is first proposed. During the five-year interim
period, government officials said yesterday, settlers there (the areas in
white in the map on the left) would remain Israel's responsibility,
protected by the army.
Neither Mr Rabin nor any of his colleagues have offered guarantees as to
settlers' fate after the five years are over. The government may hope that
those living in or near Arab population centres will decide to relocate
inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.

IT DID not take long to bring Palestinian rifts into the open, following the
signs of progress yesterday in the peace process.
Conflicting signals emerged from the PLO itself - euphoria from Mr Bassam
Abu Sharif and Mr Yasser Abed-Rabbo, aides to the chairman Mr Yassir Arafat,
contrasting with pessimism from political department head Mr Farouk
Khaddoumi.
Mr Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command was more extreme and threatened to assassinate Mr Arafat. The PLO
responded by saying the guerrilla group was out of touch with the needs of
Palestinians.
The Hamas Islamic Resistance movement, which has its strongholds in Gaza,
has said it will do everything to block a deal. The fundamentalist group,
which opposes the US-brokered Middle East peace talks, is the main rival of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza
strip. Its main stronghold is believed to be in Gaza.
'This project opens the door wide to inter-Palestinian fighting and civil
war because it does not fulfil their aspirations and liquidates their
cause,' Mr Mohammed Nazzal, the Hamas representative in Jordan said.
Mr Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the spokesman for the 400 deported Palestinian
radicals stranded since last December in southern Lebanon, said in a
telephone interview with the Associated Press yesterday that Moslems
throughout the world rejected any deal recognising Israel. 'This agreement
will not prevent the Islamic generation, now or in the future, from fighting
to restore its rights in Haifa, Acre, Lydda, Jaffa and Jerusalem,' he said.
Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: The Egyptian government, which has played an
increasingly important role in brokering Arab-Israeli talks, yesterday
welcomed the 'Gaza-Jericho first' agreement as a move towards achieving
Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. But it emphasised that
this should be seen as a first step.
In the first reaction from any Arab government to the proposed deal, Mr Amr
Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said: 'Any withdrawal from any part of
the Arab land occupied (by Israel) since 1967 is a step forward'. It is a
step that does not meet all requirements on its own, but is a move towards
achieving self-rule in all the Palestinian occupied territories.'
He said a full solution should embrace the terms of the original Madrid
formula for the peace talks, the full satisfaction of United Nations
resolutions and an acceptance by Israel of the principle of 'land for
peace'. 'The Gaza-Jericho proposal is under careful study and if the
Palestinians approve it, we will approve it too. The decision is a
Palestinian one,' the minister said.
Mr Arafat was due to arrive in Cairo last night for talks with Mr Moussa and
is due to meet Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, this morning at the
presidential palace in Alexandria. Mr Moussa, before yesterday's talks, put
his government squarely behind the PLO leadership in the face of hardline
Palestinian opposition to the proposal, praising Mr Arafat as 'working hard
to reach a comprehensive settlement'.

<TEXT>
THE United Auto Workers' union yesterday set in motion a tussle over the pay
and conditions of half a million US car industry workers when it named Ford
Motor as the company with which it intends to negotiate a new contract
first.
Under traditional 'pattern bargaining', the UAW tries every third year to
reach a new contract with a target company and then to impose similar
conditions on the other two big Detroit vehicle-makers. The UAW's current
contracts with the big three are to end in mid-September.
Ford wanted to be the target company and presented an outline package to the
UAW last week. It is financially more robust than rivals General Motors and
Chrysler.
The union, concerned about GM's competitiveness, may well be more flexible
than usual. Industry analysts, who do not expect a strike against any of the
car companies this autumn, point out that union leaders have struck a
conciliatory tone towards the big three recently.
Richard Waters reports: Workers at Bethlehem Steel, the second biggest US
steel producer, have approved a six-year labour accord which will allow a
representative of the United Steelworkers of America union on to the board.

THE CHILEAN government has proposed a solution to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.66bn) subordinated debt issue which has plagued domestic banking for a
decade, writes David Pilling in Santiago.
Ten of Chile's commercial banks owe the central bank Dollars 3.9bn. This
dates back to 1983 when the state took over their non-performing loans to
prevent a collapse of the banking system. Banks have since been obliged to
repurchase these debts yearly by handing over 70 per cent of their after-tax
profits to the central bank.
A reform bill, to be sent to Congress today or tomorrow, seeks to end the
repayment period after 40 years.

FT  31 AUG 93 / New homes sales down, trade deficit up, in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new homes in the US fell 5 per cent in July compared to June,
raising new doubts about the health of the housing market, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
In a separate report, it said a surge in imports had resulted in a US trade
deficit of Dollars 34.4bn (Pounds 23.2bn) in the second quarter, the biggest
shortfall in more than five years.
The weakness of new home sales puzzled analysts, as it had followed a recent
drop in mortgage rates to the lowest level in more than two decades and a
report last week of a robust 5.4 per cent gain in sales of previously owned
homes last month.
Sales fell in all regions, not just the flooded parts of the Midwest.
Figures for June were also revised down sharply to show a gain from May of
only 3.3 per cent, rather than the 11 per cent initially reported.
The unexpected weakness since May left sales running last month at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 - far below Wall Street
projections of about 675,000. For the first seven months of the year,
however, sales were still nearly 7 per cent higher than in the equivalent
period last year.
The trade deficit rose 17 per cent in the second quarter compared to the
first, mainly because consumer and investment demand in the US is much
stronger than in its recession-hit trading partners. Exports rose 1.4 per
cent from the first quarter to Dollars 113.1bn; imports rose 4.7 per cent to
a record Dollars 147.5bn.
The annualised deficit in the first half was Dollars 127.4bn compared with
Dollars 96.1bn for the equivalent period last year.

FT  31 AUG 93 / China to set up credit bank for capital projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is to establish a credit bank to fund large capital works projects, as
part of long-awaited and extensive reforms expected in the moribund banking
sector.
Mr Lou Jiwei, a senior official of the Commission for Restructuring the
Economy, said at the weekend that the Long-Term Development and Credit Bank,
planned for early next year, would fund projects in 'vital sectors', such as
those of energy and transportation.
Mr Lou, a close adviser to Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in
charge of the economy, also confirmed that an Export-Import Bank would be
established in the new year to 'stimulate' exports of machinery and
electronics.
Announcement of the formation of the new 'policy-lending' banks, plus
indications that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would have its functions
as a central bank more clearly defined under a new central bank law, follows
extensive consultation with officials of the World Bank, the IMF and other
international institutions.
World Bank officials have urged China to relieve its specialised banks of
the policy-lending burden for large capital works projects. 'Priority
investment, especially in long-gestation or very expensive projects, belongs
to an institution similar to the policy banks' described by Chinese
economists,' a World Bank report said.
'These investments could be financed by government-guaranteed bonds. This
would obviously be accompanied by re-focusing the attention of existing
banks on commercial activities. This will require much-strengthened
supervision capacity in the central bank,' the report said.
Chinese officials indicated at the weekend this process was already under
way, with emphasis on tightening the regulatory functions of the People's
Bank of China under Mr Zhu's governorship.
Among the World Bank's recommendations is that the PBOC be shorn of its
non-central bank functions such as ownership of securities companies and
mutual funds to allow it to 'focus on its primary role as a central bank',
on the lines of the US Federal Reserve.
Western bankers in Beijing say that any step towards strengthening and
streamlining the central bank's operations is welcome, but they are
sceptical about plans for sweeping reforms of the banking sector.
They point out that China's 'big four' specialised banks - the Industrial
and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank
 -are heavily burdened by non-performing loans to state enterprises.
Transformation of these institutions into commercial banks would require an
enormous commitment of government funds which may well prove beyond the
resources of the central government.
The World Bank, in its recommendations, suggested that subsidies for
loss-making state enterprises and allocations for agricultural procurement
be removed as 'a matter of priority' from the responsibility of the banking
sector.
'This type of lending,' the bank said, 'belongs to the budget.'

FT  31 AUG 93 / Bond returns may be flattering to deceive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING unprecedented in the post-war era has been happening over the last
few years: bonds have been a better investment not only than cash but even
than equities. The question is how long this performance can last.
A report* published in July by a British investment advisory boutique brings
together the facts and assesses both the process and the prospects. The
chart, taken from that paper, shows the value of an assumed investment in
the Standard &amp; Poor's composite index, with reinvestment of dividends, since
1957, relative to cash. Over the entire period the lucky investor would have
earned 3 1/2 times more in equities than in cash.
Not so the hapless investor in bonds. Over the same years the value of a US
bond portfolio, with reinvestment, would have fallen by about a quarter,
relative to cash. The UK offers a similar picture, although Germany, not
surprisingly, is a country where bonds have been a somewhat better
investment than cash.
Bad things, like good things, do come to an end. The turnaround for US bonds
relative to cash came in the early 1980s, thanks to Paul Volker's
disinflationary heroics at the Federal Reserve. More remarkably, global
returns on bonds have outstripped those on equities since 1987, while
returns on bonds have exceeded those in equities in each of the main
financial markets since 1990. The advantage of bonds has been very small in
the US, where the equity market has been buoyant, but huge in Japan. A
Japanese investor who bet on the bond market in 1990 would have made 31 per
cent per annum more than in the equity market, on average, since then. In
the UK the margin in favour of bonds has been 5 per cent per annum, on
average, over the period.
Theory suggests that ex ante returns on different assets should be the same,
allowing for risk. So equities should be more profitable than bonds and
bonds more profitable than cash over any long period. This is not what has
tended to happen.
Furthermore, if the return on bonds is to be the same as that on cash,
allowing for risk, a steep positively sloping yield curve, such as the one
now in effect in the US, implies that bond prices are expected to fall and
vice versa. If bonds have returned much less or more than cash, these
expectations cannot have been fulfilled. Up to the early 1980s bond prices
fell more than expected. Since then they have risen more than expected. The
main reason for this is that inflation outstripped expectations for a long
period. But since the early 1980s the reverse has been the case.
The authors of the study argue, however, that the reason for the market's
mistakes has not just been unanticipated developments in inflation. The
market has also not been processing the information available to it
efficiently. In particular, bond prices should be relatively high when
short-term interest rates are much below long ones, because bond prices
should then be expected to fall, and vice versa. In fact, the yield gap has
been a poor predictor of subsequent changes in bond prices. The authors of
the report argue that they have been able to identify better predictors,
which means that an active trader should be able to earn higher returns than
a passive holder of bonds.
What now? Whether or not traders can outperform the market, the principal
determinant of exceptionally high relative returns on bonds is bound to be
unexpectedly low inflation (or unexpectedly low real rates of interest).
Since the inflation expectation implied by present bond yields is already
around 3 per cent in the US, the chances of further favourable inflation
surprises may be relatively low.
At the same time a trading rule the report recommends is to hold bonds when
the gap between bond yields and short rates has recently risen and hold cash
when it has recently fallen. On that basis too, the chances of further high
returns may be modest, at least on US bonds.

UN weapons inspectors investigating Iraq's missile installations say they
are struck by their remarkable similarity to Argentina's Condor II missile
complex, closed in 1990 by President Carlos Menem, writes John Barham in
Buenos Aires. UN officials recently in Argentina were quoted as saying the
similarity of the production plants and missiles gave them insights into how
the larger Iraqi project worked. Argentina, Iraq and Egypt co-operated
closely in developing missile technology in the 1980s.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Chile bank reform proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHILEAN government has proposed a solution to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.66bn) subordinated debt issue that has plagued domestic banking for a
decade, writes David Pilling in Santiago.
Ten of Chile's commercial banks owe the central bank Dollars 3.9bn. This
dates back to 1983 when the state took over their non-performing loans to
prevent a collapse of the banking system. Banks have since been obliged to
repurchase these debts yearly by handing over 70 per cent of their after-tax
profits to the central bank.
A reform bill, to be sent to Congress today or tomorrow, seeks to end the
repayment period after 40 years. Banks with a realistic chance of achieving
this would continue to pay the 70 per cent of profits to the central bank,
but would be subject to an 'efficiency test' stipulating a minimum rate of
profit. Those with less prospect of repurchasing all their outstanding debts
within the 40 years - which include Banco de Chile and Banco de Santiago,
two of the country's biggest - would issue convertible bonds to cover the
shortfall. This would imply a dilution of existing shareholder stock, and is
likely to be controversial in Congress.
In return for their agreement to new repayment terms, banks - participating
voluntarily - would be allowed to take on new activities such as factoring,
securitisation and setting up international finance consultancies abroad.
