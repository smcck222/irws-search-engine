FT  31 AUG 93 / Mandela refuses to punish ANC offenders in human rights
cases

MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday
refused to punish ANC officials found guilty by the organisation's
commission of inquiry into murders, torture and other human rights abuses in
ANC prison camps in the 1980s.
The commission, which was appointed by Mr Mandela, last week called on the
ANC to punish those involved in the deaths of 22 detainees, and other cases
of abuse and injury, and to pay compensation to victims or their families.
Mr Mandela rejected these recommendations, calling instead for a 'Truth
Commission' to investigate all cases of human rights abuse, including those
involving government officials.
Mt Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, drew a distinction between
abuses carried out in defence of apartheid, and those committed in the fight
for liberation. Asked whether the ANC believed that the ends justified the
means in cases of human rights abuse, Mr Mandela replied: 'You can draw your
own conclusions.'
He said the ANC accepted 'collective responsibility' for what happened. He
went on to excuse the abuses by saying that they were committed 'in an
attempt to prevent violations of human rights by the other side'. Mr Mandela
said any compensation to victims would have to be paid by a future
government, not by the ANC.
Meanwhile, he announced that Mr Thabo Mbeki, a leading moderate, had been
elected national chairman of the ANC. This will boost Mr Mbeki's chances to
succeed Mr Mandela as president. Mr Ramaphosa, another moderate, is the
other possible successor, though he has come under increasing criticism for
making too many concessions to whites.

<TEXT>
THE INTERIM government of Nigeria faces the first real challenge to its
authority today.
If a national strike called by unions and the pro-democracy movement can
hold firm on the first working day after a long weekend, the economic
pressures on the new government installed by the country's military will be
considerable, for the main business and industrial centres, Lagos and
Ibadan, will have been paralysed for nearly a week by absenteeism and
strikes.
The Nigeria Labour Congress called its members out on Saturday to protest
against the former military government's failure to return the country to
full democracy. The congress wants the interim government to honour the
result of the presidential election in June, which was annulled by Gen
Ibrahim Babangida, the military ruler who stepped down last Thursday.
Oil workers have been on strike since Saturday, but production of crude for
export was not thought to be affected.
Civil service unions say they will walk out from today.
Road transport is paralysed due to a chronic shortage of locally refined
fuel.
The introduction last week of a two-tier price system for petrol, with a new
grade costing 10 times the price of the current subsidised fuel, has led to
panic buying.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's new head of government, on Sunday ordered
the release of three prominent political prisoners and several journalists
detained on conspiracy and sedition charges. But a military decree to ban
several opposition newspapers and magazines is still in force.
Mr Beko Ransome-Kuti and fellow lawyers Mr Gan Fawehinmi and Mr Femi Falana
had been jailed since July 7 for organising demonstrations against the
cancellation of the presidential poll results. They support the claim to the
presidency of Chief Moshood Abiola, the Moslem millionaire businessman
credited with having won the contest.
The pro-democracy campaign is planning to hold rallies in the northern
cities of Kano and Kaduna, where support for their demands has been
lukewarm.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Bundesbank caught in a rates quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS who dared to speculate on the direction of German interest rates
last week are now pondering the question of where German monetary policy
goes from here after the decision not to cut rates.
The question is delicate at a time when there is suspicion in some European
capitals that the Bundesbank takes pleasure in wrong-footing those who try
to guess the timing and scope of future interest rate moves.
The economic factors governing policy are conflicting - inflation is on the
way down, according to Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and
member of the policymaking directorate, and this should lead to lower
interest rates. But money supply growth - the yardstick by which the German
central bank steers its interest rate policy - is running well above the
bank's target range.
Price stability and the defence of the German currency have long been at the
core of Bundesbank policy. But there is another factor - the worst downturn
in Germany since the second world war.
Mr Issing declared last Friday that monetary policy would increasingly take
its cue from the German recession, implying that the Bundesbank wanted to do
its bit to alleviate the problems suffered by German industry.
In practice, however, Mr Issing's concern about the recession is likely to
mean that interest rates will eventually come down, but only at a slow pace.
Comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president and president elect of the
Bundesbank, also point to lower rates and concern for the wider economy. Mr
Tietmeyer said recently that further appreciation of the D-Mark within
Europe was undesirable in the light of German exporters' need to remain
competitive.
But the Bundesbank finds itself between a rock and hard place. On the one
hand it wants to cut rates, which would help alleviate the recession. On the
other, despite signs inflation is on its way down, the Bundesbank is still
constrained by money supply growth. As it never tires of explaining when
setting out its ideological stall, current money supply growth is the
determinant of inflation two or three years down the road.
To some extent, the latest M3, or broad money, figure is distorted - chiefly
by the effect of the Bundesbank's interventions in the currency markets in
recent months. This will feed through into the August number and will ensure
that for a fifth month M3 growth will exceed the target.
'The big problem is that the Bundesbank has not successfully dealt with an
increase in money supply which dates back to German reunification (in
1990),' says Mr Joachim Fels, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt 'The
reason we have high inflation now is because of monetary growth several
years ago.'
The Bundesbank's room for manoeuvre is helped by the widening of fluctuation
bands within the exchange rate mechanism. The most likely next step is a cut
of 50 basis points at most in the discount rate. This is currently at 6.75
per cent and a cut from this level could be justified on 'technical grounds'
because of the narrow margin between this rate and current money market
rates.
'The Bundesbank likes to engage in practical psychology,' says Mr Fels. 'It
must strive to keep hopes of further interest rate cuts alive. The only way
it can do this is by giving the market less than it expects, and more
slowly.'

NORWAY'S Industry and Energy Ministry has rejected applications for new oil
and gas exploration offshore acreage submitted by the Norwegian subsidiaries
of Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon Corporation, according to leaked reports.
Mr Finn Kristensen, industry and energy minister, is due tomorrow to
announce the award of 50 blocks of new acreage offered under Norway's 14th
licensing round. Both companies said yesterday they had submitted
'selective' applications based on their respective technical and
profitability assessments of the blocks on offer. Neither Shell or Esso,
Exxon's Norwegian subsidiary, said they had demanded 'special' conditions or
treatment of their applications.
Mr Einar Knudsen, director of information at Norske Shell, said the company
had told energy officials that its return on investment for exploration
drilling had to increase.
Mr Per Schoeyen, public affairs manager of Esso, said if his company failed
to win any fresh exploration acreage it would not be seen as 'dramatic'.
Both Norske Shell and Esso have criticised Oslo's tough fiscal and licensing
regimes. Other foreign oil companies have said that Norway, which faces
tough competition from emerging oil and gas producers, should provide
incentives for maintaining foreign investment.
'It takes longer for opportunities in new areas to materialise and I think
Norway is exploiting this opportunity to drive a hard bargain while it can,'
one industry official said yes-terday.
Norway's ruling Labour party, facing a general election next month, got a
boost from a poll yesterday showing that Norwegians backed its controversial
decision to seek membership of the European Community, Reuter reports from
Oslo.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Poland rich in entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY are usually aged between 36 and 45 years. Most have a background in
science or engineering. And - perhaps inevitably - nine out of 10 are men.
Three years after Poland embarked on its 'big bang' policy of economic
liberalisation, the new entrepreneurs are not only thriving, but providing
the backbone of the country's attempts to emerge from recession.
Even more significantly - according to a recent study by the International
Finance Corporation - the focus of their market skills is shifting. Instead
of simply trading, as they did in the early days, in imported 'luxuries'
such as alcohol or frilly undergarments, Polish entrepreneurs are moving
into manufacturing, producing goods ranging from car parts and plastics to
homoeopathic remedies.
The IFC says the shift has left Poland's private sector arguably the best
developed in East Europe, providing more than 50 per cent of Poland's GDP
and employment.
For those who wonder whether this can be repeated elsewhere in Eastern
Europe, the IFC's case studies are illuminating.
The key to the Polish would-be capitalists is, the study claims, their
economic 'agility'. Poland is apparently peppered with academics who have
turned their hand to producing hot dog kiosks, farmers who have switched
their skills from hop growing into spice marketing, and engineers who have
moved from metal work to meat processing to publishing and back again.
With credit hard to raise, and interest rates high, most starting capital
has come from family funds, often gained from speculative trading during the
late 1980s.
Nevertheless, a familiar litany of problems remain: loans are difficult to
obtain, trading bureaucracy is Byzantine, market information is scarce, and
almost all entrepreneurs report being plagued by that old problem - the
crackly telephone.

Finance Corporation, 1818 H Street, NW Washington DC.

RUSSIAN troops are to be withdrawn from the Baltic republic of Lithuania
today on schedule, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian president, said
yesterday in a national radio address.
A spokesman for Russian Presdent Boris Yeltsin later confirmed the troops'
withdrawal, but refused to say if it would be today.
The normally good relations between Russia and Lithuania were soured earlier
this month when Russia said it would suspend the withdrawal of 2,500 service
personnel and their families because Lithuanian negotiators had insisted on
raising the issue of compensation for damage done since the first Soviet
occupation in 1940.
Russia is in neither the mood nor any condition to make reparations for a
Soviet past it disavows. Evidence of this came yesterday when Mr Sergei
Filatov, chief of staff to Mr Yeltsin and chairman of a commission to
determine events which led up to the shooting down in 1983 of the South
Korean civilian airliner KAL007 over Soviet airspace, said that the Soviet
Union bore no guilt for the incident.
Mr Filatov said pilot error had taken the plane 350 miles off course, deep
into Soviet airspace.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Alphandery confident on economy
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday quietly vaunted its cautious monetary policy
as helping to stabilise the economy, despite the news that unemployment rose
further to 11.7 per cent in July, from 11.6 per cent the month before.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, claimed, in highly qualified
terms, that 'the hypothesis of (the economy) emerging from the tunnel (of
recession) at the end of this year or at the latest at the start of 1994 is
far from unrealistic'.
In his interview with La Tribune newspaper, the minister, evidently
chastened in his public pronouncements by the recent monetary storms, said
that after the rate of decline in industrial production had slowed in the
first half of this year, 'to all appearances, we are therefore now at the
bottom of the cycle, at a weak level of economic activity'.
But with long-term interest rates still slightly below those of Germany, and
short-term rates finding again their pre-August crisis level, the minister
said the government had no intention of 'changing the direction' of its
economic and financial policy.
The one lesson to draw from the recent crisis of the European exchange rate
system was that 'economic convergence is a precondition for monetary
convergence', Mr Alphandery said, in a marked shift from the position held
by previous French ministers during the Maastricht treaty negotiations.
France's conversion to the necessity for convergence with Germany was
reflected, Mr Alphandery said, in the decision by Bonn and Paris to work
together in preparing medium-term budgetary plans.
Despite the claims of ministers to see light at the end of the economic
tunnel, the government itself has forecast that unemployment will keep
rising until early 1994. It has moved to improve the cash position of
companies by refunding their VAT payments more quickly, but most are
reluctant to hire new workers until they see real evidence of a pick-up in
consumer demand.
Mr Alphandery said there was now evidence of improvement in the beleaguered
construction sector, but admitted many sectors were still in recession.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE headlines in Belgrade newspapers each day reflect a human tragedy as the
Serbian economy suffers under the weight of United Nations sanctions.
'Babies are dying,' one says, while others claim that 'starving pensioners
are committing suicide' and 'grocery store shelves are bare'.
After months of virtually ignoring the west, Serbian leaders have launched
an offensive to get sanctions lifted on humanitarian grounds. Mr Milorad
Unkovic, federal minister for foreign economic relations in the rump
Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro, said there was 'great
danger with the approach of winter. People will not be able to heat their
homes.'
The economic decline of Serbia shows no sign of bottoming out. Inflation in
August ran at a monthly rate of 1,500 per cent. The Yugoslav National Bank
yesterday issued a 1bn dinar banknote worth less than Dollars 3.
Industrial production in June dropped by 37 per cent compared with the same
month last year and hundreds of thousands of workers have been sacked as
factories close.
Serbian health care is suffering badly. Medicines and food are not covered
by sanctions, but 'if you need surgery, bring your own medicines, needles,
anaesthetics and linens, or commit suicide if you don't have money,' said Mr
Predrag Simic, director of the Belgrade institute of international politics
and economics.
If a settlement is reached in Geneva this week for a partition of Bosnia,
Serbia will step up pressure for lifting sanctions. But if sanctions were
eased, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic would be rewarded for destroying
Bosnia and creating Greater Serbia.
Russia has called for sanctions to be eased if progress is made on partition
but the US says it is far too early even to discuss such measures.
Proponents of sanctions on Serbia are convinced that they represent the only
means of containing an aggressive state, which is now a regional military
power.
However Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister, warned that
'sanctions have become the biggest generator of instability in the Balkans'.
Serbian officials point to a growing number of countries hit by 15 months of
sanctions on Serbia: Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Hungary have
all sustained large losses, while officials from Macedonia say sanctions are
harming the former Yugoslav republic even more than Serbia, its northern
neighbour.
The imposition of sanctions against Serbia has proved to be one of the few
issues on which the west was united. But removing them looks likely to be
yet another divisive issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, warned yesterday that modern warfare would descend into 'absolute
chaos' if governments did not stop violations of humanitarian law.
Opening a three-day conference in Geneva on the protection of war victims,
Mr Sommaruga stressed that signatories of the 1949 Geneva conventions and
the 1977 protocols protecting non-combatants were committed not only to
upholding the rules themselves but to ensuring others also did so.
The ICRC and the Swiss government, depositary state for the conventions,
called the conference at a time of mounting violations of international
humanitarian law. Red Cross and United Nations aid officials have described
the fighting in former Yugoslavia as the most savage in recent memory, but
many other conflicts reveal a similar picture of carnage and brutality.
The ICRC is particularly alarmed by two new developments: the targeting of
civilians as a war objective and the obstruction of humanitarian relief
efforts, including attacks on aid workers and contempt for the Red Cross
emblem.
Ministers and officials from some 160 countries attending the conference are
expected tomorrow to endorse a declaration backing outside intervention to
prevent violations of humanitarian law and supporting UN moves to establish
a permanent war crimes tribunal.
The ICRC, which monitors the Geneva conventions, admits it faces a paradox.
While urging signatory states to enforce the conventions, it maintains a
neutral stance that prevents it from exposing specific wrongdoing or giving
evidence to a war crimes tribunal. 'If they thought we were there to collect
information they would not allow us to fulfil our mandate,' Mr Sommaruga
said recently.
However, this policy is being debated within the ICRC, which has been stung
by criticism that it was slow to reveal the existence of detention camps in
Bosnia.
Another paradox is that many of those involved in current, mainly civil,
wars are not attending the conference. Invitations went only to UN members
and observers.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Macedonia reluctant to plug gaps: As peace talks falter
attention again focuses on sanctions against Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE trucks cluster each evening in lay-bys close to Macedonia's border with
Serbia, waiting for UN sanctions monitors to go off duty. But even if the
monitors stay up late, the drivers, keeping in touch through walkie-talkies,
can choose from dozens of unwatched tracks to cross the frontier.
As measures to enforce sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro have
tightened along the Danube and Serbia's border with Bulgaria, Macedonia has
become the main supply route for the rump Yugoslavia.
According to the UN protection force, which also monitors the border, about
4,000 trucks make the crossing in both directions every week. Vehicles
carrying oil products, construction materials and spare parts for heavy
machinery have been spotted, but not stopped.
The 38-member sanctions assistance mission, made up of customs officers from
several countries, encourage the Macedonian customs service to inspect loads
crossing the border. But it has no authority to enforce the sanctions.
'Once in a while the customs will follow our suggestions, but whole days go
by when no trucks get inspected,' said Mr Gordon Evers, a Canadian customs
official leading the SAM team.
The rail link between Athens and Belgrade is still in operation. Two or
three freight trains leave Skopje every night and tanker trains carrying oil
head north several times a week.
Macedonia, which was admitted to the UN earlier this year, has formally
backed the embargo against Serbia, its main trading partner. The government
claims that the sanctions cost the Macedonian economy more than Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 810m) last year.
However, government officials argue that the economy is so battered by the
loss of trade with Serbia, together with the effects of more than a year of
diplomatic isolation, that it cannot be expected to apply sanctions fully
unless compensation is guaranteed.
'We ask the UN about compensation and they refer us to the European
Community. There's no money in sight, but we have to cope with another 15
per cent fall in industrial output this year and an unemployment rate of
more than 30 per cent,' says a government economic adviser.
Macedonian officials admit, too, that their enthusiasm for complying with
sanctions has been diluted by delays in the arrival of Ecu100m (Pounds
76.4m) in EC aid, promised last December.
Half of that amount is being contributed by member states on a bilateral
basis, with the rest provided by the European Commission.
The government also claims it is being blackmailed into shipping oil to
Serbia by Greece, which is Macedonia's main source for oil supplies.
According to a senior Macedonian official, Greece last month threatened to
cut off all oil shipments to Macedonia unless half the supply from the
northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, amounting to more than 80,000 tonnes
monthly, was sent on to Serbia.

MR Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, yesterday cast doubts on the
prospects of reaching a peace agreement when talks resume today in Geneva,
saying 'he felt like a thirsty man sent to find water in the desert'.
Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, is due to meet his Serb and Croat adversaries
after international mediators set a deadline of this week for them to
endorse the republic's partition.
A UN official yesterday warned against any side seeking 'radical'
concessions instead of minor territorial adjustments of the package put
forward by peace envoys Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. 'Those
concessions and the whole package are not going to stay on the table
indefinitely,' said the official, adding 'bits and bobs are one thing but
whole shopping lists are another'.
The next days would determine whether the peace was to be given a chance or
whether there was to be an intensified conflict, the official said.
Bosnia's ruling assembly rejected the 'compromise package' at the weekend
for failing to restore government control over territory that was mostly
Moslem before the war. The assembly also criticised the plan for failing to
provide sufficient Nato and US guarantees that it would be enforced.
After his assembly backed the plan, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, repeated threats that the Moslems would be left with nothing if they
rejected the offer.
Bosnian Croat leaders said they would seek some minor changes in the plan,
reportedly along Bosnia's frontier with Croatia which, under the proposed
map, was mostly designated part of the Serb republic.
The peace envoys have expressed their disappointment in failing to wring
more concessions from Bosnian Serb leaders. Serb forces currently control
about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory. The proposed map gives Serbs about
54 per cent, Croats 17 per cent, and Moslems some 28 per cent.
Lord Owen last week said the settlement was the best deal he could salvage
for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group comprising 44 per cent of the
pre-war population.
But Mr Izetbegovic, speaking after yesterday's talks were postponed until
today because the Bosnian delegation had difficulties in leaving Sarajevo,
was reported to have said: 'Our people need peace, and the proposals being
offered are worse than war.'
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council yesterday condemned the use of UN troops
as pawns in the Bosnian war after Spanish peacekeepers spent a fifth day
trapped in the Moslem sector of Mostar, AP reports. At least 53 Spanish UN
troops have been unable to leave the eastern sector of the embattled city
since Thursday. Moslems under Croat siege fear renewed attacks if the
soldiers leave.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Ministers to speak at Thatcherite group meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE MINISTERS are to speak at meetings organised by Conservative Way
Forward, a Thatcherite group, during the Tory party conference, intensifying
the pressure on Mr John Major, prime minister, from the right of his party.
The latest issue of Conservative Way Forward's quarterly magazine contained
a vigorous attack on Mr Major's leadership, from Lord Parkinson, the former
cabinet minister and chairman of the group.
High-profile ministerial support for the group will further undermine party
managers' hopes that the October conference would provide the basis for a
political revival.
Newspaper serialisation of Mr Kenneth Baker's memoirs is already raking over
the divisions during the leadership contest of 1990. Tories are also
apprehensive that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, will use a speech
to a conference fringe meeting to cause further difficulties for the prime
minister.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, is the most senior of the
three ministers to address the CWF. The others are Mr Michael Forsyth, the
employment minister, and Mr Neil Hamilton, the deregulation minister. All
will speak on matters within their own responsibilities.
Apart from Lord Parkinson's bitter accusation that Mr Major's 'disunited'
government left natural Tory supporters feeling betrayed, the CWF also took
a hard line earlier this month on taxation. Its magazine warned that there
could be a further rebellion from the right wing if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, extended the base for value added tax, without making deep cuts
in public spending.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, recently refused to rule
out tax rises, although he made clear his opposition to such increases and
his desire to reduce public spending.
However, despite Mr Portillo's rightwing credentials, rightwing MPs are not
yet convinced the government will be as tough on public spending as they
want.
Further divisions could surface over the second group of government
departments to feature in the long-term public spending review. These are
expected to include the ministry of agriculture and the department of the
environment.

<TEXT>
NORWAY hosted several clandestine meetings between Israelis and Palestinians
to help secure the interim agreement on resolving the Middle East conflict,
Norwegian officials said yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Representatives of both sides met in Norwegian farmhouses and in the private
homes of Norwegian officials between April and August this year.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and Mr Abu Ala, a top Palestine
Liberation Organisation official, are said to have met for the first time
earlier this year at the 19th century Borregaard farm near Sarpsborg, just
south of Oslo.
Mr Johan Joergan Holst, Norway's foreign minister, said his country's role
as a 'back-door' mediator was central to what he described as a historic
breakthrough.
There were 25 meetings in all, he said. They took place, with Washington's
blessing, in Norway, elsewhere in Europe and in Tunisia.
Five Norwegian representatives made up a special mediating team. They
included Mr Holst, his wife, Ms Marianne Heiberg, a foreign policy
researcher, Mr Jan Egeland, secretary of state in the foreign ministry and
Mr Terje Roed-Larsen, head of Norway's Trade Union Centre for Research and
Documentation, and his wife.
Norway, currently governed by the Labour party, gained the trust of the PLO
and Israel largely because of its traditional ties to Israel's Labour party,
earlier meetings with PLO leader Yassir Arafat and Norway's status as a
founding member of Nato.
The Borregaard farm is thought to have been chosen as one of the sites for
talks because it is owned by Orkla, the listed paper and food group. Mr Jens
Heyerdahl, Orkla's chief executive, has close links with Mr Roed-Larsen, a
leading figure in the Norwegian team at the talks.

FT  31 AUG 93 / French stance 'could sink Gatt talks'

LEADING trade negotiators expressed concern in Geneva yesterday that France
is bent on undermining the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation.
This follows French insistence that its European Community partners must
water down a farm trade agreement with the US which Paris claims the
European Commission should not have negotiated with Washington last
November. French officials will this week continue discussions with Germany
on Paris's proposed changes to the so-called Blair House accord on US-EC
trade in subsidised farm goods.
But in Geneva yesterday, trade officials from 106 countries, gathering for
three critical months of negotiation which were intended to finalise the
long-stalled Uruguay round, warned that reopening the Blair House agreement
would scupper the round.
'If the EC were formally to ask for Blair House to be reopened, you can
forget the Uruguay round,' one leading negotiator predicted. The round was
launched in 1986, but stalled in 1992 because of EC-US conflict on farm
trade reform.
The French push follows a meeting last week between Mr Edouard Balladur,
France's prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, when Mr Kohl
appeared to endorse France's call for renegotiation.
German officials have been at pains since then to insist that the German
leader's comments were misinterpreted. But the confusion in their wake has
led to speculation that the EC might be forced to renege on a deal that took
a year to negotiate.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), is expected to give a clear but coded signal to
France to modify its position when he begins the autumn talks at a top-level
trade negotiations committee in Geneva today. He will call for governments
to exert political leadership in the face of pressure from lobbies.
Senior officials in Mr Kohl's office yesterday reiterated that Germany did
not seek formal renegotiation of the US-EC farm agreement. They said the
government was aware that Blair House could not be renegotiated, even in
parts, without putting the Uruguay round at risk.
Confusingly, a spokesman then added that the Blair House accord had 'neither
been signed nor finally signed . . . It is of great importance that this
agreement is compatible with the EC common agricultural policy.'
Mr Sutherland will meet Mr Kohl in Bonn tomorrow to seek clarification of
last week's comments. A meeting with Mr Balladur is due next Wednesday.

FT  31 AUG 93 / Israel backs peace pact with PLO: Extremists from both camps
threaten to derail agreement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL last night committed itself to a historic peace agreement with
Palestinians which could be a first step to ending a conflict that has
wracked the Middle East for decades.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said Israel would sign an unprecedented
accord with Palestinians at peace talks which resume in Washington today.
This is expected to provide for a degree of Palestinian self-rule in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and conditional Israeli
recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, according to Mr Shimon
Peres, foreign minister, who concluded the agreement in secret talks with a
PLO representative in Norway last week.
Following the announcement by Mr Peres and Mr Rabin, an extraordinary
session of the Israeli cabinet approved the peace plan by an overwhelming
majority. Ministers said that 16 members of the cabinet were in favour and
two abstained.
Mr Peres said: 'It's a beginning and there is a lot of work ahead of us. We
are determined to bring peace to the whole of the Middle East.'
A senior official of the PLO confirmed the agreement and said it could be
signed within 48 hours. Egypt welcomed the move, but Palestinian and Israeli
extremists condemned it and warned of violent opposition.
In Washington, Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said: 'We
hope and expect that this progress will now be reflected in the next
negotiating round and will lead to an early agreement on a draft declaration
of principles.' President Bill Clinton warned, however, that 'we've still
got a long way to go'.
The agreement is a comprehensive package providing for:
A five-year interim period of self-rule for 1.8m Palestinians in the
territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
A partial Israeli military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and an
undefined enclave around the West Bank town of Jericho.
Mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO.
If signed, and not derailed by Israeli and Palestinian extremists, the plan
could hasten progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement
between Israel and all its Arab neighbours. Mr Rabin told ministers it was
'a great step forward to advance Israel towards peace with all the
neighbouring states and especially Palestinians. I believe this will
happen'.
The Palestinians will be granted full authority over their internal affairs,
including policing in Gaza-Jericho, but will have lesser powers in the rest
of the West Bank. Jericho, a small dusty town in the parched Jordan Valley,
will become the administrative capital for the expanded elected Palestinian
authority. Bethlehem will be the site of the lesser authority governing the
rest of the West Bank.
Israel will redeploy troops out of population centres in Gaza-Jericho, but
will still provide a security role for the estimated 6,000 settlers on the
outskirts of Gaza and Jericho. Israel will keep full control of occupied
Arab East Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements and the Israeli-Jordanian and
Israeli-Egyptian border crossings, at least until talks begin on permanent
arrangements two years after the interim pact is signed.
Mr Peres said yesterday Israel could recognise the PLO as part of the deal
if the organisation completely renounced violent acts and gave up parts of
its charter calling for the extermination of the Jewish state. Once signed,
the deal could trigger progress on stalled bilateral peace talks between
Israel and Syria, and Jordan and Lebanon.
Public announcement of the deal yesterday sparked immediate protest.
Rightwing parties in Israel's parliament heckled and shouted down Mr Peres
as he tried to explain the peace package and last night up to 2,000
demonstrators protested outside the cabinet meeting.
On the Palestinian side, the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, the
PLO's main rival, accused the PLO of betraying Palestinian aspirations and
warned of a Palestinian civil war. Another extremist organisation, Mr Ahmed
Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,
threatened to assassinate Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran PLO chairman who
pushed acceptance of the peace plan through his hostile executive committee.
Mr Rabin moved to deflect potential criticism among Israelis by arguing that
Israel had made no concessions on the two most sensitive issues: East
Jerusalem and the settlements. 'Jerusalem remains under Israeli sovereignty
and is its capital. The settlements remain. None will be uprooted,' he said.
An overnight poll for Hebrew tabloid Yediot Ahronot showed 54 per cent of
523 Israelis interviewed backed the plan and 45 per cent were opposed.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment 4: Bouncing back -
Profile: BNP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE success of Banque Nationale de Paris' privatisation this year was
critical to the prospects of the rest of the Balladur government's
privatisation programme. The government did everything it could to ensure
the issue was a success - from launching a lavish advertising campaign to
pricing BNP's shares, at FFr240 each, well below market expectations.
To the government's relief, the issue was indeed a roaring success. Michel
Pebereau, who was this summer parachuted into the BNP chairman's seat from
Credit Commercial de France, now faces the challenge of getting to grips
with the management of one of Europe's biggest banks.
Analysts are confident that there is lots of scope for improvement. BNP saw
net profits fall sharply to FFr552m in the first half of this year after
sliding to FFr2.1bn in 1992 from FFr2.6bn in 1991.
However, most observers suspect that Mr Pebereau has taken an aggressive
stance on provisioning. There is also plenty of potential for cost-cutting
and for weeding out the poor performers among BNP's peripheral interests.
The consensus is that BNP, aided and abetted by Dresdner Bank, its new
German ally, should soon bounce back to profits growth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S parliament-that-never-was, a debating chamber built in Edinburgh
in the late 1970s, is to be scrapped, the government said last night.
The Scottish Office said it had 'no foreseeable need' for the building
beyond next year. It will then be decided whether to sell it or offer it to
other government departments.
In recent years the debating chamber has been occasionally used for meetings
of the Commons Scottish Grand Committee.

FT  28 AUG 93 / FBI in raids on National Medical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in National Medical Enterprises plunged yesterday on news of FBI
raids of the hospital company's offices and hospitals in a national
investigation of possible health insurance fraud, writes our New York staff.
On Wall Street, shares in National Medical dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars
8 yesterday. The company used to own the British nursing home group,
Westminster Healthcare Holdings, and now holds 42 per cent of its shares.
National Medical is already facing suits from many of the big US insurance
companies alleging that National Medical defrauded them of more than Dollars
750m (Pounds 507m), and more than 100 former patients have sued the company
for fraud, physical mistreatment and false imprisonment.
National Medical has sued 19 insurers on charges of conspiring to delay or
deny payments for patients.
California-based National Medical last year earned about Dollars 133m on
revenues of about Dollars 4bn.
The probe is part of a Justice Department and FBI decision last year to give
top priority to health care fraud.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Potter deplores BBC's 'Dalek' leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENNIS POTTER, the distinguished television playwright who has frequently
written for the BBC, last night suggested that the corporation be broken up
into smaller units.
Mr Potter told the Edinburgh television festival that the time was near when
public service broadcasting had to be saved from the BBC.
'The old Titan should spawn smaller and more nimble offspring if its present
controllers cannot be removed,' he said in the James MacTaggart Lecture
which traditionally opens the festival.
The playwright suggested separating radio from television and turning BBC2
into a separate public service broadcaster.
'Let us begin to consider afresh how the thousands of millions of pounds of
licence money could be apportioned between two, three or four successors to
the currently misled corporation,' he said.
Mr Potter said the political pressure from market-obsessed radicals and the
BBC's confused self-defence had drawn the organisation so heavily into the
'dogma-coated discourses' of 'market efficiency' that in the end it might
lose sight of why it was there in the first place.
He attacked what he saw as a one-way system of communication in the
corporation which carried signals laden with 'costive, blurb and
bubble-driven didacticism'.
In a clear reference to Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, and Mr John
Birt, director-general, Mr Potter said: 'You cannot make a pair of
croak-voiced Daleks appear benevolent, even if you dress one of them in an
Armani suit and call the other Marmaduke.'
The BBC was under governors who seemed incapable of performing the public
trust invested in them and under a chairman who seemed to believe he was
heading a private fiefdom.
Mr Potter also argued for the vigorous enforcement and even extension of
current cross-ownership provisions to prevent 'dangerous concentrations of
the media power which plays such a large part in our lives'.
He said no individual, group or company should be allowed to own more than
one daily, one evening and one weekly newspaper. No newspaper should be
allowed to own a television station and vice versa.
Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Network Television, said last night:
'The world of broadcasting has changed. And the BBC must change as well . .
. Radical reform was our only option. I make no apology for seeking a BBC
that is well-run.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japanese work practices can be
successful in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER J GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to 'Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work
practices' (July 19), here is an alternative view.
Oki's manufacturing site at Cumbernauld, Scotland, has adopted many Japanese
working practices and combined them successfully with the best from western
culture. The facility is committed to kaizen, or continuous improvement, and
the close involvement of its staff. For example, every morning a meeting is
held in each section where employees are able to discuss the previous day's
activities and provide feedback to their supervisors. It is at these
meetings, or chokai sessions, that everyone has an opportunity to
participate in the company's affairs.
The strong communications links between staff and management on a variety of
issues is vital to the culture that has been developed at Cumbernauld. It is
this culture that resulted in Oki being presented with the Investors in
People Award. At the ceremony, an assessor from Investors in People in
Scotland said: 'I have not previously come across a workforce that has been
so motivated, committed and enthusiastic.'
The 100 per cent commitment of staff and management has also brought
tangible rewards in the form of new contracts. The key ingredient to such
success is to select the elements that create the right working environment
and to mould and build on them - not just to implement a rigid code that
suffices business needs but does not take account of human requirements.
If the companies involved in your article had truly embraced the principles
of kaizen and chokai, the outcome may might have been different. I encourage
them to try again and invite them to visit our factory to see Oki's
management style in action.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Man in the News: Survivor's techniques - Martin Sorrell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Sorrell's continued tenure as chief executive of WPP Group, the
marketing company, is seen by many in the industry as proof that there is
life after death.
If one refinancing in 1991, due to burgeoning debt, could be put down to bad
luck, a second the following year must look like carelessness. In most other
industries the price for avoiding receivership would have been the chief
executive's head.
Yet Mr Sorrell remained at the helm of WPP while it restructured its
borrowings. And earlier this week he announced that half year pre-tax
profits to the end of June had jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 24.1m.
While Mr Sorrell is the first to admit that WPP is not yet out of the woods
 -it still has borrowings of about Pounds 350m - he can finally see light at
the end of the tunnel. 'And thankfully,' he adds, 'there is no train coming
the wrong way.'
The 48-year-old entrepreneur has avoided the fate of others who allowed
borrowings to get out of hand, partly because creative people are the main
assets of an advertising agency.
But his financial acumen, more than his talent as a copywriter, may have
impressed the syndicate of 28 banks which helped keep his empire intact.
Many in the US agencies Mr Sorrell controls loathe him for the fierce
financial controls he has imposed, including salary cuts.
His survival also owed much to what one friend described as 'the sheer brute
force of his negotiating tactics, which wore the bankers down'. Those who
negotiated with Mr Sorrell over the past few years describe him variously as
'determined', 'desperate to succeed' and 'infuriatingly obstinate'.
According to Mr Sorrell he was 'no hired hand' that could just walk out when
things got difficult. 'I had an enormous amount of emotional involvement; it
was my baby and I wanted it to succeed.'
Mr Sorrell says the bankers were 'sensible enough to understand that to
dispose of businesses would not have helped cash flow in the long term'.
As an only child, Mr Sorrell admits to being used to getting his own way.
His father, who was chief executive of a radio electrical company, gave him
a taste for business. He read economics at Cambridge and went to Harvard
Business School.
Part of his studying was to examine the case of Mr Mark McCormack, the US
lawyer who managed the affairs of sports stars and celebrities. Not content
with studying him, Mr Sorrell ensured that he met him in person.
The two got on well, and after his first job working for Glendinning
Associates of Connecticut, a small agency, Mr Sorrell was offered a job with
Mr McCormack when he opened a London office in 1969. He moved into a London
flat below that of Mr James Gulliver, then running Fine Fare, the
supermarket group, and looking for a personal financial adviser. Mr Sorrell
got the job and became one of the original shareholders when Mr Gulliver
started James Gulliver Associates, which later became the Argyll Group.
Mr Gulliver took a small stake in the advertising company which became
Saatchi and Saatchi. Mr Sorrell found himself giving the Saatchi brothers
corporate financial advice and by 1977 he became their group financial
director.
The Saatchis and Mr Gulliver had started from scratch and by 1985 Mr Sorrell
was ready to emulate them. 'I began to have my male menopause at 40 and I
decided it was time to do something on my own.'
With about Pounds 200,000, half of which he borrowed, he bought an interest
in a small engineering company called Wire and Plastic Products, which made
wire baskets. The object was to gain control of a small quoted company that
could be used as a vehicle for acquiring other businesses.
In 1987, the famous New York-quoted advertising agency of J Walter Thompson
was suffering a lack of strategic direction, losing money and big clients
such as Burger King. WPP bought it for Dollars 525m (Pounds 354.7m). Two
years later, in a contested bid, Mr Sorrell bought Ogilvy &amp; Mather for
Dollars 864m. 'With hindsight we paid too much for Ogilvy &amp; Mather,' admits
Mr Sorrell.
By 1990, the advertising industry was going into recession and WPP's
revenues began to fall. A year later, the company was refinanced but its
difficulties mounted and WPP failed to make scheduled dividend payments.
That triggered a legal clause giving full voting power to owners of
preference shares who found themselves with 78 per cent of the company's
voting rights - forcing a second refinancing.
WPP's bankers do not disagree with Mr Sorrell's view that the deal proved
satisfactory from their viewpoint. In the second refinancing the banks wrote
off Dollars 275m of debt in exchange for 250m new shares, priced at an
average 54p each. Yesterday the shares closed at 96p.
If most of the banks have been placated the same cannot be said of all
institutional shareholders.
Some are angry that Mr Sorrell was given a five-year contract in 1989, which
they regard as too long. Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, has written
to Mr Gordon Stevens, WPP's chairman, to complain.
Mr Sorrell says his terms and conditions were fixed at the behest of some US
institutions and points out that he waived Pounds 111,000 of his Pounds
510,000 salary this year .
At the same time, not all of WPP's investors are convinced that shareholder
interests are best served in the long term by keeping the company together.
WPP's recovery over the past year was based mainly on good performances from
the group's US agencies. Revenues at J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather
rose by 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Neither is represented on
WPP's board, prompting the questions about whether the agencies should be
run separately.
Mr Sorrell says he is sure that keeping WPP's subsidiaries under a holding
company has the effect of increasing total revenues. If WPP is to remain as
one group, Mr Sorrell will have to prove that he can keep profits rising and
convince his backers that his financial prowess remains indispensable.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A dearth of options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE CONSTANT and unremitting theme of the post-war financial world has been
the decline of the personal investor. Year in year out, almost without fail,
the UK personal sector has appeared in the official statistics as a net
disinvestor in company securities. Anonymous investment institutions have
filled the gap, taking their stake in British equities up to two-thirds or
more of the total value of the stock market. Not even the rhetoric of the
Thatcher period, with its emphasis on popular capitalism and privatisation,
was able to change the trend.
Then, last year, came a dramatic, though untrumpeted, volte face. The
private individuals who had sold Pounds 19.8bn, Pounds 7.8bn and Pounds
2.6bn in 1989, 1990 and 1991 respectively, suddenly bought a net Pounds
3.6bn of equities. In the first quarter of this year they added a further
Pounds 835m to their holdings. It looks suspiciously as though the collapse
in the housing market has finally achieved what years of exhortation by Tory
politicians and stock exchange chairmen so signally failed to bring about.
While richer individuals have been flocking back to the stock market,
smaller retail investors have been pouring money into unit trusts. July
alone saw a net Pounds 948m flood into the unit trust managers' coffers,
taking the total for the first seven months of the year to over Pounds 5bn.
That is more than the total cash flow of Britain's pension funds for the
whole of last year - a remarkable reversal of another lengthy trend.
This shift in the balance of power between retail investors and the big
investment institutions is partly a reflection of the traditional hunt for
income at a time when interest rates are plumbing historically low levels.
People have been withdrawing their savings from low-yielding deposit
accounts at banks and building societies and putting them into unit trusts
or shares.
Modest improvement
That pattern is repeated all the way up the investment scale. Within an
overheated equity market higher yielding shares have out-performed for much
of this year as investors have sought protection in income. Elsewhere the
institutions have re-acquired an appetite for commercial property investment
that they lost in the disinflationary 1980s. The big question in all this is
whether the quality of the income compensates for the risk of falling
prices.
By historic standards, the current dividend yield on British equities of 3.7
per cent looks low. Moreover dividends shrank last year in real terms and
look set for only modest improvement this year. This does not, then, look
the time to buy equities for the long term; but note that, after the 1967
devaluation, equities were exceptionally buoyant despite negative dividend
growth. Today the market looks set to bubble away in comparable fashion
until interest rates are perceived to have run their downward course. The
mere fact that equities bounced back to record levels after the Bundesbank
threw a wet towel on the proceedings on Thursday by failing to cut key
interest rates suggests that this bull will take some stopping.
Heavily oversold
In property the long-term position is very different from equities. Despite
the sharp recovery since last year yields are still historically high,
relative to gilts, in a market which had been heavily oversold by the
institutions. The problem for investors is that the excess supply of
property, much of it in the hands of banks, is not all income-producing. The
attraction of a higher yield than in gilts depends on the existence of a
good quality tenant and a long lease with upward-only rent reviews.
Even here, there is a question mark in that underlying rental income
continues to fall while capital values are rising. Many tenants are
committed, under the terms of standard institutional leases, to paying way
over the open market rent. Buyers have to base their judgment on the likely
rent and the potential value of the property in, say, 10, 15 or 20 year
time. If their assumptions about residual values are over-optimistic, the
comparison with gilts is a nonsense.
Nor are gilts immune from questions about the quality of income. For while
gilt yields have been falling, budget deficits across the developed world
have been rising, thereby raising questions about future inflationary
pressures. As the London-based securities firm BZW points out, the debt
overhang cannot be stabilised until real debt yields fall below the likely
trend growth of GDP. Taking British index-linked gilts as a yardstick, real
government bond yields have almost certainly fallen across the Group of
Seven industrialised countries. But even at around 3.3 per cent, they are
still above any plausible growth assumption for the short to medium term,
which means that debt burdens will continue to grow. But if governments do
confront their fiscal problems, economic growth will, paradoxically, be
slower in the next year or two.
Investors, it seems, are making precious little allowance for risk in
equities, gilts and property alike. But that is because, in the hallowed
phrase, they cannot find a better hole.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Overload in the people's car: The costs crisis afflicting VW
stems from the cosseting offered by Germany's social economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems at Volkswagen are as old and as durable as the dear old Beetle
itself. Foremost among them has long been the carmaker's chronic inability
to confront the simple truth: that its costs are too high.
Now, 55 years after the launch of the Beetle phenomenon, in the middle of
the motor industry's worst post-war slump, Ferdinand Piech and Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua are bidding to effect a cure. But while their abilities
are not in doubt, their rough-and-tough methods, and criminal allegations
against Lopez are threatening to destroy dreams that VW can be restored
speedily to full health.
The malaise was apparent back in the 1930s, when Ferdinand Porsche was
developing his pop-eyed rear-engined runabout and when Adolf Hitler was
growing increasingly excited by 'his' Volkswagen: his people's car.
'I have no doubt that the outstanding ability of the designer, and at a
later date the economic acumen of the manufacturers, will make it possible
to make available to the German people cars which are low-priced and cheap
to run, similar to those the American people have enjoyed for a long time,'
Hitler proclaimed at the 1936 Berlin motor show.
As Dan Post, the celebrated Beetle historian, noted *, Mr Schickelgruber
failed to mention that in 1936 an American had to work only 300 hours to buy
a car while a German would have to toil for 800.
The differentials have narrowed, the world has shrunk, and the Volkswagen
concern has ballooned into an international giant since the Wolfsburg works
opened in 1938. In May that year the first 'KdF' (Kraft durch Freude -
Strength through Joy) cars rattled out at a handsome 990 Reichsmarks apiece.
But the dangers inherent in overblown costs have persisted. They were
ignored for years as VW cars first filled the garages of Germans benefiting
from the post-war economic miracle, and later moved off into international
markets as puttering proof of Germany's reputation for engineering
excellence.
Progress through technology, or Vorsprung durch Technik, to borrow a phrase
beloved of Piech, Porsche's grandson, and by a fateful twist, today's
chairman at VW, served the German motor industry well in its youth and
adolescence. But high costs threaten to be the death of it in its maturity,
Piech says.
Piech, former head of Audi, the VW quality car division, and patron of its
Vorsprung durch Technik slogan, took charge of the group in January this
year as it toppled into its worst losses ever. A technical man by training,
he was chosen for the skills he displayed in re-engineering Audi into the
most profitable part of VW. He, in turn, chose another engineer, the
controversial Lopez, formerly General Motors' cost-cutting wizard, to help
him with his work.
Since March, when Lopez arrived shrouded in suspicions of having stolen GM
industrial secrets, the rehabilitation work has been progressing at speed.
The eccentric Basque is said to work from five in the morning to midnight
every day. In less than six months, Piech claims, he discovered and applied
cost-saving methods worth DM700m. But as allegations and evidence mount up,
it appears increasingly unlikely that the dynamic duo will remain together
for long.
Thr group could find a replacement relatively easy for Lopez. There are
plenty of managers who understand and can implement the 'lean' production
and group working methods he uses, but it would be more damaging if Piech
were forced to go. Since he arrived, he has hacked hard at VW's internal
costs structure, its civil service-style bureaucracy, and its cosy
relationships with its mostly German, high-cost components suppliers. He has
also set about cutting its bloated workforce.
While his claims of having DM8.7bn-worth of savings 'in my pocket' do not
bear close inspection, and even he has given up on his earlier claims of
reaching break-even this year, there is ample evidence that the Austrian
engineer is giving VW the shake-out of its life. As Lopez and his team
terrorise components suppliers, Piech is carving into investment plans,
paring every budget to the bone. He is even making a brave show of tackling
over-employment, the single most important cause of the group's malaise.
Since his arrival in January, Piech has announced the shedding of about
20,000 jobs in VW's six German works. But in keeping with post-war
industrial tradition, there is not a single redundancy among them. Natural
wastage and early retirement on generous terms are, as usual, the order of
the day. There is no role for hire-and-fire methods in Germany's social
economy, where even the threat of industrial conflict is anathema.
But Volkswagen is a special case. As a 'new' industry in post-war Germany,
it was cosseted under government control. Based in a traditional Social
Democrat (SDP) stronghold, Lower Saxony, it was an exemplar. It was a pillar
of the social economy: a creator of jobs and wealth in what used to be a
faraway, hard-up corner of West Germany, tucked close against the old East
German border. When Bonn sold off the last 16 per cent of its holding in
1988, commentators cheered: at last action would be taken to reduce VW's
cost base, they said. At the time, VW's profit margin was exactly one third
that of its main European competitors.
'I don't know of a single example where a company has lost the government as
a shareholder where it hasn't led to fundamental change,' one analysts wrote
at the time.
But the commentators appeared to have forgotten the 20 per cent holding left
under the control of the Lower Saxony government. The state authorities,
today wearing the red and green colours of an SPD/Green party coalition,
together with worker representatives on the company's board of supervisors,
still control VW's fate.
As a result, Volkswagen has continued until now to be managed more in the
style of a social security office than a commercial concern. It has fired
workers only once in its entire history. Even today, its in-house pay
agreement is the most generous in the German car industry. Two weeks ago,
seeking to shave another 3,000 jobs from its domestic payroll, the
management offered an extraordinary deal, allowing employees to retire at 55
on 90 per cent of their net income until the normal retirement age of 60.
In an industry where labour costs account for 70 per cent of the total cost
of a typical vehicle, according to the VDA automotive industry association,
the workforce is the single most important source of potential economies. VW
calculates that its latest early retirement package should bring the number
employed in its six domestic plants to about 100,000. Industry observers,
given to understand that the desired target is 80,000, are puzzled.
Times may be desperate, but even hard men such as Piech and Lopez would have
no hope of gaining the assent of their labour-oriented supervisory board to
job losses on such a scale within the two years they have given themselves
to turn the company around. Accordingly they have gone about their other
cost-saving activities with sometimes alarming vigour.
But the fact that they were put in charge, and that Piech won agreement to
his first phase of job cuts, reflects the new chairman's powers of
persuasion and the Lower Saxony government's belated acceptance that
fundamental change is needed if VW is to prosper in Europe's single market
and in an increasingly liberalised global economy.
Now, several years behind innovative, privately-controlled companies such as
BMW, and at least two years behind most other German industrial groups,
where task-master bankers hold large stakes, sit on supervisory boards and
hold the whip hand over management, the duo has set about a crash cure.
There is no time for niceties, they say. Without drastic action now, says
Lopez, the Japanese will colonise European industry and 'become our
landlords'. For Piech the issue is the 'survival' of Germany's
second-biggest industrial concern.
Both arguments are deliberately pitched to disseminate fear and prepare the
ground - in the supervisory board and the workforce - for their Blitzkrieg
tactics. But they have signally failed to convince the watchers beyond the
borders of Lower Saxony.
The Austrian Piech and the Spaniard Lopez appear to have overlooked that
change on the scale they demand, especially in Germany's conservative
business culture, requires management, not force. They have also to remember
that the ground rules of a social economy demand consensus, not coercion,
and not just with a company's own workforce and supervisors.
While Lopez's purchasing department 'warriors' are allegedly dashing around,
tearing up component suppliers' contracts and demanding instant price cuts
on pain of loss of contracts, more conventional managers are pursuing
similar ends through dissimilar means. Proceeding according to the tiresome
but tested principle that co-operation is preferable to confrontation in
Germany, business competitors in the motor sector and other industries are
negotiating their way to improved competitiveness, at a gentler pace. Most
important, they are operating out of public earshot.
However great VW's difficulties and however inspired the new management may
be, a director at one competitor says its methods are unacceptable. The fact
that Volkswagen is so large, so well-known and seen internationally as a
flagship of German industry, makes 'this bullying' all the more
reprehensible, he adds.
VW, Germany's most persuasive argument for privatisation, is also its most
suitable case for treatment. But as its supervisory board appears to have
realised, with recent hints that Lopez may have to go, the malaise
afflicting it is an indigenous German ailment which demands German therapy
for an effective and lasting cure.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Little-known winners share the LWT corporate jackpot: Rachel
Johnson on the 54 people who will become rich by virtue of the
golden-handcuff scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 16 top executives at London Weekend Television who will become paper
millionaires next week as a reward for investing in a Pounds 3m
golden-handcuffs scheme before the 1991 franchise auction will not be the
only people feeling prosperous at the company.
Leaving aside the 16 - who include such well-known names as Sir Christopher
Bland, chairman; Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive; and Mr Melvyn Bragg, arts
controller and presenter of the South Bank Show - there are plenty of
lesser-known winners of LWT's corporate jackpot, making a total of 54. All
those who benefitted from the scheme were in management at some level, but
why were they so richly rewarded?
Those who left LWT before Sir Christopher Bland dreamt up the golden
handcuffs scheme, or were not senior enough to participate in it, struggle
to give even-handed replies.
Mr Anwer Bati, a freelance producer who worked at LWT in the early 1980s,
gulped at the thought of a former colleague, Mr Robin Paxton, being worth
Pounds 2m. 'They were in the right jobs at the right time, so lucky them,'
he said.
He added: 'It's not that they were in dire danger of being headhunted, but
the station needed to convince the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Authority)
that the people behind its star programmes would not be headhunted by
rivals. Take Barry Cox (director of corporate affairs). He's a very nice
guy, was an ordinary programme maker. Now he's worth Pounds 1.5m.'
The scope of the scheme has penetrated some surprising corners. Mr Paul
Gibson is a classic example - an unknown manager on the technical side of
LWT's operations, he is one of nine investors who have ended up with
shareholdings worth Pounds 915,000 each.
Mr Gibson is LWT's group systems controller, in charge of all corporate
information technology, airtime bookings and production bookings. His past
experience includes time as a senior systems analyst at Lyons and Tesco, the
food retailers. He would not comment on his participation in the share
scheme nor why he was chosen for it.
According to Korn Ferry, the media headhunters, Mr Gibson's job at LWT would
involve extensive responsibilities and probably command a salary of about
Pounds 70,000. 'But he wouldn't be all that hard to replace,' Korn Ferry
said yesterday.
LWT says the 54 managers are justly reaping the reward of their loyalty in
1989.
At a time when it was not clear whether Carlton Communications, chaired by
Mr Michael Green, would compete for the London weekend franchise, they took
a risk by putting their own money, sometimes borrowed, into LWT.
Mr Peter Coppock, head of press relations at LWT, was keen to put this side
of tale of the 'telly millionaires'.
He was offered 18,028 shares at 83p, and made 'no small investment' of
Pounds 15,000. But he did not know until the franchise was renewed that he
had made money rather than lost it. 'For a long time the share price was 65p
and it was brown-trouser time,' he recalled. 'It's easy enough now the share
price is 470p to say it was a cushy investment but it didn't feel like that
at the time.'
Mr Coppock's investment is now worth Pounds 342,991 - 22 times its original
value. He said that a shareholding this size is the norm - and that only the
16 top managers became millionaires overnight.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Mutual assurers 'in survival fight'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONAL life offices the mutual assurance companies owned by their
policyholders - will have to fight competition from banks and building
societies to survive, a report to be published next week says.
Life Assurance 1993, to be published on Friday by Mintel, the market
analysts, says the life assurance market has become overcrowded both with
new domestic players, such as the recently established insurance arms of
some banks and building societies, and with foreign companies entering the
market.
This has led to pacts, such as the exclusive distribution deal between
Halifax, the largest UK building society, and Standard Life. It has also
resulted in foreign buy-outs such as the purchase of Equity &amp; Law by Axa,
the French insurance group.
The link-up between life offices and banks and building societies benefits
both partners. The life office gains a valuable distribution channel while
the banks and building societies earn commission for the sale of life
products.
Mr Paul Hersey, senior finance analyst for Mintel, remarked: 'The mutuals
are disappearing slowly. The traditional medium-size Scottish offices are
coming under attack . . . The traditional composites will also suffer unless
they make a firm decision regarding which segment of the market they want to
target.'
The survey also reports that the independent financial adviser is winning
the confidence of clients. People are less prepared to return to their bank
manager for further financial advice, it says. In 1991, 34 per cent of those
who sought financial advice in the previous 12 months said they would go
back to the bank manager, but of those who sought advice in the previous 12
months this year that figure declined to 26 per cent.
Yet 17 per cent would return to their independent adviser for further
advice, compared with 13 per cent in 1991.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Switch trend hits insurers: Customers more likely to shop
around as premiums increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS ARE increasingly likely to shop around for cheaper insurance
policies in the face of rising premiums, a survey says today.
The number of people switching to another insurer almost doubled between
September 1991 and March this year, from 1m to nearly 2m, NOP Corporate &amp;
Financial, the market research company, says in the survey.
NOP, whose survey is based on interviews with 30,000 people, says sharp
increases in premium rates had been the biggest factor.
Rises in premiums for motor and household policies averaged 20 per cent a
year in 1991 and 1992, but many policyholders have faced much greater
increases as companies have changed the way they rate risks.
Some householders living in areas judged to be prone to subsidence or storm
damage have faced increases of more than 100 per cent. Drivers of faster or
fashionable cars, which are more likely to be stolen, as well as younger
drivers who tend to have more accidents, have been hit by steep increases.
Different insurance companies often rate the same risk in a different way,
with correspondingly wide variations in quotes.
A random sample of six risks by SelectDirect, a telephone-based company
jointly owned by Rollins Hudig Hall, the insurance broker, and General
Accident, the composite insurer, showed variations of more than 100 per
cent.
Mr Peter Friend, managing director of SelectDirect, said that the
differences reflected the limitations of the data available to insurers.
Decisions are often taken on the basis of claims to the insurance company
rather than market-wide figures.
Mr Friend added: 'Every underwriter believes he is right. The fact is that
at the end of the day they all make different decisions because they have
all got partial information.'
Policyholders who switch their household cover tend to be younger and from
the ABC1 social classes, with the C1 group being most likely to switch, the
survey says. In the motor insurance market switchers tend to be very young
and from the C2DE social classes.
Londoners are most likely to switch their policy in the household markets,
while those in the Midlands and Wales are the most likely to change motor
insurer. The survey adds that women are more likely to switch household
policies, while men are more likely to switch their motor insurance policy.
Most policyholders are still unlikely to change their cover. The survey
shows that 60 per cent of household policyholders and 39 per cent of motor
policyholders were unlikely to seek alternative cover.
Ms Heather McAdam, NOP director, said: 'There is still an awful lot of
inertia in the marketplace.'
The Consumers' Association, which has accused insurance companies of
charging their customers for past mistakes, welcomed the trend.
Mr Roger Taylor, a senior researcher, said: 'It's excellent news. We have
been saying for some time that some insurance companies are charging
outrageous premiums and our advice has always been that people should shop
around.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Top athletes compete for medals and sponsorship gold:
Following victory at the World Championships, Christie, Gunnell and Jackson
look set to break earnings records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH ATHLETICS goes into its end-of-season meeting at Sheffield tomorrow
trying to work out how to build on the successes of last week's World
Championships in Stuttgart. There Linford Christie won the 100m in the
second-fastest time ever and Colin Jackson, in the 110m hurdles, and Sally
Gunnell in the 400m hurdles, both broke world records.
The plan being considered by the British Athletics Federation is to put
Britain's top 50 to 75 athletes under contract. The idea is that British
athletes will commit themselves to supporting federation events and in
return will receive some guaranteed income, medical screening and medical
insurance.
Mr David Bedford, honorary secretary of the BAF, said that the principle had
been agreed for some time and now the federation was discussing the
practicalities of the scheme.
Britain's world champions are in demand at all the big grand prix meetings
around Europe. But for many British athletes the eight or nine domestic
televised meetings a year controlled by the federation represent the largest
chunk of their incomes.
The federation scheme is regarded with scepticism in some quarters. Fatima
Whitbread, the former javelin world champion and world record holder, said:
'I don't know where they are going to get the money from. All the athletes
had a good laugh. Athletes are individuals, most do not want to be tied
down.'
She said athletes wanted to be able to tinker with their competition
schedules throughout the season to make sure they peaked for the big events,
such as the World Championships and the Olympics. These events do not pay
appearance money, but provide the prestige which increases earnings.
Whitbread is president of a promotional club, the Chafford Hundred, which
she founded with Christie and Jackson to promote athletes. British athletes
who wear the logo of Lucozade, the soft drink, are part of the club's
multi-year deal with SmithKline Beecham which Whitbread says is worth Pounds
1m.
So what is the earnings potential of the UK's top track and field stars?
Christie earns far more than any other British athlete. His earnings leapt
after he won the 100m in the Barcelona Olympics last year and he can expect
another spurt in his income after his win in Stuttgart.
Even so he is still behind Britain's top soccer players and a long way below
the world's best-paid boxers, golfers and tennis and basketball players.
Gunnell is the next highest-paid British athlete and Jackson should reach
her level after finally winning a big championship.
Below them is a small group of well-paid runners, but the rest of the
British team, even some who reached finals in Stuttgart, are struggling to
get by.
Gunnell has complained about the disparity between her race fees and
Christie's, arguing that she is a world record holder while Christie is not.
One newspaper estimated that the British men's 100m relay team of Christie,
Jackson and two individual silver medallists, Tony Jarrett and John Regis,
which finished second to the US in Stuttgart, is worth Pounds 2.2m while the
women's 400m team, which Gunnell anchored to a bronze medal, is worth Pounds
880,000.
One leading promoter said: 'The only one of those who earns anything other
than a living wage is Sally and I would be flabbergasted if she earnt that
much (close to Pounds 800,000).'
Athletes' incomes come chiefly from fees and prize money for races, and
sponsorship and endorsement deals. The biggest sponsors are sportswear
companies. Christie has a long association with Puma, the German sportswear
manufacturer. Gunnell has a contract with Mizuno, the Japanese company.
But even athletes of this stature are not secure. Last year Jackson, who is
now with Puma, was dropped by Puma's great German rival, Adidas. Paul
Magner, sport manager (running) for Adidas UK, said the company decided to
concentrate on road running and training shoes because, while sprinters such
as Jackson offer marketing spin-offs, the market for running spikes is
small.
The jewel in Adidas's crown is an athlete who no longer competes: the former
decathlon Olympic champion Daley Thompson. Thompson is now a television
pundit.
'We got excellent coverage from Daley appearing on the BBC in branded
clothing,' said Mr Magner.
Among competing athletes the next level is represented by young runners with
potential such as Curtis Robb, 21, who finished fourth in the 800m in
Stuttgart. After Robb reached the Olympic final last summer he was, said one
observer, the subject of a 'bidding war'.
He ended up with a contract worth Pounds 20,000 a year for four years from
Nike. Mr Simon Taylor of Nike UK said Robb was also part of Nike's global
bonus structure which rewards performances in everything from national
championships to Olympic Games.
The real problem is that athletics is a poor draw in the US, the world's
biggest market. Athletics earnings pale alongside Nike's contracts with
tennis player Andre Agassi and basketball stars Michael Jordan and Alonzo
Mourning. Jordan's contract is worth an estimated Dollars 20m (Pounds
13.5m), while Mourning's is put at Dollars 16m for five years.
The runners therefore still have a long way to go. But, as Whitbread said:
'It does not matter how many gold medals you win, there is only so much
money in the pot.'
Linford Christie, Olympic and world 100 metres champion, is paid about
Pounds 30,000 per race - a little more for some big European grand prix
events - and runs in up to 20 meetings a year. He and American Carl Lewis
were recently paid Pounds 100,000 each to race at Gateshead. These are
almost certainly the highest appearance fees ever paid to an athlete.
Christie has a contract worth a basic Pounds 60,000 with footwear company
Puma. Industry estimates suggest that, including bonuses, this contract will
earn him more than Pounds 200,000 this year. He also has a Pounds
100,000-a-year contract with Lucozade and can command Pounds 5,000 for a
personal appearance. These are limited by training, racing and commitments
to leading sponsors.
Sally Gunnell, Olympic and world 400 metres hurdles champion, has a contract
with the Mizuno shoe company worth Pounds 220,000 over three years. Her race
fee is Pounds 20,000 and personal appearance fee is Pounds 3,000.
Colin Jackson's race fee is Pounds 10,000. But that will rise following his
victory and world record in the 110 metres hurdles at the World
Championships in Stuttgart. His personal appearance fee is Pounds 3,000.

<TEXT>
MR PETER HAIN, secretary of the Tribune group of Labour MPs, yesterday
claimed that some voters no longer knew what the party stood for, as it had
got rid of so many policies since the general election.
The party's main weakness, he said, was its failure to provide a credible
economic alternative to the government's policies.
The MP's comments followed a survey by MORI in yesterday's Times newspaper,
showing support for Labour at its lowest level since Mr John Smith became
party leader.
At 42 per cent in the poll, however, Labour is still 14 percentage points
ahead of the Conservatives.

<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT schools improved their A-level performance this year by 2.2 per
cent, according to figures from the Independent Schools Information Service,
John Authers writes.
Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the strongest results have again
come from big-city, single-sex day schools. Most of the top 20 schools have
shown remarkable consistency over the past six years.
St Paul's School in Barnes, south-west London, finished first. In terms of
the points system used to judge A-level results, its average score per pupil
was 29.4. A score of 30 would be equivalent to three A grades.
The highest-placed fully co-educational school was Leicester Grammar, at
29th.

FT  28 AUG 93 / British Coal fails to find takers for four pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of saving four pits no longer required by British Coal finally ended
yesterday when it emerged that an invitation to private-sector operators to
mine them had produced no takers.
The disclosure will disappoint the government which is already struggling to
find a way of providing a future for another 30 mines still operated by
British Coal.
Further closures among the 30, which include 11 reprieved by the government
in March, are considered inevitable by British Coal following a
steeper-than-expected decline in the coal market.
With a strong political reaction to future closures likely, ministers want
the private sector to take over as many as possible of the 19 pits already
declared surplus to requirements by British Coal.
British Coal has been advertising the 19 pits in tranches of four and five.
In the latest tranche - the third - private-sector companies were offered
five pits. Just one, Trentham, near Stoke-on-Trent, was the subject of a bid
that involves mining.
The bidder's identity was not disclosed by British Coal yesterday, but it is
thought to be Mr Malcolm Edwards, the corporation's former marketing
director.
Vane Tempest in County Durham, another of the five in the tranche, also
attracted some bids. However, they involved proposed activities on the
colliery surfaces.
The other three pits in the third tranche, Grimethorpe and Houghton Main, in
South Yorkshire, and Westoe, in Tyne and Wear, attracted no offers for the
final stage of the process in which bidders had to provide a Pounds 50,000
bond.
British Coal is likely to move quickly to seal the four pits which are no
longer wanted as mines, although local union officials will have to be
consulted.
Together the four employed more than 3,500 miners when mining ceased.
British Coal has now closed the bidding deadline for 14 of the 19 pits it no
longer wants to mine. It has received 17 tenders in all for 10 of them but
four pits have attracted no interest - the three disclosed yesterday
together with Bolsover in Derbyshire.
In addition three pits - Cotgrave and Silverhill, in Nottinghamshire, and
Vane Tempest - are the subject of bids that involve use of surface assets
only.
Another five mines have still to go out to tender. These are Shirebrook in
Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Glamorgan, Coventry near Coventry city,
Parkside in Merseyside, and Sharlston in West Yorkshire. Coal analysts
believe it is unlikely that mining will be resumed at more than six of 19
pits which have been closed by British Coal.
British Coal yesterday closed its north-east headquarters in Sunderland. The
office, where 45 people were employed, was considered unnecessary with just
two working pits left in the region which once employed 150,000 miners at
more than 100 pits. The corporation will administer its north-east
operations from Nottingham.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Bottomley warns troubled hospitals to cuts costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS VIRGINIA BOTTOMLEY, the health secretary, yesterday warned two London
hospitals to cut costs after they ran into funding difficulties just five
months into the financial year.
The Department of Health last night confirmed that four other hospitals in
the capital - the Royal London, the Royal Orthopaedic, the Royal Ear Nose
and Throat and the Havering - have been asked to cut back on some non-urgent
operations.
Mrs Bottomley's warning to University College Hospital - one of the
capital's biggest teaching hospitals - and Middlesex Hospital underlined the
government's intention to take a firm stand against inner-city hospitals
which fail to bring their spending into line with contractual obligations.
UCH and Middlesex Hospital, both part of the UCL Trust, have been forced to
stop carrying out routine operations after exceeding targets imposed by
Camden and Islington Health Authority.
The hospitals had treated 500 patients too many, putting them 21 per cent
over budget by the end of June. Ms Alyson MacRae, the health authority
manager, said the hospitals had over-performed on their Pounds 26m contract.
She said: 'If they were allowed to treat everyone on the waiting list as
they wanted to, the contract would be used up, leaving no more funds for the
urgent cases. We took this action so that they did not treat too many people
on the waiting list too fast.' The authority had no contingency or reserve
funds for hospitals that exceeded their contracts.
The health authority said that it was monitoring non-urgent cases 'very
closely' at St Bartholomew's Hospital with which it also has a contract.
Individual cases were being referred to the authority for approval.
UCH, like many of the large inner-city teaching hospitals, has seen demand
for its services dwindle as shire health authorities, which used to refer
patients, started to use local hospitals under the contracting system.
A spokesman for UCH and Middlesex Hospital admitted that management might
not have faced up to financial pressures quickly enough. He said the
hospitals had known that the contract could not cover the expected number of
patients based on previous years, but managers had hoped that more money
could be made available.
The hospitals now plan to shed between 20 and 30 consultants' posts and up
to 40 non-medical staff as part of a cost-cutting exercise designed to save
Pounds 10m this year, he said.
Ms MacRae said: 'They have not responded quickly to the market situation.'
The authority had no contingency or reserve funds for hospitals that
exceeded their contracts.
Mrs Bottomley said costs of treatment at the hospitals were high compared
with The Royal Free or St. Mary's, two other London hospitals. 'For every
two patients treated at UCH and Middlesex and Bart's more than three could
be treated at the other hospitals.'
Mr Geoff Martin, campaigns director of London Health Emergency, a pressure
group backed by Labour-controlled local authorities, warned that similar
cuts could happen elsewhere in London and in other large urban areas.
He said: 'We know of other health authorities in London with similar
financial problems. We are in a situation where before Christmas we could
have a blanket ban on non-emergency operations across the whole of inner
London.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Stores defend credit card interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORE GROUPS accused this week by Labour of charging allegedly extortionate
credit-card interest rates claim there are good reasons for higher rates
than those levied by bank credit cards.
Ms Elizabeth Stanton, director of the Retail Credit Group, which represents
large retailers who offer credit, said that the average amount outstanding
on store cards, at Pounds 163, was far less than the Pounds 420 typical of
bank credit cards. Stores had to recoup their fixed costs over this smaller
sum which was why rates were higher.
Furthermore, holders of store cards often benefited from special offers  -
such as discounts on goods - not available to holders of other credit cards.
Also, those who paid their card accounts in full each month did not pay
interest.
The Retail Credit Group says that while sales on credit rose 11.5 per cent
year-on-year in the first quarter of this year, the amount of outstanding
balances fell 11 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn.
Labour said on Thursday that the average margin over base rate charged on
store cards had risen from 18 per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent.
Labour said the most expensive store credit card was operated by Dixons,
which charges 34.4 per cent to customers who do not pay their accounts by
direct debit.
Store cards represent only a small part of the consumer credit market. The
total value of store-card transactions last year was Pounds 3.2bn, a survey
by Datamonitor, a market-research group, found. This represents only 10 per
cent of other credit cards.
A few store groups dominate the market. According to Datamonitor the Marks
and Spencer card accounts for almost a third of all consumer store-card
expenditure.
It adds that John Lewis, the Burton Group and the House of Fraser account
for another 41 per cent.
Cards are attractive to store groups because they encourage customer loyalty
and provide valuable marketing information. A store group such as Marks and
Spencer, which does not accept other credit cards, will save substantially
on the fees it would otherwise have paid to credit-card companies.
Nevertheless, the costs of running a store-card operation caused several
retailers in the late 1980s and early 1990s to sell their credit-card
operations to outside organisations who could run the business more cheaply.
GE Capital, for example, bought the card operation of the Burton Group. And
retailers have had limited success in selling other financial services to
their card-holding customers.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Struggling Group Lotus finds Italian saviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER of Group Lotus by Bugatti brings together two of the most
famous motor racing names of the pre-war and post-war eras.
Ettore Bugatti, the Italian creator of some of the world's most beautiful
classic cars, died in 1947, and his car factory in France had already ceased
production by the early 1950s in the aftermath of the war.
In the UK Colin Chapman, the Group Lotus founder and one of the most
creative and successful designers of racing cars, started his business in
the early 1950s. His company has had a chequered history and never achieved
a financial strength to match its success on the grand prix racing circuits.
Group Lotus struggled to survive both before and after Chapman's death in
1982. It has proved to be none too secure in the hands of General Motors
since 1986, and last year recorded a a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m on a
turnover of Pounds 60.98m.
General Motors was forced to put in Pounds 18m to repair the battered Lotus
balance sheet in 1991, and the reverses convinced the giant carmaker that it
had neither the desire nor the management resources to cope with such a
small and specialised business.
Group Lotus losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in
1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990, Pounds 14.7m in 1991 and the record Pounds 36.6m
last year.
However, in the past 12 months General Motors has been restructuring the
business to ready it for disposal.
Following the demise of the Elan sports car, Group Lotus has limited
production to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is
planning to build 350 this year. The workforce has been cut from 1,717 in
1990 to about 700 - a total of 500 in engineering and 200 in car production.
Now the latest saviour has come from Italy in the shape of entrepreneur and
life-time Bugatti lover Mr Romano Artioli, who holds an 18 per cent stake in
Bugatti Automobili.
He has recreated the Bugatti marque - supported by unnamed financial backers
in the European automotive components industry - both as a maker of exotic
and expensive cars and as a designer label for exotic and expensive fashion
items, from sunglasses to table-ware.
The first car of the new Bugatti company, created in 1987, was the EB110
supercar unveiled early last year with a mid-mounted 550 bhp V12 engine,
carbon-fibre chassis and four-wheel drive. Production began in December and
47 have been delivered to date.
Bugatti Automobili is based at Campogalliano near Modena, not far from the
homes of Ferrari and Lamborghini.
Mr Artioli was at one time a Ferrari dealer and is now the Suzuki
distributor in Italy, but Bugatti has been his passion for 40 years.
His campaign to revive the marque began in 1987 when he negotiated with the
French government for the rights to the Bugatti name and badge.
Ettore Bugatti was born in Italy, but the cars that made him famous were
produced in Molsheim in the Alsace region of France. After his death the
factory was taken over by Hispano-Suiza which eventually became part of
Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group.
The Bugatti holding company is registered in Luxembourg and its shareholders
remain anonymous. Some big corporations have co-operated in developing the
EB110, however, including Aerospatiale, which produces the carbon-fibre
monocoque chassis.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Sugar in move to block Venables
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, has launched a court move to
'strike out' a legal attempt by Mr Terry Venables to seize control of the
football club.
Mr Sugar says Mr Venables, the club's former chief executive, should be
blocked from pursuing his action because he has still not paid the Pounds
300,000 'security for costs' demanded by the High Court as a condition of
being allowed to continue with the case.
The payment, ordered on July 29, was due by August 19. The deadline was not
met and Mr Sugar is to apply on September 13 for a court order striking out
the action.
Mr Venables has already made an application for extra time to pay the money
 -but that plea is not due to be heard until October.
Yesterday Mr Justice Lindsay granted Mr Sugar's lawyers an order for
production of official transcripts of the July 29 hearing for use in the
strike-out move.
Mr David Mabb, counsel for Mr Sugar, his holding company Amshold and
Tottenham Hotspur, said it was 'somewhat curious' that Mr Venables' plea for
extra time was scheduled for October - well beyond the 21-day extension he
was seeking. Mr Sugar issued the strike-out application after failing to
obtain an explanation from Mr Venables' solicitors as to the basis of the
plea for more time.

FT  28 AUG 93 / In-house bid advice for civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVANTS have been given advice on how to improve their chances of
keeping their jobs when government departments face competition from the
private sector.
Detailed advice on how to prepare an in-house bid has been included in the
revised guidance on the market-testing programme, which was published
yesterday by the Office of Public Service and Science.
The new guidelines reflect experience since last autumn, when Mr William
Waldegrave, the public services minister, announced a programme to test
whether some Pounds 1.5bn of government activities would be performed more
efficiently by officials or by the private sector.
Officials in Mr Waldegrave's department admit privately that not all
departments will meet the market-testing targets set for the end of
September, but say that delays arise merely from the necessary procedures
rather than a lack of enthusiasm. They emphasise that departments which fail
to achieve the targets by the deadline will be expected to meet them in the
following months. This is in addition to proceeding with the next tranche of
the programme which starts in October and is intended to cover a further
Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn of government activities.
Earlier this summer Mr Waldegrave had to call on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to put pressure on departments that were falling behind in the
programme.
The guidance was revised after discussions with departments and Civil
Service unions, and also takes account of private-sector suggestions.
It does not include a revision of advice to departments on the impact of
regulations designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and
mergers. This will be updated as case law develops.
The application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations, which guarantee the jobs and pay of existing workers in many
cases when work is contracted out, has caused some confusion in Whitehall.

CHINA has jailed one of its best-known businessmen for 20 years for
obstructing justice. Mr Yu Zuomin, former chairman of the board of an
entrepreneurial village near Tianjin, had been held up as a national model
of the new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs until he fell from grace, writes
Tony Walker from Beijing.
Mr Yu's sentence coincided with the passing of death sentences in Beijing
against four officials, including one from the Bank of China, for
corruption.
China launched a drive this week to root out corrupt officials whose
activities had been fuelled by the economic boom. The execution of several
hapless individuals had been expected. Chinese describe this process as
'killing a chicken to frighten a monkey', meaning that lesser officials are
being dealt with severely as an example to more senior cadres.
Mr Yu of Daqiu village near Tianjin, which had become something of a
national entrepreneurial shrine, was found guilty of harbouring criminals,
obstructing justice, bribery, unlawful detention and unlawful control of
people.
Mr Yu's arrest followed the beating to death of a worker in his village, and
his attempts to cover up the crime.
Beijing yesterday threatened to reconsider its commitment to a key
international missile control agreement in a furious protest against a US
ban on the export of high-technology items to China.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Nigeria's oil workers set to strike: Challenge to legitimacy
of new government

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened yesterday as oil workers prepared to
strike and the winner of the annulled presidential election promised to form
a rival government.
Oil workers are challenging the legitimacy of the country's
military-installed government with an indefinite strike starting today that
could seriously disrupt the vital petroleum industry, which accounts for
more than 90 per cent of export earnings.
Nupeng, the oil workers' union, called the strike to demand a democratically
elected government based on the June 12 presidential election, annulled by
Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the military leader who quit office on Thursday.
The unofficial winner of the election, Chief Moshood Abiola, yesterday
dismissed the appointment of an interim government headed by Mr Ernest
Shonekan as 'a non-event', and said the new council 'represents nobody but
Ibrahim Babangida and a small clique'.
'By the end of next week I will be in Lagos,' he said in London. 'It will be
a real government I will form.'
Mr Clement Akpamgbo, justice minister in the interim council installed on
Thursday, said such a move would be treated as 'insurrection'.
However,the pressing concern in Lagos yesterday was the impending strike.
Oil executives said it could close refineries and disrupt distribution to
petrol stations. But they said essential services, including the production
of crude and loading tankers, could be maintained by supervisors.
The strike was expected to exacerbate the severe fuel shortage that has
brought Lagos and southern Nigeria, the country's economic heartland, to a
virtual standstill.
Lagos was deserted yesterday on the third day of a stay-at-home protest
organised by pro-democracy activists. But in the north, Nigerians seemed
more inclined to accept the new administration.
Secrecy still surrounds the mandate of the new government, which was hastily
put together by Gen Babangida when a bid to extend his strongman rule was
blocked by fellow officers.
Nigerians have not yet been told how long this 'interim national government'
will remain in office. In a country propelled by rumours, speculation is
that Chief Shonekan will call fresh elections within nine months.
Gen Babangida appears to have overlooked the naming of a new head of state -
a post he was presumably keeping for himself. The post of commander-in-chief
of the armed forces is also vacant following Gen Babangida's forced
retirement on Thursday.
Chief Shonekan's 32-member cabinet, which included representatives from each
of Nigeria's 30 states, was sworn in yesterday.
Nigerians in the Moslem north, which has traditionally held the reins of
political power, appeared satisfied with the new regime.
In Lagos, however, several businessmen were scathing about the calibre of
Chief Shonekan's team and doubted his ability to reverse Nigeria's economic
decline.

AFTER a campaign remarkable only for its lack of political vigour, Singapore
goes to the polls today to elect a president.
Mr Ong Teng Cheong, a leading light in the governing People's Action Party
(PAP), who resigned as deputy prime minister to run for president, is
favourite to become Singapore's first elected president. Mr Ong is opposed
by Mr Chua Kim Yeow, a former banker and senior government official.
Two critics of the government were declared ineligible to stand for
president under a law which, in effect, rules out all but senior members of
Singapore's establishment.
Both Mr Ong and Mr Chua have led low-key campaigns which have generated
little excitement. In a final televised election address, Mr Ong rejected
criticism that he would be a tool of the PAP as president. 'Some people
still ask if my long association with the PAP will stop me from acting
independently,' said Mr Ong. 'The answer is No. My loyalty, first and
foremost, is to the people of Singapore.'
Mr Chua has shyly admitted that he was pressured into standing for president
because the government wanted a contest. But Mr Chua did cause a small
political spark in his election address by saying that the absence of an
effective opposition in Singapore was worrying many people.
'The PAP dominates the government and the legislature,' said Mr Chua. 'Do
you want the PAP to dominate the presidency as well?'
Singapore's new president will have some executive powers, including a veto
on government spending of the country's USDollars 46bn reserves.

FT  28 AUG 93 / BAe signs deal with Taiwan for regional jet aircraft
venture: The last minute drama in negotiations to put new life into a
loss-making enterprise
</HEADLINE>

BRITISH Aerospace yesterday signed an agreement with Taiwanese officials on
the financial structure of a proposed joint venture to build regional jet
aircraft.
The deal came on the fifth day of intensive talks between a team led by Mr
John Cahill, BAe's chairman, and Taiwanese bankers, politicians and
industrialists.
The venture marks a breakthrough for Mr Cahill's strategy to improve BAe's
profitability. The RJ series of aircraft that the joint venture will build
partly in Taiwan currently loses money for BAe.
The turning point in the tough negotiations came on Wednesday when Mr Cahill
and Mr Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of Taiwan's state owned Chiao Tung Bank,
initialled a draft financial structure for the venture, called Avro
International Aerospace. They then sent that draft on its tortuous journey
through a series of politicians and bank officials who needed to give their
approval.
The final stage, a nod from Mr Lien Chan, Taiwan's prime minister, came
yesterday. The agreement was signed by Mr Cahill, Mr Liang and Mr Hou
Chun-hsiung, chairman of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), BAe' s
manufacturing partner in the venture.
It marked the end of a tough week for both sides. Taiwan's top bankers and
politicians - professions which sometimes overlap in Taiwan - had just
emerged from a turbulent congress of the ruling party, the Kuomintang. Mr
Cahill and Mr Charles Masefield, president of BAe's Regional Jet division,
had cut short summer holidays at the weekend to fly in from the US and
Europe respectively.
A hectic series of meetings began at 7am on Monday morning. For the next
two-and-a-half days, BAe's five-strong team visited lawyers, bankers,
politicians and industrialists in their offices dotted about Taipei.
The talks were essentially over fears within the Taiwanese banking
consortium planning to lend money to Avro that the venture was too risky.
These fears were based on the knowledge that the RJ series of aircraft that
Avro would build partly in Taiwan had lost money for BAe.
There were also concerns that an associated aircraft leasing company would
suffer a repeat of troubles experienced by western aircraft leasing
companies such as GPA.
However, the agreement involves an effective Taiwan government guarantee of
loans to Avro. BAe also agreed that the leasing facility of substantially
more than Dollars 250m would only be tapped when firm orders for the
aircraft came in.
There was little inkling last January when the original contract was signed
that there lay ahead a gruelling struggle to convince Taiwanese banks to
lend to Avro. It was almost three months after the January signing of the
contracts that problems began to emerge. Mr Hou of TAC fell seriously ill
and was unable to work for more than three months.
US-educated Mr Denny Ko, TAC'S president, was left in control of the
company. But he had come from a US corporate environment, having worked for
Los Angeles aerospace company TRW and run his own company in California. By
his own admission, he found the transition more difficult than he had
expected.
Relations between TAC and the consortium of banks slated to lend money to
Avro began to deteriorate. By midsummer, the government stepped in to save
the deal from collapse.
At the end of July in an attempt to improve the banks' confidence in the
deal, the government officially backed Avro. But it was not enough and talks
between middle-ranking UK and Taiwanese negotiating teams in Taiwan stalled.
This triggered a series of exchanges between Mr Cahill and senior Taiwanese
politicians that culminated last weekend in the arrival from various
continents of BAe's top management. In spite of yesterday's signing,
compromises have yet to be worked out on some of the non-financial
conditions.
These differences, and the incorporation of the Chaio Tung Bank into
existing contractual arrangements between BAe and TAC, are to be completed
at meetings in London on September 6.
After that, the way should be clear for Taiwan to begin working on RJs in
the spring of 1994.
At BAe it is a lifeline for the RJ programme, which began life in the late
1970s as the BAe 146. Its early days were dogged with technical difficulties
and the company struggled to improve the reliability of the aircraft.
By 1991, reliability had reached international standards, but competition
from the likes of Dutch company Fokker, and a growing recession, didn't help
sales.
At the start of 1992, therefore, BAe decided to seek international partners,
hitting almost by accident on Taiwan just as a proposed joint venture
between Taiwan and US aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas began to
founder.
Mr Cahill made his first visit to Taiwan in May 1992. In January 1993, he
and Mr Ko signed a manufacturing agreement in London, but it was only
yesterday that the financial structure of Avro was resolved.
For Taiwan, the offer from BAe came at an opportune time. Some of the
difficulties with the McDonnell Douglas proposals did not apply with BAe:
Its aircraft were proven designs, the investment would be in the hundreds of
millions of dollars, rather than billions, and there was a larger potential
market among domestic carriers flying short trips across Taiwan's rugged
countryside.
And as one leading Taiwanese lawyer put it this week: 'Two failed attempts
to set up an aerospace joint venture looks bad.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Japan negotiates plan to lift flagging economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling coalition yesterday opened what is set to be painful internal
bargaining over a plan to lift the flagging economy, due to be tabled in
mid-September.
Government departments have proposed more than 70 deregulation measures,
although details are still confidential, said ministers after a cabinet
meeting.
The Japan Research Institute, a private body, estimated that more than 1m
new jobs and over Y10 trillion (Pounds 64bn) worth of demand could be
created by curbing government regulations on industry. However, the outcome
depends on the details of the proposals and how many of them survive the
intense inter-ministerial bargaining.
An indication of the difficulties ahead came when Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the
finance minister, yesterday quashed speculation that the government would
cut income tax to try to stimulate consumer spending.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, wants tax reductions, but the
powerful bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry administration oppose cuts. Mr
Fujii himself used to be a Finance Ministry bureaucrat as director general
of the powerful budget bureau.
One controversial draft proposal made public yesterday is to ease the
present 2,000 kilolitre-per-year minimum production allowed for Japanese
brewers. If made law, this would break the 30-year, four-company oligopoly
of Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory - the only brewers big enough to
qualify - and is likely to run into fierce opposition from them.
Mr Ishida will hold an emergency meeting with ministerial colleagues
responsible for the economy next Tuesday before starting negotiations with
the ministries involved.
Further evidence of Japan's deepening economic gloom came yesterday from the
latest jobless figures, showing there were only 72 job offers for every 100
applicants last month - the lowest for six years - down from 74 in June.
However, the unemployment rate remains unchanged at a seasonally adjusted
2.5 per cent.
Consumer spending remains sluggish, as big retailers yesterday said sales
fell 5 per cent last month from the same period last year, the 14th
consecutive monthly drop. These figures add weight to fears that the
recovery might be further away than some government economists had expected
and will increase already heavy pressure on the coalition to find a way to
improve consumer confidence.

FT  28 AUG 93 / China jails star village official

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has jailed one of its best-known businessmen for 20 years for
obstructing justice. Mr Yu Zuomin, former chairman of the board of an
entrepreneurial village near Tianjin, had been held up as a national model
of the new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs until he fell from grace.
Mr Yu's sentence coincided with the passing of death sentences in Beijing
against four officials, including one from the Bank of China, for
corruption.
China launched a drive this week to root out corrupt officials whose
activities had been fuelled by the economic boom. The execution of several
hapless individuals had been expected. Chinese describe this process as
'killing a chicken to frighten a monkey,' meaning that lesser officials are
being dealt with severely as an example to more senior cadres.
Corruption has become a pervasive force in China, reaching high into the
ruling Communist party. Top officials and their families are engaged in
business activities from dealing in cars to speculating in real estate.
Mr Yu of Daqiu village near Tianjin, which had become something of a
national entrepreneurial shrine, was found guilty of harbouring criminals,
obstructing justice, bribery, unlawful detention and unlawful control of
people.
Mr Yu's arrest followed the beating to death of a worker in his village, and
his attempts to cover up the crime. His sentencing is certain to capture
attention throughout China since Mr Yu had been hailed by party bosses for
his money-making skills and elevated to the national parliament. He coined
the slogan: 'Only by looking money-ward can you look forward.'
Beijing yesterday threatened to reconsider its commitment to a key
international missile control agreement in a furious protest against a US
ban on the export of high-technology items to China.
Mr Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador in Beijing, was summoned to the foreign
ministry, to be told of Chinese anger over the US action which followed
accusations that Beijing was exporting missile components to Pakistan.
Mr Liu Huaqiu, China's vice foreign minister, told Mr Roy the US sanctions
'puts Sino-US relations in serious jeopardy'.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Shamir speaks out amid hope of deal with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's former right-wing prime minister, yesterday
accused the government of rushing to give away land to Palestinians and
demanded elections, in a bid to dampen recent excitement about an imminent
peace deal.
Mr Shamir was reacting to statements by Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign
minister, and senior officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation that
the two sides were close to a self-rule deal which would be agreed at next
week's peace talks in Washington.
Mr Shamir said the issue was too important to be left to the government
alone in a country divided over the peace process. 'If someone wants to
decide on changing borders he has to go to the people,' he said.
Leading Israeli newspapers said yesterday that Mr Peres had met senior PLO
officials during a recent visit to Scandinavia to hammer out the plan for
self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories.
Since his return Mr Peres has been making upbeat statements saying Israel is
prepared to withdraw troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank
town of Jericho - a scheme dubbed Gaza-Jericho First - as part of a
comprehensive peace agreement with Palestinians.
His optimism has been shared by several PLO officials. On Thursday Mr Saleh
Ra'afat, a PLO central council member, said Israel and the PLO had finalised
a provisional accord on partial Palestinian control in the occupied
territories after secret high-level contacts. Mr Ra'afat said the agreement
centres on the Gaza-Jericho First plan combined with an interim phase of
self-rule throughout the rest of the territories.
However, political analysts believe the optimism may be misplaced. The
Gaza-Jericho idea is understood differently by both sides and has caused a
major revolt inside the PLO by hardliners who are against making any
concessions to Israel that would leave any part of the occupied-territories
under Israeli control, even during an interim phase.
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was yesterday holding emergency talks in
Tunis aimed at diffusing the revolt, also driven by criticism about his
leadership style and the PLO's financial crisis.
In addition neither side has so far outlined any breakthrough in the
fundamental obstacle in the peace talks - who should control occupied Arab
East Jerusalem and the Israeli settlements in the territories during an
interim phase of self-rule.

MALAYSIA'S official anti-corruption agency has cleared Mr S Samy Vellu,
Malaysia's energy minister and head of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC)
political party, of any criminal offence in relation to a share transaction
nearly three years ago.
The Malaysian opposition had accused Mr Samy Vellu of 'hijacking' millions
of shares in Telekom Malaysia when the telecommunications company was
partially privatised in October 1990.
The shares had originally been allocated by the government to the MIC and
Malaysia's Indian community.
The anti-corruption agency said it was satisified that neither Mr Samy Vellu
nor anyone else had unlawfuly utilised the Telekom shares and declared the
case closed.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Birds of a feather: Summer Rites - Nigel Spivey ponders
grouse beaters and their place in the scheme of things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY A very sensitive ornithologist would want to claim that the grouse was
a lovely bird. Lagopus lagopus is a gawky creation which barks when it
should trill and flies with a sort of aerial stagger when it should soar.
Nature, I think, patently intended this fowl of the air for the pot.
Still, I confess to a frisson of pity the first time I saw one downed,
somewhere up on the Banff moorlands, not far from the Glenlivet distillery.
A late grouse has marvellous scarlet eyes, with black pupils that catch
glints of sunlight as the bird lies blasted in tussocks of Highland ling.
This is the stuff of the sporting print, the appetising table-mat, the
jaunts of Jorrocks and the fields of Fielding.
But I briefly mourned the unlovely bird. And I now realise why, for it is
becoming increasingly hard to put a gloss of time-honoured prowess on a dead
grouse in the 1990s.
To begin with, the guns of today are too good. The birds have the odds
against them. Humans may be known for their intelligence, but grouse are
not. A double-barrelled shotgun has one barrel too many: that is what our
great-grandfathers would say.
But that is not the crux of one's objection to glory on the grouse moor. Put
crudely, it is that the wrong sort of sportsman is bagging these birds. It
would be undiplomatic, not to say ungentlemanly, to name nationalities,
though when I last went beating even the unctuous head game-keeper took
exception to a detachment of Italian Christian Democrat town councillors
firing away at rabbits all stricken with chronic myxomatosis.
The fact is that nothing says so much about the decline of British
aristocracy as grouse shooting. All that is left to us natives is the state
of vassalage. We can hardly afford to shoot, so give us a stick, affix an
old fertiliser bag, marshall us into a line and let us earn a crust by
beating the birds towards the guns of our new masters.
Beaters are masochists. They take a delight in the humiliation of it all.
The game-keepers run about in plus-four tweeds and hob-nailed boots,
dictating strategies over portable telephones. The beaters do as instructed.
A whistle sounds. The beaters obediently set off.
It may be a mile before they converge - plashing through streams, beset by
midges but always flapping that old fertiliser bag on a stick. Whole
families of grouse peacefully grousing in the heather go spiralling up.
As the beaters inexorably unite, and the glen fills with flapping bags, the
guns begin to pop and blaze. Scrambling up the hillside, dodging the patter
of pellets, the charitable beaters are the ones wearing Barbour jackets.
Before the dogs home in on fallen birds, before the men with foreign tongues
begin to congratulate themselves and their quintuple-barrelled guns, there
is always the chance to express your pity for a grouse that has ceased to
be: pick him up and stuff him into one of those spacious poacher's pockets a
Barbour so thoughtfully provides.
After a hearty morning esconced in the butts on the edge of a hill, the
alien aristocrats pass round their hip-flasks, exchange a few jokes about
the state of the currency markets - and wait for lunch.
Lunch will certainly arrive in a Land Rover, toiling up from the local
country house hotel. That vehicle will be even more certainly piloted by two
gorgeous Sloanes. Cold cuts, smoked salmon, foie gras and Stilton are
disembarked, and Bollinger is found to ease the nourishment down.
The beaters? The beaters will be out of sight, by order of the keepers. An
unkempt motley of old Etonians, Oxford graduates and peers of the realm,
they have much in common: processed cheese sandwiches, Red Label tea, and a
packet of Silk Cut. They bask in the sun. They know their place.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Where vulgarity is a virtue: Blackpool is the genuine
article, says Nicholas Woodsworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM TIME to time, I have dipped a toe into the waters of Britain's seaside
resorts. No matter how I disdain the boardwalk for its vulgarity and
seediness I am, at the same time, attracted to it for precisely those
reasons. So why not, I decided, pay a visit to the oldest and biggest of all
promenades in Britain? Result: on a recent Friday evening, I caught a train
northwards. Three hours later, I alighted in exotic Blackpool, mother of all
British seaside resorts.
Perhaps it was the knifing wind and fine, cold drizzle that blew in off the
sea, sending sweet papers and cigarette packets swirling; perhaps it was the
recession. Either way, an inescapable air of weariness enveloped the small
shops and businesses, the half-empty B&amp;Bs, the down-at-heel pubs along my
way. As I walked through back streets towards a Blackpool Tower obscured by
mist, I felt suddenly glum. I could not help thinking that the special
atmosphere of the English coastal resort might have become superfluous.
Who needs seaside seediness now that it has seeped its way inland, through
the entire country? Where is the fun in vulgarity if it has worked its way
into the highest social and political circles? There are times, these days,
when all Britain seems gripped by the ethos of the penny arcade. Not even a
short stroll along the Golden Mile itself - the long band of fast-food
kiosks, amusement arcades, souvenir shops and jostling crowds that fronts
the sea - cheered me. The chip shops smelled of stale oil. The souvenirs
looked grubby and pawed-over.
Braving a ghastly electronic howl, I stuck my head into an amusement arcade.
I did not really expect it, but there was not a coconut shy, a dart or hoop
or skittle in sight; the fun seemed centred on video-screen games featuring
heavily-armed psychopaths trying to kill each other.
Not even the real people looked happy. Groups of loud youths blundered by
with beer bottles in hand. Elderly women wandered aimlessly out of bingo
halls into the rain. In the restaurant beside the tower, I queued behind a
man and wife in bright nylon shell suits, a baby sealed in a plastic-covered
pram between them. They consumed their Big Macs joylessly and left without a
word.
I had a Big Mac, too, and ruminated. Was this a final picture of England,
supine and spiritless? Had the cheer gone even from the cheap and cheerful?
Not at all, said Barbara Rocks, when I asked her what she thought. It was
simply the rain and grey weather. Recession or no, Blackpool remains a place
where you can find a bit of fun. Barbara, for eight years proprietress of
the Norwin B&amp;B, is a level-headed Scot and immediately dispelled my
moodiness.
Besides, her spotless little establishment, from the plastic flowers in the
dining room to the coloured lights in the bay window, struck just the right
note. So did Barbara. I like being called dear and told not to fret.
Tomorrow, I was promised, would be a brighter day. And it was. How, I
wondered as I strolled towards the promenade, could I have doubted the
town's resolve to see the rest of the country through its lowest moments?
The world at large might be down in the dumps but, if sea-front hoardings
and advertising are anything to go by, Blackpool is one great laugh of a
place. Without leaving town I could watch the Hilarious Jolley Brothers,
Nick Miller's Comedy Store, Roy Walker's Family Laughter Show, the duo Joka,
the funnymen Little and Large, the Shamrock Music and Laughter Show, Chubby
Brown, Bernard Manning, and scores of other comedy routines. There were
singers, dancers, musicians, magicians, ventriloquists and every other kind
of performer; making people laugh, though, is Blackpool's real talent.
Low-brow mass entertainment? Perhaps. But then, Blackpool is about temporary
escape, simple relief from the monotony and enforced dullness of
working-class life. And who needs Godot in Blackpool? There is enough of the
surreal about the place as it is.
Summer, for example, is not a season in Blackpool but an attitude. In the
stiff breeze on the promenade, young couples in shorts and T-shirts strolled
hand-in-hand as if whiling away time on the French Riviera. Wind-whipped but
undaunted, the elderly reclined gingerly in rented canvas chairs.
I enjoyed walking the piers. On Central Pier, I circled round and round on a
Ferris wheel while, far below, bumper cars bumped and the surf crashed to
the theme song of Hawaii Five-0. On the Victorian-style North Pier, where a
small tram runs between little white pavilions with green onion domes, there
are still a few traditional games of skill left. I threw hoops over bottles,
fired corks from pistols, aimed balls at moving targets.
I could not even set foot in Harry Ramsden's famous fish restaurant, so
great were the queues that evening. Instead, I bought a bag of rock cod and
chips from the take-out counter and parked myself on a bench not far away.
Why is it that strange women never make saucy remarks to me when I sit on
public benches in London? Perhaps there is safety in numbers - Blackpool is
a place where whole office-loads of secretaries, entire shops-full of sales
assistants, choose to unwind.
I am not sure I could take more than two or three days of Blackpool. There
are times when the rain falls, the wind blows, and not even the most
successful fantasist could pretend he was on the Riviera. Then, one is
forced indoors with hordes of sodden holiday-makers, and it all becomes too
much.
What Blackpool has, above all, is amiability. My last evening was spent at a
show at the Layton Institute, a working men's club some distance from the
Golden Mile. The singing was mediocre, the humour parochial. But the
atmosphere was as warm and sociable as anything I have encountered in
Britain.
In London, I live surrounded by people of cool, off-handed mien. It is a
city where outsiders rarely feel entirely at home. But, in Blackpool, I felt
at home in five minutes. Beneath the seediness and vulgarity, it has a
strength of popular culture that, even in tough times, can make the airs and
pretensions of London seem gaudy.

heads of government, Ross Perot, Nasa, Nato, stuff like that. Yesterday it
was the UK sports minister who summoned me to his lair, to discuss Operation
Final Push - the last phase of Britain's bid to stage the Olympic Games of
2000 in Manchester. D-Day is September 23, when members of the International
Olympic Committee make their decision.
I did not catch the sports minister's name, but I could tell from his
clothes and gear - blazer, hockey tie, headguard, cycling shorts - that he
was who he said he was.
'Right,' said the minister. 'Some coffee, Julian, mucho rapido.' Julian is
the minister's political assistant: a Michael Portillo look-alike from the
Conservatives' hard right - gangster suit, purple tie, perfect teeth,
Castilian hair-style, muscular, mercurial. Age: 27. Never turn your back to
him.
'Manchester,' said the minister. 'Operation Final Push. Big heave essential.
Political risks considerable. But rewards, of course, immense. Everything to
play for. Grateful your advice.'
I said: 'What is your problem?'
He said: 'As you know, the government has pumped untold billions into the
bid to stage the 2000 Olympics. Manchester has acquired a surfeit of
infrastructure. Nine new airports. A 12-lane ring-road. Dozens of hotels.
Fifteen new museums. Hundreds of new restaurants. Waterfalls and parks.
Zero-rent apartment blocks.
'And plans are well advanced for a coup de theatre: the unveiling, on the
last day of the Games, of the John Major Millennial Institute of Sport and
the Performing Arts.
'But the prime minister is jittery. He read in The Economist last week that
Beijing, one of Manchester's main rivals, is running a campaign of the
utmost ruthlessness. According to The Economist: 'When the (Olympic)
committee visited Beijing, a Chinese representative simply pointed to the
five rings of the Olympic flag and said: China has 1.27bn people, more than
one-fifth of the world's population . . . One of those rings . . .
represents (us).' Absolutely dynamite. And then there is Sydney. It is
co-favourite with Beijing.'
'Sydney is smashing,' I said.
'Just so,' said the minister. 'But let us concentrate on Manchester. I have
called you in, Michael, because of your intellectual rigorousness - your
ability to atomise complex scenarios into fundamental particles. So here is
the big question: what is our Achilles' heel? What could possibly spook us?'
I said: 'Three things, actually. Numero one: the weather. It has now rained
in Manchester for 613 consecutive days. They have had blizzards and typhoons
and showers of speckled frogs. To date, the media have co-operated and not
blown the whistle. But the scandal could leak out. Manchester's weather is a
catastrophe-in-waiting.
'Numero two: everywhere in the world there is an anti-British backlash.
Europe hates us. Asia despises us. So does everyone else. In The Times, Kate
Muir reported this week that in New York, especially, there is a campaign in
progress denigrating everything British - our boorishness, our grottiness,
our racism, our snobbishness, our economic backwardness, our Marks &amp; Sparks
underwear, even our garden gnomes. There is a floodtide of Anglophobia
raging.
'Numero three: John Major. He's your biggest problem. You know he's got to
go, so why muck around? Replace him with Portillo.' From the chair next to
mine, Julian flashed a smile. 'But you can forget the Olympics. Manchester?
Not a hope.'
'So what should I do?'
I steepled my fingers and let my braincells whirr, atomising the scenario
into fundamental particles.
I said: 'There could be a solution. Your best bet, minister, hinges on the
fact that Queen Elizabeth II is still Queen of Australia and Australia's
head of state. So . . . despatch our nuclear submarines. Have them resurface
in Sydney harbour. Take Australia back. It is one of the world's best
countries. The Aussies wouldn't mind. I am sure they would welcome you.
Their brains have been softened by sun, sex and surf. By reconquering
Australia you will acquire Sydney's bid to stage the Games of 2000. The IOC
would love that. Adios, Beijing. And we'd all fly south and live in
Australia. Bondi here we come.'
The minister said: 'Your cheque is in the post.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Pictures of Beirut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A racehorse being exercised. A convocation of soldiery. Pallid mannequins
loitering. At war or at peace, Beirut is a city of the strangest
incongruities and juxtapositionings. These photographs are from a portfolio
of work shot this summer by Morris Carpenter, one of two winners of the
first Alan Harper Bursary, which is open to photographers under 25. The
Pounds 5,000 bursary was set up in memory of Alan Harper, an FT photographer
who was killed while on assignment in the Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991. For his
project, Carpenter, who works for Zoom Photographic, concentrated on the
rebuilding of Beirut, the protection of its historical buildings and
archaeological sites - and the effects of redevelopment on the survivors of
war.

A REFRESHING line was taken in Radio 4's Monday play, The Chicago Conspiracy
Trial. It was a dramatised version, by Peter Goodchild, of the transcripts
of a real trial - a notably colourful trial, too, with noisy disputes
between both sides' lawyers, witnesses and the public. Directed by the BBC's
Martin Jenkins and John Theocharis and produced jointly by the BBC, Los
Angeles Theatre Works and WFMT of Chicago, it was very exciting.
In 1968, the Democrats held their Convention in Chicago; the Peace Lobby was
active, and there were protests about Vietnam war. They led inevitably to
riots, and eight selected defendants were tried before Judge Hoffman and a
jury of eight women (two black) and two men - who were kept sequestered for
six months. The charges seem trivial today, matters like crossing
state-lines and unauthorised sleeping in public places. Defendant Bobby
Seal, leader of the Black Panthers, had to be bound and gagged to keep him
quiet, though this made his supporters less quiet than ever. Interruptions
ranged from the serious to the trivial - an attempt was made to disqualify
the judge (the one individual to retain his dignity throughout) and to give
his Seale a birthday cake. The participants' names are mostly forgotten
today, apart from the poet Allan Ginsberg, and the able American players are
unfamiliar to us. The production was genuinely memorable.
Wednesday's The World Tonight on Radio 4 contained an alarming report of
sexual harassment in the police. A 19-year old WPC said her bottom was
forcibly date-stamped as an initiation ceremony; a sergeant driving her home
behaved disgustingly in the car; when she complained, she was invited to
resign. The London Police Federation was alleged to refuse funds to women
for legal advice for an industrial tribunal, but not to men; and the
production of evidence was obstructed.
The Federation's general secretary admitted that the police could behave
like anyone else (and indeed male apprentices in industry can have similar
experiences); but he denied the matter of funds. Hertfordshire's Chief
Constable reckoned education would clear up such problems, and had written
to every individual in his force to point out that their behaviour must be
as firmly controlled as the general public's. A distressing report, all the
same.
Radio 3 last night gave A Sorceress of Her Time compiled by Michael Bakewell
from Alma Mahler's letters and diaries. She has become a kind of heroine on
the basis of her liaisons. Almost engaged to Klimt, she married Mahler
instead, although he was 'a rickety, degenerate Jew' and 20 years older than
she. No case of compulsive love, though; they had three daughters, but she
was soon close to pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch. Mahler died in 1911, then she
was famously courted by Kokoschka, but she set her sights on architect
Walter Gropius and married him. They had a son but were soon divorced -
leaving her free to marry the writer Franz Werfel in 1929. Her affaire with
a priest naturally came to nothing. Manon, her youngest daughter by Mahler,
died in 1935, and Alban Berg dedicated his violin concerto to her memory.
Alma was a firm pro-Nazi who thought Hitler a 'genuine idealist', but she
had had two Jewish husbands, so they fled to New York in 1940. There Werefel
died, but Alma lived to be 86, devoted in her way to Mahler's memory. She at
least must have felt that she had lived a distinguished life.
I heard some of the young people's stories on Radio 5; this week, Is Anybody
There? a serial by Eric Pringle. Little Christine (Moir Leslie), lives with
her father in an old house, where his dead mother once lived. In the attic,
Christine hears the voice of an unseen little girl. Instead of being scared,
she plays verbal games with her. Later, from the attic window she sees a
strange family in the garden, but does not ask who they are. It all ends
happily.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Verdi the beginner - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL STUDENTS of opera should have been at the middle week of this year's
Edinburgh festival. As a rule composers do their best to bury their first
attempts at opera, but posterity has developed a fascination for digging
them up again.
After Tuesday's efforts by the 18-year-old Schubert and the 33-year-old
Janacek, and Wednesday's double-bill of stage works by the young Scottish
composer James MacMillan, Thursday brought the turn of Verdi and his first
opera, Oberto. The composer would probably be surprised that we should want
to hear the piece. He knew that he had gone on to far better things.
As the concert performance began in the Usher Hall, it was interesting to
think back to 1839. The audience that had come to see this first opera by an
unknown composer was used to Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. What can they
have made of Oberto? From the first notes the music is rugged and
full-blooded; there is a frankness about it, a determination not to dress up
simple ideas with unnecessary frills, that must have caught their attention.
In short, Verdi was a new voice.
Today Oberto is important for what it promises, not what it achieves. The
plot is a feeble affair, which winds up stock characters with intense
emotion (father bent on vengeance, daughter spurned by lover, forgiving
rival) and then sets them tilting one against another. Verdi fills their
lungs with music, but cannot breathe life into them.
The singers of the day had been brought up on Bellini and Donizetti just as
much as the audiences, so we can assume that their voices would have been
flexible, adept at achieving expression through phrasing and ornament,
almost certainly not very large. Maria Guleghina, who took the leading role
of Leonora, is a stunning singer, but not of that kind. Getting the words to
speak and shaping the vocal line at the appropriate scale do not come easily
to a soprano whose glory is soaring out in blazing splendour on high. When
she sang, 'My voice will resound among these lofty towers', one believed
her. I look forward to her Aida and Tosca.
Dennis O'Neill, Leonora's former lover, a real bounder, matched her in
volume and exceeded her in Italianate passion, at the expense of an edgy
vibrato. The role of the old, enfeebled father went to the young and by no
means feeble Alastair Miles, whose well-focussed voice has grown beyond
Handel and may yet mature into a real Verdi bass. Jane Henschel made the
most of the low notes in Cuniza's music (Guleghina does not have a chest
register with which to answer back). As a team, they delivered the goods.
In place of Edward Downes, David Robertson conducted the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra in a performance of some energy and force, the qualities
Oberto does possess in abundance. By the end, the opera had made an impact
well beyond what the books of theory tell us Verdi the beginner should be
able to muster. Students of opera, please note.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: An Inspector Calls - Aldwych Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fog everywhere. The bleak house of Birling floats above the dank Yorkshire
mists until An Inspector Calls at the Aldwych Theatre. Stephen Daldry's
fine, dark production has transferred from the National Theatre. The superb
design by Ian MacNeil makes JB Priestley's play into a nightmare of shadowy
rain drizzling around the bright bourgeois home of the Birling family,
northern manufacturers. The theatre-noir opens with the score from
Hitchcock's Vertigo. Priestley's 1944 vision of social conscience gradually
works its end on the characters, exposing their shame and guilt in the
suicide of a girl they all know. The Inspector's calling card carries the
message: 'We don't live alone. We are members of one society. We are
responsible for each other.' There are excellent strong performances from
Julian Glover as Birling, the family patriarch, and Kenneth Cranham as
Inspector Goole his implacable opposite. Sylvestra le Touzel plays Birling's
daughter and Judy Parfitt his wife, a horror in red taffeta. This is
first-rate Priestley played with atmosphere, purpose, style, and wit:
Priestley's original setting was 'an evening in spring' - more like a season
in hell. (Aldwych Theatre - 071 836 6404)

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: How to do Edinburgh - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 20 years this weekend since first I came to the Edinburgh Festival. If
anybody told me now how to 'do' the Festival, I would probably ignore them;
but I might well have listened then. So here are some rules of conduct for a
young festival-goer to disregard or consider as she/he chooses.
Don't specialise. Follow as many different art forms as possible, even if
you are already going to be an actor or a musician or a movie critic, even
if your interest in one art is your reason for coming to the festival. Who
knows one art who only one art knows?
Keep up an average of three shows per day: a civilised quantity. You have
the rest of the year in which you will go to all too few (and in which to
recover). But, if you keep up five per day or more (there are those who do
ten), be aware that you do so at the cost of such other important festival
pleasures as conversation, friendship, meals, sex and sleep. It is better to
eat and sleep between, rather than during, shows.
Go to both Official Festival and Fringe events. Yes, some Fringe events are
perfectly terrible. So are some Official ones. There are some famous artists
on both Fringe and Official sides; some will disappoint. Both Official and
Fringe will feature a number of artists you never heard of before; some will
thrill, and one or two could change your life.
Follow your instinct, and do no more preparatory homework in your choice of
shows than you need. There is nothing so eye-opening as taking in a
wonderful new (or old) piece where you have no notion what will happen next,
or how you are meant to react. 'All knowledge is a fall from the paradise of
undifferentiated sensation.' (RP Blackmur).
Make a schedule for all you plan to see (allowing time to get from place to
place and time to get programmes etc.), and then feel free to improvise
around it or revise it. Shape your schedule around your digestion. Yes, of
course you can go to 10 events a day if you want - but a rumbling stomach
does not go down well during a viola revital at the Queen's Hall, and
stomach cramps are not the best condition in which to admire plays about
incest.
Take time to fit in the non-festival features of Edinburgh - unless you
visit the city regularly. It would be silly, for example, to catch all the
festival exhibitions but to bypass the permanent collection at the National
Gallery of Scotland (which has, as they say, 'one of everything').
Go to several events that you are not sure you will enjoy. (This is easy in
Edinburgh.) It is great to find that a show you were looking forward to
fulfilled your expectations, but greater to be overwhelmed by a show of
which you had no expectations.
Even if you have a Fringe mentality, try a few orthodox events. (This is not
too easy in '93. Sexual unorthodoxy is particularly to the fore: with
incest, prostitutes, gay love, promiscuity and child abuse all receiving
their dues. Also transvestism. The only show I have seen about a married
couple made a a big deal out of them going to a drag show.) But there are
Holbein, and Verdi, and Shakespeare.
Don't subordinate your own taste to those of the published critics. Some of
them are ninnies, some of them are smart but wrong, some of them are right
but dull. The ones to pay attention to are those who, whether or not you
agree with them, are in some way or other illuminating. It is useful to read
that Wednesday morning's performance of the Schubert E flat major trio was
not very good. But if you were hearing that trio for the first time, you had
a different experience from the critic, who may have narrowly prescriptive
notions on how that trio ought to go. If she/he really tells you how that
trio ought to go, fine. If she/he really reveals to you how that trio
actually went on Wednesday, even better. But the best thing is simply to
listen to the trio.
If there is life after Edinburgh, apply the above to that too, where and
when possible. If not, not.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Artistic row brews up - Off the Wall / The Edinburgh
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH EIGHT days to go, the Edinburgh Festival is on line to be a commercial
success. But artistically it is still up for grabs.
Director Brian McMaster had a soft start last year when he presided over his
first Festival. Now the inevitable criticisms are starting. A lack-lustre
opening concert; a pretentious Peter Sellars production of The Persians;
doubt over the new works by featured composer James MacMillan - these are
nit-picking irritants.
But the row that McMaster has got into with the National Gallery of Scotland
is more serious. Every year, the National Gallery mounts its best shows to
coincide with the Festival. It has been included in the official Festival
programme and to most visitors is part of the festivities. When successful,
as the Ramsay exhibition was last year, the Festival gets some of the glory.
McMaster appears to be against the visual arts. He has suggested a separate
Visual Arts Festival. He refused to include the major National Gallery shows
this year, one devoted to Holbein, the other to the Russian avant-garde, in
his programme, even though the gallery pays for the privilege.
The National Gallery is furious. Fortunately, it is getting record
attendances for the Russian exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art but it
cannot understand why McMaster does not make use of its great potential
contribution to the Festival. McMaster maintains he wants complete control
over the contents of the Festivals.
The spat this summer could be put down to inexperience. But there are
reports that McMaster is not interested in including the 1994 art shows
inside the official Edinburgh Festival brochure for next year. Since they
involve expensive and important exhibitions on late 19th century French
painting and German Romanticism, and seem sure to be popular, McMaster might
wisely think again and perhaps try to attract to the Festival events that
tie-in with these themes.
It is unfashionable to say that the arts in the UK have for the past
generation enjoyed a Golden Age, prompted in part by government funding that
has risen sharply ahead of inflation. If the Arts Council's budget is cut by
Pounds 5m next year (and Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke now presides over
such a large empire that he could easily switch funds to the arts if he
wished) it is a minimal cut compared with recent increases.
Of course, the arts must put pressure on Mr Brooke and defend their corner
but sometimes the crisis talk gets out of hand. Take Edinburgh, for example,
and Scotland generally. The success this year of the biggest arts festival
in the world hardly suggests imminent doom and the Scottish Arts Council is
in remarkably good heart. Here follows some good news.
Within 18 months the Lottery should be providing money for the arts. The SAC
reckons it could receive Pounds 6m of it, a sizeable improvement on its
current grant of Pounds 23m a year. It anticipates using the annual windfall
mainly for capital projects. But where?
The arts in Scotland are in the throes of an extraordinary building binge.
Glasgow recently got its international concert hall; the money has been
found for the new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, which will open next spring
with the largest stage in the UK; the Traverse Theatre is new and sparkling,
as is the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow. The Fruitmarket and the Tron are
among a whole array of art institutions that have recently been refurbished.
The Lottery money will easily be absorbed, in improving the Usher Hall, for
example, but no-one can pretend that the arts in Scotland are in extremis.
There are the inevitable squabbles - over the merger of two Scottish
symphony orchestras; whether Edinburgh or Glasgow should play home to yet
another new arts structure, the Museum of Scottish Art; but as the SAC
awaits its divorce from the Arts Council of Great Britain and becomes a
client of a supposedly-sympathetic Secretary of State for Scotland in Iain
Lang, it does seem as if one part of the UK is doing well by the arts.
Bill Burdett-Coutts who runs the Assembly Rooms, the biggest venue on the
Fringe, is to take over as director of the Riverside Studios in London. It
is a challenging job. Riverside is Pounds 200,000 in the red.
Burdett-Coutts will continue to manage the Assembly Rooms during each
Festival and hopes that he will be able to integrate programming. He has
long wanted to produce new work rather than just act as a receiving house
and controlling a London venue makes it feasible to create plays that start
in Edinburgh with a guaranteed transfer to the capital and vice versa.
In the meantime he might give some thought soundproofing the various
auditoria inside the Assembly Rooms. American comic Greg Proops got so upset
at the noise percolating to his show from the performance of the Doug
Anthony All-stars playing up above that he rehearsed his 100-strong audience
in anti-Anthony slogans and led them on to the All-stars stage The
Australians retired hurt for 20 minutes.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Themes miss the note - Richard Fairman takes the
Festival to task over its music programme / The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DOES it take to make a music festival in 1993? As the second week of
the Edinburgh Festival comes to its close, the programme may look as full
and varied as ever, the audiences are up, but a sinking feeling has set in.
The music has simply not been strong enough.
These days, image, integrity - call it what you will - is essential. Driven
by the need to attract the affluent, music-loving tourist, cities throughout
Europe have been starting up festivals at an unsustainable speed. Those
which will survive and prosper are the ones which have something special to
offer. Glyndebourne, Bregenz, Bayreuth keep to opera, where the real money
is; some modestly restrict themselves to chamber music. For the other big
festivals the challenge is to adapt and change - and that is not easy. Look
at the problems Salzburg is encountering as it tries to re-focus its
position after decades of stagnation.
Everybody in Scotland can heave a sigh of relief. Edinburgh's problems are
not on that scale. It is a long time since this was a festival of the rich
and famous, where the music can hardly be heard for the tinkle of jewellery
and the rustle of furs. Fees commanded by top artists have made the old
Salzburg-style festival barely feasible any more.
In most years Edinburgh makes the focus of its music programming a central
theme. This is a sensible policy: it means each festival is different and
events which might otherwise look uninviting take on extra relevance in the
context of the overall package. This year, the second under Brian McMaster
as Festival Director, there are three themes: Schubert and Janacek
'juxtaposed'; Verdi 'from first to last'; and James MacMillan 'his music in
focus' - in principle, a good mix.
Why, then, do I declare this festival's music to be a disappointment? There
have, after all, been successes, such as the concert performance of Mozart's
Cos fan tutte, the vocal recitals by Sylvia McNair and Thomas Hampson, the
concert by the Oslo Philharmonic and Mariss Jansons. But these were one-off
events. None of them was special to Edinburgh 1993.
The Verdi theme is a non-starter. Only three operas on offer, Oberto (his
earliest) in a concert performance, a modest new I due Foscari and Falstaff
(his last) in a revival of a familiar production by Welsh National Opera:
Verdi 'from first to last' perhaps, but with precious little in between. The
retrospective of James MacMillan, Scotland's leading young composer, has
probably been the most well-balanced theme.
Unfortunately, the big one is the Schubert and Janacek series, and that has
proved crucially flat. Each half of it looks to me an opportunity missed. So
much of Schubert's greatest music lies in the area of chamber-music and song
that there was the chance to put on high-class events at relatively low
cost. One imagines, for example, a series of song recitals with the great
Schubertians of the day: Schreier, Fassbaender, Margaret Price. In Janacek's
case the fare has been variable - no operas (a serious omission), decent
coverage of the orchestral works, some interesting rarities. But the BBC's
Janacek Festival at the Barbican earlier this year put on just as much and
performed it just as well.
Here lies the nub of the problem. Day-to-day concert programming throughout
the year is growing more adventurous. The Barbican's own mini-festivals
devoted to Britten, Stravinsky, Scandinavian music and so on, have been so
exhaustive, so far-reaching, that it is difficult for Edinburgh to go any
further.
What can be done? The first thing I have missed is performers who really
have something to say about the featured composers. If Janacek is to be the
theme, then why not Mackerras, sadly restricted here to just a couple of
pieces? (His performance of the Glagolitic Mass a couple of years ago was a
more memorable Janacek experience than the sum of all we have had so far.)
If Schubert, then a leading string quartet; or perhaps Graham Johnson, to
draw on the singers of his Schubert Lieder Edition on record. Salzburg has
turned to Harnoncourt. Others have looked to John Eliot Gardiner. These are
the thinking musicians who can turn a mere series of concerts into a vision.
Secondly, however expensive, however troublesome, there have to be more
staged productions which are unique to Edinburgh, or at least to Britain.
(This year's theatre programme has forged links with Salzburg, which may be
a way forwards.) In 1994 the re-built Empire Theatre will be ready, the home
for the large-scale theatre and opera productions that the festival has
needed for so long. McMaster, in his last post an enormously successful and
imaginative head of WNO, will then have his hands tied by only one
constraint - lack of money.
With the Scottish Arts Council soon to enjoy more independence and a
substantial sum expected from the proceeds of the National Lottery, there is
the prospect of some improvement to the finances. I can think of no better
investment for the future than a fund to allow one or two major stage
productions at the festival each year. There is no other festival quite like
Edinburgh. It should be Scotland's pride and joy.

BLACK SHIPS BEFORE TROY: THE STORY OF THE ILIAD by Rosemary Sutcliff,
illustrated by Alan Lee Frances Lincoln Pounds 12.99, 128 pages
ROSEMARY Sutcliff, one of the greatest authors of historical fiction for
children in the 20th century, died at the age of 72 in June 1992. The
daughter of a naval officer, she had a peripatetic childhood. She suffered
throughout her life from a condition known as Still's Disease which confined
her to a wheelchair for much of her time. Of her disabilities she once
wrote, touchingly: 'There's a great loneliness about having any kind of
handicap in a world which in general doesn't, however much you get to the
stage where neither you nor anybody else notices. You tend to create
somebody on your side of the barrier who will talk your own language.'
She had little formal education, but was a voracious reader, being
especially fond of history, legend and myth - subject areas that she would
make her own in later life. Her first wish was to be an artist, but her
disabilities made it impossible for her to work on large canvases and so she
took to writing instead, publishing her first book, a rather unsatisfactory
prose version of the tales of Robin Hood, in 1950.
Many important novels followed: the great Roman cycle, which is seen to its
best effect in The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), and many re-tellings of
traditional stories in modern versions. Her novels were often prefaced by
fascinating 'Historical Notes', which seemed to summarise her rather
quirkish approach to historical research. 'So in The Mark of the Horse Lord
I have written of Caledanes and Dalriads, and not of Picts and Scots, but it
comes to much the same thing in the end.'
Earlier this year she published The Minstrel and the Dragon Pup (Walker
Books, Pounds 9.99), which marked an unusual development. Set in a rather
hazy Middle Ages, it was both a picture book text (her first, in
collaboration with the illustrator Emma Chichester Clark) and as much a
fantasy as a gobbet of historical narrative. Her last two works to be
published, versions of the Iliad and the Odyssey (promised in 1995), are
much more characteristic of the general drift of her fictional themes: the
testing of the warrior hero; the clash of light and dark; the overriding
importance to a culture of the symbolic objects that seem to embody its very
reason for existence. As for Dryden and Pope before her, Sutcliff's Iliad
was not the culmination of a lifelong passion but an imaginative response to
a commission from a publisher.
Though tales from classical myths did not figure in the earliest examples of
children's literature that have come down to us, there were some sensible
abridgements of the Iliad and the Odyssey for children in circulation at the
end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. Since the 1940s, the
most widely available translation of the Odyssey in English has been EV
Rieu's; and two years ago, Christopher Logue's spirited version of books one
to four of the Iliad was published by Faber. Logue gave the Iliad a mighty
pummelling. His version, boldly incongruous, packed with movable incidents,
audaciously anachronistic, virtually reduced Homer's epic to a sequence of
marvellous storyboards. But it also demonstrated just how resilient and
concentrated a story the Iliad is - so much more manageable in plot, themes
and characterisation than the elegiacally diffuse Odyssey.
The Iliad demands not so much imaginative elaboration as ingenious restraint
 -and Rosemary Sutcliff has reached much the same conclusion in her version.
Like Logue, she shows us a Greek nation which seems to have developed a
mighty contempt for anything other than the culture of war - an attitude
which includes holding death itself in disdain. Her most memorable
achievement has been to disentangle some of the more difficult elements of
plot and characterisation so that the individual players in the drama shine
through with a stark and bloody clarity.
Alan Lee's illustrations, as extravagant in their heroic aggrandisement as
any sequence of Victorian narrative paintings, match the text perfectly -
the clash of metal on metal; the sweat of heaving bodies; the mists of
morning rising serenely over scenes of unimaginable carnage.
The book's principal failing is that the dialogue, as often before in
Sutcliff, sounds awkward at times, wordily encumbered, unlike even the
heightened human speech of those who walked like gods. Perhaps this was the
ultimate price that she paid for her own inability to move freely among
other human beings. Otherwise, as ever, she remains robust and
intellectually challenging, her prose perfectly pitched to the grievous
undoing of two fabulously flawed nations.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: A finger of fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The giant finger of fate descends again from the Coliseum flies: English
National Opera has opened its 1993-94 season with a revival of Simon
Boccanegra. David Alden's 1987 production frames a darkly violent,
broodingly personal response to perhaps the most 'inward' of Verdi's
middle-period operas.
The stage-picture is cluttered by too much psycho-symbolic baggage (Alden's
later ENO productions have proved more disciplined in their stagecraft).
Atmosphere is unvaried, larger issues tend to get lost, yet on Thursday the
contorted passions and confrontations of the characters were heated to
boiling-point - any Verdi staging that can urge performances of such searing
emotional force out of all its participants must have unlocked some powerful
Verdian truths at the opera's centre.
The cast is characterised by strong, unbeautiful voices sensitively used -
Gregory Yurisich tremendous in the title role, pictured left, with Janice
Cairns (Amelia); David Rendall (Adorno), Keith Latham (Paolo); only John
Connell's Fiesco seems short-breathed, underweight. The revival would
benefit from a less self-conscious, stop-go conductor than Alexander
Rahbari.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Not just bums on seats - Michael Arditti on why the
audience's role is so crucial to both actor and playwright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARDITTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOULD YOU ever visit an actor after a performance, do not be surprised to
find your compliments reciprocated. While at first this may seem theatrical
gush - after all you have been sitting still while he's been sweating
Shakespeare - if you turn up on a later, less successful night, you may
better appreciate what he means.
For the audience's role is crucial, as Oscar Wilde acknowledged when, on the
first night of Lady Windermere's Fan, he congratulated the audience 'on the
great success of your performance, which persuades me that you think almost
as highly of the play as I do myself.' Such curtain speeches may be a thing
of the past, but the old maxim that plays are not written but re-written
holds true. And as many contemporary playwrights have found, from Simon Gray
to Peter Shaffer, the audience is their final collaborator.
So although we can hardly claim royalties, it is clear that we have a
validating role over and above the routine dispensation of applause. Michael
Frayn is another to have learned from this collective wisdom when the
six-week run at the Lyric Hammersmith prompted the changes which ensured
Noises Off a four-year life in the West End. Ironically, the reverse occured
with its companion piece, Look Look, set across the footlights in an
audience, when the actual audience stayed away in droves.
Look Look's demise sent shock-waves through theatreland, but the subsequent
spate of West End obituaries proved premature. For not even a playwright of
Mr Frayn's distinction could be expected to mould the disparate characters
who composed his typical audience - the family party, adulterous couple,
elderly gay, middle-aged mother and daughter - into a cohesive whole. But if
his attempt was an honourable failure, it is one most managers and directors
fail even to make.
It may be a fatal omission. So much of the energy of our post-war theatrical
expansion has gone into redefining the bond between actor and audience:
reshaping auditoria to replace the outmoded social and aesthetic
relationships of the proscenium arch, that little has been left for the
equally pressing task of establishing bonds within audiences themselves.
When managements do consider audiences, it is generally in terms of
attendances. Thus the arrival of the mega-musical becomes a cause for
celebration, even though it raises the theatrical stakes at the expense of
genuine engagement. Audiences become mere applause fodder.
Increasingly, managements play the TV card. Everything is done to make
audiences feel at home. The frisson of theatre is reduced to the reassurance
of the small screen, as familiar faces are promoted, albeit in unfamiliar
guise. This can have obvious benefits, as even the pioneering Bush theatre
found when Kevin Whateley ('TV's Inspector Morse]') recently appeared there,
but more often it can backfire as with the irate couple who loudly left The
Entertainer, complaining that Peter Bowles was playing Archie Rice and not
Richard de Vere.
Of course it is vital to attract a new audience. Even the Haymarket had its
stuffiness knocked out with the Dawn French fans in singlets and jeans
rather than twinsets and pearls. And yet this can prove a mixed blessing.
The increased chattering, bleeping and even mobile phone calls in the stalls
attest to an audience not so much at home in the theatre as behaving as if
it were still at home. Though so far we have been spared such sights as the
Madonna fans who arrived halfway through her Broadway performance in Speed
the Plow and at the end sat back and waited for it to begin again.
Such a response negates both the power and purpose of theatre. It is a
quintessentially communal experience where dramas are played out on the
public stage. And unless managements respect this role rather than trying to
lure audiences with the spectacle of the cinema or lull them with the
familiarity of TV, its uniqueness will he lost.
Similarly, if the audience is to play its role in the theatre and the
theatre in society, it can no longer remain the province of the privileged
few. For though it is heartening to recall that more people go to the
theatre each week than to professional league football, it is still a
predominantly white middle-class activity.
This is a loss to all concerned - and even to those unconcerned; for the
wider the audience, the richer will be its response. A disproportionate
audience can grossly distort a performance, as anyone who watched a house
full of yuppies turn Caryl Churchill's Serious Money at the Wyndhams from a
critique of city practice into a celebration of its own excess, can confirm.
The experience of seeing a play about racism in a predominantly white
audience can be still more disquieting. When Ma Rainey's Black Bottom played
at the Cottesloe to rows of white faces, the audience seemed to reinforce
the segregated world of the play. Whereas in the very different racial mix
of the Theatre Royal Stratford East, black people laughing at racist lines
in Tunde Ikoli's Scrape off the Black liberated their white neighbours to
confront their own prejudice and fear.
But then the Theatre Royal consistently offers a model of successful
audience engagement, as the citation for their recent Prudential award
attests. 'Community theatre which should be a tautology, remains far too
often an unrealised ideal; and yet, at Stratford, it infuses every aspect of
their work. In this they uphold the tradition of their founder, Joan
Littlewood, who on being questioned before a performance as to why she was
scrubbing the foyer steps, tartly replied: 'I'm expecting company, aren't
you?''
In most theatres, audiences are not company but simply customers, which in
turn prevents them from fully engaging with either one another or the stage
 -but, at Stratford, the diversity of the audience is matched by the
strength of its response. And although I would be the last to encourage
patrons at the National to shout 'Behind you]' to Hamlet as Claudius and
Polonius hide in the arras, or 'Nice one, Lopakhin' as the new owner of the
cherry orchard announces his prize, the highly vocal Stratford audience
reveals an energy and enthusiasm far too often ignored.
Audience engagement is by no means the same as audience participation. After
all, actors do weeks of exercises to bind them together, while the crash
course of a three-hour performance can leave an audience with a deep sense
of distrust (I still have nightmares of a Bournemouth matinee where I was
plucked protesting onto the stage to conga with a six-foot-four Carmen
Miranda). Nevertheless, if the audience is truly to play its part, it is
essential to harness that collective energy which remains the theatre's
unique aspect and most precious resource.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Three Choirs' still packs the naves - Roderic Dunnett
feels Elgar would have approved of this year's Festival at Worcester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERIC DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE BY Elgar's statue opposite the north side of Worcester Cathedral is a
shop named 'Bygones'. You could be forgiven for thinking the Three Choirs
Festival, which has been running all this week, fitted the name. Surely it
perished years ago, with the rest of those dinosaurian choral traditions -
Huddersfield, Birmingham and the Leeds Triennial?
Well, the answer is 'no'. Three Choirs claims to be Europe's oldest
festival. This year's is the 266th in a series tracing back to at least the
1720s. The 280-strong three choirs - made up by choral societies from the
three cathedral cities of Hereford, Worcester and Gloucester (the venue
alternates annually) - continue to pack the naves and aisles. The festival
has survived all vicissitudes: the collapse of Hereford's west tower in
1786; the provisioning of George III's entire retinue two years later; and
dire cash shortages in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars.
The venues make idyllic settings. Worcester, clasped between the Malverns
and the Vale of Evesham, is an agreeable place to spend a few days. The
omens seemed good this year. Both a four-day cricket match on the county
ground abutting the River Severn and a race meeting dovetailed nicely with
the middle of the festival: Elgar would have approved.
But who goes to the Three Choirs now? Critics traditionally lambast the
festival as one of the nation's arch-parochial events (where else would you
find an informal forum on church music packed to the doors?) William Mann
used to speak of its 'senile decay'. But it is a large parish. An audience
survey last year showed that some 70 per cent of visitors to the festival
are drawn from outside the locality. Many come from London and the Home
Counties. Punters, prepared to pay up to Pounds 25 for a seat, arrive from
as far afield as Scotland and Cornwall. Some 50 visitors from the US were
here; my immediate neighbours proved to be enthusiasts from Durham, North
Carolina, Washington DC and Boston, Mass. A few rows down was an attentive
Japanese contingent.
Programming to maintain diversity, ensure profitable sales and keep the Arts
Council happy is a fine balance. The administration - much of it amateur and
laid back, old-style but efficient - annually falls to a local committee,
led by the Festival Director, who is also the host cathedral organist. The
conducting is shared with visiting professionals: this year the BBC
Philharmonic brought with it the Bolshoi's Yuri Simonov, replacing the
indisposed Sir Edward Downes, and BBC Scotland's Jerzy Maksymiuka. Some
think there should be more guest conductors, but budget plays a role here.
Full accounts date back to early performances of Handel's Messiah. One
problem is that County Council and Arts Council support has fallen woefully
behind in the last few years, while the costs of orchestras, staging and
closed-circuit TV have risen. Fire and safety checks have meant the loss of
several hundred mainly cheaper seats, reducing Worcester's capacity to
around 2,000.
But the festival has its own resilience, as the Worcester treasurer, Peter
Seward, explains. A tradition of stewardships guarantees the bulk of the
central nave; sales are completed in March, providing a tidy sum for advance
investment. Sponsorship from commerce and industry was initiated in 1976, at
the same time as an organised 'Fringe' added diversity. A Royal Worcester
donation of Pounds 4,000 towards a performance of Britten's War Requiem,
linked to Wilfred Owen's centenary and the 75th anniversary of the
armistice, was matched under the Business Sponsorship for the Arts scheme
administered by ABSA. The Great War has an added meaning for Worcester:
Geoffrey Studdart Kennedy, the pioneering forces' chaplain known as
'Woodbine Willie', was vicar of St Paul's Church.
Ticket sales account for well over half the Pounds 370,000 budgeted
expenditure, the bulk of which goes on orchestras and soloists. Sponsorship
adds some Pounds 28,000, of which Pounds 10,000 is from county council
sources. The dense programme book still makes a healthy profit. Most
important, the administration takes up only 14 per cent of the whole. There
are advantages in this quiet, in-house efficiency. administrator would
meaningfully increase either the income or the professionalism of the
set-up.
In the meantime the parent body, the Three Choirs Association, is in the
process of drawing up a three-year business plan. Friends of the festival
make donations, the odd legacy still makes its way in, and there is an
active organising ladies' committee. Slightly less promisingly, an Endowment
Scheme recently set up has only produced Pounds 26,000 to date, part of
which has been taken up with a new orchestral revolving platform and
improved staging.
The festival still seeks to innovate, if modestly. This year's programme
includes the European premiere of the American composer Dominick Argento's
large-scale Te Deum, plus a string orchestra commission from Robin Holloway.
The event would benefit, perhaps, from a closer study of its visiting
orchestras' repertoire, or linking in with the wide-ranging contemporary
groups and series such as the London Sinfonietta or Contemporary Music
Network. Each has been featured before. This week, amid jazz and Ivor
Novello favourites, the Composers' Ensemble brought songs from the wholly
contemporary Mary Wiegold Song Book. Above all, the festival needs to win
over and educate its audience, Rattle-style, to offer a ready ear to the
more innovative side of its repertoire. Without that there would have been
little Parry and still less Elgar.
Where the Three Choirs does score is in its commitment to second
performances - forgotten works like A Spring Canticle by the suffragette
Dame Ethel Smyth, not heard since its premiere here in 1926. Her memoirs,
'Impressions that Remained' were displayed in that same 'Bygones' shop
window. Impressions that remained of Worcester this week were of a friendly
series of events, often into the small hours, and very much alive.

STAND BEFORE YOUR GOD: GROWING UP TO BE A WRITER by Paul Watkins Faber
Pounds 14.99, 203 pages
'A WRITER of rare and precocious talent': this kind of glowing review and a
prize-studded career to date certainly support Paul Watkins' reputation as
one of today's most promising young writers. This 29-year-old author has
already published four novels. Two have received nominations for the Booker
Prize - the last, The Promise of Light, is currently being re-issued in
paperback - while his second, based on his experiences deep-sea fishing off
the New England coast, won the Encore Prize for the best second novel of the
year and is currently being made into a film.
The Promise of Light is set in 1921, the story of a young American who sets
out for Ireland to track down his family and walks straight into the
savagery of the Black-and-Tan war. Accompanying its publication comes
Watkins' autobiography, his tale of a homesick New Englander growing up
amidst the pillow-fights and puppy loves of an English public school.
Why is it that autobiographies seem to be written younger and younger these
days? Watkins' self-chronicle, with its lofty title, actually provides few
clues as to why he grew up to be a writer. His account of his years, first
at the Dragon School, then at Eton, is remembered in such vivid detail that
the reader is at first tempted to mistake immediacy for imagination. Watkins
loved his Action Man, for instance. He loved him 'saying Brave Things like
'Mission Accomplished - Good Work Men' when you pulled his cord away from
his chest.' He is distraught when he foxholes Action Man in the shrubbery
and he gets sliced to pieces by the groundman's rotary mower.
The trouble is that when his father, a real life Action Man, dies
prematurely from cancer, Watkins' growing-up seems to stop in the classroom.
Denied the chance to prove himself or to earn his rite of passage, it is as
though he is resigned to have to look out on to the grown-up world outside.
Watkins never says as much - perhaps he cannot, which is why the book is
strangely moving - but we glimpse it in the way the film of Michael Caine's
last-ditch stand against the Zulus gives him nightmares, or in the way a
First World War documentary leads him to spend a solitary school holiday
tramping around the battlefields of Ypres and Passchendaele. Here a ghostly
camaraderie envelops this fatherless adventurer, as if, among a league of
sleeping knights, he had momentarily earned his spurs: 'I felt a kind of
gentleness surround me in the mist. It was a sense of being looked at by
kind eyes and protected from harm.'
While the book may be psychologically revealing, it is rather
one-dimensional to read because Watkins never gets inside the experiences he
describes. Indeed, one's overwhelming impression is that he still inhabits
the mind-set of these schoolboy dramas of treachery and betrayal. One is
reminded, a touch unfairly, of Norman Mailer's remark about JD Salinger:
'the finest mind never to leave prep-school'.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Selling Weill at the Proms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the 1960s to the '80s, many classical musicians, music-lovers and
music-promoters saw Kurt Weill as the (dead) composer most likely to bring
together the distinct audiences for popular music and 'serious' concerts: a
consummation devoutly wished by many, if on hazy grounds. The Brecht-Weill
Threepenny Opera had been triumphantly resuscitated off-Broadway toward the
end of the 1950s, and 'Mack the Knife' reached the American hit-parade,
while a handful of other Weill songs became late-night listening - chiefly
on LPs by Lotte Lenya, Weill's widow - among sophisticated folk, especially
left-liberals.
Since anyone with a judicious ear could hear that Weill was much more than
just a tunesmith, and the smug European consensus that the (profitable)
music of his American exile represented an unworthy decline was already
passe, he seemed to offer a bridge across an embarrassing musical barrier.
Yet hardly anyone crossed it. The people who took to his catchiest
theatre-songs do not come to revivals of his harder, less ingratiating
pieces, and many of his highbrow admirers are still shy of admitting
Gershwin or Cole Porter to the same canon. The first of Wednesday's two Prom
concerts tried a brave new tack.
Conducting his Matrix Ensemble, Robert Ziegler offered a programme of jazz-
and black-influenced German music, comprising some unusually 'authentic'
Weill, his contemporary Wilhelm Grosz's cycle of Afrika-Songs, and Bernd
Alois Zimmermann's 1954 trumpet concerto on 'Nobody knows de trouble I see'
(typically troubled, looking-both-ways Zimmermann - serialism and modernism
v. honest Heart - pointedly delivered here by Hakan Hardenberger). Grosz's
1930 cycle displays impeccably decent sympathies, but also his incurable
knack for bland, memorable tunes, of the same ilk as his 'Red Sails in the
Sunset', though nobody remembers him for that.
The concert began with the Brecht-Weill Mahagonny-Songspiel. Not the hybrid
Kleine Mahagonny, which was amiably eked out with extra songs from their
later 'opera' Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (also about capitalist
temptations and catastrophe), but the original 1927 sequence of prickly
vocal numbers with acrid instrumental interludes. The emollient Grosz cycle
might have been chosen deliberately to set Weill's tougher virtues in proper
relief.
In the second half we had Cry, the Beloved Country, David Drew's
well-calculated arrangement of numbers from Weill's 'musical tragedy' Lost
in the Stars, for Broadway - not linked by any dialogue, but by sober
narration from Weill's and Maxwell Anderson's source, the celebrated South
African novel by Alan Paton. Drew's focus is clinically fixed on the larger
social issues, to decently wrenching effect; but Weill's own calculated vein
of American uplift is discreetly expunged, even to the starry-eyed
title-song.
Yet Drew, than whom nobody knows Weill's music better, would surely agreed
that the composer's best European theatre-music relied upon dramatic context
for its scathing ironies. (The most vicious people and their deeds got the
most elegant tunes.) It seems to me that the later Weill's Broadway shows
were just as meticulously planned wholes as before; can it be right simply
to jettison his 'sentimental', too-American stuff in favour of the
politically right-on numbers?
Among the vocal soloists in all this music Janis Kelly and Jake Gardner made
consistent marks, and Damon Evans pushed his light tenor hard enough to
score. Cynthia Clarey's equally light, pretty soprano was often threatened
by Weill's quaintly jazzy brass and saxes, like the supporting male quartet
in Mahagonny. Still, their plucky efforts were appealingly human. In the
second Prom of that evening, seven singers from Anthony Rooley's Consort of
Musicke were so practised, so elaborately subtle and balanced and secure
(and English) in Monteverdi's 6th Book of madrigals that I was driven to
imagining what flamboyant, volatile, self-advertising Italians might have
sounded like instead.

HOGARTH: ART AND POLITICS, 1750-1764 by Ronald Paulson Lutterworth Press
Pounds 35, 568 pages
RONALD Paulson's biography of Hogarth appeared originally in two volumes in
1971. In the intervening 22 years much further research on Hogarth and his
period has been accomplished. Not least by Paulson himself, who is Professor
of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Constantly widening
his already encyclopaedic knowledge of this artist, Paulson arrived some
time ago at a point where he has was moved to cover the whole ground again.
He was especially enlightened by spending a week at the Tate scrutinising
the Hogarths in the exhibition of 1971 before it opened.
In 1991 Paulson published the first volume of a greatly revised biography,
Hogarth: The Modern Moral Subject, 1697-1732 (Lutterworth Press Pounds 35)
and in 1992 the second, Hogarth: High Art and Low, 1732-1750 (Lutterworth
Press Pounds 35). With the appearance of this final volume, Paulson sets the
seal on a major work of scholarship that includes both interpretation of all
the works and biographical narrative.
Hogarth's paintings and engravings were executed over a time-span that
begins in the period of Addison's Spectator, which he regarded as a kind of
Bible, and continues through the high Augustan era of Pope and Swift into
the world of Dr Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith. Although not as phenomenally
successful as his younger rival Reynolds, Hogarth represents a much more
significant response to the political and cultural development of the
period. Queen Anne died when he was three; George III was on the throne when
Hogarth himself died, aged 67, in 1764.
There are many points at which his work touches on contemporary literature.
Fielding was a friend and colleague; both as a novelist and as a magistrate
he shared Hogarth's concern about public order and his dread of anarchy.
Smollett was an enemy who satirised Hogarth as Mr Pallett in Peregrine
Pickle. Sterne's way of writing fiction was positively Hogarthian. Defoe and
Richardson both come into the Hogarth story. John Cleland's Fanny Hill
derives from Hogarth. Paulson raises his eyebrows at the absence of any
tribute to Hogarth in Ian Watt's standard The Rise of the Novel and similar
studies.
Hogarth was likewise deeply into poetry. One of Hogarth's earliest works was
a set of illustrations for the verse satire that preceded those of Pope -
Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Hogarth's genius for ridicule was already
riotously in evidence here. Busy crowded woodcuts foreshadow his main
painterly innovation - a pictorial work in consecutive parts, delineating
the progress of an anti-hero, or an anti-heroine, containing coded
references to historical and contemporary people. The tradition of the
'political cartoon' later developed by Rowlandson and Gillray stems from
Hogarth.
The Hudibras illustrations were followed by The Harlot's Progress - a close
kinship here with The Beggar's Opera, which Paulson sees as the transitional
work of the whole period and which Hogarth also illustrated. Then came The
Rake's Progress - a set of paintings aimed at a single purchaser,
accompanied by a parallel edition of prints for popular consumption that
were sold to the public by Hogarth from his workshop on subscription. This
doubling of painting and print was his usual practice: the prints were not
mere copies but often differed in points of detail from their originals.
In London, where Hogarth lived for his entire life, we are fortunate that
much of his best work is easily accessible, not only in galleries like the
Tate but also in those institutions with which Hogarth was associated:
Captain Thomas Coram's hospital for Foundlings of which Hogarth was a
governor - he designed the children's uniform - and St. Bartholomew's
hospital. Above all, there are the 12 fine Hogarths purchased by that great
18th century collector, Sir John Soane, architect to the Bank of England.
They are on view in the Sir John Soane's Museum, 12 Lincoln's Inn Fields.
They consist of the eight original paintings of The Rake's Progress series
and four large canvases done in the last decade of Hogarth's life when he
was exercised by the corruption evident in party politics - An Election.
Paulson deals with this sequence in fascinating depth, showing the contempt
that Hogarth had both for the candidates and the mob.
It was not only party politics that preoccupied Hogarth at this time but
also the politics of art. As a youth he served his apprenticeship as a
silver-plate engraver; he left his master before completing his seven-year
indenture; then he became an assistant to Sir James Thornhill with whose
daughter Jane he eloped. Setting up on his own as an artist-dealer in 1720,
he was much concerned about the protection of engravers' copyrights in their
own prints against pirates and succeeded in getting legislation through
Parliament in favour of the artists. He was active as an instructor at the
re-formed St Martin's Lane Academy and he joined the newly founded Society
of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (now the RSA) where the first annual
exhibitions of paintings in London were held.
Led by Reynolds, many leading artists left the Society and lobbied for an
English Academy on the lines of those in France and Italy. When this
resulted in the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768, Hogarth parted
company from them. He opposed the emphasis the Academy put on the copying of
canonical Renaissance models (prescribed by Reynolds in his annual
Discourses to the students). By contrast Hogarth believed that they way
forward for art in England was by direct, honest, often scurrilously
subversive observation.
Much of Paulson's final volume is taken up with Hogarth's theory of art.
Hogarth expounded it himself in The Analysis of Beauty in 1750 both in a
text and in two engravings. His gesture against the formal symmetry of the
continental ideal was to point to the wavy line, the sinuous shape made by
the letter S, as the basis of the Beautiful. His first print shows a
painter's yard full of statues in S-shaped poses and surrounded on its
border by stays, furniture and other examples of the S-bend. The second
print shows the S-shape as formed in their movements by a group of dancers
at a ball who are doing a minuet. The shape is wayward and variable -
elements of variety and surprise were crucial to his theory of art. Looking
at a painting also implied search. The spectator is encouraged to observe
the picture closely and decode it.
Here Paulson is invaluable. His glosses on the proliferation of emblems and
allusions in Hogarth's work amount to a social history of the period. In his
concluding chapter Paulson deals with Hogarth's last drawing, Tail Piece or
The Bathos made in 1764. At this time Hogarth was under attack from the poet
Churchill and in contention with both Burke and Wilkes. He inscribed on it
in capitals the word FINIS, a sentiment that will now be echoed by his
biographer, with a justifiable sense of triumph.

THE VOICE OF THUNDER by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99,
229 pages
SIR LAURENS van der Post has led a life of adventure - soldier in the
jungles of the Far East, explorer of the deserts of Southern Africa, great
white hunter. Like a character in a John Buchan novel, he is equally at home
in tent and palace, welcomed, trusted and consulted as sincerely in Botswana
as in Belgravia.
Unlike the predecessors who trampled uncomprehendingly over local cultures,
he was sensitive and sympathetic. He understood that simple technology does
not imply simple minds; that peoples without books may share rich resources
of legendary traditions; and that those whose lives are precariously
balanced retain an understanding of the changing seasons, the vital force of
rain and sun, our kinship with animals, and other aspects of humanity which
are lost or obscured in the comfortable West.
Van der Post wrote marvellous books. He was quick to exploit television when
it was new and to help change old attitudes. To the post-imperial generation
brought up in this country after the war, as well as to recent
environmentalists and conservationists, Laurens van der Post is a modern
hero.
His new book The Voice of Thunder brings together two pieces written some
years ago,'The Little Memory' and 'The Great Memory', and a recent essay,
'The Other Journey'. The earlier pieces are classic van der Post, part
autobiography, part good yarn about the desert, interspersed with
observations and speculations about how the bushmen of the Kalahari see the
world and how we can share their wisdom.
The new essay has no narrative, it is an old man's meditation on the story
of the Odyssey, the perpetual cycle of departure, return and departure which
he sees as intrinsic to all lives.
As he has grown older, van der Post's mystical streak has become more
pronounced. He is sure he has a message to pass on, but it is hard to pin
down what exactly it is. The ancient Greeks would have recognised his awe at
the power of nature as a sense of the divine, Pan in the woods, Nereids in
the Ocean, without implying a personal deity or an intended discoverable
design. The romantic poets shared his vision of the mountains, the torrents
and the deserts as metaphors of the tempests and aridities of life. Jung,
whom van der Post knew personally, suggested the concept of the collective
unconscious, the cumulative effect of heredity and experience, which is
unique to each individual but of which a good deal is also shared with other
human beings.
Van der Post sees a revealed secret in the urge of the unconscious to become
conscious. Perhaps, he suggests elsewhere, everything in the universe is
synchronised. The metaphor of a journey can give shape to recurring patterns
in human lives. Mixing personal experience with fragments of science, myth
and literature, drawing on a quotation here and a famous name there, van der
Post constantly risks appearing banal and confused. He is a remarkable man,
but wonderment and benevolence are not, by themselves, enough to make a poet
or a philosopher.

THE MARRIAGE OF CADMUS AND HARMONY by Roberto Calasso Jonathan Cape Pounds
19.99, 403 pages
ROBERTO Calasso's The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony has been celebrated
around the world this year, and it is necessary to ask why. This is not just
a retelling of Greek myth, nor even a brilliant evocation of the classical
world. It offers itself as much more: a recreation of myth for the modern
imagination and so, in some sense, a new myth, composed both of the ancient
stories and of the meaning which a 20th century sensibility can make of
them.
This makes it a formidable blend of two kinds of minds that often exclude
each other - the poetic and the analytic - where the gods are both
overwhelmingly present and figures for thought. Calasso gives us the
original Greek myths and a reflection upon those myths, both story and
interpretation, image and commentary, sitting down side by side with each
other as once happened with gods and mortals until Cadmus brought the
alphabet to humanity and the gods withdrew into our indifference.
But why does it work? Primarily because Calasso is an enchanting
storyteller, weaving his tales together with all the craftsmanship of the
bard in the market place, bewitching his audience with iridescent images and
poignant dramas, then drawing them subtly into discussion and, suddenly,
secular perspective.
For instance, while he is giving us Europa barely lifted above the waves by
the shuddering bull, Zeus, in his race to Crete, Calasso mentions in passing
the Linear B tablets and the fact that all Cretan stories have a bull at the
beginning and the end. As he ranges from Homer through Pindar, Herodotus,
Ovid and many others to Nonnus, the little-known 5th century AD Hellenised
Egyptian writer, he achieves many fascinating insights into classical myths,
and into the nature and persistence of myth in general: as when Harmony,
trying but failing to resist marriage to Cadmus, understands 'that myth is
the precedent behind every action, its invisible, ever-present lining'. Or,
as the fate of Socrates showed, 'we enter the mythical when we enter the
realm of risk, and myth is the enchantment we generate in ourselves at such
moments.'
Yet the book seems to me to contain a danger which is probably inevitable
and a flaw which is not. The danger is that this particular style,
suspending all our disbelief, invites us to receive Calasso's
interpretations as a part of the story, and so to lose the difference
between the Greek and the modern eye, which has so much to teach us. When,
for example, following the entrancing story of Theseus and Ariadne, we read
that 'the heroic gesture of women is betrayal' and find Ariadne classed with
Antigone on the grounds that they were both the ruin of their cities, we may
wonder wearily if classical heroines are doomed to suffer the same fate as
Eve. 'Antigone betrays the law of her city to make a gesture of mercy toward
a dead man who does not belong to that city.' On the contrary, Sophocles'
emphasis is on the nobility of the sacrifice of her own life for love of her
brother against the tyrant Creon, the tragedy of individual value asserting
itself against the collective rule of law. Myths of other cultures offer a
unique perspective on our own culture and we have always to guard against
re-imagining them in the image of our own one-sidedness.
Another consequence of this blend of modes of discourse is that we have to
take the whole story just as he tells it, as, it might well be argued, we do
with any storyteller. But many of these characters are already known to us
and have a distinct place in the way we think of things. Without demanding
that there be only one version, are we not entitled to pursue these figures
independently in the other paths they take in the tales he tells? When only
the sources of direct quotations are given, but not the sources of reported
speech of which most of the book is composed, we cannot carry our
reflections further ourselves. The omission of an index (and a bibliography)
also limits the ways we can approach the book: perhaps Calasso is
frustrating any use of it as a dispassionate reference book; perhaps he's
trying to let the stories live on their own?
The flaw is that on occasion he takes the characters out of their separate
stories and makes them a composite character, spanning many centuries and
embracing incompatible extremes of behaviour, and this confuses the identity
of figures we know. He fails at times to honour the integrity of the
particular poems and stories which first gave the figures their habitation
and their names. In this way, he allows myth to subsume literature,
forgetting that it is literature that gives voice to myth.
Myth then becomes a generalisation from literature instead of emerging as a
certain depth of resonance in poem and painting which allows an opening into
the mythic realm. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for instance, which he
relates beautifully and at length, so that we enter with delight the
particular imaginative world of the seventh century BC poem, is suddenly
interrupted with the goddess Demeter's giving of herself 'illicitly' to King
Celeus, according to an obscure scholiast, Gregory of Nazianzus, a
fourth-century AD saint. We have instantly to abandon the Demeter of the
Hymn whose awesome presence, when she revealed herself, terrified Celeus and
all the sons of Eleusis into building her a temple immediately.
Even more disturbing are Calasso's several stories of Odysseus, where he
moves from one to the other without indication. But Homer's Odysseus is not
the same Odysseus as Ovid's; those yet to read the Odyssey will not be
assisted by first learning of Penelope as a 'whorish fox' and the mother of
Pan, from Lycophron 400 years later (who he?). This skimming across stories,
all apparently of equal weight, may do for a sociology of myth but stops
working once we engage with art.
These reservations are not intended to diminish Calasso's achievement in
bringing the classical world to life. That the book has rapidly been
translated into many languages points not just, in the waning of our
Christian age, to a release of the old myths, once dismissed as pagan
ignorance and excess; nor only to a vital reclaiming of classical culture in
a time when Latin is no longer compulsory and Greek is rarely studied. Maybe
it has also kindled a recognition that myths, telling a universal story,
survive the death of the particular culture which first told them, simply
because they belong to our specifically human inheritance. As the American
mythologist Joseph Campbell once put it: 'The latest incarnation of Oedipus,
the continued romance of Beauty and the Beast, stands this afternoon on the
corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic
light to change.'

RIDER HAGGARD AND THE LOST EMPIRE by Tom Pocock Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds
20, 263 pages
IN 1885 a young Norfolk barrister called Rider Haggard, who had an
adventurous spell in South Africa already behind him, took a bet from his
brother that he could not match a new best-seller called Treasure Island. In
the two years that followed, in a well-nigh unbelievable burst of creative
and imaginative energy, Haggard wrote and published King Solomon's Mines,
Allan Quatermain, Jess and She.
After that, it is hardly surprising that the remaining 38 years can sound
anti-climactic, although they were undeniably distinguished, successful and
lucrative. Tom Pocock, who is a veteran Fleet Street journalist and an
experienced biographer, has produced a brusque, no-nonsense, no-padding life
story of a fascinating man in which he acknowledges that his aim has been to
concentrate not so much on the novelist as on the public servant, above all
on the visionary of the British Empire.
This is the first biography for over ten years and it tells a fairly
familiar tale to good effect. The boy was denied a gentleman's education by
his Norfolk squire father and sent off to South Africa in 1875, in time to
hoist the Union Jack over Pretoria in the British annexation of the
Transvaal - and also to meet a certain Umslopagaas and fall for the Zulus.
He became the youngest Registrar of the High Court, farmed ostriches in the
middle of the first Anglo-Boer War, and came home to the boredom of
barristers' chambers where he found rapid fame and fortune with his
Africa-inspired fantasies.
After some years of this, Mr Pocock claims, Haggard realised he had
perfected a novelist's formula which was a licence to print money, and for
the rest of his life he churned out the fiction - he wrote 58 novels, most
of which are utterly forgotten today - while getting on with his real
interests. He was passionately concerned about agricultural reform, land
settlement, and the future of the Empire.
He was no blimp and certainly not a conventional Tory. But he believed in
'the divine right of a great civilising people'; he wrote, 'on only one
condition . . . have we the right to take the black man's land, and that is
that we provide them with an equal and just Government, and allow no
maltreatment of them . . . but on the contrary do our best to elevate them
and wean them from savage customs. Otherwise the practice is surely
indefensible.' His imperialism linked logically with his concern for the
health of British agriculture, which was central to the empire's economy.
His particular concern was to promote the (white) peopling of the Empire -
'the great house with the empty rooms', as he once put it in a vivid phrase
 -and he served, unpaid, on a long sequence of royal commissions and the
like, travelling the world to promote policies which were almost all
rejected by Westminster.
After the death of his beloved nine-year-old son, his life was gloomy:
Pocock is good on the pessimism, in the post-1918 years, of upper-class
imperialists like Haggard and his great friend Kipling. Meanwhile Haggard
supported Lily, the First Great Love so often glimpsed in his novels, in a
house in Aldeburgh (later to be occupied by Britten and Pears) as she
disintegrated, Ayesha-like, from the syphilis her husband, Haggard's rival,
had given her.
All of this is well enough done, but Mr Pocock must have realised that he is
in danger of having written Hamlet without the Prince. The truth is that
Haggard is principally interesting because he wrote a sequence of remarkable
fictions which, a hundred years later, continue to haunt our imagination
(Pocock's title, with its echo of Haggard's influence on present-day dramas
like Indiana Jones, suggests that he admits this). See Pocock's glancing
reference to She, where he merely footnotes a reference to the book's later
interest for Jungians and Freudians and then skidaddles away: this really
won't do, we deserve to be told just a little more. To ignore the books,
without whose existence we would not be reading this biography, becomes
perverse: I cannot believe that Haggard was so uninvolved in these tales
which he dictated every day, and I begin to doubt whether Mr Pocock has
actually read many of the novels he lists - but that, I am sure, is an
unworthy thought.
Let us remind ourselves, then, that Haggard was a popular novelist of genius
who also happened to be a Norfolk farmer and a man of public affairs. In
that order. Let's remember the best of his novels are unforgettable because
their resonances and references belong to the world of universal myth. As CS
Lewis once wrote, 'Haggard's best work will survive because . . . a great
myth is relevant as long as the predicament of humanity lasts.' Less
elegantly, VS Pritchett has written of Haggard letting down a suction pump
into the Unconscious. It would be good to read more about this and less
about Sir Rider's activities for the Royal Colonial Institute in 1916.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Sport: The virtues of straight bat and twisting ball -
Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTIFIED by my small son's return from a cricket coaching course stiff with
straight bat instructions, I watched the Oval Test with renewed admiration
for the Australian batting. Not that the Oval displayed this at its best; no
less than three of the tourists gave their second innings wickets away with
ill-judged hooks or pulls. But there were still many examples of the
correctness that has distinguished and strengthened Australian batting this
summer.
'Play forward and play straight with bat and pad together.' This principle
of safety is obviously as central in Australian first class coaching as it
is in the coaching my son received. So much the better for Australia.
When they attacked, accomplished batsmen such as Mark Waugh and David Boon
sometimes branched out into a repertoire of more individualistic shots. But
most of the time the middle and lower order played straight and did well out
of it.
Never one to miss fame as a wild and swinging exception, Merv Hughes got
himself out for 12 runs with a wayward hook in his second innings at the
Oval, making a total of 999 runs in his Test career. Most likely he could
not resist having a go at the English bowling. It had little of the ferocity
with which Curtly Ambrose's seven for 25 and Ian Bishop's six for 40
devastated the Australians at Perth and won the West Indies v Australia
series last winter.
England at the Oval were a milder proposition. They were slow, as they have
been all summer long, to remove the Australian tail. Even with the match
well in England's favour, they could not prevent bowlers Paul Reiffel and
Shane Warne putting on a ninth wicket partnership of 74, before Angus Fraser
finally took both wickets.
That is why Devon Malcolm is at once a healthy and a difficult transfusion.
He failed to blast out any tail-enders at the Oval, probably because he
concentrated on pace at the expense of length and accuracy. He bowled a fair
bit of rubbish, some exotic, some just misguided, all fast. Openers Michael
Slater and Mark Taylor both looked distinctly alarmed by Malcolm's bowling,
which Atherton used rightly, in short, erratic, frightening bursts.
I doubt if destiny meant Malcolm to be England's perfectly controlled modern
answer to the West Indies' Whispering Death, Michael Holding, but his
aggression did sharpen England's bowling attack. Pity the Ashes were already
lost. Australia too lacked real pace this summer.
Hughes bowled tirelessly, cleverly, with variation and quite but not really
fast. With an unfit Craig McDermott flown home early in the tour to
convalesce in the shade of the Queensland gum trees, Hughes was left to
spearhead a bowling attack consisting only of himself, Reiffel and relief
bowler Steve Waugh, punctuated now and then by apprentices Brendon Julian
and Wayne Holdsworth.
Australia's bowling strength was their spin, especially Warne's leg-spin. On
different occasions his corkscrew spinners removed old hands Mike Gatting
and Graham Gooch with balls that twisted across behind their legs to hit the
stumps. For Robin Smith, spin is bad news; leg-spin is disaster. He never
had a chance to play his shots because he could never follow the ball.
With Ian Salisbury not playing, England had no leg-spin reply. A sad feature
of English bowling in this series was its lack of occasional bowling, which
can be a useful hidden weapon. Atherton used to bowl a few leg-spinners, as
did another English opening batsman, Bob Barber, a generation before him, to
good effect. Occasional bowling often serves to break up long partnerships.
Gooch always seemed to distrust it. He did not like trying out his own
offerings of slow medium pace, even while Steve Waugh was claiming English
victims with his.
I was glad to see Atherton try Graham Hick's off-breaks against Australia.
They are full length, slow and floating, aggressive because they are
tempting, and add an element of the unexpected to the bowling. England's
main off-spinner this summer, Peter Such, bowled efficiently and
economically, but in the later games it looked as if he saw his job as
containing rather than trapping and he gave the ball little air or flight.
A partner in spin at the other end would have helped him develop his
bowling, as Warne helped off-spinner Tim May in the Australian team. The
more May played, the more he tossed the ball up and the more tricks he
tried, his wicket-keeper poised to profit.
Slow bowlers and quick keepers are mutually flattering. I do not think Ian
Healy is a great keeper, but he is one whose close work with his spinners is
building up confidence all round. A keeper who can bat well, as Healy did,
to England's cost, generates more initiative in a team than a batsman who
can keep wicket if necessary, like Alec Stewart.
Stewart was good-humoured about his failure to take over the captaincy from
Gooch. His light-footed batting was a pleasure to watch and with a steady
batting position, preferably as opener, his defiant shots might demoralise
some of the West Indian fast bowlers.
Stewart is a superb fielder and I would like to see him freed from behind
the stumps. Then he would perform fewer of the premature celebrations and
histrionic appeals at which he excelled this summer.
Both England and Australia used these tactics constantly to try and persuade
umpires to raise the dismissal finger. Though I doubt if they were
responsible for producing what seemed to me to be an unusually high number
of questionable and mistaken decisions, they must have unsettled both
umpires and players.
I regard false appeals as a lower form of sporting life, unworthy of
cricket. Caught behind is one of a modern umpire's nightmares. With so much
medium pace bowling relying on swing and bounce for its wickets, no-one
knows for certain whether the ball touched the bat, re-plays are often no
help and only the umpire can decide, to the inevitable disapproval of either
bowler or batsman.
In his second innings at the Oval, Michael Slater suffered a caught behind
decision where the fatal touch was right up on his elbow and, in sporty mood
with the Ashes safely secured, said: 'It's just one of those things.'
Next time England want good relations but from a differently tilted balance
of success. Their Oval victory, though not crucial and slightly false in a
way, was good for their crushed morale. A touch of pace, a turn of spin and
a thoughtful captain . . .

FT  28 AUG 93 / Sport: Courier faces the heat again - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST great traditional event of the year, the US Open, starts next week
in New York with record prizemoney of just over Dollars 9m, more than double
what it was five years ago. There is equal prizemoney for men and women (an
absurdity, this) and the two champions will each win Dollars 535,000.
Not that the players will be thinking about the money when they play. They
never do; pride and ambition predominate. But there is an unusual sense of
expectancy this year, at least among the men, where the battle for the No 1
spot is still raging fiercely. There is no clear leader. The three Grand
Slam championships have produced three different winners, though the doughty
American, Jim Courier, has been in in all three finals.
Last January he beat Sweden's Stefan Edberg in the sweltering heat of
Melbourne. Then, on another hot day in Paris, he surprisingly lost the
French title he had held for two years to Sergi Bruguera. At Wimbledon, on
yet another scorching afternoon, fellow American Pete Sampras beat Courier -
narrowly - on fast grass.
Will Courier triumph at Flushing Meadow to stamp himself unquestionably as
the man of the year? That is a teasing question. The seedings say he will:
having regained the world No 1 ranking with his victory last week at
Indianapolis, the 23-year-old Floridian is the official favourite.
Yet this normally rock-hard competitor has displayed a soft centre at key
moments this year, as he has done for the last two years in New York. In
1991, after storming through to the final, he was thrashed by Edberg with
the finest tennis I have ever seen from the Swede. Last year Sampras
thwarted him in the semi-final. Perhaps Courier's fine win over Becker last
Sunday in Indianapolis will give him the confidence.
Sampras knows all about confidence - or rather, lack of it. In Indianapolis
he was shattered by a 7-6 6-7 7-6 quarter-final loss to the 20-year-old
Australian Patrick Rafter, ranked at 139. That defeat lost Sampras the top
ranking and demoted him to the No 2 seeding next week.
Having now glanced at the draw, Sampras must feel that the fates are against
him. Whereas Courier has the quietest section, with No 15 seed Cedric
Pioline of France as his fourth round opponent, at the bottom Sampras must
face Andre Agassi. Even though the erratic but colourful 1992 Wimbledon
champion, described by Alistair Cooke as 'the Las Vegas lollipop', has
slipped to No 16, he will have a tremendous following among New York's crazy
fans. Of course, both must win their first three rounds, but on the evidence
of Thursday's draw that seems likely.
If he survives, Sampras will probably have a quarter-final against in-form
Michael Chang who won in Cincinnati two weeks ago. In seven meetings since
1989 Pete has won only once. That was on a fast indoor carpet in Paris two
years ago. In their five matches on hard courts Pete has won only one set.
This is a psychological block that goes back to their junior days. Pete's
best hope is that the powerful Czech left-hander Petr Korda (9) or last
year's quarter-finalist, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, who meet in a
testing first round match, will beat Chang first.
The holder, Edberg, is also in the tougher bottom half. Seeded No 3 and as
delighted with life as any new father, Stefan faces a fourth round meeting
with an old enemy, Alexander Volkov. The 14th seeded Russian upset Edberg
dramatically in the first round in 1990. The winner is due to face Michael
Stich, seeded No 6, another who always gives Edberg trouble. The German has
won three of their last four meetings.
The top half, though weaker overall, has its strong sections. Below Courier
are the tall Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev (8), a winner of three titles already
in 1993, and the tall Dutchman, Richard Krajicek (10). They have met twice.
Last February Krajicek won indoors and in April Medvedev prevailed on clay.
However, Krajicek could easily lose to his probable third round opponent,
Todd Martin. The fast-improving Martin has risen to a career-high ranking of
17.
The continuing absence of defending champion Monica Seles has robbed the
women's game of any real interest. Since Seles was stabbed at court-side in
April, Steffi Graf has dominated. She has won seven tournaments this year
and should add an eighth in New York.
But perhaps Martina Navratilova will give us a last hurrah. At the age of
36, Navratilova should not really be capable of taking this title for the
fifth time. But how do you write off someone who won her eighth Los Angeles
title recently to bring her career record of tournament victories to 165?
I am particularly looking forward to the first live use of TEL on four of
the show courts. This automatic line call system is the first to cover all
the lines of the court. After pressure from the players there will be
linesmen, too - a sensible decision which should rule out any uncertainty on
those calls beyond the system's 1ft range.
HOW THE SEEDS WOULD MEET
MEN
1 Courier v 15 Pioline; 10 Krajicek v 8 Medvedev; 4 Becker v 13 Lendl; 11
Ivanisevic v 5 Bruguera; 6 Stich v 12 Muster; 14 Volkov v 3 Edberg; 7 Chang
v 9 Korda; 16 Agassi v 2 Sampras.
WOMEN
1 Graf v 13 Pierce; 15 Coetzer v 5 Sabatini; 4 Martinez v 11
Maleeva-Fragniere; 9 Huber v 8 Novotna; 7 Capriati v 10 M Maleeva; 12 Sukova
v 3 Navratilova; 6 M J Fernandez v 16 Garrison Jackson; 14 Tauziat v 2
Sanchez-Vicario.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Motoring: VW updates little and large
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE major international motor shows in Frankfurt, London and Tokyo draw
near, the steady trickle of new models turns into a flood. The latest are
the Volkswagen Passat and Golf cabriolet. Britons will have their first
chance to see them at the London show (October 21-31) some weeks after they
have made their debut at Frankfurt, which opens to the public on September
11.
Neither car will go on sale in the UK until early next year.
When the Passat appeared in the mid-1980s, it was bigger and heavier than
any previous Volkswagen car. At its launch in Britain, VW made the point
amusingly in a television commercial: a Passat fell through a floor that had
supported a Golf.
Owners, however, have appreciated its solid construction and, in the case of
the Variant estate, massive carrying capacity. It is a worthy car; so worthy
that I have always felt guilty at finding it rather dull.
If the present Golf cabriolet - still one of the darlings of the young and
trendy - was a person, they would call it a wrinkly. It is based on the
original Golf and has been around since 1979. But it has proved highly
successful; Germans alone bought 100,000 last year.
The Cabrio was tough and, by open car standards, very safe. The body shook
far less than any contemporary's on imperfect roads. A stout roll-over bar
protected occupants if it overturned. Its down-side was a minute boot,
cramped rear seats and a soft top that, while made beautifully, stood as
high from the body when folded as that of a second world war German staff
car.
The new Cabrio, based on the latest Series III Golf, still has a roll-over
protection bar (VW says it would not make an open car without one). Boot and
rear passenger space is more generous and the body feels even more rigid
than before. The hood sticks up hardly at all when folded and power
operation is an extra-cost option.
Driving it in Germany this week, I was impressed by the lack of wind noise
or buffeting at quite high speeds. The Cabrio comes with 75, 90 and 115
horsepower engines and a five-speed gearbox with a shift matching the
highest Japanese standards of delicacy and precision.
Britain will have only the 90 and 115 hp versions, which will be available
with four-speed automatic transmission, but the two-pedal, 115 hp Cabrio was
my favourite. Its probable cost will be close to Pounds 17,500 against a
manual 90 bhp version's Pounds 14,500.
The Passat for 1994 has had a mid-life face-lift. A proper radiator grille
has re-appeared by customer demand. But while styling changes make it look a
little curvier, it is still too bland to turn many heads. Enhanced passive
safety features include air-bags for driver and front passenger and
seat-belts that tighten on impact, both as standard equipment.
Two of the most interesting features of the new Passats are the availability
of Sycro four-wheel drive (initially, only in a 115 hp Variant estate) and a
90 hp, direct-injection turbo-diesel. This engine, first seen in the Audi
80, cannot equal the near-silence at low speeds of a Citroen Xantia's or
Peugeot 306's indirect-injection turbo-diesel, but it is a spirited
performer which is quiet over about 30 mph (50 kmh) and promises
class-leading fuel economy.
The Passats, which have a pleasing, solid feel, can have anything from 75 hp
petrol or diesel four-cylinder engines to a 174 hp petrol V6. Right-hand
drive models arrive in Britain next January at forecast prices in the Pounds
13,000-Pounds 22,000 band.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Gardening: Magnificent magnolia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEKEND sees the abrupt end of the yearly return on my garden's
longest-running investment. I do not mean the swimming pool, which has now
drowned its yearly quota of hedgehogs and is staying open in the hope of
drowning a few squirrels. I mean my magnolia. Magnolia grandiflora has
opened, flowered and turned brown, leaving me wondering if the wait has been
worth it.
Experts have no doubt. In his classic book, The Well Tempered Garden,
Christopher Lloyd writes that this magnolia: 'is the shrub for whose sake
any outmoded old parsonage, however riddled with dry rot, should be acquired
with enthusiastic pride.' In my case the old vicarage came first, then the
dry rot, and then the magnolia.
I am a magnolia missionary, and missionaries usually have been converted,
too. Twenty-two years ago, I was converted by a single grandiflora which had
grown to the eaves of a great Elizabethan manor of pinkish stone in
Somerset, where it released occasional flowers from the candle-shaped buds.
the Elizabethans would never have seen a grandiflora. Its home is in the
American south and it did not arrive in west country gardens until the early
18th century (although another fine evergreen, Virginia, got to England
before 1700 and can still be seen in quantity in Florida, even on swampy
ground).
Grandiflora also migrated to the Mediterranean. Perhaps it occurred only in
the 19th century. It certainly suited the migrant. In England, a grandiflora
may produce one flower to every square yard of greenery. In Italy, they are
mesmeric, growing freely in the open to the height of tall trees in the
parks of great villas from the Veneto to Tuscany.
In England, we have to wait for flowers until summer and, even then, they
appear only if you have observed an essential warning. Grandifloras grow
freely from seed, but seedlings vary and, in Britain, most refuse to flower.
Christopher Lloyd referred in 1970 to one seedling, probably aged 50, which
had still to flower for the first time.
The only way to buy a grandiflora is to buy one grown from a cutting off a
proven flowerer. Cheap stock is useless. I had often suspected that the
Italians would simply sow seed and get away with it in their hotter
sunshine. But as you drive from Pisa airport into Florence your first, fine
foreign impressions are the nurseries which grow big grandifloras, trees
which the great Italian artists never saw.
I did my homework six years ago. In his useful book Three Gardens, the great
plantsman, Graham Thomas, prefaces his usual lists of plants with chapters
of brief reminiscences. He describes the evergreen magnolia which had been
picked for his new garden: it was a newcomer, called Maryland. Even in its
second year, it was bearing several flowers.
'There was I,' says Thomas, 'revelling in the lemon fragrance of great
globes of cream, with no need to administer potash or any other plant
medicine.'
In 1988, I ordered my Maryland, paid a suitably high price and put it,
facing south, between two windows. Maryland is not a pure grandiflora but it
has the best of both American bloodlines. One parent is grandiflora, the
other Virginia. It is a southerner on both sides of the blanket but,
nonetheless, it is supposed to flower before all others.
After three years, I started to notice growth, not flower. Thomas did refer
to 'great bulk' for Marylands of the future, although his check-list
indicates only 'eight feet by seven feet.' In its sixth season, mine is 10ft
high already, bulging forwards, branching sideways, and grating testily
against the windows whenever the wind moves the side branches. Everybody is
adamant that these magnolias should not be pruned, and Lloyd even says
owners should sit indoors in gloom rather than cut their way out.
In the fifth year I had one flower, and this year we have gone ex-dividend
at three, which I would represent as a tripling of output if I was writing a
report for the market. But this result is not Maryland as Thomas describes
it.
Like many others, I think I have bought Exmouth, although they asked for it
and I did not. Exmouth is a respectable senior citizen: the first batch of
grandifloras in England all died in frost late in the 1730s, and one of the
few which re-established was in an Exmouth garden in Devon. At the time,
nurserymen travelled happily to pay five guineas for a slice of the tree.
Exmouth is supposed to flower within seven years, so I suppose that mine
could be warming up. Meanwhile, what can we all do about that persistent
problem, reluctance to flower on this great evergreen?
Perhaps you own a seedling from the past which has virtually no intentions
of flowering. If so, you should curse the previous owner and decide if you
are sufficiently fond of leaves alone. Otherwise, you can try heavy
dressings of potash, applied in springtime, or some artful pruning.
It is no use cutting back the top growth because you will only stimulate
more growth and delay its ripening into wood for flowers. Instead, you might
try ringing. You should cut away a strip of outer bark, about a  1/2 in
wide, near the base of the tree and run it three-quarters of the way round
the trunk.
The job is best done early in the year as its aim is to prevent too much sap
from rising and forming leaves, not flowers, above. The strip should not be
taken too deeply, and on no account should you continue the ring right round
the trunk and allow the ends to meet. Otherwise, you will cut off sap
altogether.
The final option is to be more insistent than I was and to profit from the
intervening years of demand. Maryland is scarce but sometimes available, and
if you insist on seeing it and having it verified, you might be looking at
cream globes in 1996.
If you start the hunt, do not let the price deter you: if you track the
right variety, you are saving yourself between five and 20 years' delay. It
is no use complaining at the price of a short-cut to one of the best scents
in the world.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Property: Racing prospect falls in the selling stakes -
Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE SALES completed in July showed a predictable seasonal decline from
June levels, according to the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index, but
the market is still gaining strength.
Contracts exchanged in July for later settlement were at a peak for 1993,
with a 3.2 per cent increase over June, and sales were 3.4 per cent up on
July 1992 when the imminent ending of the chancellor of the exchequer's
stamp duty holiday provided an artificial boost.
Sensibly priced property will sell quickly to eager buyers. In the
Cotswolds, the Old Forge at Windrush went recently for a little over the
asking price of Pounds 190,000 (through Hurley Lloyd Thorpe, at
Stow-on-the-Wold). The Lewes office of Strutt &amp; Parker sold two houses at
East Hoathly, Sussex, for more than Pounds 400,000 on the same day: the Gate
House (asking price over Pounds 425,000) and Spring Place (Pounds 395,000
for the house, with 37 acres extra).
Further north, however, joint agents Blenkin, of York, and DTZ Debenham
Thorpe, of Wetherby, report that the Hambleton House racing stables near
Thirsk, Yorkshire, with 25 loose boxes and 175 acres of gallops where Noel
Murless and Jack Calvert have trained, did not make the Pounds 400,000
asked. The stables will be back in business soon.
CENTRAL LONDON has led the consolidation of the British property market
since the pound was devalued on Black Wednesday in September last year and
interest rates fell. Now, the market is suffering from a distinct lack of
prime properties.
This has, however, not stopped Lassmans from selling 6 Farm Street, Mayfair,
near the Jesuit church, for near the asking price of Pounds 1.7m for a
95-year lease.
The country market is more difficult. What is the right price for the
handsome Buxted Park near Uckfield, East Sussex, now a country house hotel?
The electrical trades union EEPTU bought the 1726, Grade II-listed mansion
in 1987 for Pounds 6m for the use of its members and others. Before that, it
had been a health hydro and the UK home of the ruler of Abu Dhabi.
The EEPTU, now part of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union,
refurbished it lovingly and opened it as a country house hotel in 1989. But
it started in difficult times.
Buxted Park has yet to show a profit despite having conferences, a health
club and all the conveniences guests/comrades could wish - such as a
ballroom; private cinema holding 53; large, heated outdoor pool; park with a
herd of fallow deer, and scintillating chandeliers. Inquiries to Savills
(071-499 8644).
LITERARY HOUSES put a gleam in agents' eyes. You never know who will apply.
On the north side of Hyde Park, 46 Albion Street is a typical London terrace
house with four floors, a garden, and a blue plaque in honour of the
novelist William Makepiece Thackeray. It was his mother's and stepfather's
house and he went to live there in 1837 with his bride Isabella (and, soon
after, their child Anne). Chestertons Residential (071-262-5060) offers it
for Pounds 525,000 freehold.
LOVE LIFE in the Bloomsbury Group was more complicated. Savills in Ipswich
(0473-226191) and Durrants of Halesworth (0986-873797) are selling the
half-timbered Grange at Wissett, Suffolk, where Vanessa Bell lived in 1916
with David Garnett and Duncan Grant after separating from Clive Bell. Her
sister, Virginia Woolf, wrote: 'Wissett seems to lull asleep all ambition -
don't you think they have discovered the secret of life?' Available for
Pounds 250,000.
WOOLBEDING GLEBE near Midhurst, West Sussex, a splendid 1747-cum-1877 old
rectory with a garden running down to the river Rother, has links to a minor
Victorian literary figure. The Rev. Francis Bourdillon, author of 'The night
has a thousand eyes' (in the Oxford Book of Victorian Verse), lived there as
rector from 1855 to 1875.
His successor enlarged the house, adding a substantial library. Now, it
boasts a swimming pool as well. Set in glorious country (much of which is
owned by the National Trust), Woolbeding Glebe is on sale from Jackson-Stops
in Midhurst (0730-812357) for Pounds 1.25m.
WESTWARDS, in Hampshire, Jane Austen and her brother Edward lived at
Chawton, near Alton, from 1809. Her house on the estate belongs to the Jane
Austen Memorial Trust and is open to the public but the big house, Chawton
House, is in poor condition.
Its sale last week (with the adjacent Old Manor House and 275 acres of park
and farm land) to the Leonard X. Bosack and Bette M. Kruger Foundation of
the US should, however, ensure its survival. The foundation will restore
house and gardens as a centre for the study of women writers. The asking
price with agent Humberts Leisure was Pounds 1.25m.
ONE FAMILY has farmed at Wested Farm at Crockenhill, near Swanley, since
1908. Its 719 acres are 20 miles from London and a mile from the M25 and
M20, Now arable, it used to be in fruit, vegetables and dairy cattle and
could easily return to them. A tithe barn incorporates a cold store holding
80 tonnes and there are the necessary cottages and a farm manager's house.
One of the lots is a ground let for Pounds 1 a year to the local football
club. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) looks for more than Pounds 2m for
the property as a whole.
THE FALL IN prices since the 1980s, cuts in interest rates and inflation,
and higher earnings for people with jobs have made houses more affordable
than for many years. One unexpected consequence, says the Royal Institute of
Chartered Surveyors, is that some buyers are ignoring the usual first step
on the housing ladder - studios and one-bedroom flats. They are going
straight to flats with two and three bedrooms and houses big enough for
children.
DO YOU FANCY your very own tax haven? Then try Brecqhou, which lies just off
Sark, in the Channel Islands. It is 1,000 yards long, 600 yards wide and
rises to 240 feet with a manor house, dower house, four cottages, paddocks,
helicopter pad and small harbour. Supplies arrive by an aerial cable trolley
from Sark, useful in bad weather.
The price from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Lovell and Partners (0481-723 636)
is over Pounds 3.5m (at least some of which surely could be recouped from
the tax savings) and the new owner gets the whole 80-acre island.
He also qualifies for a seat in the Chief Pleas, Sark's parliament, as well
as joining its government (known as the Quarantine).

FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: New tracks along the Silk Road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STALIN and Mao never trusted one another, even when China and the Soviet
Union were allies. So their plan to link China and the Soviet Union by rail
through central Asia was never realised.
Not, that is, until the 1980s. By then the Sino-Soviet dispute was history,
and people on both sides of the frontier were thinking more about trade than
politics. So the Chinese revived the idea of a central Asian rail link. They
went further, and proposed a new trans-continental rail link joining Europe
with China, the North Sea to the Yellow Sea.
The proposal involved building a railway line across the mountainous border
between the city of Urumqi in the far west of China and Kazakhstan: the
railway Stalin and Mao never built. Last December 1 the rail link was
inaugurated, and amid much pomp and ceremony the first freight train left
the Chinese port of Lianyungang on the Yellow Sea, bound for Rotterdam.
There is not yet a trans-continental passenger express on the route. But
there is a good second-best: a new express train from China to Kazakhstan,
leaving Urumqi for Alma Ata every Tuesday morning. This train ride along the
old Silk Road is irresistible - for us, anyway.
To travel on the Urumqi-Alma Ata express, our first step was to get to
Urumqi. We had a choice between flying from Peking or stopping off along the
old Silk Road en route. We chose the second.
We flew from Peking to Dunhuang, site of the world's finest Buddhist cave
murals, and then took a train across the desert to the oasis town of Turfan.
There we visited mosques, bargained for Uygur carpets, rode camels and
climbed sand dunes (harder than it sounds). Then we hired a car and drove
north-west to Urumqi.
For three hours we sped through the northern outskirts of the Taklamakan
desert, the most awesome and barren mass of land in Asia. Then we wound
through the pass between the gaunt and forbidding Tian Shan, the Mountains
of Heaven. At last we drove down into the suburbs of modern Urumqi, now a
bustling centre of frontier trade and tourism.
In the railway station at Urumqi the following Tuesday morning a sign in
Chinese proudly pointed the way to 'International Trains.' There was only
one train from Urumqi fitting that description. That was our express.
The carriages were smartly painted in green with yellow clover-leaf friezes.
According to a plate on the undercarriage, they were made in Halle, eastern
Germany.
Our compartment was spotlessly clean - an echo of the immaculate days of
Chairman Mao - and contained two couchettes, a table and a teapot. Every so
often our Kazakh carriage attendant would replenish the pot from a
state-of-the-art samovar at the end of the corridor. He wore a stiff peaked
cap and stood to attention outside his carriage when the train stopped at
stations. Otherwise he lay on his bunk in his vest.
The journey was a leisurely trip through space and time.
The Han Chinese faces of city people in Urumqi gave way to the more homely
features of the minorities - Uygur, Kazakh and others - to be found in
western China away from the main urban centres. Portraits of small-town
frontier life passed our train windows.
Gradually, more and more Russian faces could be seen, rough-hewn at first,
then more finely drawn. The landscape began to change, too. The land became
more fertile, and vistas of barren mountains and brown stone wastelands gave
way to fields of cotton and grain.
Our neighbours in the next compartment were too busy to observe all this.
They were a delegation of Chinese railway workers earnestly preparing for a
visit to the railway ministry in Moscow. Their interpreter was a
warm-hearted Chinese woman who had learned Russian in the 1950s, in the
heyday of the Sino-Soviet alliance. She had not spoken or read the language
for years, and now she was eager to brush away the cobwebs and start again.
With this in mind she helped us get to grips with the timetable posted in
the corridor of the carriage. This was not so easy to do. It was not at all
clear why the train was scheduled to take 10 hours at the frontier going one
way, and four hours the other. Finally we worked out the answer: the
timetable, issued by the government of Kazakhstan and printed in Russian,
showed Moscow time.
From Urumqi to the border the train carried a Chinese dining car. By the
time we found our way there the car's stock of local beer had been consumed,
as we could see from the ruddy complexions of the diners. So we washed down
our spiced meats and vegetables with a pink fortified wine from the Turfan
vineyards.
Later, across the border, we found a Kazakh dining car in which we drank
Russian champagne and dined on a banquet for the princely sum of Dollars 1
(our first experience of the collapsing rouble).
The border crossing from China to Kazakhstan was an elaborate affair.
Mercifully, it took place at night, so we slept through most of it. There
was much bumping and grinding as the carriages were adjusted to the broad
Russian gauge, and much striding and searching as frontier guards and
customs officers examined every inch of the train. Clearly they had been
brought up to exercise authority the old way. At the same time they were
trying to adjust to their changing role in the new era.
'Passports] Papers]' the Chinese customs officer snapped officiously as he
flung open our door. But then he sat down and chatted for 20 minutes about
China's open-door policy and investment prospects.
We received much the same treatment from the intent-looking Russian woman
who rushed in waving a sheaf of forms. 'Kazakh Aids certificate - government
regulations]' she declared grimly. When we shook our heads and explained our
ignorance, she smiled sweetly and hurried into the night.
As we approached Alma Ata on the second day, the white mountain range beyond
the city made a glorious backdrop against the winter sky. When we drew into
Alma Ata station we parted reluctantly with our travelling companions.
The carriage attendant beamed, but looked wary when we asked him to
recommend a good hotel. How was he to deal with such innocents at large? He
probably wanted to warn us about the perils of life in a market economy, or
at least tell us how to bribe our way into a hotel room. In the end he said
very little. As a result we learned the hard way, and found rooms very late
that evening, only after lining our passports with large dollar bills.
As for my friend from the Chinese railway department, she turned up once
more in an unexpected setting. On the way to London from Alma Ata I stopped
off in Moscow, where I lost my luggage at the domestic airport. She was on
the same flight, and lost hers, too.
But she knew at once what to do. 'Follow me', she said, and led the way out
on to the tarmac. There, far away in the snow, was a pile of abandoned
suitcases, including mine. 'How did you know where to go?' I asked. But I
knew the answer before she replied. Who better than a Russian-speaking
Chinese, nurtured on the Sino-Soviet alliance, to understand how the Russian
bureaucracy works, even today?
Travel from Peking to Urumqi and on to Alma Ata by air and rail can be
arranged through the China International Travel Service (CITS). Much the
most comfortable hotel in Urumqi is the Holiday Inn, which can be booked
through CITS or direct, tel: (0991)-218788, fax: -217077. There are several
large hotels in Alma Ata. We stayed at the Hotel Otrar. Hotel bookings as

FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: Puffins and polecats, at home in Wales - Islands,
estuaries, Snowdonia. Michael J. Woods describes the wildlife of Wales, from
cetaceans to the red kite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS

<TEXT>
A STRANGE and mournful wail filtered up from beneath our feet as if some
lost soul was crying in despair from the depths of the earth. The only light
came from the flickering flames on the dark horizon and a slight glow from
the stars as we stumbled forward. Something flopped away from us, struggling
over the uneven grass like a grounded spirit of the night.
Black and white, with wings outstretched, it made pathetic but vain attempts
to take to the air. No effort was required to catch the bird; as I lifted it
skywards, it spread its long wings and, returned to its true element, glided
away with ease.
It was a Manx shearwater, a short-term occupant of one of the old rabbit
holes on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, in Wales. More than
100,000 come here every spring to nest in the shelter of their underground
bunkers, safe from the predatory intentions of gulls.
Flying aces, they glide over the stormy oceans with grace, dipping an
occasional wing-tip in the water as if to belittle its power. On land they
are all but helpless, staying hidden under ground during the day and only
venturing out under cover of darkness. Their half-eaten corpses strewn on
the rabbit-cropped turf, particularly around full moon, tell of a successful
night's hunting for the gulls.
In spite of the proximity of Milford Haven and the burning beacons of its
oil refineries, Skomer is a diamond in the Welsh wildlife crown. In addition
to shearwaters, it has large colonies of nesting sea-birds including puffins
and guillemots. Choughs swirl around its cliffs while short-eared owls hunt
its special Skomer voles. Skomer is also one of the most important breeding
sites for grey seals in southern Britain: about 100 pups are born there
every autumn.
Wales is well-blessed with wildlife islands. Further off-shore from Skomer
is Skokholm, which has storm petrels as well as many of Skomer's species;
even more remote Grassholm supports one of the largest gannet colonies in
the northern hemisphere.
Ramsey Island, off St David's Head, has been purchased recently by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds. A number of rare birds nest there
including peregrine falcons; there is also a large grey seal colony and a
herd of red deer. Also noted for its birds is Bardsey, accessible by boat
from Pwllheli, which has its own bird and field observatory.
All these islands, along with Anglesey and various headlands on the Welsh
coast, are good spots from which to watch for passing cetaceans, although
less-dedicated whale watchers might have more luck with the resident
bottle-nosed dolphins which live in Cardigan Bay and can be seen off New
Quay Head.
In less rocky areas there are outstanding examples of salt marshes and
estuaries of national and international importance around the Welsh coast,
notably the Loughor estuary north of the Gower peninsula, the Cleddau, the
Dovey and the Dee, Conway and Taff. The last three are under considerable
pressure from development, and the main wildlife interest of the Taff
estuary is likely to disappear if the Cardiff Bay barrage is constructed as
planned.
All have large populations of wildfowl, especially in the winter when they
are important feeding grounds for significant flocks of waders such as
godwit, redshank and oyster catcher, and ducks like pintail, widgeon and
goldeneye.
More picturesque than mudflats at low tide are the sandy beaches and their
flower-rich dunes which are found, notably, around the Gower and nearby
Kenfig and at Newborough Warren on Anglesey. Fine orchids grow in these
unlikely places, including the southern marsh orchid, fen orchid, marsh
helleborine and green-winged orchid. If it is an unusual beach you want,
then try Shell Island south of Harlech where the empty shells of more than
70 different crustaceans may be found.
The Snowdon massif makes a magnificent backdrop to this area and the summits
of these, the highest mountains in Wales, have a flora that dates from the
last Ice Age. On the most exposed tops you can find dwarf willow and
reindeer moss, while in more sheltered spots are other Arctic-alpine species
including cushions of purple saxifrage, mountain avens, Snowdon lilies and
globe flowers.
On the slightly lower slopes are sheets of heather which support both black
and red grouse. The latter, startled by your approach, cries out 'Go back,
go back' as it leaps into the air and glides away. In river gorges you may
spot a ring ouzel, a shy relative of the blackbird with a white bib, not to
be confused with the smaller, tubbier and more confiding dipper.
There are feral goats up here, too: animals that have probably roamed the
hills for centuries. At present there is conflict between the goats and
local agricultural and conservation interests because of the damage they do
to young trees and seedlings; selective culling takes place. But while you
are quite likely to see the goats of Snowdonia, the gwyniad will almost
certainly evade you. It is a small, herring-like fish - an Ice Age remnant -
which occurs only in Bala lake.
Unlike Bala lake, many of Wales' inland waters are man-made, tapping into
the high rainfall of this hilly country to bring water to drier parts of
Britain. Some of these reservoirs, especially in the Elan Valley and at Llyn
Brianne, appear to be strongholds for the red kite. A success story for the
work of the RSPB, the red kite has made a significant return, particularly
in the past decade. While the RSPB's Dinas and Gwenffrwd reserve is the main
centre for these birds, they range widely, and seeing one is a matter of
keeping your eyes peeled for a fine chestnut bird with a forked tail.
There are good chances of seeing otters in Wales, both on lakes and in
rivers, while its relative, the polecat, is a Welsh speciality. This
ferret-sized creature was persecuted to extinction in England, but has been
hiding out in the Brecon Beacons and Tregaron Bog, a notable national nature
reserve, and is now making successful incursions into its old haunts in the
English west midlands.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: Art deco at the end of the earth - John Westbrooke
visits New Zealand's answer to Bath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GO TO the end of the earth, turn east, and what do you find? Answer: a gem
of a collection of art deco buildings.
Napier, a city of 50,000 or so on the east coast of the North Island of New
Zealand, is the home of a remarkable example of town planning: half-a-dozen
blocks, most of its commercial heart, built at the same time and in the same
style - a Bath for the 20th century.
There is a melancholy reason for this. Early this century, Napier was a
Brightonesque seaside resort, noted for its bracing sea air and its long
marine parade looking out towards. . . well, Chile is the next stop. Its
buildings were characteristically Victorian, several storeys high, lined
with fretwork verandas.
Then on February 3 1931, the region was struck by an earthquake. In effect,
the whole country is a fault line rising from the Pacific, but this was by
far the deadliest of its many 'quakes, 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death
toll was 258 and the subsequent fires razed the middle of Napier.
So it all had to be rebuilt at once, and the city fathers decided that the
new art deco look was the one best suited to a community trying to overcome
tragedy and turn firmly towards the future. It was not the only style used -
you can see hints of classical, Spanish mission (the main influence in the
rebuilding of nearby Hastings) and Frank Lloyd Wright - but it was the main
one, and Napier is clearly, as it claims, Art Deco City.
The architects - Louis Hay, a Wright devotee, and E A Williams were the
busiest of them - learnt lessons from the disaster. Buildings were to be
low-rise, with less masonry to fall on passers-by; two storeys is standard.
Services went underground.
Many of the street-level shopfronts have been renovated, but turn your eyes
up and the city's uniqueness becomes apparent. Everywhere you look you see
the straight lines and sharp angles of art deco.
Typical decorations involve sunbursts, chevrons, zigzags, even stylised
Maori motifs. Most have been sympathetically painted in soft pastels,
standing out against the bright blue sky.
The best are to be found on the Countrywide Bank and the Daily Telegraph
buildings, in pinks and oranges, the latter looking vaguely Egyptian, and on
the Midland hotel, with a long, low, almost flat facade. But there are lots
of small shops and offices, their architects often unknown, which go
together to make up this unique cityscape.
Europeans often think of art deco as an art form of the north. It was first
unveiled at the International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial
Arts in Paris in 1925. But it has flourished best in the sun: fine
collections of apartments and shops are on show in Miami and Los Angeles.
Napier's collection is not as big as those, but it is notably compact:
half-an-hour's stroll will take you past most of it.
Oddly, it was only a decade ago that the locals realised just how unusual
their town was. By this time, some buildings had already been pulled down, a
process which is still occasionally going on, though today's replacements
usually make a feeble attempt at the art deco look themselves. Since then,
books and TV programmes have alerted New Zealanders to the value of Napier.
Visitors can take guided tours of the town, while the museum offers
audio-visual displays about the 'quake of '31. Information from Art Deco
Trust, PO Box 248, Napier. Art Deco Napier, by Peter Shaw and Peter Hallett
(Cosmos Publications, Napier, NZDollars 26.95), is a short, well-illustrated
guide to the town's treasures.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Independent schools - FT 500: A premier league starts to
emerge - John Authers considers the latest A-level results and finds an
unmistakable trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAD TEACHERS are always quick to assert that A-level league tables do not
tell the whole story about a school's performance, and they are, of course,
right.
However, the story they do tell is growing increasingly clear. For most
independent schools, the FT now has data for the last six years. The tables
on this page and the next show the rankings for each of 501 independent
schools both for this year, and, where the figures are available, the
average position for the previous five.
There is a marked and unmistakable trend at the top. Of this year's top ten,
all bar two were in the top ten averages for the previous five years. The
only newcomers were Withington Girls School in Manchester, ninth with a
previous a average of 18th, and King's College School, London, which came
tenth after a previous five-year average of 21st place.
The two to drop out of the top ten scarcely suffered serious falls from
grace, with Haberdashers' Aske's, Borehamwood, now 12th, and Wycombe Abbey
16th.
Close though the margins between different schools' results can often be,
the league tabling has revealed a hard core of consistent performers - a
'Carling Premiership' of schools as one educationalist has put it.
A closer look at the schools which made it into the premier league does
however cast some question over whether the exercise is measuring the
quality of a school's tuition, or just its success in attracting able
pupils.
The top ten this year include two internationally renowned and highly
prestigious boys' boarding schools, Eton and Winchester, for both of which
applications will always be high. The remaining eight are predominantly day
schools, based in large conurbations, and therefore have a catchment area
which enables them to select from a broad range of pupils.
Deciding between mixed and single-sex education involves more than academic
criteria. But these results also seem to provide an academic argument for
single-sex education - all bar one school in the top thirty are single-sex
up to the age of 16, using the FT's definition of single-sex schools (see
footnotes to our top thirty table). Leicester Grammar School is the
highest-placed fully coeducational school at 29th, although Westminster has
a mixed sixth form.
John Trevis, schools consultant with the Gabbitas, the London-based
educational consultancy, further points out that the few boarding schools
among the top academic performers are unusual in that they have special
houses for scholars, where the ablest pupils can feed off each other.
This calls into question the concept of 'value for money'. Schools such as
St Paul's in London, top of the tree this year, may have excellent results,
but it may not necessarily follow that they offer better value for money. It
could be argued that pupils bright enough to prosper at St Paul's would also
shine anywhere else. Further, the standards required by the academic elite
schools are so great that it could be argued that many parents should ignore
them in any case.
Stephen Baldock, highmaster of St Paul's, admits that his school is working
on 'good material'. However, he points out that this year's results included
good grades for some of the boys who were not naturally among the most
gifted.
Trevis suggests that parents with children who are lacking in academic
self-confidence might deliberately avoid the top schools because the pace of
lessons may be too much for them. Schools lower in the standings may be much
better equipped to cater for their needs.
He points, for example, to Stanbridge Earls School, in Hampshire, which
finished 501st. The school specialises in teaching dyslexics and children
with other learning difficulties, and, according to Trevis, ranks as highly
as St Paul's in the job it does for its pupils.
Another issue is the effect the league tables will themselves have on
schools' performance. The government's motive in publishing them is to
reveal under-achievement and give the schools a powerful incentive to
improve standards. The 2.2 per cent overall improvement in pass rates by the
independent schools surveys suggest that the tables may have had this
effect.
The objection to the league table concept that individual positions are too
strongly influenced by minor fluctuations in results seems unfair. Compare
this year's score with the average for the previous five, and you will find
a remarkable degree of consistency. While this is most evident at the top,
significant deviations are still rare lower down.
A few significant jumps were recorded - for example Croydon High School came
32nd, compared with a five-year rank of 103, and Francis Holland school, in
Clarence Gate, near Regent's Park, London, leapt to 50th following an
average placing of 229. Further down in the tables, Cobham Hall School, near
Gravesend, Kent, rose to 194th from a previous average of 409th.
Consistency in league tables has been helped by the rigorous approach taken
by the FT's statisticians, using data supplied by the Independent Schools
Information Service. These tables are based on total UCCA points, which
include both A-levels, and the new AS-levels ('Advanced Supplementary')
which were introduced to add breadth to sixth form curriculums, and are
intended to be as difficult as A-levels, but with syllabuses only half the
size.
By taking this approach, all grades achieved, not just As and Bs, are taken
into account, giving a full picture of a school's academic strength. Schools
which provide extra options such as AS levels will be credited.
General studies A-levels, offered by many schools as an extra option but
often without any devoted tuition, has been derided by employers'
organisations. It is usually ignored by university admissions tutors, and so
it has been excluded from all the FT's calculations.
Schools with less than ten candidates in total have also been excluded, as
these are likely to be highly specialist, while the grades achieved could
lead to statistical distortions - as was shown by last year's government
league tables for state schools which saw the tiny Scilly Isles in first
place.
The FT has also aimed to avoid over-simplification by ranking schools using
two separate scores - UCCA points per entry, and UCCA points per pupil.
The former gives the average grade in each exam taken, while the latter
gives the total grades each pupil has on average accumulated.
Either could be argued to be preferable. The former can be manipulated by
deliberately withdrawing pupils from A-levels where they do not seem likely
to do well, while the latter rewards schools where pupils commonly take on
more than the standard three subjects.
League tables compiled using the two measures would be different, as a
glance down the columns headed UCCA points per entry and UCCA points per
pupil show. Instead the two have been combined to give the ranking score.
As the bald ranking can unfairly accentuate what are often marginal
differences between schools' results, the figure in the second column gives
an 'FT score' which shows by how much a school has varied from the norm.
This is calculated so that an average school will score exactly 1.00. This
was achieved by the schools ranked from 263 to 269, and is equivalent to
roughly 18 UCCA points, or three Cs per pupil.
A more profound problem is whether A-level grades themselves are the true
'gold standard' of educational excellence which many teachers and university
admissions tutors assume.
Difficulties with university entrance this year, and wide discrepancies in
the grades awarded by different A-level examining boards, have brought
serious questioning of the A-level system for the first time.
In Scotland, most schools prefer to do the broader Scottish 'Highers' rather
than A-levels - which is why only two Scottish schools appear in the table.
Further education colleges in the state system have reported significant
increases in demand for new 'vocational A-levels', in which some exams will
be replaced by work experience and coursework. In the independent sector,
International Baccalaureate is also gaining in popularity.
Sevenoaks School, in Kent, has been in the forefront of introducing the IB,
which forces pupils to do a broader range of subjects, and has wider
international recognition.
Richard Barker, Sevenoaks' headmaster, believes that the IB allows greater
diversity, and the abler pupils are encouraged to take it. IB candidates
account for the majority of the school's Oxbridge entrants this year. The
school's figures in the table have been derived using a complicated formula
to convert IB results into an A-level UCCA points equivalent.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Fashion: Picked to be perfectly packed - Forget those
struggles with big suitcases. Avril Groom knows how to travel with the
minimum fuss and luggage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFECT holiday traveller is a magician. She arrives without fuss
carrying one small suitcase from which she apparently pulls an endless
stream of clothes so that she looks elegantly and appropriately dressed on
every occasion. You do not believe she exists? Then read on and find out how
anyone can turn themselves into her.
It may not all be done with mirrors but it is a matter of illusion. This
paragon knows how to get a gallon of clothes into a pint-sized bag. The
secret, of course, is interchangeability based on a narrow range of colours,
giving the maximum number of permutations from a limited number of pieces.
The successful packer knows that the easiest colour combinations around
which to work are neutrals because they all go with each other and you need
only a few accessories to go with all of them. The black, white and cream
combination chosen for the wardrobe on this page is ideal. She also knows
that clothes pack more tightly and emerge less creased when rolled rather
than folded, and that anything which will not fit into the largest
acceptable aircraft cabin bag (55cm x 24cm x 31cm according to Louis
Vuitton, which makes one) is not worth taking. This applies just as much to
two as one week holidays; the laundry bills or, for the parsimonious, a few
minutes' washing, are minor inconveniences compared with lugging a larger
suitcase.
If a short-notice invitation to the south of France arrives just when she
thinks her summer is over, the perfect holidaymaker will already know (as
the FT photographic team discovered) that an easy way to get there is with
Air UK from Stansted, which has a speedy check-in to help you go from
central London to your hotel in the Nice area in about 3 1/2 hours.
She will also know exactly where to go to replenish her holiday wardrobe in
the dog days of summer when many stores have already decreed that autumn has
arrived. As efficient a shopper as she is a traveller, she will home in on
Whistles, Jaeger, Ronit Zilkha, Dorothy Perkins, Jeffrey Rogers and The Hot
Shop at Harrods and top House of Fraser stores, all of which are joining the
trend for an extra 'transition' collection of high-summer separates to fill
in the awkward period between ever-earlier sales and serious autumn
arrivals.
Some fabrics such as the textured viscose which Ghost use year-round, are
non-seasonal, and smaller-scale designers who work to order, such as Amanda
Wakeley, keep their summer styles going longer. If she has more notice, the
traveller may order one of the pale silk dresses, pyjama-style trousers,
waistcoats or loose shirts re-created from original 1920s patterns by the
Gallery of Antique Costumes and Textiles. These take about two weeks to make
and are available all year round, so the really organised are ordering now
for their winter holidays.
The ideal holidaymaker's glory is that she is the perfect guest, with the
appropriate outfit for whatever she is invited to do, although even she
would probably not make so many changes in one day as we show here. Coupled
with all the extra combinations that these pieces make, this wardrobe should
supply enough fresh looks for a week's warm-climate holiday.
Each item can be used in several different ways. Both pairs of shorts go
with each swimsuit and the striped body. The swimsuits themselves can also
be used as bodies, while the velour robe, minus its belt, doubles as a grand
evening coat.
The fitted linen shirt-jacket adds a touch of formality to the longline
shorts, the silk dress or the crushed silk skirt, while the loose linen
shirt gives these same pieces, or the black trousers, a more relaxed mood.
It is also useful as a beach cover-up, as is the printed georgette shirt
which, worn loose with the trousers, makes an informal evening outfit. The
silk skirt dresses down when worn plainly with a body or swimsuit but looks
more evening-style with a scarf and the crepe top, which also goes with the
trousers. The crepe skirt looks slim and sophisticated with a body while the
cream knit looks good with everything, especially the silk dress, for cooler
days.
Subtract from these clothes one non-crush outfit to travel in - perhaps the
black trousers, the body and the knit - and add the jewellery we show, a
roll-up hat, three pairs of shoes (deck-shoes, espadrilles and smart
sandals), a nightdress and a modicum of lingerie and you should still have
room in that hypothetical bag for an extra top and a sarong. The only piece
of poetic licence is, perhaps, the robe. Carry it over your arm - it could
be useful on the aircraft.
As you are also allowed a handbag, take advantage of a large, squashy style
to hold your toilet bag, suncream, sunglasses, paperbacks, tickets, money,
passport and embroidery or other anti-delay device.
And as you stroll calmly through the most crowded and frenetic of airport
lounges, no-one will know that, as perfect travellers go, you are merely a
novice.

FT  28 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Secret of barbecue fires without smoke -
Charcoal is the key ingredient for cook-outs. Peter Knight seeks a good
piece of charred wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLAYING RAP music very loudly or encouraging Rover to yap all night might be
efficient ways to annoy the neighbours, but there is nothing to beat smoking
them out with a badly burning barbecue.
Clouds of acrid smoke supplemented by that evocative smell of vaporised fat
from the chump chops is a sure-fire way of getting the occupants of No 20 in
full retreat.
That this is a common occurrence has more to do with the quality of charcoal
than the incompetence of the chef. Nearly all the 45,000 tonnes of charcoal
imported into Britain each year is badly made and environmentally dodgy.
This is what the embryonic home-produced charcoal industry want us to
believe and they are probably right.
The black lumps we buy to fuel our summer cook-outs come mostly from
developing countries in Africa, South America and the far East. The charcoal
is made in the traditional way, either in a pit dug in the ground or in a
huge mobile metal oven. Both methods allow the wood to burn slowly until
only the charred remains are left.
Good charcoal should be about 90 per cent carbon. At that level it will not
smoke because there is little, if any, wood left. Much of the imported
charcoal is not much better than blackened wood and that is why it smokes.
Furthermore, the chances are that the charred lumps were originally a
tropical hardwood or part of a mangrove swamp. This is hardly the fuel for
the environmentally conscious 1990s, especially when the exporting nations
rely mainly on wood-based fuels for their needy populations.
Europe could make its own charcoal and in the process provide better
management of its woods. This is specially true of the UK which has the raw
materials, the know-how and the demand. In some rural areas you can buy
local charcoal - made in the traditional way - but there is not enough
supply to meet the demand from large retailers, such as petrol stations and
DIY stores.
Christopher Irwin wants to change this. He is a Suffolk farmer, in the
timber business and regional secretary for the Timber Growers Organisation,
which represents owners of private woods in the UK.
'Charcoal is the offal of logging. It is badly and wastefully produced from
virgin forests in west Africa, South America and the far East. We've got the
resources and the market here - why can't we put the two together?'
Irwin says the market for second quality home-grown hardwood - which was
once used for mining and paper making - has disappeared. Mines no longer use
the wood and the paper mill in Kent which used to consume most of the
county's coppiced wood, has been converted to use waste paper.
'We've got huge areas of neglected woodlands in the UK and nothing positive
is being done about it,' he says.
Irwin wants to harvest the woods - as they were since the middle ages - and
use the cuttings to make high-quality charcoal in an environmentally sound
way. There would be enough, he says, to supply the domestic market which is
estimated to be growing at 5 per cent a year.
Plenty of people and organisations are enthusiastic. Farmers who own woods,
which are now commercially worthless, like the idea. The Forestry Commission
 -the government agency in charge of the UK's state-owned woodlands - wants
to see the woods pay their way. The World Wide Fund for Nature supports the
idea too.
Irwin's problem is how to keep the costs down. The wood has to be cut and
transported. The charcoal has to be made in high-tech ovens equipped with
the latest pollution-control equipment and then it has to be bagged in sizes
suitable for the supermarkets.
When Irwin does his sums he finds that his costs are marginally higher than
the imported product, mainly because the imports exclude the environmental
costs. Nevertheless he is confident that his idea could work and he is
building a pilot plant to prove it.
He might get some help from the supermarkets and DIY stores which constantly
assure us of their environmental credentials.
The UK's biggest DIY chain, B &amp; Q, is the most environmentally aware. Alan
Knight, its environmental co-ordinator, says the store is committed to stock
only timber from sustainable sources by 1995 and charcoal falls into that
category. B &amp; Q gets its charcoal from Portugal where it is made from
saw-mill off-cuts.
He says B &amp; Q will consider a UK-made product. 'But just because it has a
Union Jack on it does not mean that it will be stocked. It has to be well
produced and competitive in price.'
Irwin is disdainful of the UK attitude towards the quality of charcoal. 'The
Germans, for example, are very particular about their charcoal and they
would never buy the sort of rubbish that the British buy.'
The Germans have an official standard for charcoal and this helps shoppers
choose good from bad. A similar standard should be available throughout the
EC by the end of next year.
This should aid domestic producers if their quality is indeed superior to
imports. A shift to better fuel will help some of the UK's depressed rural
communities, produce better barbecues and certainly go some way to alleviate
the discomfort of those poor smoked-out people at No 20.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Hobby horses for learners - Polo
is a difficult game to master. Keith Wheatley visits a business which
teaches beginners to handle a mallet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLO IS NOT an easy sport to get started in. The game itself is so exciting
that any spectator would be tempted to climb up on a pony, swinging a stick
with HRH and the best of them. Deep pockets are an initial requirement. A
basic equipe of two ponies, trailer, clothing and membership of a UK club
would probably cost around Pounds 10,000.
Even if the cash is available for a debut - and plenty of complete beginners
buy expensive boats to go yacht racing in - there is the ghastly ordeal of
being a highly visible novice in a team of only four. As the summer polo
season reaches its height there would quite possibly be a sizeable crowd on
the touchline, their passing interest in polo fuelled by Jilly Cooper's
'jodhpur-ripping' best-sellers.
'I have an occasional nightmare of being on stage in an orchestra, in front
of a large audience, with a violin in my hands which I can't play. That must
approximate to a first game of polo at a member's club,' laughed Anthea
Hartley of the Chiltern Polo Centre, based at her home, Lower Bassibones
Farm, near Great Missenden 30 miles north-west of London.
Last year she began to turn the family hobby (four Hartley children aged 12
to 19 all play Pony Club polo) into a business. Her concept was to use the
barns, stables and 65 acres of pasture at the farm to open polo's equivalent
of the golf driving range.
'Beginners and people who can't afford the grand end of polo give us our
market,' said Anthea. Three evenings a week in the summer there are group
classes where anything up to 15 people pay Pounds 40 for two hours
instruction, including the use of a pony.
Polo has to be safety-conscious. The possibilities for calamity with horses
colliding at 30 mph is very real. So one of the earliest classes is a rules
session on a green table-top - complete with plastic ponies  - marked out as
a polo field.
In a barn that also doubles as a dormitory during residential courses for
younger players, a mixed group of pupils ranging from a local builder to a
Peat Marwick accountant, pore over the display and discuss tactics with New
Zealand instructor and professional player Simon Hill.
But even at a first lesson our tyro player gets to mount up and a play a
chukka, one of the seven-minute spells of intense action which make up a
match. In the gossip columns it may be the Princess of Wales waiting behind
the goal line, chez Hartley it is more likely to be son Toby, 17, patrolling
with a hockey stick to stop the ball being lost in a nettle bank.
While after-work tuition on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays is the backbone
of the business, Chiltern Polo Centre has its bespoke side. One northern
businessman, challenged to play by a colleague but without any previous
experience, recently booked three days of one-to-one tuition. A team from
the Quorn, challenged to polo by another hunt, took a crash course.
Other healthy sources of revenue are affluent Nigerians and Ghanains sent to
England by indulgent fathers and anxious to learn polo for the social status
it confers in west Africa.
'Word of mouth is important but we advertise every week in Horse &amp; Hound
(the weekly magazine that is a bible in equestrian circles) and that is our
primary source of new clients,' said Hartley, adding that she spends just
under Pounds 3,000 a year with the magazine.
Referrals from polo clubs themselves are increasing. 'I doubt the really
grand clubs even know we exist but the others are beginning to send one or
two beginners to us,' she said.
Instructors are paid on a freelance basis but the yard has two full-time
staff during the season. They undertake a small amount of livery and
schooling for more experienced players looking for a place to keep polo
ponies.
Using these, plus her children's mounts, gives Anthea Hartley the ability to
maintain the large number of ponies a school requires at relatively low
capital cost.
An additional bonus is that as the polo bug bites deeper into its victim, a
pupil often becomes a pony-owner with an animal to be kept at livery,
creating more revenue for the centre. These people are far from plutocrats.
One regular arrives on summer evenings with his polo sticks (Pounds 55 each)
strapped to his motorcycle.
'My son played via the Pony Club and I got talked into having a go,' said
Malcolm Stirling, 39. 'Now it's become a terrible obsession, I've bought a
pony, and I have to come here for these weekly therapy sessions.'
Robert Colin, a loss adjuster from Ealing, west London, booked a lesson on
impulse last summer, after browsing through Horse &amp; Hound. Now he admits, in
the confessional tones of a compulsive gambler, that polo takes up all his
spare time and money - around Pounds 700 in an average month.
'It's just all-consuming,' says Colin, 35.
Geoff Hartley, Anthea's husband is a successful businessman and a committed
non-equestrian. He does the books for the polo school and declares it to be
'already breaking even, with the potential to be profitable.'
From the family's point of view it enables them to enjoy a passionately
loved - and very expensive - hobby at no direct cost.
'Polo and kids is a bit like school fees,' said Hartley. 'If you thought
about what it was going to cost overall you'd never educate them at all.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Romanians count the cost of luxury - Common
Markets / Giles MacDonogh tries to find something worth buying in Bucharest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCHAREST is a city replete with the usual eastern European contrasts: the
luxury hotel - well, by Romanian standards it counts as a luxury hotel -
where a largely foreign clientele pays what it considers to be rock bottom
prices for food and drink; and, across the way, the little street market
where pitifully small quantities of food change hands for what locals
consider to be intolerably inflated sums.
The hotel is called the Buchuresti. The market is on the other side of the
Calea Victoriei behind one of Bucharest's loveliest small Greek orthodox
churches. It is called the Piata Amzei. A market will generally give you a
good idea of the local diet; but you will get only a limited impression of
what an inhabitant of Bucharest eats from the Piata Amzei, for it sells only
fruit, vegetables, flowers and cheese.
I was there in the spring when the only fruits to be seen were a few bruised
apples and pears. The vegetables were more interesting. They were arranged
in little lots on newspapers: posies of spring garlic which Romanians chew
with their soup as if they were spring onions; and an early spring
speciality, a reddish-blue leaf which is used to make a meatless Lenten soup
called ciorba de loboda.
Muddy parsnips were set beside little heaps of chicory. In a far corner of
the market a salesman was doing brisk business selling excellent acacia and
'poliflori' honeys at 1000 lei and 800 lei a jar.
When a lorry turned up loaded with fresh eggs the driver was virtually
mobbed by old women in headscarves. Eggs were clearly a rarity.
Not so cheese. This was sold from a covered building by dour men wearing
white aprons and trilby hats. The best is a hard ewes' milk cheese called
brinza. Some wheels are sold smoked.
A soft, fetta-style ewes' milk cheese was also available as was a cows' milk
curd called telemea. In some places you may buy a whey cheese called urda,
but I could not find it here.
As I walked back to the Calea Victoriei, a drink shop caught my eye. There
was a whisky for sale called 'Big Boss' which purported to come from 'the
Highlands'. Later I discovered that it came from the highlands of the
Lebanon. Dodgy as it was, it cost 2,600 lei (about Pounds 2.50), which is a
lot for a Romanian.
Seventy per cent of this is taken by the government in tax. Whisky is chic,
but the local spirit drunk in the country is tzuica, a plum schnapps similar
to slivovitz. It can be coarse stuff.
I personally preferred the version made from quinces in Transylvania which
is tempered for a year in Mulberry wood casks and sold at a more modest
price.
Meat is the most important part of the Romanian diet. The gustare, or first
course, of a typical meal is all meat. In spring you might get drob, a cake
of lamb tripe which was translated for me as 'mixed organs'.
It was liberally sprinkled with pepper and bound with an egg. Another
Wallachian delicacy is babic: a mutton sausage made in horseshoe lengths and
flattened under stones. It is hard on the teeth. Romania's national soup is
ciorba de burta. This, I was told, was what used to sustain the Christian
janissaries, elite troops, in the Ottoman army.
It translates as 'sour stomach soup' and is made from tripe. It can be an
alarming sight if you are unused to tripe. You blend the soup to your own
liking by adding garlic sauce, vinegar or cream and eat it with green
chillies and spring garlic. Another popular soup is a puree of stinging
nettles.
After the excitement of the first two courses, the main course might come as
a disappointment: sarmate are similar to Greek dolmas, with vine leaves
often replaced by cabbage leaves.
The basic blend can change from region to region but basically it is meat
and rice. Sarmate are eaten with mamaliga, polenta made into a cake the size
of Christmas pudding and cut with a string. Little meat balls are also
popular. These are also eaten with ferociously hot chillies.
Sadly, to eat such authentic Romanian dishes you may need to be asked into
someone's home or entertained on a farm. The face of Romania which is
reserved for foreign tourists is rather different.
In the restaurant Velvet, on the other side of the Hotel Buchuresti, you
will have difficulty finding any Romanian dishes whatsoever: the food is all
western. There is no cheese and no Romanian spirits. The vodka is neither
Russian nor Polish, but comes from Finland; and for the privilege of feeling
you might be just about anywhere, you will pay the equivalent of a Romanian
citizen's monthly salary.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: There is life after Bull's Blood - Jancis
Robinson considers the politics of Hungarian viticulture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN EVERY large tasting of a supermarket or off-licence's wine range this
year, I have been surprised by the value offered by Hungarian wines in the
heavily populated Pounds 2.50 to Pounds 3.50 per bottle bracket. And, once
the country's privatisation ferment has settled, we should see an even more
interesting range of fiery whites and clean, fruity reds.
The pioneer, as usual, was Bordeaux-based, Australian-trained Hugh Ryman,
whose response to the frost damage to France's 1991 crop was to install
himself in a well-equipped but under-utilised winery in Gyongyos, east of
Budapest, and vinify lorryloads of bargain Sauvignon and Chardonnay grapes.
Gyongyos Estate wines, Pounds 3.35 from Sainsbury's and Pounds 3.39 from
Thresher, are still at the cutting edge of Hungary's white wine output -
although its 1992 Semillon has been commercially hampered by the fact that
the Hungarians forgot to register Semillon as an approved Hungarian variety
in Brussels.
Two colourful rival importers are at the heart of extracting wines to suit
British palates from Hungary's excitingly varied but under-achieving
vineyards. Both of them laugh much more than seems appropriate in view of
the confused state of Hungarian wine production, which has suffered from a
lack of motivation and is now suffering from the disappearance of its old
Comecon markets.
About half of all Hungarian wine exports to Britain are imported by Eva
Keresztury and her associates, who include Ryman. 'I'm a strange creature,'
admits this jolly Hungarian. 'I came to England as decoration when my
husband came to work in the City for one of those strange foreign trading
organisations.'
Drawn in to the Hungarian wine business by the need for translators, she now
runs Interconsult, a strange foreign trading organisation of her own, from
her dining room in Barnes, south west London, and shepherds inceasing
numbers of professional wine buyers around wineries and vineyards in the
throes of privatisation.
'One of the most pleasurable trips of my life was soon after I started in
1991 when I took the two Safeway buyers around the wineries. What a
revelation] The winemakers blushed and had tears in their eyes when they
made blends that pleased them. We worked 18 hours a day and never seemed to
sleep.'
Her determination to sort the wheat from the chaff, and make the most of
some very exciting fruit, which can yield 'brilliant' wine only if handled
properly, has led her on one occasion to buy and install her own bottling
line. She is now directing a team of antipodean and local winemakers in
various temporary locations. It all sounds suitably Romany.
Hemant Kotecha, of Manchester, is her main competitor in exposing the best
of Hungary to western palates. A Ugandan Asian, he took a master's degree in
crop control at Reading before immersing himself in business. He went to
Hungary in 1989 looking for general commercial opportunities, and wine was
one of the commodities offered.
He too started up his company, Myliko, in 1991 and applied antipodean
technology to a well-equipped Balaton winery, in this case to produce the
Chapel Hill range of white international varietals at Pounds 2.99. The
Chardonnay, at Sainsbury's, is a snip; the Rhine Riesling, at Victoria Wine,
is racily fruity (although not dry); only the overripe Sauvignon
disappoints.
Safeway, particularly open to suggestion from the east, has the most
genuinely interesting selection of Hungarian wines, which reflects its
genuine interest in what distinguishes the country and its very different
wine regions.
Oddbins has the fine Volcanic Hills range. Its moody label was designed for
Eva's company by a 19-year-old who has never left Hungary. The eerily
Alsace-like Pinot Gris 1992 at Pounds 3.49 is my favourite, and I can
reluctantly understand why they did not use the grape's Hungarian name,
Szurkebarat.
Some of the crispest, liveliest red wines selling anywhere at Pounds 2.99
are Eva's Villanyi Hills Cabernet Sauvignon and, even fruitier, Merlot,
stocked by Thresher, Bottoms Up and Wine Rack - and miles better than these
shops' Hungarian whites at the same price. The Tuscan firm, Antinori, has
invested in the Bataapati estate in the country's south west and the lively
red Kekfrankos and spicy white Zoldveltelini are available at about Pounds
4.50 from Great Northern Wines of Leeds.
Other more expensive wines are, inevitably, in the trans-Danubian pipeline,
although I have yet to be thrilled by them. It is heartening to note,
however, that both major importers are planning to introduce some of
Hungary's rich gene bank of indigenous vine varieties. Look out for 1993
Harslevelu.
And what of Hungary's most famous wine, the legendary rich, deliberately
sherrified golden Tokay? Do not ask. A bevy of international wine companies
is trying to establish a firm foothold in this historic region, but they are
being comprehensively hamstrung by local landowners and state officials.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWING investment fashion for emerging markets was illustrated this
week by the announcement of two new funds in the area.
Emerging markets are favoured because of their high economic growth and
relatively undeveloped stock markets which, enthusiasts believe, offer
greater opportunities for profit.
Foreign &amp; Colonial's new emerging markets subsidiary has launched an
offshore, open-ended fund which will invest in India. Meanwhile, Robert
Fleming is planning to launch a Chinese investment trust.
The F&amp;C fund will be based in Luxembourg and will aim to invest in
medium-sized growth companies. F&amp;C says that economic growth in India is
predicted to reach 7-8 per cent by the middle of the decade.
It adds: 'Low-cost, medium-sized companies are likely to find it easier to
adjust to the changing policy framework and many have already begun to
experience more rapid growth than their blue-chip counterparts.'
IndSec Securities &amp; Finance Ltd, an Indian fund management group, will act
as adviser to the fund. The launch price will be Dollars 10 a share and the
minimum investment will be Dollars 10,000.
As well as its Luxembourg base, the fund will invest via a wholly-owned
Mauritius subsidiary. F&amp;C says the structure will reduce Indian capital
gains tax to zero and dividend income tax to 15 per cent.
Fleming's Chinese investment trust will use the Hong Kong-based Jardine
Fleming as investment adviser and SG Warburg as the stockbroker.
Jardine Fleming is estimating that Chinese economic growth will be 12 per
cent in 1993 and 8 per cent in 1994. The trust is expected to be launched at
the end of September.
Potential investors should realise that single-country emerging market funds
are likely to be highly volatile because the stock markets involved are so
illiquid. A more widely-spread emerging markets fund is likely to be a much
safer bet for the small, or first-time, investor.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: When the taxman pays - David Cohen
explains the benefits of PRP, a salary scheme designed to leave employees
with extra income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT have gone unnoticed by the voters at Christchurch but the
government has introduced at least one popular tax measure. More than 1m
employees now get tax relief on profit-related pay (PRP) and the numbers
look set to grow rapidly.
PRP is pay which varies with changes in the profits of the business at which
the employee works. If paid under a scheme registered with the Inland
Revenue, it is tax-free within certain limits.
The tax privileges associated with PRP were introduced in 1987, and the
tax-free limits were increased in 1991. For employees getting up to Pounds
20,000 a year, the limit is 20 per cent, while higher earners now have a
ceiling of Pounds 4,000. That translates into a maximum tax saving of Pounds
1,600 for a 40 per cent taxpayer, and Pounds 1,000 for a basic rate-payer.
The allure of these tax hand-outs has been behind a spectacular increase in
the number of companies registering PRP schemes - from 2,049 in December
1991 to 4,904 in June 1993. Over the same period, the number of employees
involved has also more than doubled, from 581,000 to 1,179,700.
Apart from the rise in the limits, the key factor spurring companies to join
the PRP bandwagon has been realising that introducing a scheme need not
cause an increase in overheads. Instead of being given PRP in addition to
basic salary, employees can be invited to exchange part of their salary for
PRP. A properly structured 'salary sacrifice' arrangement should leave both
employer and employee better off - with the bill being picked up by the
taxman.
Suppose, for example, that a company offered 10 per cent PRP in return for
an equivalent pay cut. A worker on Pounds 10,000 would switch to Pounds
9,000 basic and Pounds 1,000 PRP. Paying no tax on the latter would mean
that although his gross salary was unchanged, he would be Pounds 250 better
off in terms of take-home pay.
This type of salary swap is often being used instead of a salary increase;
it costs the company nothing and gives the employees their rise.
Alternatively, if the company wants to be more generous, it can give a
partial increase plus PRP. Employees will then be even better off and the
package will still have cost less than a full increase with no PRP.
However attractive the theory, a salary sacrifice scheme can be implemented
only with the consent of the relevant employees. And unless 80 per cent of
those eligible to take part - all full-timers with a qualifying period of up
to three years' service - agree, the scheme cannot proceed.
How should employees react to such an offer? Does it have any risks?
Obviously, that will depend on precisely what is offered. A key - if obvious
 -point to remember is that the amount of PRP cannot be guaranteed in
advance; it all depends on profitability.
To allay employee concerns on this score, most companies pay out the bulk of
PRP on account during the actual profit period. When the actual profits are
computed, employees then get any balance owed.
If, on the other hand, it transpires that profits are lower than expected
and employees have, therefore, been overpaid, most schemes provide that the
company waives its right to be repaid. This is crucial because it puts a
guaranteed floor under the PRP.
Take again the example of a worker earning Pounds 10,000 and sacrificing 10
per cent of his salary for 10 per cent PRP. Assume that 80 per cent of
anticipated PRP is included in his monthly pay packet.
Over the year, that will give him Pounds 800 of extra tax-free income. To
get it, he has had to sacrifice Pounds 1,000 of taxable income which would
have been worth only Pounds 750 net. So, with the promise that the monthly
PRP is his for keeps, the employee can be certain that he will be at least
Pounds 50 better off even if the company's profits fall below expectations.
Most employees who get this degree of re-assurance will, no doubt, be
prepared to sign on the dotted line. Before doing so, they ought at least to
bear in mind that the reduction in their basic salary could have some
negative consequences.
In particular, if they belong to a company pension scheme, their entitlement
might depend on their basic pay, with additional sums - such as PRP - being
excluded from the reckoning. Similarly, if they apply for a mortgage, the
offer from the lender is likely to be based on a multiple of salary with no
account being taken of PRP.
These minor quibbles apart, a well-structured PRP scheme is a must for any
company wanting to use taxpayers' money to reward its staff and an
opportunity which employees should seize with both hands.

I HAD EXCESS capital gains in 1992/93 and, in completing my tax return, I
sought to use losses carried forward from 1977. These amounted to Pounds
1,185 and I suggested to the inspector that the sum should be increased by
the indexation allowance from March 1982 of 1.753, giving a March 1993 loss
figure of Pounds 2,078. He says the 1977 loss cannot be increased by the
indexation allowance and that only the figure of Pounds 1,185 is available
to offset gains. Is he right
Yes.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming tax credits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE BOUGHT BT3 shares for my son, who is six months old. To whom should I
write and what is the procedure for claiming back tax credits attached to
the dividends?
Second, I have a brother who works and lives in Canada. He holds various UK
shares, with his address registered in the UK (ie, my address). Can he claim
back tax credits attached to dividends, and what is/are the procedures?
Provided that your son's income (inclusive of tax credits) from gifts from
your wife and yourself does not exceed Pounds 100 in 1993-94, you should ask
your local tax office for a form on which you and your wife can claim
payment of the tax credits on his behalf next April. If possible, tell the
local tax office the names and reference numbers of the tax offices which
deal with your own and your wife's returns.
If your son's income derived (directly or indirectly) from funds provided by
your wife and yourself exceeds Pounds 100 in 1993-94, no tax credits will be
paid to you on his behalf; his dividends will be treated as your own (or
your wife's, as the case may be) under section 663 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
On the second point, we take it your brother is a Commonwealth citizen. That
being so, he is entitled to a full personal allowance against his UK income
for 1990-91 onwards. If his UK dividends (inclusive of tax credits) exceed
his personal allowance, he will be entitled to payment of a quarter of the
20 per cent tax credit on his dividends for the present tax year in excess
of his personal allowance, by virtue of article 10(3) of the double taxation
convention between Canada and the UK.
For 1990-91 to 1992-93, the corresponding payment will be two-fifths of the
25 per cent tax credit; in each case, the effective residual rate of UK tax
is 15 per cent, and this is eligible for credit against his Canadian tax
liability by virtue of article 21(1)(a) of the convention.
He should write for claim forms (one for each tax year) to the Inland
Revenue, Claims Branch (International), St John's House, Merton Road,
Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, giving his nationality and details of any
periods spent in the UK in the past six years.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: VAT on flat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM ABOUT to have some essential repairs done to a flat I own in London,
which I occupy occasionally. The managing agents will be responsible for
supervising the work and have billed me for their services, including Pounds
254.64 valued-added tax.
As a foreigner and non-resident of the UK, am I not entitled to exemption
for this VAT charge? My bankers, stockbrokers and other professional
advisers who I employ from time to time exclude VAT in their invoices to me.
If the agents are correct, would I be entitled to a refund similar to those
on goods I buy when in the UK and export personally when departing. If so,
where should I submit any claim for the rebate?
You are not exempt from VAT on charges relating to your UK property although
other services, including those of stockbrokers, are zero rated to
non-residents.
You can obtain a refund of VAT on goods exported by you. The retailer will
give a form to complete which explains the rules. The detailed rules are set
out in Customs &amp; Excise notice 704.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Too many nasty surprises - Harry
Hopkins wonders why investors increasingly have been getting the sort of
news they didn't want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRY HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY sensible person, venturing into the stock market, must expect the odd
nasty surprise. But not, surely, so many and so often out of the blue.
Consider these examples:
Hartstone, an up and coming hosiery group, crashed from 277p in February to
30p in April despite having been tipped widely to rise to higher things.
Trafalgar House shareholders were 'surprised' in January when profits
announced as Pounds 122m for 1991 turned out to be a Pounds 38m loss, after
a change in accounting policies.
Bimec Industries, riding on a green 'environmental' tide at 75p in February
1991, had plummeted to 6 1/2 p and been forced to seek the attentions of a
company doctor by August of that year. The dividend was cancelled suddenly.
This week, the group wrote off Pounds 5m of debt in a restructuring,
announced it had negative shareholders' funds - and said it would be suing
its auditor, Grant Thornton.
Queen's Moat Houses, Britain's second-largest hotelier, halted a long course
of price fluctuations and rumours by suspending its shares on March 31 at
47p (they were 92p just 10 months earlier) in order to 'clarify the
company's financial position.' Now, shareholders must wait until autumn to
see what, if anything, is left for them.
There must be few investors who cannot quickly add to the above list. Yet,
these are not fly-by night gambling counters. Queen's Moat Houses was
advancing boldly across Europe with a chain of business hotels while
Hartstone, with the well-founded aim of knitting together a fragmented
hoisery industry, had already achieved second place in Europe.
Far from seeking to conceal information, Harstone's ex-chairman, Stephen
Barker, following the suggestions of the Cadbury report, invited
shareholders not attending the annual general meeting to send in questions
with their proxy papers to be read out, answered at the meeting and then
circulated so as to keep everyone in touch.
It is the confusion that follows the nasty surprise and the disruption of
perspective that, for the investor, as for the workers, must be the
traumatic feature.
Nasty surprises should regularly be subjected to post-mortems from impartial
qualified bodies to determine what went wrong and where the fault lay, and
the reports should be made accessible. Such examinations should not leave
out the roles of brokers, public relations firms and the press.
How far do brokers - and company brokers, in particular, which must
experience divided loyalties - play a Pied Piper role in the progress to the
cliff?
Is everything possible done to make potential investors aware of the risks,
even if they have managed to remember the widely-disseminated admonition
that 'shares can go down as well as up'?
A year or so before Hartstone's nasty surprise, a side table at the
company's 1992 AGM featured a batch of research reports that were
comprehensive, thorough and lucid. One, from BZW, ran to 41 single-spaced
pages with many tables and charts. It was headlined: 'Latest acquisitions
give 'brand' new opportunity.'
A second, from Morgan Stanley, had nine pages. It was headed: 'Hartstone:
one and one make more than two,' and contained a buy recommendation.
A third report, from Warburg Securities and dated June 25 1992, also said
'buy.' But its mere two pages did contain a distinct 5-inch paragraph
headed: 'Risk areas.'
This opened: 'History provides many examples of unexpected setbacks among
highly acquisitive small companies. Many of these had previously enjoyed the
freedom to employ some highly creative accounting. Management capacity has
undoubtedly been stretched . . . As we write, there is an excess hosiery
market capacity of some 15 per cent so a price war remains a distant
possibility . . .'
With hindsight, such a succinct caution might have given one pause. For so
many of these nasty surprises seem to derive from the same factor:
over-rapid acquisition programmes in times of recession, leaving no leeway
for unscheduled developments such as demand falling off suddenly and stocks
building in Europe. Or from developments in accountancy's vast hall of
mirrors.
Perhaps, in the interest of cutting down nasty surprises, even brokers'
recommendations should have to carry a risk warning, stated unequivocally in
a prominent box. This would at least be an improvement on that patronising
slogan 'shares can go down as well as up.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Small doesn't have to be risky -
Unit trusts Scheherazade Daneshkhu profiles a fund which has profited from
minimising the hazards in a volatile sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THINK smaller companies, think risk. This is the thought process which James
Findlay, manager of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's US Smaller Companies trust, is
keen to dispel, since his strategy is to minimise investment risk in what is
seen as a volatile sector.
That strategy seems to have paid off and the fund has an impressive record.
It is top of the North American sector over the seven years and five years
to August 1, and is the second highest-performing fund in that sector over
three and two years, according to the Hardwick Stafford Wright Stats Pack.
When it was launched in 1983, as the F &amp; C American fund, it was not
confined to smaller companies. Findlay, who has managed it since 1986, says
the decision was made to concentrate on smaller companies after a time when
corporate re-structuring, brand name exploitation and a weak dollar - which
had helped larger companies to outperform - appeared to be ending. The
fund's name was changed in 1986 when it had only Pounds 1m under management.
Now, it has Pounds 80m.
In 1987, when stock markets collapsed, the fund lost 30 to 40 per cent of
its value - not unusual at the time and better than many smaller companies'
funds, but a situation which Findlay would not care to see repeated. 'Until
then,' he says, 'I had been doing much the same as everyone else by
investing in new issues, technology stocks and restaurants. But, after the
crash, I decided to formulate a strategy to create a vehicle to invest in
the US with a lower volatility ratio than most of the other funds.'
Part of this strategy is to adopt a longer investment horizon by trying to
double the share price in two to three years instead of adopting the shorter
term time horizon followed by most other smaller company funds.
The share price must be cheap relative to earnings, cash flow or asset
value, but Findlay will not invest unless a company is well managed.
Most smaller companies' funds seek out firms in rapidly growing sectors of
the economy but, unusually, Findlay tends to avoid those involved in
technology because he believes their performance is too unpredictable and
volatile.
The down-side of this lower-risk strategy is that the fund misses out on
high-growth periods, such as 1991 when the US bio-technology sector was the
star performer. Still, Findlay says he is prepared to accept this as the
price for reduced volatility.
'Most people like to invest in a cure for cancer, but these companies tend
to be expensive and have a high risk profile,' he says. 'The primary goal
for me is not to lose any money in an individual investment, so I try to
find understandable businesses with predictable earnings.'
He tends to avoid defence stocks and restaurants for the same reasons. 'In a
bad year, my objective is to try not to go down a lot because of the effect
on compounding. At the end of the day, the compounded rate of return is what
matters to investors.'
This means that the list of companies in which the fund invests is decidedly
unglamorous. 'You could fall asleep looking at it,' Findlay admits.
The largest holding, accounting for 4 per cent, is in Tejas Gas, an
unregulated pipelines company which sells their use to gas companies.
Findlay likes it because it earns money each time gas goes through the
lines. 'I try to have companies with a lot of recurring revenues,' he says.
'Tejas has no capital investment to make, so earnings are free to be
investing in buying more pipelines. I never invest in companies which have
to sell equity capital in order to grow.'
Magma Power, another favourite, is also an energy company which produces
electricity through geo-thermal sources. 'It is a very stable business and I
have made three times my money in the four years I have held it.'
Oakwood Homes, which specialises in making prefabricated dwellings, has also
produced good returns. 'One in four homes in the US is built in a factory
and earnings are growing very rapidly as the housing market recovers,' says
Findlay. One disappointment, however, is Pulitzer Publishing, which has
fallen 15 per cent in value since it was bought earlier this year. Findlay
thinks it will recover,
There are 60-80 companies in the fund, but the term 'smaller companies' is
relative in the US since Findlay will choose stocks with a market value
anywhere between Dollars 100m-1bn. The average initial market capitalisation
of his companies is Dollars 400m.
The US market offers around 1,500 stocks from which to choose and Findlay
says he relies on industry contacts rather than brokers to find the ones he
wants. He tries to make use of market inefficiencies in his search.
What of the currency risk? Findlay admits he has not been active at hedging
the fund, which did not seem necessary when the dollar was cheap in 1987.
'We have got a better system now so that, if the dollar is over-valued, we
will think of hedging.'
Although this is a smaller companies' fund, Findlay's aim is to beat both
the Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of smaller companies,
and the S &amp; P 500, which follows the performance of the largest stocks. This
requires tight discipline, and Findlay says he sometimes has to force
himself to sell a stock he likes once he thinks it is over-valued. But he
stresses: 'The performance of this fund has come by controlling risk, even
in a terrible market like 1990.'
Charges. The fund has a 5 per cent initial levy and a 1.5 per cent annual.
The present bid/offer spread is about 6.5 per cent. Because the fund has
more than 50 per cent of its assets outside the EC, it qualifies for a Pep
allowance of only Pounds 1,500 instead of the full Pounds 6,000. Hypo F &amp; C
does not have a specific Pep attached to it.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: International bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows the 10 highest-performing international bond funds in the
year to August 1. The average growth rate was 26 per cent and the top six
funds managed returns of at least 30 per cent, according to figures from
Micropal.
Philip Saunders, manager of Guinness Flight's Global High Income bond trust,
said the 'bumper capital gains' had been achieved mainly because of the fall
in the value of sterling once it left the exchange rate mechanism last
September.
'Currency returns can account for more than 50 per cent of returns in
international bond funds. Sterling investors have been protected from the
devaluation, which is part of the reason for holding an
internationally-based portfolio,' he added.
Caroline Hay, manager of Newton's international bond fund, also said the
gains arose from an investment strategy which recognised that interest rates
in Europe would fall and the ERM was unsustainable.
Her fund has benefited from the strength of the yen relative to the dollar
since increasing its yen holding at the beginning of the year; the fund has
now switched to being overweight in dollars.
Both funds attribute their relatively high yields to investing in the
high-yielding Italian and Spanish bond markets, but the Guinness Flight fund
aims for income while Newton goes for total return. Neither manager expects
the same level of capital returns over the next year.
But both say there are further gains to be made and bond funds will continue
to offer a higher fixed rate of income than cash.
Whittingdale's fund is dollar-denominated and invests only in short-dated US
government bonds.
Its performance in sterling terms is determined by that of the dollar; for
sterling investors, this has meant capital gains as sterling has weakened
against the dollar in the past year.
Minimum investment is Dollars 2,000, with an initial charge of 1.25 per cent
and an annual charge of 1 per cent.
The initial charges for the Guinness Flight fund are on a sliding scale
depending on the level of investment. The minimum for this is Pounds 1,000
and the highest charge of 3.5 per cent is for investments up to Pounds
9,999.
The lowest charge - of 1 per cent - is on Pounds 50,000 and above. The
annual fee is 0.75 per cent.
Newton's international bond fund has a 2 percentage point discount off its 6
per cent initial charge and has waived its 1.25 per cent annual management
fee, both for an unspecified period. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Pain in Spain for holiday
home-buyers - New tax could make life more complicated for those owning
property through offshore companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE IMPOSITION of a new tax
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the 5 per cent impuesto especial - has brought into question the advantages
of owning a holiday home in Spain through an offshore company.
In the good old days - probably before those of time-share - you would be
encouraged to buy such a property through a non-Spanish (probably
Gibraltarian) company, either by the vendor or by some friendly local
expatriate or adviser.
The reasons given for owning your holiday home through a non-Spanish company
could be any one or more of the following:
To avoid ISD, Spain's equivalent to inheritance tax.
The rate varies but can be as high as 81.6 per cent, although only where the
inheritance is more than Pta100m and passes between people with no family
relationship.
Recipients resident in Spain are charged ISD on all gifts and inheritances,
but ISD is charged only on Spanish-sited assets for non-residents. If,
therefore, you are a non-Spanish resident and you own your casa through a
non-Spanish company, you will be owning shares in a company outside Spain
and not the property directly. Therefore, you will be outside the scope of
Spanish ISD.
Another advantage of the offshore company relates to the lack of a
double-tax treaty with Spain covering death duties. If you are UK-domiciled
when you die, your estate will be charged UK inheritance tax and the
beneficiary of your Spanish property will be charged ISD unless you have set
up an offshore company.
To avoid the Spanish equivalent of capital gains tax on a sale or gift.
For non-Spanish residents, Spanish tax is charged on the disposal of Spanish
property but not on the sale of shares in a non-Spanish company.
To avoid the costs on a re-sale or gift - which can be as much as 11 per
cent.
The greater part of these costs is taken up by the Spanish equivalent of
stamp duty, ITP. For residential property, this is generally 6 per cent of
the sale price.
To avoid plus valia, which is a local tax charged on the increase in the
so-called catastral value since acquisition.
Land in Spain has a value which can be ascertained from the local town hall.
Historically, catastral values have lagged behind market value; but now that
the market price for Spanish property has fallen, the catastral values are
closer to market value.
To avoid the rules of succession in Spain (in other words, who gets what
when you die).
Spanish succession rules apply only to Spanish nationals, and provided you
can prove that your will complies with your local law, this usually is
accepted.
The reasons for buying a Spanish property through a non-Spanish company are
quite convincing, but what are the drawbacks? First, if you are a
non-Spanish resident and you are thinking of letting your property there,
the Hacienda (Spain's Inland Revenue) can make non-resident companies pay
corporation income tax, or ISS, at 25 per cent on the gross rent received
from the property.
Second, if you are resident in the UK for tax purposes, owning a property in
Spain through a non-Spanish company could result in tax problems in the UK.
The Inland Revenue can charge income tax on the benefit of accommodation
provided by a company if you are an employee or director (including,
arguably, a deemed director who, in fact, controls the company).
One way to avoid this charge could be for your Spanish property-owning
company to be controlled by a trust, so that accommodation is provided
through being a beneficiary of this rather than an employee or director of
the company. Where your trust should be resident depends on your domicile.
If you are domiciled in the UK, there is little advantage in setting up a
trust elsewhere.
Third, and not least, is the new impuesto especial which applies to all
non-Spanish companies holding Spanish property. The tax is charged on the
catastral value and accrues on December 31 each year, starting in 1992.
There are a number of exemptions, especially where the non-resident owner
can satisfy the authorities of the origin of the funds used to acquire the
casa, as well as the identity of its owners (together with an undertaking
that the authorities will be notified of any change). At present, the
Hacienda is interpreting this exemption very narrowly - in particular, when
dealing with Gibraltar holding companies.
The impuesto especial poses no real threat to an English resident buying his
casa through a non-Spanish resident company and trust structure - assuming
the original source of funds is ascertainable, clean, and causes no
embarrassment to either the company or the beneficial owner. But where this
is not the case, the problems may not be quite so simple to resolve.

JOHNSON FRY is launching a monthly postal auction for buyers and sellers of
second hand with-profit endowment policies.
Selling a second-hand endowment policy is usually a more attractive option
than surrendering it to the life insurance company because buyers are
attracted by the steady growth that with-profits policies can provide.
Bidders will be required to make a deposit of Pounds 500 for a submitted bid
(a catalogue of policies for sale can be obtained from Johnson Fry
Securities, 20 Regent St, London SW1Y 4PZ). There will be a reserve price
for each policy and no bid below that will be accepted.
The first auction date in on September 14 and bids must be received by 10am
that day.

SALES WERE a prominent feature during a fairly quiet week. Two directors of
Alba, chairman John Harris and chief executive Daniel Harris, each sold
650,000 shares at 145.6p. The group has a diverse range of businesses
including audio and video goods and giftware. Over the past six months or
so, the share price has performed steadily and both men retain considerable
holdings, accounting for more than 34 per cent of the company.
Evans of Leeds, a property development group, is another company where the
share price has been doing well. Recent sales at between 204-208p by Michael
Evans, a non-executive director, and Bill Gibson, an executive director,
still leave each with a considerable number of shares.
Indeed, Evans - who, with other members of his family, holds almost 50 per
cent of the company - has reduced his holding by only a small proportion.
Scantronic makes alarms used against intruders and for the care of the
elderly. The recent sale by Christopher Brookes, the chairman and chief
executive, was made for tax purposes.

AS SEPTEMBER draws closer, university business expansion schemes will begin
to dry up. BES companies are allowed to buy only property which is empty,
which means before term begins.
This week's offerings include another FT-SE 100-linked scheme sponsored by
Close Brothers. BESSA Wye College is an arranged exit, cash-backed scheme to
provide accommodation for Wye College, University of London.
Investors can choose one or two companies. The first offers a fixed price of
121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to a 13.9 per cent
annual compound return to a higher-rate taxpayer.
The second will give a fixed return of 60p, plus a variable return of 2.44p
for every 1 per cent growth in the FT-SE.
There is a lock-in once the index achieves 25 per cent growth (giving
investors a return of 121p) and 0.6p for every 1 per cent growth thereafter.
The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Sponsor Neill Clerk's cash-backed Glamorgan Residences aims to raise Pounds
4.5m for student accommodation for the University of Glamorgan. The arranged
exit price is 122p and minimum investment Pounds 1,000.
Capital Prime Properties, an assured-tenancy BES sponsored by Johnson Fry,
seeks to raise Pounds 5m to 'buy property in London as cheaply as possible,
add value to it where it can, and let at the highest possible rental.'
The minimum application is Pounds 3,000. There is a 4 per cent discount for
applications received before September 7, and 2 per cent from then to
October 5.
Capital Ventures next week launches Cambridge Collegiate Consortium, a
cash-backed offer with a fixed exit price of 122.5p.
For those who prefer trading ventures, Safewear Wessex, a Hampshire-based
corporate clothing and work-wear company, has launched a BES trading company
called Bodycover plc which will acquire the parent.
The company will continue to supply corporate clothing and plans to create a
franchise network.

<TEXT>
THE DECISION by the troubled Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire friendly society to
impose a 12 per cent levy on its 67,000 policyholders for a compensation
fund is unprecedented, says the Registry of Friendly Societies.
In a letter to policyholders, dated August 18, L &amp; Y said it had reduced all
unit prices on the society's benefit funds by 12 per cent on August 1 for a
Pounds 10m compensation fund.
It fears that a High Court ruling will oblige it to pay compensation to
roughly three-quarters of its policyholders. Bernard White, treasurer, said
that since the society is a mutual, members would be liable for compensation
were the High Court to decide that the society had to pay. The irony is that
policyholders are contributing towards a fund for their own compensation.
The society went to court for directions on how to deal with a series of
fundamental errors which came to light last year.
More than half the policyholders at L &amp; Y - some 39,000 - have suffered as a
result of a Pounds 4.3m property write-off on unauthorised investments in
its Capital Secure fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash
deposits and gilts - but it was found to have invested Pounds 6.8m in a
hotel development near Rotherham which, after falls in the property market,
was valued at Pounds 2.5m last year. It also invested in the society's
present headquarters, Moorgate Hall, a Grade II listed building in
Rotherham.
The court is to determine the way in which the property losses should be
treated and John Ramsden, L &amp; Y's chairman, said the advice he had received
from his lawyers indicated that the society might be required to compensate
policyholders.
The other issue on which the court is to make a judgment is whether 7,000
policies which were funded by a lump sum are eligible for tax-exempt status.
To qualify for tax exemption, the policy must be funded by regular premiums.
Any lump sum payment is often used to buy an annuity but L &amp; Y had not
arranged this.
At the end of last year, L &amp; Y's actuary estimated that the society's
contingent liabilities were Pounds 8.3m. White says the society is being
prudent in setting up a Pounds 10m compensation fund, Pounds 6.3m of which
is the estimated payment to those invested in the Capital Secure fund and
Pounds 2m for the 7,000 policyholders who may find their policies do not
qualify for tax exemption. Policyholders are angry, since they were not
consulted over the decision. 'I'm faced with a fait accompli. Nobody
consulted me,' said Andy Anderson, a member who lives in Morayshire,
Scotland. He said his request for an extraordinary general meeting was
turned down.
The money is being held on deposit with the Royal Bank of Scotland, L &amp; Y's
trustee, and the society says it will be returned to policyholders if the
court does not require compensation to be paid.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECAST vary sharply over the interim results of HSBC Holdings, the parent
of Midland Bank, to be announced on Tuesday. Pre-tax profit estimates range
from about Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 1.3bn, both substantially higher than
last time's Pounds 521m.
Midland has already revealed profits up at Pounds 385m (Pounds 60m) and Hang
Seng Bank has weighed in with HKDollars 2.75bn (HKDollars 2.34bn). Some
Pounds 200m from a favourable HK dollar exchange rate will also be included.
The only possible black cloud could be China's cooling economy.
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, is expected to announce a
strong increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.4m to between
Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m on Thursday. Much of the rise is likely to be
accounted for by the contribution from Specialty Coatings International, the
US coatings company bought for Dollars 434m earlier this year, although
estimates differ of how large this contribution will be.
Analysts are hoping for evidence from the company that SCI has been
integrated into the group and is performing well. The interim dividend is
forecast at 5p, from a restated 4.7p last year.
Analysts expect Ladbroke Group to report a fall in pre-tax profits for the
first half on Thursday. Last time's profits will be restated under FRS 3 to
about Pounds 81.5m to account for estimated hotel disposals and this time
forecasts range from about Pounds 68m, if there is a higher interest charge,
to about Pounds 74m. The one bright spot should be UK racing. The dividend
should be held at 4.92p.
Rolls-Royce, also reporting on Thursday, is set to reveal operating profits
sharply lower at about Pounds 30m (Pounds 44m), affected by the conditions
in the aerospace and industrial power markets. Including exceptionals should
result in flattish pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20m.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the mustard-to-lavatory cleaner group, is expected to show
an increase in interim pre-tax profits to around Pounds 150m (Pounds 134.2m)
when it reports on Thursday. The shares have been poor performers with
worries about prices squeezed by retailers, the slowdown in the European
economies, and longer term concerns about the value of brands.
Burmah Castrol is reporting interim results the same day and is expected to
announce net profits of between Pounds 44m and Pounds 46m. The group's
German operations, which since April have had a contribution from Tribol,
the industrial lubricants bought from ICI for Pounds 31.7m, are going to be
watched carefully.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Putting trust in pensions - Debbie
Harrison finds a small but well-formed alternative to life companies in
providing an income after retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES THE average employee have a real choice when it comes to a personal
pension provider? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Despite most financial
institutions being able to offer these plans, the fact is that life offices
have maintained a virtual monopoly on this lucrative market.
Personal pensions were introduced in July 1988 to allow employees to opt out
individually from the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), and to
provide a tax-efficient investment vehicle for their retirement savings. Of
the 5m plans sold to date, an estimated 97 per cent are life office
products.
So, what happened to the other institutions? Most of the banks and building
societies, deterred by the cost of setting up systems to offer pensions,
rushed with almost indecent haste into the welcoming arms of the life
offices and signed exclusive sales agreements in return for handsome
commissions.
One of the few sectors to challenge the life office monopoly - the unit
trust groups - saw its meagre presence reduced further when Fidelity
withdrew from the market earlier this month. Fidelity's action leaves only
three main unit trust providers: Rothschild Asset Management (RAM), Gartmore
and Murray Johnstone.
Despite this, unit trust pension plans are worth considering by both
individuals and employers interested in setting up a simple, cost-effective
group arrangement that offers flexibility of contributions without penalty.
Murray Johnstone's product is a group money-purchase scheme under which the
unit trust group handles the investment but the administration is looked
after by a third party. RAM and Gartmore continue to provide individual
plans and undertake both investment and administration. Both companies are
keen to develop in the group market.
Assuming you are satisfied with the performance, one of the main attractions
of unit trust personal pensions is the charging structure. These products
offer a simple, clear fee system with two elements: the initial charge (or
bid/offer spread) and the annual management charge.
RAM's charges are 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual while Gartmore's
are 6 per cent initial and 0.5-1.5 per cent annual, depending on the fund.
Murray Johnstone cut its fees last year and now imposes an initial charge of
up to 1 per cent and an annual management levy of 1.5 per cent.
Bear in mind, however, that RAM and Gartmore allow in their initial charge
for a commission payment to the adviser, part of which could be rebated or
re-invested. Murray Johnstone usually sells through fee-based advisers.
By comparison, life office charges are notoriously complex and it is
impossible for the layman to find out what he is actually paying. In
addition to the bid/offer spread and annual management fee, there are policy
and administration fees. Many unit-linked insurance plans also allocate the
early contributions to 'initial' or 'capital' units which carry a higher
annual charge than standard units.
Furthermore, regular premium plans tend to pay a hefty up-front commission
to the adviser, often accounting for most of the initial two years'
contributions. This is usually paid from the capital unit charges. Unit
trust groups can pay only a single premium commission of 4-5 per cent, which
is incorporated in the bid/offer spread.
While it can be shown that there is little difference in total commission
cost between the regular and single premium method over a 25-year investment
period, few plans last this long in practice and many are terminated within
the first few years.
Robert Ivey, financial services manager at actuarial consultant R. Watson
and Sons, says: 'Many people with personal pensions will face the situation
where they have to stop making regular contributions, perhaps because they
have moved to a company which has a good pension scheme, been made
redundant, or simply can no longer afford to contribute.
'In these circumstances, it is important that they receive the full value of
their contributions. Contracts arranged as a series of single premiums are
likely to provide considerably better value for money in this event. This is
the standard basis used by unit trust providers.'
Despite this advantage, several problems have beset the unit trust groups.
Personal pensions are a heavy administrative burden on providers and, while
life offices are geared up to cope with this, unit trust groups have had to
start from scratch.
Moreover, unit trust groups are not able to offer important features like
life cover and waiver of premium insurance. In most cases, this has to be
bought separately, although Gartmore has set up an arrangement with Swiss
Life to provide these benefits.
Explaining Fidelity's reasons for abandoning its personal pension plan, Mary
Blair, executive director of product development, said: 'We see ourselves
primarily as an investment house, and we found dealing with the complex
pensions legislation and administration very onerous.' Fidelity has
transferred its clients to Professional Life, which will handle the pensions
administration while maintaining an investment link with Fidelity's funds.
Other well-known groups did not even attempt to provide a unit trust
personal pension. Save &amp; Prosper and M &amp; G decided to launch unit-linked
products through their life operations while Mercury Fund Managers (the
investment arm of merchant bank SG Warburg) set up Mercury Life in July 1989
specifically to launch a unit-linked product.
Midland Bank switched to a unit-linked product despite the apparent initial
success of its unit trust plan. Last year Invesco linked up with Provident
Life to provide unit trust investment but, again, via a life office
unit-linked plan.
In all of these cases, the higher charging structure and higher commissions
paid on unit-linked personal pensions made them favourites over the more
cost-effective but less lucrative unit trust version.
Employees and employers interested in unit trust personal pensions, whether
on a group or individual basis, should bear in mind the long-term nature of
this type of investment and seek advice to select the fund suited best to
their own risk profile. The unit trust groups do offer deposit and gilt
funds, for example, and recommend a switch to these safe havens five years
before retirement to protect gains in the event of a stock market crash.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Is it really the decade of the bond?
 -A three-year rally has encouraged bond investment, says Philip Coggan, who
explains how to buy gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO said that the 1990s would be the decade of the bond have not
looked too foolish so far. Bond prices around the world have been rising and
gilts (bonds issued by the government) have enjoyed a three-year rally in
the UK.
The redemption yield on long-dated high-coupon gilts has fallen from nearly
12.3 per cent at the end of April 1990 to around 7.5 per cent today. The
long-dated gilts price index has risen nearly 50 per cent over the same
period.
Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, and the subsequent
falls in short-term interest rates, have helped the rally. But the key to
the revival in gilts market has been the fall in the rate of inflation, and
investors' expectations that the UK has moved into a low inflation era.
Inflation quickly erodes the capital value of a fixed interest security such
as a gilt. If inflation is 5 per cent, then after 10 years the real value of
Pounds 100 invested in a gilt falls to Pounds 61.39. Ignoring dividend
payments, Pounds 100 invested in gilts in 1945 would be worth little more
than Pounds 2 today.
But, with headline inflation at 1.4 per cent, gilts look a much more
attractive proposition. A long gilt yielding 7.5 per cent is thus offering a
real gross return of 6.1 per cent.
That compares well with the real return on offer in April 1990, at the start
of the recent rally. Then inflation was 8.1 per cent, so the real return was
just 4.2 per cent.
The apparently high real returns on offer at the moment are partly illusory.
The headline rate of inflation has been flattered by the falls in mortgage
rates. Stripping out that effect, the underlying rate of inflation in July
was 2.9 per cent, bringing the real yield down to 4.6 per cent.
Nevertheless, such a real return looks attractive in historical terms.
Furthermore, the fall in base rates to 6 per cent means that cash deposits
yield less than long term gilts (the reverse was true in April 1990, when
base rates were 15 per cent and gilt yields were 12).
Those who doubted the potential of the bond market to rally were less
concerned with demand, than with supply. The government is having to fund a
Pounds 50bn budget deficit this year and is meeting most of the gap with
gilts issues. To date the government seems to have had no difficulty funding
itself and is even ahead of schedule.
Gilt prices and yields
Private investors should understand a number of factors before they buy
gilts. The first is that as prices rise, yields fall. So normally speaking,
gilts do well when interest rates decline.
But much depends on the maturity (see box on jargon) of the gilt concerned.
Yields on a short-dated gilt will follow base rates very closely, since such
gilts are comparable to cash.
Long dated gilts will not always rise in response to a base rate cut. If,
for example, monetary policy was seen as being too lax, a base rate cut
might provoke fears of inflation causing prices of long dated gilts to fall
(and yields to rise).
A second factor is that gilts rarely trade at face value. Many at the moment
trade above it. Thus investors must realise the difference between the
running and the gross redemption yield (see box).
If a gilt is trading above par value, then the running yield will be higher
than the gross redemption yield; if a gilt is trading below par value, the
reverse will be true. Remember that tax will be deducted from the income,
and not the redemption yield.
On Thursday, for example, the Treasury 13 per cent 2000 was trading at a
price of 132 3/32 . For every Pounds 132.09 you paid, you would get an
income of Pounds 13, a running yield of 9.84 per cent. For a top rate
taxpayer, that return would fall to 5.9 per cent. But if you hold the bond
to maturity, you will lose almost a quarter of your capital. The quoted
gross redemption yield is 7.04 per cent; the net redemption yield (a complex
calculation) will be considerably lower than that.
Capital gains made on gilts are tax-free. However, the corollary is that
losses on gilts cannot be offset, for Capital Gains Tax purposes, against
profits made elsewhere.
Index-linked gilts
Index-linked gilts are complex animals. Both the interest payments and the
maturity value increase in line with the retail prices index. The coupon is
normally 2 or 2.5 per cent.
However, the price of index-linked gilts does not go up in line with the
RPI; instead it is set by supply and demand. If you invest in an
index-linked gilt at 100 in August 1993, and the RPI increases by 5 per cent
over the following year, the price in August 1994 will not necessarily be
105.
To date, most index-linked gilt prices have not risen as quickly as the RPI.
Anyone buying an existing long-dated index-linked gilt at current prices can
look forward to an additional catching-up gain; their real return will
accordingly be 3 per cent plus.
The calculations are complicated because the indexation period does not
exactly coincide with the life of the gilt. Indexation starts eight months
before the gilt's issue and ends eight months before maturity.
The consequence is that the investor is at risk from inflation in the last
eight months of the gilt's life. This matters most when the maturity date of
the gilt is only two or three years away. The FT shows the real yields on
index-linked gilts based on two inflation assumptions - 5 and 10 per cent.
The higher the assumed rate, the lower the real return.
Take the 2.5pc 2003 issue, quoted in Wednesday's paper at a price of 164 1/8
. The real yields shown were 2.85 per cent at 10 per cent inflation and 3.16
per cent at 5 per cent inflation. That would translate to nominal yields of
12.85 per cent and 8.16 per cent respectively.
The attraction of index-linked gilts for private investors may depend on
their income needs and tax position. Most of the return comes in the form of
tax-free capital gain; which may suit top rate taxpayers. The corollary is
that there is little income, which may not suit retired investors.
Prospects for gilts
For private investors, the key question is whether it is too late to join in
the rally. Chris Anthony, sterling bond economist at UBS, thinks 'it is more
or less too late. There is some value in index-linked stocks (see below)
since, in the run-up to a possible tax-raising Budget, investors may be
attracted by their tax efficiency.' But he sees long gilt yields rising to
8.25 per cent by June next year.
Ian Shepperdson, of Greenwell Montagu, says the market has entered a
consolidation phase. He believes base rates will fall to 4 per cent by the
end of the year which will be good news for short-dated gilts. But there may
be some political alarms during the party conference season which could
worry gilt investors. With real yields on index-linked gilts at 3.3 per
cent, he says they look a good buy to private investors prepared to put in
money for the medium term.
How to buy
A private investor who is interested in gilts has three options; buying
gilts from a stockbroker; buying gilts through the National Savings Stock
Register at the post office; and buying them through a bond fund.
A stockbroker is probably the best route for the wealthy investor with a
six-figure portfolio who wants to put tens of thousands into gilts. If you
fit that category, the chances are you already have a broker.
Brokers can handle large orders, at reasonably economic commissions; and
they should be skillful enough to get you the best price on the market.
The Post Office system is best suited for those with relatively small sums
of money, who feel confident enough to choose between the many gilt issues
on offer. (The Bank of England has issued a booklet, called Investing in
Gilts which is available from post offices).
The commission on a gilt purchase bought via the Post Office is Pounds 1 for
the first Pounds 250, then 50p for every extra Pounds 125 or part. A
purchase of Pounds 2,000 of gilts would cost Pounds 8.
One advantage of buying via the National Savings Stock Register is that
interest can be paid without tax deducted, which may suit non-taxpayers. The
limit on an NSSR purchase was recently increased from Pounds 10,000 to
Pounds 25,000.
However, the disadvantage is that transactions are conducted by post and the
NSSR cannot guarantee to buy at a particular price or on a particular day.
For those, who do not feel expert enough to select their own gilts, a bond
fund might be the ideal solution. These are normally unit trusts which buy a
portfolio of bonds, with the aim of offering investors income, capital
growth, or a combination of the two.
There have traditionally been two objections to the use of bond funds for
private investors. The first is that profits on bond fund holdings, unlike
profits on gilts themselves, are subject to capital gains tax. However, few
investors use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance.
The second problem is that the managers' fees can subtract substantially
from investor returns, especially when yields are low. Some managers have
tried to tackle this problem by cutting the initial charge; notably the
Aberdeen Gilt Growth and Income funds, Fidelity's Gilt And Fixed Interest
Fund and Murray Acumen Reserve. But annual charges in the sector can still
be high, with some funds charging as much as 1.5 per cent.
Offshore gilt funds can pay income gross to investors, which can make them
more attractive for non-taxpayers. Weekend FT regularly publishes tables
showing the yields and performance records of both onshore and offshore bond
funds. The fund with the highest yield is not necessarily the best; it could
be that the capital is being eaten away to provide the yield. As of August
1, the onshore gilts trusts with the best performance over the last five
years were: Murray Acumen Reserve, Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt and Abbey
Capital Reserve.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: A fine time to land in a fix - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED-RATE mortgages are now extremely attractive for potential house
buyers, according to financial adviser Berry Birch &amp; Noble - and it is hard
to disagree.
Even though most experts seem to expect a base rate reduction before, or
around the time of, the chancellor's Budget in November, the variable
mortgage rate is unlikely to reflect that cut in full. A one percentage
point cut in base rates might lead to a reduction of only a half, or a
quarter, point for mortgages.
As Mike Beerling, Berry Birch &amp; Noble's mortgage director, explains:
'Mortgage interest rates cannot fall much more. Any further drop in UK
interest rates will give building societies very little scope to reduce
mortgage interest rates as the societies need to maintain competitive rates
to attract savers.'
Borrowers appear to be listening to such advice. According to the Council of
Mortgage Lenders, just under half of the mortgages and re-mortgages taken
out in the first quarter of 1993 had a fixed rate of interest.
Since an increase in interest rates seems a threat more in the medium than
the short term, it is probably better to lock in to a mortgage with a longer
period, even though the rates normally are higher. Halifax's present range
of fixed rates, for example, varies from 6.75 per cent (APR 8.3 per cent)
until November 30 1995, to 8.75 per cent (APR 9.1 per cent) until November
30 2003.
The Halifax is also offering a series of 'stepped' mortgages, with a low
rate until November 30 1994 and then a higher rate over the rest of the
term.
For existing customers, the rates are: 6.5 per cent, then 6.75 per cent till
November 30, 1995 (APR 8.3 per cent); 6.95 per cent, then 7.45 per cent
until May 31, 1997 (APR 8.3 per cent); and 7.2 per cent, then 7.95 per cent
until November 30, 1998 (APR 8.5 per cent).
Arrangement fees vary from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250 and redemption fees from
three to five months' interest, depending on the term of the loan.
First-time buyers must take out buildings and contents insurance or a
mortgage payment protector policy from the society; however, they benefit
from a lower rate in the initial period.
Northern Rock building society is offering a 6.89 per cent fix (APR 7.3 per
cent) until August 1 1997. The arrangement fee is Pounds 275 and borrowers
must take out home and contents insurance.
These rates may not be the absolute lowest that fixed-rate mortgages will
ever reach but they are probably pretty close to the bottom. If you are
about to take out a mortgage, in historical terms, you are very lucky to
have the chance to fix at present rates.
CAPITAL SHARES were designed to do extremely well in a bull market and they
have certainly been up to the task this year.
According to SG Warburg, the average capital share rose 65 per cent between
January 1 and August 20, compared with a 15 per cent total return from the
FT-A All-Share index over the same period.
Split capital investment trusts issue capital shares to attract investors
who want a geared stock market return. The rights of capital shares vary
from trust to trust.
In a simple trust, there will be two classes of shares: income (which get
all the revenue) and capital (which get no income, but all the growth). More
complex issues throw in zeros (which pay no income, but get steady capital
growth) or stepped preference shares (which earn steady income and capital
growth).
The key fact to grasp is that capital shares are at the end of the queue.
All the other shareholders get paid off first.
Only if the trust's assets grow significantly will the capital shareholders
earn a decent return. But once that target is passed, capital shareholders
normally get all the growth and the returns start to look really attractive.
As an example, Warburg cites River Plate capital shares. If you assume the
trust's assets can grow at 5 per cent a year, the gross redemption yield to
capital shareholders (at the August 20 price) will be 18.3 per cent. And
River Plate capital shares have already risen by more than 150 per cent this
year.
Of course, such high rewards as these do not come without their risks. When
the market and trust assets fall, the price of capital shares drops even
faster as the prospects of a good payout recedes.
Warburg says: 'Shorter-term investors may want to consider taking some
profits, as we believe that the UK market is at or near its peak for the
current year and there is a genuine risk of some consolidation.'
It adds, however: 'On a longer-term view, we still believe that certain
capital shares represent very good value and are capable of generating
outperformance against the markets.'
For those who believe the present bull market has plenty of mileage left in
it, and who are willing to accept a high level of risk to their capital, the
Warburg-recommended capital shares are: Fulcrum, Gartmore Scotland, General
Consolidated, M &amp; G Income, River &amp; Mercantile, River Plate, St David's and
Yeoman.
But be warned: these shares are definitely not for the cautious, for those
who cannot afford to lose any part of their capital, or for those who want
income.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: US tax returns incentive - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US expatriates who have not filed their federal income tax returns, are
being given an incentive by the Internal Revenue Service to come clean.
Moore Stephens, the New York-based accountants, says that US citizens living
abroad can now exclude housing costs and up to Dollars 70,000 of
foreign-earned income from their gross income.
Previously, these exclusions could only be claimed on an income tax return
or an amendment filed within a limited period. Under the new rules, an
expatriate taxpayer can file returns which are years overdue and no time
limit is set for filing a return claiming the exclusions.
However, Moore Stephens warns that if expatriates owe federal income taxes
and are contacted by the IRS before filing their returns, they lose the tax
break.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Talking telephone numbers - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US appetite for mobile communications seems limitless. Even before
AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn plus takeover of McCaw, shares in the UK mobile operator
Vodafone had shot up, thanks largely to US investors.
The shares began May at 377p then enjoyed a rise in anticipation of
encouraging year-end results. The market was pleased by the profits and
outlook and the shares resumed their climb even before the McCaw deal. They
closed last night at 579p, up more than 50 per cent in less than four
months.
Moreover, Vodafone has been one of the week's heaviest traded stocks on Wall
Street where it has an ADR listing. More than a quarter of the company's
shares are held in the US; a significant increase in a few months.
What does Wall Street see in Vodafone? 'The size of the McCaw deal convinced
US investors that other cellular operators are undervalued,' says Laurence
Heyworth, telecommunications analyst at Robert Fleming.
Vodafone is not the only beneficiary of the cellular gold rush. But as the
world's largest dedicated mobile company it is the prime magnet for funds in
search of a second McCaw.
If they are after another takeover, investors are probably backing the wrong
horse. Allowing for a typical premium, a purchaser would need to find about
Pounds 7bn. The only telecommunications companies with that sort of spare
cash are BT and AT&amp;T. But after their recent sprees, neither is in the
market. Anyway, regulatory hurdles would prevent BT from making the
acquisition and accounting considerations deter everyone. A buyer of
Vodafone would have to take a gigantic goodwill write-off since its net
assets are worth only about Pounds 600m.
Investors banking instead on still larger returns from Vodafone's businesses
in the UK and overseas can take some comfort. Europe's cellular operators
enjoy a licence to print money. They are monopolists or duopolists in
lightly regulated markets. Their customers regard the services as essential
and pay little of the bill personally.
Vodafone prints more than most. Last year its operating profit was 46 per
cent of sales and its cash flow 58 per cent. With 115,000 net new
connections to its existing analogue network since last December, 50,000 of
them paying the standard business tariff, its margins are unlikely to fall
significantly this year.
Long term, Vodafone wants as large a population base abroad as at home,
allowing for relative income differentials. Yet its overseas licences are
mostly recent acquisitions, and significant foreign revenue is at least two
years away.
The UK markets will determine the company's medium term fortunes. It is
astonishing that Vodafone and Cellnet have avoided price regulation for so
long. A large part of the explanation is that competition has always been
just around the corner.
After repeated delays, it is finally coming, in the shape of Mercury
One-2-One, a digital PCN network about to be launched in and around London.
One-2-One is not going all-out for the existing operators on price. Its
prospective tariffs have so far obliged Vodafone to do no more than cut the
special premium on its business tariff in London, and price local calls on
its new 'MetroDigital' network, coming on stream in October, more
competitively. With capital costs falling fast, that is still compatible
with 50 per cent margins provided One-2-One expands the market while only
slowly bringing down prices.
That may happen. It is what Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, has in
mind when he says of One-2-One: 'We need you as competition, otherwise we
will get regulated'.
However, if it does happen it may not be the end of the matter. For if
competition fails to bring down margins, the case for regulation will be
unanswerable. On the other hand if 'softly softly' fails to get Mercury many
customers, the very survival of One-2-One may push Mercury into a serious
price war for the first time in the industry's history.
Private consumer who do pay their own bills can only relish the prospect.
But neither scenario would comfort Vodafone's new US investors.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Six years on, memories of the crash revive - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICANS cannot resist anniversaries. They are not content with making a
big fuss of just the nice round numbers like 10, 20 or 25 years. Anything
that happened this time any number of years ago is an excuse for a party, a
commemoration, or for the chance to sell a few million more greeting cards.
In fact, why wait a whole year? This week, New Yorkers who work at the World
Trade Centre observed the six-month anniversary of the day the twin towers
were bombed. At least the Floridians who suffered at the hands of Hurricane
Andrew's fury had the patience to wait 12 months before remembering their
disaster.
So, it was no surprise this week when Wall Street analysts pointed out that
the US stock markets reached their pre-crash high six years ago this past
Wednesday. On August 25 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 25
points to 2,722.
Just a few weeks later, of course, the great crash of October wiped a
staggering 36 per cent off the Dow's value.
The point of noting this particular anniversary, of course, was to suggest,
none too subtly, that history might repeat itself. After all, this week the
Dow rose on August 25 to an all-time high of 3,652.09. And, in the two
trading days that followed, the average failed to advance past that mark,
slipping back amid profit-taking.
Could this be an omen? Are the markets heading for the kind of calamitous
event that made October 1987 (not to mention August 25 1987) such a
memorable date?
Few really think so, for 1993 is different from 1987 in one all-important
characteristic. Six years ago interest rates were rising - a key ingredient
in any big market correction. Today, interest rates are falling - and to
record low levels, to boot.
While no one is discounting the possibility that stocks may struggle to
sustain their present highs, and could even suffer some kind of setback, the
consensus among Wall Street analysts is that as long as interest rates stay
low, the markets should be in good shape.
It is difficult to over-state the role interest rates have played in the
1993 bull market. It certainly has not been the robustness of the economy
that has propelled share prices to such heights this past year.
August has been a case in point. Equities have performed extraordinary well
in spite of the fact that the economic news has been less than encouraging.
So far this month, stocks have risen on all but six of 19 trading days, and
only once (in yesterday's morning session) did the Dow register a
double-digit decline. Countless record highs have been set in August and the
volume of trading has been surprisingly heavy for what is traditionally the
busiest holiday month of the year for market practitioners.
Investors have been buying stocks because interest rates have been falling -
and falling fast - thanks to a still-struggling economy, low inflation, and
a shortage of new bonds.
At the start of August, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond stood at
6.56 per cent. By yesterday morning, the yield had dropped to 6.08 per cent,
the lowest it has been since the Treasury began issuing 30-year bonds on a
regular basis in 1977.
Short-term rates also have fallen sharply this month: the yield on the
two-year note has dropped from 4.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent.
With interest rates so low, stocks are attractive to investors seeking
returns better than the 2 to 3 per cent available on short-term assets like
certificates of deposit and money-market funds.
One problem, however, is that stocks look expensive at the moment, at least
by historical standards. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is trading at 23.5 times
earnings.
Until recently, this did not seem to matter much. However, in the last month
or so, it has been noticeable that investors have become more careful about
where they invest their money.
The search has been on for stocks that have missed out on the summer rally,
or simply those that have underperformed the rest of the market. Thus, over
the past couple of weeks, consumer product stocks such as Procter &amp; Gamble,
Coca-Cola, Pepsico and American Brands have been in favour.
Many consumer stocks have had a difficult 1993, and so are among some of the
few bargains left in the market. Philip Morris is among them, although this
week the stock lost a lot of its recent gains when the tobacco and foods
group decided not to raise its quarterly dividend.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Why records continue to be broken - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD stock market highs have become such regular events that they hardly
merit being called news any more. The Footsie reached an all-time peak on
Wednesday, held it on Thursday and rose again yesterday, making it through
3,100 and just staying above that.
So, what has driven the market to these levels? The combination of largely
favourable economic statistics and corporate news has, no doubt, helped but
two other factors are worth examining.
First, there is the question of the Bundesbank and the rate cut that never
came. On Wednesday, the day before the regular fortnightly Bundesbank
council meeting when decisions on interest rates are made, speculation grew
that a reduction was coming. On Wednesday, too, the Footsie rose 29.9
points. It was all too easy to link the two.
As it turned out, the Bundesbank did not cut rates on Thursday. The Footsie
trembled but closed unchanged, suggesting that it was not the prospect of an
immediate German rate cut that caused Wednesday's rise. Indeed, the German
stock market also rose sharply on Wednesday although it fell on Thursday.
Rather than focus on Europe - after all, German interest rates will fall
sooner or later so it is hardly worth getting too worked up about timing -
consider the US bond market. This has been strong lately, with the yield on
the long bond dropping to near 6 per cent.
Michael Hughes, an economist at BZW, thinks real yields on bonds are coming
down world-wide. A look at the chart shows that, in the UK, real long gilt
yields - those adjusted for inflation - have risen over the past couple of
years. Inflation has gone down faster than yields.
Although falling somewhat recently, real yields are still high. This
suggests one of two things. Either bond yields are set to fall further - in
which case, equities can continue their rise - or inflation is going up
again.
The present view is that an era of low inflation combined with economic
growth - the dream of every finance minister - is dawning. And it might even
be true, for a couple of years at least. If so, a Footsie at 3,100.6 is by
no means over-valued.
It is also worth looking at the performance of individual Footsie stocks
this year. Although the index is up from 2846.5 so far, a rise of 8.9 per
cent, the share prices of around a fifth of the top 100 stocks actually are
lower than they were at the start of the year.
These are mainly drug stocks such as Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham
which have been hit by fears of cuts in health spending; food retailers,
including Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Argyll, affected by theories that
competition in the sector is becoming too intense; and consumer stocks like
Bass, Allied-Lyons, Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, affected by fears that
the revival in consumer spending is sluggish.
If the market were in an over-optimistic phase, then such stocks would not
have been left so far behind.
Turning to economic news, there have been few statistics this week. But what
has come from the Treasury and the CBI has been encouraging. The Treasury
said on Thursday that the economic recovery this year was looking stronger
than had been forecast in the March Budget. At the same time, the CBI raised
its forecasts of economic growth this year and next, with a prediction of a
3 per cent rise in GDP in 1994.
Meanwhile, the official statisticians admitted the recession really was not
as bad as they had thought - little comfort to those who have suffered in
it.
An encouraging trend in corporate stories is the number of deals being done
as companies buy or sell subsidiaries. Buyers - notably MB-Caradon, with its
Pounds 800m purchase this week of the bulk of RTZ's industrial activities
but also Wolseley, with a Pounds 51.5m US purchase - are looking to expand
into the economic upturn.
Sellers, like RTZ and TSB, which sold its EuroDollar car hire subsidiary to
its management for Pounds 118m yesterday, are at last able to get rid of
businesses they no longer want, and at reasonable prices. With all these
deals going on, and rights issues and flotations continuing apace, it is no
wonder the merchant bank sector has been one of the strongest performers so
far this year.
Another excitement this week - which can be taken as a bull point for the
market, too - was Reuters move in offering to buy back Pounds 350m worth of
shares from investors to use up some of its low-yielding cash. Such was the
demand to sell that Reuters had offers of 164.3m shares, 6.5 times the 25m
it wanted to buy even though it was paying Pounds 14 apiece and the market
price was more than Pounds 1 higher.
The reason was that those institutional investors which run tax-exempt
funds, such as pension funds, could reclaim a tax credit from the Inland
Revenue on top of the Pounds 14 from Reuters. In theory, then, institutions
have Pounds 350m plus the tax rebate to put back into the stock market -
more than offsetting MB-Caradon's Pounds 334m rights issue.
Trading results remain patchy although expectations are that forecasts for
full-year earnings growth from the market as a whole will be revised upwards
once the interim reporting season gets going properly next month.
This week saw BZW upgrading its profit forecast for Imperial Chemical
Industries, not such a big business since it demerged Zeneca but still an
important market leader. ICI told BZW that July had been a good month.
Another pointer came from Graseby, the electronics group, which said this
week it would cut its 1993 dividend from 10.7p to 6.6p, after reporting
interim profits up 18 per cent, because it wanted to retain cash for
investment.

FT  28 AUG 93 / The Long View: From boom to doom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENDING Barry Riley's return from holiday next week he has arranged for a
number of distinguished guest experts to contribute, in brief, their current
views on the booming stock markets.
Stanley G. Sachs
At last the stock market has ceased to focus on trailing price / earnings
ratios which are depressed by bottom-of-cycle provisioning, especially by
outdated dinosaur companies like IBM, and instead investors are beginning to
anticipate the coming earnings boom. This will arise from the benign
influences of low inflation, resumed economic growth and low interest rates.
Meanwhile our composite value indicators and our bond-equity yield ratio
measures show no strain. Many equity market analysts have made the error of
comparing current conditions with the 1970s or the 1980s. In fact there are
much better precedents from the 1960s, when inflation and interest rates
were low, growth was steady, and equity values were very high. We see the
Dow Jones Average at 5,000 and the London Footsie at 4,000 within 18 months.
Dr Mort Duhm
No less than 22 of my 23 regular indicators of value are now approaching
critical levels in most markets, to an even greater extent than in 1987. For
instance, the price / earnings ratio is in excess of 25 on Wall Street, and
only marginally lower in London. Dividend yields are historically
unattractive, and moreover dividend cover is exceptionally weak. Corporate
earnings prospects are not nearly good enough to justify the current
stratospheric valuations.
The boom in stock prices, and the sustainability of low dividend yields, has
depended critically upon the fall in global bond yields, which in turn has
relied heavily upon the willingness of the US Federal Reserve to pump vast
quantities of cheap credit into the US banking system. Within the next few
months I anticipate a meltdown in which the Fed will turn down the tap, hot
money will panic out of bonds and stock prices will become value-based and
not liquidity-driven. Hold on to your crash helmets.
Hector Dow-Elliott
European markets are still within their reverse triangle pattern and are
re-entering the longer-term trend channel from which they will break out
upwards so long as the neckline of the head-and-shoulders formation is not
penetrated by the 120-day moving average before the end of September, on the
basis of the FTA Europe ex UK Index.
When the DAX breaks 2,000 with strength the next upward leg will be
confirmed but hesitation at 1,950 would indicate a switch into the CAC
subject to the satisfactory completion of a consolidation pattern and the
abortion of the threatened upside-gap two crows on the Japanese candlestick
charts. However, if the Finnish HEX outlines a double top at 1,500 and thus
reaches its theoretical Fibonacci target all bets will be off.
Morgan Schroderburg
Too many investors have underestimated the secular fall in inflation and the
extent of the loosening of monetary policy, certainly in the US and Japan,
if not yet in Europe. I believe the uptrend in equity markets has some way
to go, but disappointing economic growth next year may lead to a setback.
For companies, I would point out that the next six months may represent a
rare window for raising new capital or floating off poorly-performing
subsidiaries (which we prefer to describe as 'non-core') at unusually
attractive prices. As for investors, my advice would be to to remain fully
invested but to avoid new flotations or companies that raise new capital.
Rhys Mogg-Williams
Consensus economists have been thrown completely off balance by the
sluggishness of the global economy and the (to them) mysterious collapse of
inflation. As far as the stock market is concerned, investors have been
unable to adapt to the fall in long-term interest rates which they
ignorantly assume must result in higher equity valuations.
However, the current conjunction of the downswings in the Kondratieff and
Juglar cycles is plainly creating industrial havoc in the Western world. In
the context of chronic excess capacity, many production industries are being
devastated by Third World competition and even the protection of domestic
brand names is becoming almost worthless, as we have seen with Philip Morris
and Procter &amp; Gamble.
Technological progress will begin to create splendid new opportunities later
in the 1990s as the next Kondratieff upswing develops, but meanwhile
investors will be sadly disappointed.
Murray Henderson
In our view the latest upward breaks in most markets should not distract
attention from the scope for sector rotation. Although the general switch
from blue chips into small company stocks recommended at the beginning of
the year may have matured, our special situations fund is still performing
very well. As for recovery stocks, in fact there is now an opportunity to
profit from the cheapness of pharmaceuticals shares through our Health and
General fund.
For those who are worried about poorer values in the leading markets -
concerns not shared, incidentally, by our top fund managers - we have a
number of attractive suggestions, including our Managed Futures Fund, our
Emerging Markets Trust, on which there is a 2 per cent discount for the rest
of this month, and our brand new China Millennium Fund.
George Palindrome
Normally I refrain from making stock market forecasts in public because I
might be accused of undermining the capitalist system through speculation.
Also, my 1987 prediction of a Tokyo market collapse proved embarrassing.
Now that there are no more soft exchange rate targets to aim at, however, I
consider I am justified in taking stock market positions again. I am
extremely bullish of the US, Japanese and European markets, and I shall
continue to hold this view in public until the day after I have sold out.

FT  28 AUG 93 / In the footprints of the Holocaust: Maurice Samuelson knew
his grandfather came from the Polish village of Bolimow - but little else
about it. When he visited it, he learned a lot more . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON SEEING the road sign, I got out of the car and posed with my wife for a
photograph. We had finally reached Bolimow, the village in Poland from which
my grandfather, Morris Jenkins, had come to England 100 years ago.
He established a tailoring business in Manchester and fathered 10 children
before dying, aged 46, in 1919. My mother, his second youngest child, was
then eight years old. Although she remembered him only faintly, she never
forgot the name of his birthplace. She once said she thought it was near
Warsaw. But that was all she knew. In any case, Bolimow was always mentioned
in the past tense, as though it was not of this world.
We never thought of seeking it on a map. Nor did we ever think about how
many generations of our family might have existed in that part of Poland,
wherever it might be.
Still less was it ever whispered that, until the second world war, we had
numerous close relatives in Bolimow. It was to be nearly 50 years before I
discovered that seven first cousins of my mother, all married with children
of my own generation, were among the victims of the Nazis. They were the
children of my great-aunt, Riva-Leah, and her husband, Mordechai Mann.
Riva-Leah had died in 1929. Her elderly husband perished in the Holocaust.
As far as I was concerned, these people might never have existed. While
stunned by the German atrocities, my family had always assumed that, as
English-born Jews, we were immune to its horrors. We recoiled from the first
photographs of concentration camp victims and were uneasy whenever we
encountered the jittery, wide-eyed survivors who appeared in England after
the war.
To reach Bolimow, we had driven about 60 kilometres south-west of Warsaw,
across the farmland of the Mazovian plain, once a dense centre of Jewish
population. At Sochaczew, once 75 per cent Jewish, we had photographed an
impressive new Jewish memorial in a bare field which had been the
community's cemetery. (The Roman Catholic cemetery lay next door, full of
well-tended memorials).
We had also visited the bigger Jewish cemetery in Lowicz, last resting place
of great aunt Riva-Leah and her mother. The cemetery's imposing brick wall
still screens it from the road and about a quarter of its headstones still
stand. But its other walls have vanished, together with the rest of its
stones.
Driving the last kilometre into Bolimow, I realised that our ignorance of
our origins was not as remarkable as it seemed. Our family was typical of
those founded by poor Polish immigrants to Manchester at the end of the last
century. Remembering my Jewish schoolfriends' families from the second world
war, I wondered how many of them also had close relatives who were forgotten
even before they were herded into the gas chambers . . .
A grassy square, little bigger than a soccer pitch, appeared suddenly on the
right. I drove round it and parked on the cobbles near a small bus shelter.
With the help of Peter, the young Polish interpreter whom we had engaged in
Warsaw, I wanted to question the locals about Bolimow and its Jewish ghosts.
I was not entirely ignorant about the place. Situated on the Rawka, a narrow
tributary of the river Bzura, Bolimow has a dubious footnote in history -
the first place where poison gas was tried out on the battlefield. The
Germans used it in the winter of 1915 against the Russian front line on the
other bank of the Rawka. (Because of the icy cold, the gas did not disperse;
it was soon used to deadlier effect on the western front). There had also
been a large forest in this region, which was the haunt of the now extinct
wild ox.
I had learned about my Bolimow connections from Freda Etzioni, an Israeli
cousin who was born in Bolimow and went to Palestine in 1934. She had
trained in Poland as a nurse. Her first Israeli home was a kibbutz near the
Sea of Galilee. When the second world war started, she moved to Jerusalem,
where she eventually became the head nurse at the Hadassah hospital.
From her and from Moshe Mann, another Bolimow cousin who settled in
Palestine in 1932, I learnt that when the Germans marched in, there were
about 50 Jewish families in the village - between 10 and 20 per cent of its
population. Freda had drawn me a rough map of the centre of Bolimow,
indicating the houses in the centre inhabited by our various relations. At
first sight it seemed accurate, although the village green was not oval but
rectangular (I later learnt that the lay-out was altered after the war).
In the middle stood the well and hand pump, just as she had drawn them. But
she had forgotten totally the white-towered church, only 200 metres away.
All around stood single and two-storey dwellings, painted pink, brown or
grey with tar-covered roofs.
There were no traces of mezzuzot, the slim prayer cases affixed to the
door-posts of most Jewish homes. But I knew that several of them had been my
relatives' homes until the Nazis arrived at their doors. The only modern
buildings were the two-storey, white-washed PKO bank and a shabby
bar-cum-restaurant.
Half a century after the war, I had scant hope of finding anyone who
remembered my relatives or who could identify their houses, so I was not
surprised by the blank expressions of the first elderly people we
approached. We had a more promising reaction, though, from the young girl in
the bar. 'Try Stefan Konopczynski, the potter,' she said. 'He knows all
about the history of Bolimow.'
I had already seen this name in the Polish guide-book I had brought from
London. It contained three paragraphs about Bolimow, mentioning the two
Romanesque churches and the Konopczynski pottery. The book was 30 years old
and neither the churches nor the pottery were on my sight-seeing list. But
the presence of such a significant old-timer was a good omen.
At midday we arrived at the Konopczynski home, a solid brick house where a
little girl was playing on the lawn. It was the potter's grand-daughter. Her
mother came to the door and asked us to come back at 2.30. Stefan, now
nearly 90, was having his daily rest. In the meantime, she told us how to
find the Jewish graveyard and the residence of the parish priest.
A soft August rain was falling but we decided to walk to the cemetery rather
than drive. Passing a stone mason's yard, full of unfinished tombstones, we
turned down a tree-lined path through a field and saw the walls of Bolimow's
Catholic cemetery.
Where was the Jewish cemetery? 'That's it,' Peter said, pointing to the
flat, open field beyond the Catholic graveyard. As the sun came out, I
approached the grassy field with sinking feelings.
Where were my own forebears' graves? I wondered. Where were their
headstones? Could they have been taken to the mason's yard and recycled for
other people's memorials?
The field was surrounded by a ditch and embankment. There was room in it for
at least 100 graves. Stumbling over the rough ground, we found only seven
fallen headstones, their weathered Hebrew letters peeping through the long
grass and wild flowers. While my wife gathered flowers and grass as
keepsakes, I photographed the scene.
Then we returned in silence and walked through the village to the priest's
house, opposite Bolimow's second church, by the river where cousin Freda had
played as a child. It was now full of pollution.
Father Ryszard Smoldar, a chubby, well-scrubbed man in his early 40s,
received us warmly. Over coffee and chocolate-coated cinnamon cakes served
by his housekeeper, he gave a strange explanation for the Jewish cemetery's
desolate condition. 'The stones are all still there. But they have fallen
down and are lying under the grass,' he said.
He added that, following the opening of diplomatic relations between
post-communist Poland and Israel, the village council was planning some kind
of memorial to the Jews. The idea had been proposed by the Voivod, the
larger administrative area in which Bolimow was situated. But as he had
served at Bolimow for little more than a year, he was not briefed fully on
the latest situation. Stefan Konopczynski was better informed, he said.
Bidding us goodbye, Smoldar told us that the solid cream-and-brown police
station we had passed in the centre of the village had been the synagogue
before the war.
Alert and refreshed, Stefan Konopczynski was waiting for us. He looked 20
years younger than his real age. With his black beret and trim white
moustache, he seemed more like a Breton farmer than a Polish potter.
We followed him to his pottery, a long shed in its own grounds where his
son, Jan, a man in his early 40s, was working the wet clay. In a separate
room stood shelves of white earthenware jugs decorated with simple but
attractive patterns of doves and flowers.
The pottery was well known in the district and Stefan showed isitors' book.
But I was less excited by the pottery than what father and son were able to
tell me about Bolimow.
They were a remarkable repository of village history. While Stefan had
devoted his life to collecting documents about it, Jan had written a
doctoral thesis about its sociological development.
As his potter's wheel whirred, Jan confirmed that the police station had
been the synagogue before the war. But he discounted Smoldar's claim about
the sunken Jewish gravestones. 'They were removed or stolen during or
immediately after the war,' he said.
He had sent the inscriptions on the seven surviving stones to be translated
by the Jewish historical institute in Warsaw. It was his father, he said,
who had persuaded the villagers not to grow crops on the Jewish cemetery or
to graze their animals on it.
Back in their living room, father and son showed us documents illustrating
the presence of Jews in Bolimow for more than 300 years. These were annual
returns of the local forest collective, the shareholders of which,
regardless of religion, enjoyed the rights to timber from the local
woodlands. Their contributions were used to pay for the village's amenities.
Alongside their names and details of their annual payments, the shareholders
had made their marks. The Christians signed with three crosses; the Jews had
drawn three small circles. On the returns for 1820 and 1939 I found the name
Mann, the surname of my mother's cousins and the largest Jewish family in
Bolimow.
'I remember all the Jewish families,' said Stefan, mentioning five people
who had been his friends. He fished out a 1907 group photograph of about 30
members of the village's volunteer fire brigade. On the reverse he had
written all their names, Christians and Jews.
He described two wartime events. Early in the war, he had been arrested by
the Gestapo and taken to Lowicz, where the town's Jewish leaders were being
tortured to extort money from the rest of the Jewish community. Once the
ransom was paid, they were murdered, along with the others.
In Bolimow, two families - 11 people - had hidden in a bunker that they had
built and furnished near the river Rawka. They survived until 1944, when
they were betrayed to the Nazis. Before being executed, they persuaded the
Germans to spare a non-Jewish Polish soldier who had shared their hiding
place. Their Christian neighbours took their bodies to the Jewish cemetery
and buried them. Stefan said that the only local Jews to survive the war
were four boys who had gone to Palestine when it ended.
I drove back to Warsaw grateful to Stefan and Jan for their acts of
remembrance. Three weeks later, we took our photographs and notes of the
visit to Freda and Moshe in Israel. From the photographs, Moshe identified
his own house and that of my great-aunt. They appeared unchanged, he said.
After the war, Moshe had corresponded with his former school teacher in
Bolimow and knew about the two families who had hidden by the river. One of
them, the Shtiefermanns, were his own first cousins. He had also known the
four boys who had lived through it all and reached Palestine after the war;
their families still live in Tel Aviv. As for Stefan Konopczynski, Moshe's
mother used to buy her crockery from him.
Back in London, I turned to Martin Gilbert's Atlas of the Holocaust to
discover the likely fate of the rest of the family - my mother's seven
cousins, their elderly father, wives, husbands A ghetto was created in
Bolimow on June 11 1940. In February or March 1941, its inhabitants were
among 72,000 Jews from the district dispatched by road to Sochaczew, from
where they were sent by rail to Warsaw. In the ghetto there, they either
shared the fate of the 150,000 who died or fought, or were among the 350,000
sent from Warsaw to the Treblinka death camp.
Had my mother still been alive, I wonder if I would have had the heart to
tell her this story. But perhaps she had known some of it all along - and
never had the heart to share it with me. At least my own children will know.

FT  28 AUG 93 / German inflation to drop markedly, says Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION in Germany is set to fall 'markedly', the Bundesbank's chief
economist said yesterday, in a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the outlook
for German prices. However, he dismissed arguments for an early cut in
interest rates.
At the same time Mr Otmar Issing, member of the policymaking directorate at
the German central bank, cautioned that inflation would fall slowly and be
influenced by factors beyond the Bundesbank's control, such as tax
increases.
Mr Issing also argued for maintaining the wider fluctuation bands of the
European exchange rate mechanism, noting that although currencies were
stable at present scope for change may be needed in future.
He said on German television prices were moving in the 'right direction',
adding that the fall in the annual inflation rate from 4.3 per cent in July
to 4.2 per cent in August concealed a much sharper month-on-month decline in
the rate of price increases.
Mr Issing also said monetary policy was taking its cue from the German
recession - a comment in sharp contrast to the Bundesbank's usual insistence
that combating inflation has to take priority over 'counter-cyclical'
attempts to stimulate the ailing economy via cuts in the cost of money.
His remarks came the day after the Bundesbank council decided - contrary to
market expectations - to leave interest rates unchanged. Mr Issing said the
question remained open as to when the central bank could cut rates further.
On the markets, however, the effects of the tight monetary policy were felt
by most European currencies yesterday as they drifted down against the
D-Mark.
The French franc fell below the FFr3.51 level against the D-Mark, but later
strengthened to close at FFr3.499. The Danish krone and Belgian franc came
under pressure and ended at their lowest for the day.
Mr Issing sought yesterday to play down the importance of growth in money
supply in July. M3 grew at annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 7.5 per
cent, the third month in a row in which the 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range
was missed. The main cause was growth in bank lending which he dismissed as
an 'inexplicable spike'.
In a separate interview with the AP Dow Jones news agency, Mr Issing said
the increase in money supply had made it impossible to cut rates on
Thursday, leaving the discount and Lombard rates at 6.75 and 7.75 per cent
respectively.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Investigators defend raid on Volkswagen offices: State
prosecutors shrug off charges of leak to media

INVESTIGATORS who raided Volkswagen, the German carmaker, on Thursday in
search of allegedly stolen data, yesterday appeared confident they had found
material of help to them.
'The object of the search was at no time endangered,' even though the
suspects might have known details of the swoop, said Mr Georg Nauth,
spokesman for the Darmstadt state prosecutors' office.
Investigators, backed up by 40 police, went in looking for papers and
computer-stored data in connection with their investigations into
allegations that material was stolen from VW's rival, Adam Opel, the German
subsidiary of General Motors, by former employees of the US group who
defected to VW in March.
According to Mr Nauth, the search was completed yesterday morning after
officials had confiscated large volumes of documents and computer diskettes,
along with around 30 stand-alone personal and laptop computers: 'In the
light of their complexity, evaluation of these materials will demand a lot
of time,' he said.
Mr Nauth seemed unruffled by charges that information on the raid had been
leaked. Three TV camera crews were waiting outside the VW main plant in
Wolfsburg when the police arrived on Thursday morning.
The usual VW press relations team, meanwhile, had been reinforced by
employees from other divisions and subsidiaries. One spokesman said
yesterday tips about the raid could be seen in the media; another was
'astonished' to see the camera crews at the factory gates.
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group production director at the
centre of the criminal investigation, carried on working unperturbed when
investigators barged into his office. His house and those of three of his
associates were being searched at the same time.
'The Darmstadt public prosecutors' office seems to have as many holes as a
Swiss Cheese,' said Mr Uwe-Karsten Heye, spokesman for the government of
Lower Saxony, VW's home state.
However, the Lower Saxony government itself had been informed in advance of
the action, led by officials from Hesse, who requested assistance from local
police forces.
In a bizarre twist, two men from the Frankfurt red-light district also
appeared to have known about the impending raid. They were arrested on
Tuesday night after telephoning VW with an offer to sell the company
information for DM500,000. The company informed the police of 'attempted
extortion' without discovering details of the information, a spokesman said.
According to press reports, the two men had learnt about the raid from
police officers they met at a Hesse shooting club.
Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM Europe and a member of the Opel
supervisory board, said the affair was a matter of 'questionnable behaviour'
by individuals. 'In general our respect from VW and its employees is
unchanged.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the rumours surrounding Lasmo in recent weeks, a bid from British
Gas looks unlikely. The theory is that since the MMC wants to clip British
Gas's wings in the UK, it may spend more on its exploration and production
arm. Yet while the company seems keen to expand, the risks and returns look
better in its Global Gas business. Management contracts to run gas networks
and the construction of power stations in collaboration with others is
closer to British Gas's core expertise. Besides, the company's exploration
and production interests are primarily in gas: bidding for an oil company
like Lasmo would be distinctly out of character.
Speculation that Mr John Walmsley might be tempted to join Lasmo after his
resignation as finance director of Enterprise Oil looks equally misplaced.
The current chief executive, Mr Joe Darby, was only appointed in March.
There can hardly be room for Mr Walmsley to become an executive chairman
above him. It is even more improbable that Mr Walmsley would be happy to
have left Enterprise to become second in command at Lasmo.
More persuasive is the idea that US investors, valuing Lasmo on the basis of
cash flow, regard the stock as cheap compared to its US counterparts. That
ignores the fact that the cash is more than needed to finance the
replacement of reserves. Lasmo is unlikely to have any substantial free cash
flow until 1996. Since the dividend may yet be cut further, UK fund managers
may be content to allow their US competitors to acquire the stock.

FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Guardian Royal Exchange is the last of the UK composite insurers to take a
tentative step towards direct selling. But it has taken the startling
success of Direct Line, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, to stir the
industry giants into action. Royal Insurance was first into the fray, but
was careful to disguise the parentage of The Insurance Service for fear of
backlash among insurance brokers. It is a sign of the now resigned attitude
among brokers that Royal Northern, its second direct insurance venture,
carries the parent company name.
GRE should thus feel bold enough to use its own identity. While that might
be useful, big insurers do not have much of a reputation for consumer
marketing. Besides, it will take more than clever branding to catch Direct
Line. Its competitive edge turns on an expense ratio well below that of the
established competition and faster, more detailed analysis of risk. That
will be matched only if the composites allow their direct subsidiaries
freedom over pricing. Direct selling will never be more than an additional
channel of distribution if prices are based on parent company expenses and
claims experience. The reluctance of established insurers has also allowed
Direct Line to build critical mass. That in itself is an advantage. Keeping
telephonists and computer systems busy writing new business, rather than
making uncompetitive quotes, contributes low expenses. Smaller rivals are
some way from achieving such economies of scale.

FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: TSB/EuroDollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Forte's sale of Gardner Merchant last December was a sign that the
management buy-out was not dead, TSB's disposal of its EuroDollar car rental
business shows that buy-outs continue to enjoy a quiet recovery. That is not
surprising for this stage of the cycle. Managers who purchase a business now
are buying into the recovery. Low interest rates make it easier to satisfy
the rigorous cash-flow requirements imposed by banks. Lenders themselves are
selective, but more are finding the high margins on buy-outs attractive
given the squeeze on their net interest income.
The EuroDollar deal had some special attractions. Since car rental is way
outside TSB's banking and insurance focus, the bank was not particularly
minded to quibble about the price. Assuming the new owners can sort out the
foreign subsidiaries, they will be left with a lucrative business bought at
only a small premium over its value in TSB's books. With leasing finance
available for the rental fleet, the buy-out syndicate did not need to borrow
on its own account.
Yet more conventional deals also now enjoy a good chance. The main
constraint is size, since lenders are reluctant to see gearing rise much
above 50 per cent. Large, highly-geared deals like Isosceles and Magnet thus
remain out of the question. Banks will need time - and probably a hefty dose
of inflation as well - to forget the pain they caused.

FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Reach for the sky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is is a measure of how much the world has changed that the Bundesbank's
decision not to cut interest rates this week barely disturbed the upward
march of equities. With the ERM in tatters it is taken for granted that
other European countries will cut rates even if Germany does not. To the
extent that the Bundesbank's stoicism soothes nerves about inflation at home
and keeps German bond yields low, gilts also stand to benefit. While that
sounds like the logic of a market able only to look on the bright side, it
is no coincidence that yesterday's rise of the FT-SE 100 index through 3,100
was underpinned by another strong gain in gilts.
A closer look at equities reveals an increasingly desperate search for
value. Sectors that led the market higher during August are those that have
hitherto been shunned: food manufacturers, food retailers, and
pharmaceutical companies. Investors' thirst for yield against a background
of low inflation and low interest rates is the driving force. Having
underperformed the market by almost 20 per cent since sterling left the ERM
last September, for example, the food retailing sector now yields close to
the market average.
Should that buying continue the index may have further to run. Regaining the
market value lost by Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham alone would add
another 100 points to the Footsie. While there are good reasons for
remaining cautious about drugs stocks in particular, the combination of a
low price/earnings ratio and a decent yield is proving a powerful
attraction. With no sign of resurgent inflation - and growing confidence
that the hoped-for recovery in corporate earnings will indeed appear - it is
likely to remain so.

FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reverses in line with
bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FALLING BOND prices left leading US stocks lower yesterday, although a late
rally kept losses to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.55 at 3,640.63,
well off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500
ended 0.50 lower at 460.54. Smaller company stocks and secondary indices
fared better. The Amex composite finished up 0.79 at 454.99, and the Nasdaq
composite up 2.68 at 734.07. Trading volume on the NYSE was 196m shares.
Equity prices have been following bond prices higher all summer, so the
morning's declines in bonds had an immediate effect upon stocks when the
markets opened. Amid considerable profit-taking, the benchmark 30-year
government bond fell more than a point, pushing the yield back up towards
6.2 per cent.
That decline sparked heavy selling of stocks, sending the Dow more than 20
points lower. Later, bond prices recovered somewhat and in late trading the
30-year bond was down at 101 17/32 , yielding 6.133 per cent. Equities
initially failed to match the bond market's recovery, but staged a rally in
the final hour-and-a-half of trading to end in more respectable territory.
Analysts were not perturbed by yesterday's sell-off, noting that volume was
relatively light throughout the day session. Optimists believed that the
correction in prices could have set the stage for the Dow to assault 3,700.
National Medical Enterprises lost Dollars 3 1/8 , or almost 30 per cent, to
Dollars 8 in volume of 7m shares on news that more than 20 of the company's
facilities were raided by FBI agents as part of a broad inquiry into alleged
criminal misconduct by National Medical, which operates private hospitals.
American Telephone&amp;Telegraph bucked the trend, climbing Dollars 2 to Dollars
62 3/4 in volume of 2.8m shares on hopes that talks between the
telecommunications group and cable companies about creation of a multi-media
communications network would bear fruit.
Drug stocks were mixed. Merck rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 7/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 55 7/8 , but Pfizer gave
up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 and Schering-Plough fell Dollars 1 to Dollars
59 7/8 . Nichols Institute, traded on the American Stock Exchange, fell
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 5 3/8 , and Unilab, traded on the Nasdaq market,
fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6, after being told to expect federal
investigators to subpoena company documents as part of an investigation into
possible Medicare fraud by medical testing laboratories.
Canada
TORONTO ended the week on a positive note, posting a solid gain in moderate
trading. Based on preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index was up
17.80 points to 4,133.40, for a gain on the week of about 56 points.
Advances led declines by 421 to 304 and volume fell to about 55m shares from
Thursday's 57.6m. The best gains were posted by golds and industrials.

FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris, Madrid, Lisbon set new
record highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Spain in particular thought positively yesterday but investment
decisions elsewhere were not made easier by opposing views on Europe and the
US from two big UK merchant banks, writes Our Markets Staff.
Baring Securities overweighted continental Europe (especially Germany) and
underweighted the US within a flow of funds approach to global strategy
published yesterday; on Thursday, Kleinwort Benson moved in the opposite
direction.
PARIS shot forward to set a new record high of 2,198 in the CAC-40 index
during the session before late profit-taking dragged it back to close up
10.27 at 2,183.88, a week's rise of 2.6 per cent. Turnover was estimated at
FFr4.2bn.
Kleinwort Benson, in its latest French equity review, forecast that the
CAC-40 could reach 2,300-2,350 by the end of the year as lower interest
rates begin to take hold. The brokers added that they did not expect a fall
in the index because of poor corporate profits: 'The worse the figures are,
the faster and further interest rates will have to be brought down.'
BSN was one of the few issues to go against the trend, falling FFr16 to
FFr912. The stock was affected by news that Heineken of the Netherlands was
recalling bottles, made by BSN's Dutch subsidiary, because of an alleged
bottling fault. Bouygues put on FFr18 to FFr727 after announcing that one of
its divisions had won a FFr1.3bn contract to build the terminal for the Hong
Kong metro linking the new airport to Kowloon.
FRANKFURT began by incorporating, and adding to, its post-bourse fall on
Thursday after the Bundesbank's decision not to cut its key interest rates.
But the DAX index recovered from a low of 1,887.83 to close 3.45 up on the
day, and 0.9 per cent down on the week at 1,904.60.
Dealers gave the credit to short-covering before the weekend and renewed
optimism on interest rates. However, turnover eased from DM6.8bn to DM6.7bn.
Enthusiasm was curbed by the approach of the UK bank holiday on Monday, and
the renewed weakness in the dollar which hit big German exporters on
Thursday.
Retailers were weak. Revised sales figures, and a forecast of higher 1993
profits from Kaufhof did not stop the shares falling DM6.50 to DM530.
Karstadt, Germany's largest department store chain, fell DM13.50 to DM576 on
a 2 per cent rise in first half sales, profits below expectations and no
hope of a second half improvement.
AMSTERDAM recovered some of Thursday's losses and the CBS Tendency index
ended 0.6 higher at 128.1, barely changed over the week.
News that Heineken was to recall and destroy 17m bottles of its export brand
after glass splinters were discovered in some batches initially took the
shares down to a day's low of Fl 180.20; but they later recovered to end up
80 cents at Fl 186.00. Analysts remarked that the news was unlikely to have
a long-term effect on the brewer's earnings.
Among other major stocks, ABN Amro added 60 cents to Fl 67.20 on news of
better-than-expected interim figures and plans for a rights issue, while
DSM, which had fallen sharply on Thursday over worries in the European
chemicals sector, regained Fl 1.70 to Fl 96.30.
MADRID broke the 300 barrier, the general index closing 3.45 higher at
302.97, up 3.8 per cent on the week with the support of interest rate hopes
and the rise in the Spanish bond market.
Turnover shot up from Pta27bn to about Pta36.8bn. Most banks and some
construction shares were strong, but one of the biggest individual rises was
in Ercros, the chemcial group controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office,
which reported a cut in net losses and rose Pta20 to Pta154.
MILAN was firmer in fairly active trading helped by the government's
decision after the close on Thursday to give the go ahead for a number of
public construction projects, including a high-speed train link. The Comit
index put on 3.70 to 627.91, a week's rise of 2.2 per cent.
In the construction sector Italcementi added L382 to L12,330 and
Italmobiliare, the holding company, L1,168 to L44,450. Unicem, the cement
manufacturer, rose L140 to L10,100.
STOCKHOLM rebounded sharply after several days of declines, the
Affarsvarlden general index adding 19.2 to 1,270.2, down 3 per cent on the
week.
Turnover rose to SKr1.64bn. The bank and insurance sector index climbed 3.4
per cent with Handelsbanken up SKr11 to SKr129, and S-E Banken up SKr2 to
SKr76. SCA B fell SKr2 to SKr129 after announcing a SKr1.4bn rights issue
while Volvo B rose SKr16 to SKr470 after Thursday's good interim figures.
LISBON reported another spurt of foreign buying as the BTA index rose 43.0
to a new 1993 high of 2,565.0, 2.8 per cent higher on the week.
ISTANBUL added 2.1 per cent to settle at a new record high, the composite
index adding 244.1 to 12,020.6 for a week's gain of 8 per cent. Turnover was
about TL1,200bn.

FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Good results, political action lift
China shares - Zhang Tingting on the Shanghai/Shenzhen rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China B shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have staged a strong comeback
recently after months of decline. Since early August, and after a good day
for share prices yesterday, the Credit Lyonnais Securities Shanghai B-share
index has risen by 20.4 per cent to 754.56 and its Shenzhen B counterpart by
16.3 per cent to 947.86.
In Shanghai, the birthplace of both China's communists (1921) and its first
capitalist stock exchange (1990), trading in B shares, which foreigners can
buy, hit a record high of Dollars 2.24m in average daily turnover in the
second week of August after the inception of H shares in Hong Kong in July:
the H shares, listed in the colony, were in four state-run enterprises from
mainland China.
Mr Andrew Leung, a China analyst at Smith New Court in Hong Kong, attributes
the Shanghai rallies to the encouraging interim results from several
companies and the rumours that three of the 12 B share companies - Shanghai
Tyre and Rubber, Chlor-Alkali and No 2 Textile Machinery - are applying for
American Depository Receipts.
The profits news apparently triggered bargain hunting, overseas investors
believing that B shares had bottomed out after dropping near to a single
digit price/earnings ratio.
In addition, there was action to stabilise the Chinese currency by Mr Zhu
Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of economic reform, who took over in
July as governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.
His support for the yuan against the US dollar also helped boost B shares,
which are quoted and traded in dollar terms.
Citibank of the US, one of the pioneers in China's equity markets, missed
out on the recent share price recovery. But Mr William Calvert, one of its
Far East investment managers in London, is not too unhappy.
The US investment bank bought Dollars 500,000 of China's first batch of B
shares in February, 1992, when the country opened its new equity markets to
foreigners. It sold out with 'fantastic profits' last year though Shanghai
dropped by about 50 per cent at one point on expectations of a government
clampdown on the overheated economy.
B shares have their drawbacks. Mr Calvert says that even Shanghai, generally
perceived as hosting higher quality companies than Shenzhen, comes 'very low
down the list' in Citibank's current exploration of emerging markets.
The limited number of B shares available - 12 in Shanghai and 17 in Shenzhen
so far - make liquidity a problem. And this is exacerbated by the fact that
most of the shares, floated by placings, are in the hands of managers of
about 30 China funds which have mushroomed during the China craze of the
past year. Consequently, a small buying or selling interest is able to move
a price sharply.
Investors in China's B share markets are not afforded the same legal
protection as they would get in Hong Kong where the newly listed H shares,
says Mr Leung, are 'exposed to basically the same political and economic
risks as the B shares inside China'.
All B share companies, too, still feature dual accounting systems -
international accounting standards (IAS) are compulsory for final results
and optional for interim results. Last year, results were published in the
Chinese accounting style and in the Chinese language a week before the
English version, compiled according to international standards, presenting
severe problems for foreign analysts.
Transparency is low: relevant information has traditionally been regarded as
secret, and liable to weaken the company's position if obtained by its
competitors.
The fact that the government has a controlling stake in all listed companies
gives rise to concern among overseas investors over politically-appointed
management and questions about its competence, directly affecting equity
market performance.
In spite of these problems, China continues to attract long-term investors
as a potential economic superpower and centre of growth in the coming
decades.
'They're fully aware of the risks and are prepared to take them,' says Mr
Guy Stevinson, a broker with Standard Chartered Securities.
Most observers believe the current central government's attention to
Shanghai's development and reform will allow the city to realise the dream
of restoring its past glory as a major financial centre in East Asia, while
Shenzhen will develop toward a merger with Hong Kong after 1997, when
Britain returns the territory to China.
According to Mr Li Chuwen, an adviser to the Shanghai municipal government,
its turnover in all shares (A shares for domestic investors and B shares for
overseas) reached Rmb76bn (Dollars 13bn) last year and is expected to hit
Rmb300bn by the end of this year.
Shanghai plans to be number two Far East stock exchange to Japan in terms of
annual turnover by 1995, he said.

FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rate cut hopes support
Nikkei average

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate bolstered
futures trading, and share prices gained ground on arbitrage related buying,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average saw its fourth consecutive advance, rising 199.92 to
20,791.68, for a week's gain of 0.9 per cent. The index fell to the day's
low of 20,579.56 soon after the opening, but gained ground during the day,
hitting a high of 20,863.39 in the final 30 minutes.
Volume was 330m shares, topping 300m shares for the first time since August
17. Brokers actively traded on their own accounts, on the first day for
September delivery. Advances outnumbered declines by 827 to 169, with 160
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 16.18
to 1,670.54 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.60 to 1274.72.
A fall in short-term interest rates encouraged investors. The three month
certificates of deposit fell 0.03 percentage points to a record low of 2.85
per cent, while the unsecured overnight call rate, which is closely
controlled by the Bank of Japan, also eased.
Lower interest rates supported banks and Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y40
to Y3,440 and Bank of Tokyo gained Y40 to Y1,730.
Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, rose Y37 to Y834, a new high of the
year, on the telecommunications infrastructure theme. Traders also said that
some investors were interested in the company's development of a device
which calculates the total cost of grocery shopping without taking the goods
out of the shopping basket.
Enthusiasm toward telecom related stocks supported Oki Electric Industry,
which gained Y13 to Y543 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which advanced
Y4,000 to Y947,000.
Showa Sangyo, a food processing company, rose Y3 to Y614 on hopes that
deregulation in the food industry would allow the company to procure raw
materials at lower prices.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 236.69 to 22,746.25 in volume of 33.7m
shares.
Roundup
AFTER a week of record performances among the region's markets, many
investors chose to take profits ahead of the weekend.
HONG KONG saw late demand for blue chips help lift the index from early
lows, but profit-taking was in evidence after Thursday's strong performance.
The Hang Seng index closed off 26.10 at 7,422.98, having fallen by 78 points
at one stage. The index fell by 1.6 per cent over the week. Turnover was
HKDollars 3.35bn.
HSBC Holdings, the day's most active issue, fell 50 cents to HKDollars 83
while Swire Pacific, which announced disappointing interim results on
Thursday, lost HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 36.75. Cathay Pacific, in which
it holds a 51 per cent stake, rose 10 cents to HKDollars 10.30.
SINGAPORE also lost ground as investors took profits after Thursday's record
run, the Straits Times Industrial index falling 2.27 to 2,007.92, a 1.7 per
cent rise on the week.
Volume rose to 355.6m shares against 277.3m on Thursday.
SEOUL continued its downward trend with a fall of 9.87 in the composite
index to 685.87, its fifth straight loss and a week's decline of about 6 per
cent. Turnover rose from Won 212.2bn to Won229.2bn.
TAIWAN lost 1.6 per cent on weakness in the financial sector, the weighted
index falling 64.71 to 3,919.96 for a 3.1 per cent decline on the week.
Turnover was TDollars 11.4bn.
AUSTRALIA recovered early losses as both News Corp and BHP rose to new
record highs. The All Ordinaries index closed up 7.1 at 1,948.6, a week's
gain of 1.1 per cent, in turnover of ADollars 807.4m.
JAKARTA set another new high, the JKSE climbing by 4.11 to 409.67.

FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISK trading in stock index futures provided the opportunity for
substantial arbitraging in equities yesterday, writes Terry Byland. However,
traders said that once again, severe shortage of stock in the underlying
blue chip stocks had hampered dealing.
The September contract on the FT-SE Index traded 8,585 contracts, below
Thursday's total, but still a healthy figure. Gains in the contract led the
stock market ahead, taking it through the Footsie 3,100 mark as September
moved to its day's peak of 3,123, at which stage it showed a premium of 20
points against cash.
However, futures settled lower and at the close, September, at 3,108, was
almost in line with the fair value premium of about 7, which allows for
carrying costs and dividend flows. Wall Street's opening weakness took the
shine off London futures.
In traded options, activity focused on the Footsie option, where volume rose
to 9,049 contracts from 7,098 the previous day, with the Euro Footsie
recording 2,490.

FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mixture of US buying and a run to catch the bull market proved a powerful
cocktail which pushed oil stocks ahead amid substantial turnover.
Action was greatest in the secondliners with Lasmo reaching a hefty volume
of 9.5m. After a recent run of large daily trading volume and steady price
gains and recurrent bid rumours, one analyst said that a professional and
concerted bull raid appeared to be taking place in the stock. 'Bid rumours
and options talk have been feeding the frenzy,' he said.
Lasmo climbed 7 1/2 to 153 1/2 p and marketmakers looked towards the US for
buyers. American investors have increasingly viewed the UK oil sector as
undervalued compared with their own domestic stocks.
Enterprise Oil also benefited from transatlantic interest boosted by a very
positive stance from SG Warburg. The broker sees Enterprise as one of the
soundest based stocks in a sector expected to bounce after underperforming
the buoyant market. Enterprise, a tightly held stock, moved up 29 to 480p in
turnover of 2.5m. Cairn Energy had a successful day with Strauss Turnbull
going positive and it added 5 to close at 60p.
Burmah Castrol went up 13 to 785p ahead of interims next Thursday.
The larger oil stocks were slower off the mark, with BP losing a penny to
320p and Shell pushing up 4 to 678p.
News that Zeneca had received a UK licence for its heart drug Zestril
attracted investors and the shares firmed 5 to 714p.
US buyers early in the session, together with a lack of stock later in the
day, saw Glaxo jump 16 to 588p, as 4.8m shares were dealt.
Shares in chemicals company Brent International fell 7 to 116p, as the
market reacted to an 86 per cent slump in interim profits, a warning from
the chairman about full year profits and the departure of the company's
chief executive.
The success of Reuters' Pounds 350m share buy-back offer boosted trading in
the stock yesterday. The shares jumped 32 to 1552p.
This week's good results from Guardian Royal Exchange reverberated through
the market, pushing the stock up 9 to 222p.
Among transports, a positive review on the sector from SG Warburg benefitted
NFC, and the shares moved 8 ahead to 277p. Speculation of a cut in French
interest rates boosted several stocks with French interest. That list
included channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, whose shares gained 11 to 477p.
General investment support was seen for UK airport operator BAA and the
shares moved 19 ahead to 818p.
Securities house UBS was said to be positive on Inchcape ahead of interim
figures next month. The shares firmed 8 to 568p.
Bass lost 9 to 502p as James Capel turned negative. Allied Lyons, which in
the previous session made solid gains, continued upwards with a rise of 5 to
633p.
Hopes that consumers would play a leading role in the recovery helped
maintain a firm stores sector. Kingfisher pulled back ground lost in the
previous session and moved ahead 13 to 678p while Marks and Spencer
consolidated an already strong position with a rise of 4 1/2 to 377 1/2 p.
Dixons gained 4 to 237p as did Dunhill Holdings which reached 401p.
Good holiday bookings pushed Airtours upwards, adding 20 to the stock which
reached 399p. Investor confidence was enlivened by Airtours out-performance
of the sector in package bookings.
The recent honeymoon with the market enjoyed by Barclays after the
appointment of Mr Martin Taylor as chief-exectutive designate began to
crumble with Smith New Court advising a switch from the stock into Lloyds.
But Mr Martin Green of the broker said that the position was born out of a
warming to Lloyds as opposed to a cooling with Barclays.
In an almost straight reversal of fortunes Barclays gave up 6 to 508p in
moderate turnover of 3.5m while Lloyds added 9 to close at 559p with 1.6m
shares changing hands.
TSB, which announced the sale of its car rental business EuroDollar, gained
3 to 203p.
Further appreciation of this week's sale by international mining group RTZ
of most of its Pillar business for around Pounds 800m brought a further
advance in the shares. They gained another 10 to 734p. MB-Caradon, the
purchaser of the businesses, appreciated 4 to 340p.

FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome against the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS GROUP Wellcome moved against the market trend after reports that a
broker had turned cautious on the stock.
The shares, which moved sharply ahead throughout last week and the early
part of this week after US investors turned buyers of the drug sector, fell
10 to 733p in early trading yesterday on suggestions that leading agency
broker James Capel had adopted a more cautious stance. The broker was also
believed to have trimmed its forecast for the current year by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 650m.
Bargain hunting and strength elsewhere in the stock market helped Wellcome
reduce earlier losses and the shares finished a penny lighter at 742p, in
trading of 1.5m.
Several analysts appeared likely to remain cautious on the stock in the near
future. They cited stiffer competition for the group from rival
SmithKline-Beecham, whose new Herpes drug Famcyclovir, to be launched early
next year, is likely to be a strong competitor for Wellcome's Zoviarx, which
currently provides the group with around 36 per cent of sales and about 50
per cent of profits. SmithKline Beecham 'A' closed 12 up at 461p.

FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds help FT-SE to closing peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG bond market and buoyant stock index futures trading provided the
platform for a renewed advance in the UK stock market yesterday, driving the
FT-SE Index through the 3,100 barrier to a new closing peak of 3,100.6. With
sterling very firm and confidence in economic recovery in the UK
strengthened by a bullish survey of business opinion by the Confederation of
British Industries, the London market brushed off a less encouraging
performance from New York.
Investors' belief that inflation will remain low and that European interest
rates are on the way down, despite the Bundesbank's refusal to cut key rates
this week, brought powerful gains in UK government bonds.
At the long end, bond prices gained around 1 7/32 , bringing yields down to
around 7.2 per cent. Short-dated stocks held steady but a gain of  3/4 in
Index-linked gilts implied inflation concerns have not disappeared.
The bond sector appeared little affected by the bank of England's decision
to issue a further Pounds 800m of existing bonds for dealing next week.
Equities opened higher and were quickly spurred further ahead by gains in
the September contract on the Index which encouraged arbitraging between
futures and underlying equities. Excitement, and share gains, were fuelled
by a shortage of stock now imposing severe problems on marketmakers and
would-be arbitrageurs alike.
A new intra day trading peak of 3,103.0, plus 23.8 on overnight, was
established just ahead of the Wall Street's opening. When the Dow Industrial
Average came in with a fall of 16 points in UK hours, London softened very
slightly to end the session a net 21.4 up.
This week, the second leg of an equity account extended to cover Monday's
Bank Holiday in the UK, has seen the Footsie rise by 43 points of 1.4 per
cent. But the US buyers, who have been driving UK equities ahead this week,
played a quieter role yesterday.
Also at a new peak was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 18.6 higher at 3,513.3.
Trading in non-Footsie stocks, the favourites of UK private investors, made
up around 60 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 529.2m shares; Thursday's
670.9m Seaq-traded shares represented Pounds 1.42bn in retail business, a
very profitable level for the UK securities industry albeit below
Wednesday's record Pounds 2.3bn.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Money Markets: German concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday added liquidity to the German money market via a
repo rate at 6.90 per cent in an attempt to stop a growing scramble for
short-dated funds, writes James Blitz.
The central bank's move did not imply any tightening of monetary policy.
Emergency funds have been provided at more-or-less the same rate in recent
weeks when the market has found itself illiquid.
Instead, by announcing a repo to Wednesday, the Bundesbank was helping to
calm the market over the next two trading days. There were strong
expectations that a fixed rate repo would be set at 6.80 per cent again on
Wednesday.
The provision of DM17.9bn of liquidity was required because dealers had
decided not to purchase funds on Thursday in the belief that there would be
a cut in the discount rate.
When the cut failed to materialise, there was a sudden scramble for funds in
the interbank market - especially with end of month pressures.
If the repo funds had not been provided, call money would have soared above
yesterday's already high level of 7 per cent.
The Bundesbank is becoming increasingly concerned by the discrepancy between
expectations of interest rate cuts and its own intentions. The events of the
last few days may encourage the central bank to be even more cautious about
signalling cuts in official interest rates over the next few weeks.
Mr Manfred Korber, the Bundesbank's chief spokesman, warned yesterday: 'The
Bundesbank views with concern the fact that expectations, which are
heightened by apparently scientifically backed predictions, contribute to
large market fluctuations and to volatility.'
But the discrepancy continues. There have been strong advances in some
European equity markets in the belief that German rates are coming down. And
expectations remain of a cut at the next Bundesbank meeting.
Sterling futures reflected little disappointment with German policy last
week. The December contract rose 5 basis points yesterday to close at 94.59.
Three month sterling was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. There was a shortage
of Pounds 850m in the discount market and late assistance of Pounds 460m.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: A watershed in the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR and European currencies drifted down against the D-Mark yesterday
in what appeared to be a delayed reaction to the Bundesbank's decision not
to cut interest rates on Thursday, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank yesterday surprised dealers by announcing a repo rate at 6.90
per cent to next Wednesday, higher than the established repo rate of 6.80
per cent. The move did not imply a tightening of monetary policy, but
nevertheless gave a temporary setback to most European currencies.
The French franc fell below the FFr3.51 level against the D-Mark but later
closed at FFr3.499 from a previous FFr3.502. The Danish krone fell as low as
DKr4.1350 at the start of European trading and later closed at DKr4.1225.
The Belgian franc came under more intense pressure at one stage, but closed
a little stronger on the day at BFr21.30 from its previous BFr21.37. The
dollar was also undermined by the German move, closing at DM1.6665 from a
previous DM1.6680 on a day which brought no important US data. Sterling
closed at DM2.5000, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day.
For the last few weeks, market volumes have been thin. But on Tuesday many
dealers return to work after their holidays. It is striking that they do so
just as a watershed has appeared in in the three major trading areas in the
market: the ERM, the dollar/D-Mark currency pair and the dollar/yen exchange
rate.
There is little doubt that the Bundesbank's failure to cut rates will put
intense pressure on France, Belgium and Denmark to decouple their monetary
policies from Germany.
Thus far, they have tried to shadow the D-Mark by keeping interest rates
high. But their currencies could show a downward trend over the next few
weeks, whether they cut rates or not.
There will be a new focus on the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate too, especially
in the week of the August payroll report. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency
strategist at UBS, believes that a high figure for the report could give the
dollar a new boost. But the dollar is now trading below DM1.67, a level it
tried hard to break on the upside for most of the last year - and it may be
difficult to sustain a recovery above this level.
On the dollar/yen rate, yesterday's close of Y103.95 from a previous Y104.40
has led some economists to think that the Japanese currency is building
substantial new strength.
But next month's attempts by the Japanese government to stimulate the
economy may strengthen the import side of the country's trade balance. Mr
Chertkow thinks we may never see Y100.

FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: SCA to raise SKr1.4bn after
surge in profits

SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, yesterday became the latest
Swedish company to announce a large rights issue as it unveiled a dramatic
jump in first-half profits to SKr550m (Dollars 68.1m) from SKr94m.
The group is seeking to raise SKr1.4bn to fund SKr3bn in new investments.
Its biggest investment will be in a newsprint plant at Aylesford in
south-east England where its share of a SKr3bn expansion project is expected
to cost SKr1.5bn.
SCA also plans to convert a newsprint machine in Sweden to higher quality
coated paper production at a cost of SKr1.25bn and to spend SKr350m on
adding recycling capacity to a plant in Austria.
The group said cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona and volume growth lay
behind its improved first-half result which was achieved on a 7 per cent
increase in net sales to SKr16.75bn. It noted that all its paper mills were
profitable, but its Swedish pulp mill remained in the red.
The biggest turnround was achieved by SCA Graphic Paper, which swung to an
operating profit of SKr56m from a SKr159m loss, while its Molnlycke hygiene
division strengthened operating profits to SKr530m from SKr355m.
SCA was cautious about prospects, noting that economic trends in the US and
Europe had developed less favourably than it had hoped.
It now expects a full-year profit of between SKr1.1bn and SKr1.3bn, a
refinement of its earlier prediction of a SKr1bn to SKr1.5bn profit.
SCA is the fourth big Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the last
two weeks, following forestry sector rival MoDo and two of the country's
leading banks.
Worries that the spate of new issues is beginning to soak up market
liquidity together with the company's cautious tone about prospects
contributed to a slight easing of its share price, which fell SKr2 to
SKr129.
SCA said it hopes shortly to finalise a joint venture with Mondi Europe,
largely owned by South African interests, to expand newsprint production
capacity at Aylesford.

<TEXT>
CARNEGIE International, the London securities house, has been mandated to
find a buyer for a controlling stake in Celik Halat, Turkey's largest steel
cable manufacturer.
Carnegie and Mr Artif Cezairli of Toros Securities, an Istanbul broker, have
been formally approached by Mr Nasrullah Ayan of Turkinvest, Turkey's
best-known corporate raider, to sell what is believed to be a near 50 per
cent stake worth about Dollars 20m.
The sale could effectively bring to a close a year of intense stock market
speculation for Celik Halat which has been at the centre of a number of
takeover rumours. Brokers anticipate a round of Turkish mergers as companies
look for foreign partners ahead of the move to customs union with the
European Community in 1995.
Celik Halat, which has 70 per cent of Turkey's steel cable market, earned
revenues of around Dollars 45m in 1992. Exports accounted for 30 per cent of
group sales.
Mr Cezairli confirmed that a number of Europe's leading steel manufacturers
were potential bidders but declined to give the names of companies already
approached.
Mr Ayan is putting his stake in Celik Halat up for sale after failing to
secure control of the company.

HAGEMEYER, the Dutch trading company, is on course to achieve higher
full-year net profit after posting a 20.2 per cent rise in first-half net
profit to Fl 50.6m (Dollars 30m), writes Ronald van de Krol.
The company, which is owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong and markets and
distributes branded products, said North American results showed a
substantial increase, reflecting strong growth in consumer electronics and a
better performance in speciality foods.
Results in Asia/Pacific were good, while profits improved slightly in
Europe. Overall, sales were up 2.6 per cent at Fl 1.66bn.
Pre-tax profit on normal business operations rose by 10.7 per cent in the
first half to Fl 77.2m, while Hagemeyer's tax bill fell by 6 per cent to Fl
17.9m. Lower interest rates helped cut financial costs to Fl 9.8m from Fl
13.5m.

<TEXT>
THE IBM Personal Computer company, formed a year ago as an independent unit
within IBM, has achieved significant gains in worldwide market share,
according to independent market research, ending several years of decline.
IBM's success appears to have come largely at the expense of smaller PC
manufacturers. However, the problems faced by Apple Computer and Dell
Computer, which have seen their profits slump, also reflect the increasing
competitiveness of IBM PC, according to industry analysts.
IBM is expected in increase its share of the Dollars 68bn worldwide PC
market by almost 2 per cent this year to 12.5 per cent, measured by unit
sales, according to IDC. That would translate into increased sales of
roughly Dollars 1.36bn, at retail value, the market researchers said.
IBM PC, which had sales of Dollars 9.8bn in 1982, has 'regained momentum
with competitive products priced far more aggressively than in the past',
said Mr Bruce Stephen, IDC director of PC hardware research.
'IBM has pulled off a turnround in its PC business that is dramatic given
how fast it happened and considering the size of the business.'

<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, yesterday reported strong
first-half profits and announced plans for a rights issue of convertible
preference shares to raise almost Fl 1.3bn (Dollars 665m).
The bank said issue would go ahead next month with the preference shares
priced close to the level of its ordinary shares which closed yesterday at
Fl 67.20. Holders of ordinary shares will be given pre-emptive rights to the
new shares.
The bank's net profits rose to Fl 1.01bn for the first half of 1993,
compared with Fl 872m a year ago, and the interim dividend is going up to Fl
1.45 a share from Fl 1.40 last year.
The bank said it expected to see increases in both gross and net profit for
the full year.
ABN Amro's first-half results partly reflected buoyant conditions on
European stock markets and hectic conditions on foreign exchange markets.
Income from foreign exchange trading jumped by 133 per cent to Fl 294m,
while securities trading income rose by 26 per cent to Fl 314m.
Total income stood at Fl 6.78bn, a 9.8 per cent rise on the first half of
1992. Expenditure rose by 7.8 per cent to Fl 4.5bn.
ABN Amro, created out of a merger in 1990, said it had suffered a slight
setback in planned savings on staff costs but added that the process of
integrating the two banks was proceeding according to schedule. The bank
expects to realise savings of Fl 500m a year from 1995 onwards because of
the link-up.
The bank's European results showed the strongest rise, with gross results
nearly doubling to Fl 360m from Fl 188m a year earlier. The Netherlands,
still the bank's single most important market, produced a 10.7 per cent
increase in gross profit to Fl 1.37bn.
North American results fell by 10.4 per cent to Fl 370m, but the bank said
this region would have posted a substantial improvement if it had not been
for a provision for debt securities.

The retailer said it would post a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y2.3bn

consecutive year. Mitsukoshi had earlier estimated a pre-tax profit of
Y2.5bn for the year.
Consumers are moving downmarket against a background of slow economic
recovery and department store profits have fallen in contrast to business at
discount retailers.

FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mattel challenges for top toy
spot - Karen Zagor on benefits of the US group's merger with Fisher-Price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger with Fisher-Price will transform Mattel, the number two US
toy-maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's
market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per
cent share.
The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market,
according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody. 'I think we will
continue to see smaller acquisitions,' says Mr Jacobson, 'but there is
nothing left of this magnitude.' Tyco, which posted losses for the first
half of this year, is considered too troubled to be attractive to Mattel or
Hasbro.
Mattel, once an unstable performer in an industry noted for its volatility,
has posted steady gains in sales and earnings since 1990. The company owes
much of its strength to the success of core brands, notably the Barbie doll,
Mattel's 34-year old fashion doll which last year accounted for around 50
per cent of sales.
The company, which last posted a loss of Dollars 113.2m in 1987, has found
stability by discarding non-toy assets, cutting overheads and personnel and
focusing on core products at the expense of more faddish toys. Last year, it
earned Dollars 143.8m, up from Dollars 117.2m in 1991 and Dollars 95.5m
1990. But some analysts say Mattel is too reliant on the Barbie doll.
The Fisher-Price deal will ease some of these concerns, reducing Barbie's
share of sales to just under 39 per cent for the combined company with
Fisher-Price contributing an additional 30 per cent of sales. Mattel's other
mainstay lines - Disney-based pre-school toys and the Hot Wheels car line -
will account for 10 per cent and 5 per cent of company sales respectively.
Fisher-Price, which is the dominant player in the infant and pre-school end
of the business, will help bolster Mattel's toy lines in this area. This is
particularly important because Mattel's Disney infant/preschool line has
been one of its weaker areas.
Mattel hopes to broaden Fisher-Price's overseas sales with the help of its
own distribution channels - about half of Mattel's sales are outside the US,
compared with 25 per cent for Fisher-Price.
'We also see opportunities with regards to manufacturing facilities,' says
Mattel. 'We have looked at two Fisher-Price plants in the US and think we
can put some Mattel products, currently produced by vendors, into these
plants.'
Fisher-Price, with a product range including Chatter Telephone, Play Desk
and a wide range of playsets, has been seen as a likely takeover candidate
since 1991, when it was spun off from Quaker Oats.
It earned Dollars 41.3m last year, up from Dollars 14.6m in 1991, but some
toy analysts have long felt that Fisher-Price needed big player muscle to
remain wholly competitive. Mattel, which had approached Fisher-Price at the
time of the spin-off, was the obvious suitor.
'The deal makes sense for both parties,' says Mr Harold Vogel, of Merrill
Lynch. 'Mattel had a need for it and Fisher-Price seemed to have difficulty
competing in a long-term sense against the big toy manufacturers. This gives
Mattel a little bit more balance. Whether it actually accelerates earnings
growth is another story.'
Balance is less of a concern for Hasbro, the world's biggest toy company.
Hasbro's greatest strength is the diversity of its products: it made 1992
profits of Dollars 179.2m compared with underlying earnings of Dollars
122.7m the previous year, excluding restructuring charges related an
acquisition. Products range from a strong preschool Playskool line, GI Joe
action doll for boys and board games, including Monopoly and Trivial
Pursuit.
A bigger Mattel will put pressure on Hasbro to retain its number one spot in
the toy industry, but there is still ample room for both companies to grow.
The combined domestic market share for Mattel and Hasbro is about 30 per
cent, 'leaving a tremendous room for growth', says Mr Jacobson.
Hasbro may even benefit from a more equal rival in Mattel. Stronger Mattel
toys will draw more customers into toy stores and get more products on to
shelves. And increased profits stability will allow Mattel to take greater
risks with its products.
If Mattel and Hasbro continue to grow, they may be more threatening to the
smaller companies than to each other. 'It's going to be more difficult for
small players to survive,' warns Mr Jacobson. 'But there will be niche
categories because, as Mattel and Hasbro get bigger, they will not pay
attention to the smaller niches.'
Moody's Investors Service has placed Mattel's debt ratings under review for
possible upgrade, citing acceleration in Mattel's progress 'in diversifying
its product array from Barbie toys'. Moody's expects the merger to enhance
earnings predictability without increasing debt.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Price rise may stall
coffee scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICAN COFFEE producers could chalk up a notable victory in their battle
against depressed prices without firing a shot if the world market sustains
its present bull run.
The continent's producers of robusta coffee agreed earlier this month to
join in a scheme drawn up by Latin American producers of the milder arabica
beans to withhold 20 per cent of their production from the market until
prices recovered to a more acceptable level. But a market upturn in
anticipation of the scheme, which is to come into operation on October 1,
has already brought prices to the level at which retention would be scaled
down to 10 per cent; and any substantial further gains could result in the
scheme being suspended before it comes into force.
Under the terms of the scheme the full 20 per cent would be retained while
the 15-day average of the International Coffee Organisation's robusta
indicator price was below 60 cents a lb; between 60 cents and 65 cents 10
per cent would be retained; and above that level retention of robustas would
be suspended.
Thursday's 15-day robusta average was 58.38 cents a lb, but with the daily
price at 62.13 cents the market only had to stay where it was to bring the
average up to the 10 per cent trigger level and within hailing distance of
the suspension level.
'If prices remain where they are now they will not be retaining much
(robusta) coffee,' one trader commented to the Reuter news agency yesterday.
Meanwhile the London Commodity Exchange'e robusta futures market was adding
to its already impressive recent gains. The November position yesterday
reached a fresh 2 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 1,335 a tonne before closing at
Dollars 1,281, up Dollars 19 on the day and Dollars 79 on the week. The
price was Dollars 463 above the low reached just four and a half months ago.
With the retention scheme already discounted in market prices this week's
advance was largely attributable to deepening concern about the availability
of good quality robusta beans for delivery against the large open position
at the LCE. As speculators who had sold the market short in the hope of
squaring their positions at lower prices ran for cover the premium for the
prompt September position over December futures climbed to Dollars 57 at
yesterday's close, up from Dollars 28 at the end of last week.
The cocoa market needed no technical factors to keep its uptrend going. With
both chart patterns and fundamental factors pointing northwards the December
futures position at the LCE had little difficulty in brushing aside the
psychological barrier at Pounds 800 a tonne on the way to a 22-month high of
Pounds 831 a tonne at yesterday's close, up Pounds 21 on the day and Pounds
52 on the week.
The rise was not uninterrupted - fears that the market was becoming
overbought prompted moderate bouts of selling on Wednesday and Thursday  -
but buyers remained in the ascendancy as continuing concern about growing
conditions in the Ivory Coast and Ghana (which produce about 40 per cent of
the world's cocoa crop between them) strengthened the conviction that there
would be a third consecutive overall crop deficit this year.
Having moved tentatively towards the upper end of its recent narrow trading
range last week, the gold market put up little resistance this week to
speculative pressure aimed at breaking the other end of the range. The
Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce support point gave way on Thursday under the weight
of concerted selling by New York speculators. That triggered selling orders
from the computer-controlled US investment funds and the price dipped to
Dollars 265 an ounce at one stage. It rallied to Dollars 369 at yesterday's
close, still Dollars 4.25 down on the week.
The ups and downs of the gold price were magnified in the platinum market,
with the price ranging between Dollars 466 and Dollars 481.50 an ounce
before fixing yesterday afternoon at Dollars 469.50, down Dollars 9.50 on
the week. But for palladium, platinum's sister metal, it was one-way traffic
as the US investment funds that lifted the metal's price to a four-year peak
of Dollars 146 an ounce in July turned against the market. It ended at
Dollars 120 an ounce, down Dollars 16.75 on the week.
Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of Johnson Matthey's platinum group metals market
surveys, said physical supply of the metal was tight and JM still expected a
supply deficit this year. He suspected that the Japanese had been hoarding
physical palladium because 'the yen price has been pretty low'.
At the London Metal Exchange the copper market continued to defy bearish
fundamental factors, aided by technical tightness on supplies available for
early delivery. The cash/three months delivery premium (a reflection of the
squeeze), which ended last week at Dollars 33 a tonne, widened to Dollars 42
at one stage before closing in to Dollars 38 at yesterday's close. The
market appeared to ignore a 9,800-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks as the
three months price rose Dollars 27 on the week to Dollars 1,931.50 a tonne.
The exchange's biggest loser was again the nickel market, which ended at a
fresh six-year low of Dollars 4,545 in the three months position. But tin
was not far behind, a Dollars 176 fall on the week taking the three months
price to Dollars 4,737.50 a tonne at yesterday's close. Early in the day the
price had followed the Kuala Lumpur market downwards, reaching a fresh
20-year low of Dollars 4,695 a tonne. But it steadied on short-covering.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dixons exits UK property market via Pounds
28m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons Group, the retailer, has agreed to sell a portfolio of property to
Legal &amp; General, the assurance company, for Pounds 28.55m in cash.
The deal virtually completes Dixon's exit from the UK property market, which
it announced in July 1992. Mr Robert Shrager, corporate finance director of
Dixons, said that it had decided to pull out of the UK property market,
which it entered in the mid-1970s, because of its highly speculative nature.
Dixons said it had no plans to dispose of its Continental European
portfolio, which includes about Pounds 100m of property in Belgium, France,
Luxembourg and Germany. It said this portfolio had been historically
successful.
The portfolio includes about 30 properties in various sectors throughout the
UK.

Boulton &amp; Paul, the joinery company bought out by its management from BET
earlier this year for Pounds 14.5m, is acquiring TSM Joinery from Axis
International for an undisclosed sum.
Based in Lincolnshire, TSM, a stair manufacturer, has sales of joinery
products worth about Pounds 2.5m a year, including over 150 flights of
stairs a week for the domestic housing market.
With a view to seeking a flotation within the next two to three years, Axis
International, the Surrey-based investment and consultancy group, has
appointed Beeson Gregory as its financial adviser.
Axis acquired TSM Joinery from the receiver in March 1992.

Profits of Shorco Group Holdings fell from Pounds 105,000 to Pounds 80,000
pre-tax for the half year to end-June. Turnover declined by Pounds 224,000
to Pounds 3.33m.
A same-again interim dividend of 2.4p is being paid from earnings per share

The USM-quoted company has interests in trench support systems and allied
equipment and trades almost exclusively within the construction sec-tor.
The directors said that although the UK economy as a whole was believed to
be showing signs of improvement, the level of activity of the construction
sector had 'so far shown little change.'
Margins were expected to continue under pressure.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pressings side leaves Braime lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of TF&amp;JH Braime (Holdings), the finished metal products,
forging, pressing and stamping group, fell from Pounds 214,090 to Pounds
155,099 for the half year to June 30.
Turnover improved from Pounds 2.78m to Pounds 3.3m. The fall in profits was
due primarily to weak demand for products of Braime Pressings in the first
quarter which left the subsidiary in loss for the half year.
Currently, there are signs of recovery in demand for products of the
pressings business. The directors said, however, that 'this gradual
improvement, even if sustained, may have come too late to enable us to reach
last year's level of profitability for the full year.'
The interim dividend is being maintained at 2.25p from earnings per share of
6.9p (9.65p).

Low raw material input prices, weak demand and severe price competition

In the half year ended June 30 profits fell from IPounds 6.17m to IPounds

Mr Domhnall McCullough, chairman, said there were rationalisation costs of
IPounds 400,000 in the period. Cost reduction programmes, investment in new
equipment and renewed marketing strategies had been implemented to lower
unit costs and increase sales.
He added that with a strong balance sheet and net cash the company continued

Lec Refrigeration, the refrigeration equipment manufacturer, suffered
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.68m for the six months ended June 30 which
reflected, it said, 'the persistently disappointing economic climate in the
UK'. There were profits of Pounds 320,000 last time.
After a tax credit of Pounds 553,000 (Pounds 106,000 charge) losses per
share were given as 18.58p against 3.54p earnings while, in view of the
relative strength of the balance sheet, the interim dividend is maintained
at 4p.
Turnover for the six months rose slightly from Pounds 19.34m to Pounds
19.61m.
The directors stated that while market share had been maintained, that was
only at the expense of reduced gross margins.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Surrey Group, the USM-quoted bookmakers, ran up a loss of Pounds 937,000
pre-tax for the year to end-March. That compared with profits of just Pounds
5,000 last time.
Turnover declined from Pounds 49,571 to Pounds 47,081. Losses per share
emerged at 0.48p (earnings 0.07p) and there is again no dividend.
The deficit before interest from the bookmaking activities amounted to
Pounds 715,000 and profits realised from betting office sales and other
income totalled Pounds 522,000.
That resulted in a net operating loss of Pounds 193,000.
The pre-tax results was struck after deducting interest of Pounds 744,000.
The directors said that since the beginning of the year trading conditions
in the bookmaking industry had improved. They added that the group was
currently trading at a 'small profit' but warned that it was 'too early to
say whether this will lead to a return to net profitability for the current
half year as a whole.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: West Trust expands via Pounds 2.5m buy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A further step in its expansion into the food industry, in particular the
ethnic food sector, West Trust is to acquire La Mexicana Quality Foods, a
producer of Mexican food specialising in the production of tortillas.
Consideration amounting to Pounds 2.48m will be met via a placing and open
offer of new ordinary shares. Some 8.2m shares have been placed by Bell
Lawrie White &amp; Co with institutional and other investors at 32p per share
subject to a clawback by existing shareholders on a 5-for-11 basis.
Over the last three years to end-January 1993 La Mexicana's profits before
exceptional items and tax have risen from Pounds 94,000 to Pounds 297,000.
Turnover has risen from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.37m.
West Trust also reported a swing from losses of Pounds 3.18m to profits of
Pounds 129,000 pre-tax for the year to March 31.
The results reflected a 'growing profit trend' from Bart Spices, acquired in
1992, and a Pounds 30,000 contribution from Veeraswamy's (Food Products) for
the eleven weeks from acquisition to the year end.
Profits from the food division were counteracted by a further deterioration
in tading conditions in the two textile subsidiaries.
Earnings emerged at 0.21p (losses 50.67p) and as forecast, the dividend for
the year is maintained at 2.5p.
The directors intend to maintain this level of dividend for the current year
and, dependent on half year results, commence payments of interims.
West Trust's shares rose 4p to 41p.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brierley Investments disposes of half its
Guinness Peat holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment company once headed
by Sir Ron Brierley, has sold half its shares in Guinness Peat Group, Sir
Ron's UK investment vehicle, the Australian Stock Exchange reported.
BIL sold 65m shares, or 19.2 per cent of GPG's issued capital, at 62.5
Australian cents a share. It retains 63.7m shares - 18 per cent of the
capital.
GPG said on Tuesday, when announcing a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
3.15m to Pounds 6.75m, that it would be listed in Australia from Wednesday.
BIL said yesterday that now GPG had a listing in Australia it was
appropriate to place half BIL's shareholding there. This would provide for
wider participation and liquidity in the shares in that market.
BIL, from which Sir Ron was ousted as chairman several years ago, owned more
than 60 per cent of GPG at the beginning of the decade. After restructuring
and recapitalising, BIL reduced its shareholding to 40 per cent in 1991. The
company said this had completed its direct role in GPG, and facilitated its
new direction as an entrepreneurial investment company under the
chairmanship of Sir Ron.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brent Intl Pounds 24m sale as profits drop
to Pounds 0.93m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT INTERNATIONAL, the speciality chemicals group, announced yesterday the
sale of its electronics group for Pounds 24m as pre-tax profits dropped to
Pounds 931,000 from a previous Pounds 6.4m.
At the same time Mr Stephen Cuthbert, the chief executive since 1981,
resigned by mutual agreement. His compensation is thought to be around
Pounds 250,000.
Mr Keith Hutchings, group finance director and acting chief executive, said
Brent's performance had not been meeting either the company's or the
shareholders' expectations for the last two years. The company is looking
for a recruit with strong industrial experience.
In May shares in the group fell 30p to 99p after Lord Lane, chairman, told
shareholders at the annual meeting that first half profits would be
'significantly below' those achieved in the first half of 1992.
The shares closed 7p down at 116p.
In spite of the warning analysts were surprised by the extent of the
retreat. Operating profits tumbled to Pounds 1.8m after taking into account
redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.6m and a charge of Pounds
475,000 for costs related to abortive acquisitions. Operating profits were
Pounds 6.2m last time.
Mr Hutchings said the fall in operating profits reflected the downturn in
the real volume of sales, a reduction of 20 per cent in gross margins, and a
slight rise in overheads.
Brent is selling its electronics division to Cookson. It will receive Pounds
20m cash and Cookson's Trafficair division, a maker of industrial cleaning
products for the transport industry worth Pounds 4m.
The electronics group, with net assets of Pounds 3.8m, had sales of Pounds
11.6m for 1992, and contributed Pounds 2m of the group's 1992 pre-tax profit
of Pounds 11.5m.
Mr Hutchings said the sale would realise a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7m and
reduce the group's debt from Pounds 21m to Pounds 1m. Tangible net worth
would rise to Pounds 37m (Pounds 23m) after the disposal.
Group interest payable soared to Pounds 857,000 compared with a receivable
of Pounds 132,000 previously. Mr Hutchings attributed this to payments both
for acquisitions made in 1991 and capital expenditure.
After a high tax charge boosted by Pounds 450,000 of unrelieved ACT and the
preference dividend payout of Pounds 540,000, the loss per share was 0.5p,
compared with earnings per share of 5.3p last time. The interim dividend is
maintained at 1.6p.
While turnover was up at Pounds 63.5m (Pounds 59.9m), the group said it was
down 4 per cent in real terms after taking out the exchange rate factor.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Coutts Consulting dispute continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE between Coutts Consulting, formerly DC Gardner, and Mr Barry
Topple, its former chief executive, is showing no signs of reaching a
conclusion.
Yesterday Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, sent a letter to all shareholders
saying that the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training
group would make no further improvement to the conversion terms for the
convertible preference shares.
He added that Coutts would not sell Eynsham Hall, a residential training
centre, for which Mr Topple has made an offer and is keen to buy; that it
was defending Mr Topple's claim against the company over compensation for
the termination of his employment last year; and that it was pursuing its
counter-claim against him for damages for Pounds 3.4m.
When contacted in Australia, Mr Topple declined to comment.
Coutts has one piece of its lengthy restructuring left to achieve - the
reduction of the share premium account, so that ordinary dividend payments
can recommence. The move was blocked on July 5 by holders of the convertible
preference shares, of which Mr Topple owns 50 per cent and is a trustee for
a further 20 per cent.
Agreement from 75 per cent of holders was necessary.
The board offered improved conversion terms - 66.67 ordinary for every 100
convertible preference, up about 40 per cent from the existing 47.62 - but
in his letter Sir Kit said that the offer closed on August 6 with no
acceptances.
In its results for the six months to June 30, released yesterday, Coutts
made pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.24m, against profits of Pounds 930,000 last
time. The figure was distorted by exceptional costs of Pounds 5.29m,
relating to the sale of the banking and management training division to
Euromoney Publications for Pounds 3.7m and the termination of a lease on a
Docklands property in June.
Operating profits declined to Pounds 329,000 (Pounds 1.28m), with continuing
activities contributing Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.35m), though a Pounds 200,000
write-down in the carrying value of a property for sale and Pounds 228,000
(Pounds 96,000) for redundancies and reorganisation were subtracted. Group
turnover grew to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.2m), with ongoing businesses higher
at Pounds 9.42m (Pounds 7.46m).

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TSB sells EuroDollar to management for
Pounds 192m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group yesterday announced that it was selling EuroDollar, the car rental
company, to its management for Pounds 192m.
The sale is the latest of several disposals by TSB of businesses outside its
retail banking core. In July, it sold Swan National Leasing, its vehicle
contract hire business, to the leasing arm of Midland Bank for Pounds
182.5m.
Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive of TSB, said the decision to sell stemmed
from the belief that EuroDollar would be 'somewhat isolated within the group
structure' following the sale of Swan National Leasing and Swan National's
motor group.
TSB is to receive sale proceeds of Pounds 59.9m, comprising cash of Pounds
22m in respect of EuroDollar's net assets and Pounds 37.9m in respect of
inter-company debt. In addition, the purchase will repay existing debts of
Pounds 58.1m. On March 31 1993, EuroDollar's net assets were Pounds 20.4m.
EuroDollar, which has 10 per cent of the UK market, has 12,000 vehicles and
106 branches. It also owns the EuroDollar network in 27 countries, operating
over 40,000 vehicles. It is the largest provider of rental cars to the
corporate sector in the UK.
EuroDollar was set up in 1973 by UDT, a credit financing business, which was
bought by TSB in 1981.
In its last half year to March 31 1993, EuroDollar incurred a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 7.9m, as the result of a deterioration in trading conditions in
foreign subsidiaries in Italy and France.
Of the company's equity 40 per cent will be shared by 11 of EuroDollar's
senior managers. The other equity investors are Prudential Venture Managers,
Charterhouse Development Capital, Electra Private Equity Partners and Morgan
Grenfell Development Capital, which together invested Pounds 60m.
Mr Freddie Aldous, chairman of EuroDollar, said it was 'almost certain' that
the company would be looking for a flotation within a few years.
Prudential Venture Managers said it was 'an excellent time' for management
buyouts as the UK economy emerged from recession.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rights and placing at Wiggins to fund
property acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIGGINS Group, a property developer which recently agreed a creditors'
voluntary arrangement, yesterday announced a reverse takeover involving a
financial reconstruction and the injection of several development
properties.
Mr Stephen Hayklan, chairman of Wiggins, said that the deal marked the
return of the merchant developer. Mr Oliver Iny, chairman of Clerkenwell
Holdings, a private developer who will own 30.4 per cent of the company
after the deal, wanted a quoted vehicle to take advantage of the upturn in
the property market.
The deal involves a capital reorganisation, board changes, the acquisition
of several development properties, a Pounds 1.6m rights issue and a Pounds
7m placing.
The money raised will be used to buy the site of a former hospital at
Lincoln for a total of Pounds 6.4m from Castlegold, a company controlled by
Mr Iny. The land has planning permission for 400 residential units, a hotel
and two schools.
It has also acquired an option to buy from Castlegold a leisure site in
Brent for Pounds 1.5m and the site of a former hospital in Bedfordshire for
Pounds 8m.
The board changes include the appointment of Mr William Syson as
non-executive chairman and Mr Iny, Mr Christopher Foster and Mr Lance
Blackstone as directors.
RACI, a stockbroker, will place 280m new shares at 2 1/2 p per share. The
rights issue of 63.5m shares at 2 1/2 p is on the basis of 4-for-1 and will
not be underwritten.

FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Problem of growth in a shrunken market - As
Royal Doulton heads for a quote, Peggy Hollinger looks at the fine china
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOSIAH Wedgwood, founder of the fine china company which bears his name, was
keenly aware of the dangers of industrial espionage. To thwart snoopers he
wrote down the results of thousands of experiments in a secret code.
Some things have changed in the 230 years since Josiah set up shop in
Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, but caution still rules the fine china
manufacturers. People seeking to evaluate the industry will find few global
figures or statistics.
The lack of information is one reason why the City is having such a
difficult time deciding how to appraise a quoted fine china manufacturer,
which Royal Doulton plans to become when it demerges from Pearson later this
year.
Mr Alistair Smellie, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, says investors will
have to take a broad brush approach to assessing the sector. 'With the lack
of information and limited quality available that is all one can do.'
What is clear, however, is that fine china manufacturers have come through a
devastating period of recession. Some estimate the market has shrunk by as
much as 20 per cent in the last three years.
Mr Kneale Ashwell, chief executive of Wedgwood, says that in spite of
widespread restructuring by most of the main players, the industry is still
beset by overcapacity.
To make matters worse, fewer couples are getting married. Wedgwood estimates
that the number of weddings - which account for between 40 and 50 per cent
of its and other UK manufacturers' sales - have fallen by 8 per cent in the
last two years alone. Today it is estimated that the international fine
china and porcelain market is worth between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn a
year.
That global market is divided between seven main players, including two of
the world's most famous and long-established names - Wedgwood and Royal
Doulton. The other five newer arrivals are Lenox of the US, Noritake of
Japan, and Villeroy and Boch, Heutchenreuter and Rosenthal of Germany.
While Wedgwood and Royal Doulton are marginally larger with annual sales of
about Pounds 200m, the rest are about the same size. Each holds a leading
position in its domestic market, with the exception of Noritake which,
besides a strong position at home, shares the number one spot in North
America with Lenox.
The challenge facing these seven players is how to grow in what is
undisputedly a mature industry. Although all seek to build stronger
positions outside their home markets, and exports form some 60 per cent of
the sales of the UK companies, manufacturers without brand advantage find it
difficult to meet the demands of different national tastes.
The expensive and laborious china-making process - taking more than three
days and up to 12 people to complete just one piece - means that the costs
of introducing completely different shapes and designs for different markets
would be prohibitive.
North America is one of the largest markets for fine china with annual sales
in excess of Pounds 300m. However, with the exception of the Japanese it is
also notoriously difficult for outsiders to break into. Tastes are for
simpler, more casual ware at lower prices. Here, the Japanese excel, says Mr
Ashwell. 'They have given superior quality at very, very low prices,' he
says. The slim margins have put other potential rivals under intense
pressure.
Germany, which rivals North America in terms of market size, presents
different problems. Lacking any real tradition of buying china, the Germans
prefer the porcelain manufactured at home. Although companies such as
Wedgwood and Royal Doulton have made some headway by playing on the cachet
of the brand names, the German manufacturers have a virtual stranglehold on
the market.
In the UK, efforts by the higher priced German manufacturers have largely
failed in a conservative and price-conscious market. Similarly, the Lenox
products do not appeal to more traditional English customers. Royal Doulton
and Wedgwood claim 26 per cent of the UK market by value.
Japan presents yet different demands. While English speaking countries buy
china mainly for weddings, the Japanese want to buy small gifts several
times during the year. Here, brand name, generally English, and packaging
are all important. Japanese tourists in the UK are also vital to the likes
of Wedgwood and Royal Doulton. Mintel, the market researcher, estimates that
tourists purchased some Pounds 156m of china and glassware in 1990.
Although the skilled nature of fine china puts some restrictions on the
ability of manufacturers to meet the needs of different markets, Mr Ashwell
is emphatic there are opportunities for growth. First, by speeding up the
manufacturing process. Although fine china will always be a craft-based
industry, technology is increasingly eliminating the need for skilled jobs
such as glazing and plate-making.
Second, china makers are moving towards more utilitarian giftware and point
to this market as one of the fastest growing parts of the industry. China
products such as clocks, playing card boxes and frames are a few products
recently introduced by Wedgwood to tap this market.
Third, the globalisation of brands means that differences in consumer taste
are gradually being eliminated. 'If you have some convergence as you had in
the fashion industry,' says Mr Kevin Farrell, chairman of the British
Ceramic Manufacturers Federation, 'that would be one solution to the problem
of what lines to carry.'
Finally, china makers are seeking to re-educate customers to use china every
day, instead of just on special occasions. This means they will have to
introduce more casual china and porcelain products.
There is a more controversial theory about where a few of the top seven may
find growth. 'I think we will see strategic alliances of various kinds that
will decrease the number of players,' says one industry insider. A single
alliance could result in a clear leader twice the size of any of the others,
he says.
One city analyst has already pinpointed a potential scenario. Lack of
knowledge about the industry could cost Royal Doulton a premium rating, he
suggests. Then, he says, 'a Japanese or continental competitor may see it as
pathetically rated and take it over.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Discipline in need of a better chemistry: John Authers on
science's bad image in UK schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why don't you do a nice arts degree, asked the despairing mother of her
daughter in a sketch by comediennes Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.
Choosing a physics degree can only lead to life as a boring, socially
inadequate spinster, the mother wailed.
The sketch was meant as a parody of British attitudes to scientists, but
universities trying to fill physics, engineering, and chemistry courses will
have found it too true to be funny. With thousands of spaces unfilled,
universities have this week been offering science courses to candidates with
just two Es at A-level, the lowest pass grade. Arts candidates who narrowly
missed required grades are being offered science instead.
The shortfall in would-be scientists is the corollary of a fall in pupils
taking science at A-level. The number taking physics A-level this year was
9.6 per cent down on last year. For chemistry the figure was 4.5 per cent.
A decline in interest is evident also among 16-year-olds taking GCSE
examinations. Entries for all science subjects have fallen by 4.15 per cent
since 1989, according to figures this week. 'There is an anti-science mood
in Britain,' said Sir David Weatherall, president of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science.
The government's response so far has not been to encourage science directly,
but to discourage universities from taking on arts students by cutting its
contribution to tuition fees for non-scientific subjects for 1993-94.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, this week acknowledged that the
continuing unpopularity of science is a cause for concern - but said the
blame did not lie just at his door. 'I think we are all in this together -
the government, teachers and employers,' he said.
Mr Patten may be correct to look to employers for an explanation. Although
the Confederation of British Industry and Institute of Directors preach the
need to build Britain's science expertise, figures for graduate salaries and
unemployment rates suggest demand for scientists is little or no higher than
for other disciplines.
According to CSU, a consultancy which charts graduate salaries, students
with degrees in pure science could have expected to start work on Pounds
12,285 a year in 1992, only slightly higher than the Pounds 12,039 for jobs
where degree subject was unimportant.
Unemployment rates show scientists faring worse than contemporaries who
studied arts: of those who graduated with chemistry and physics degrees in
1991, 11.3 per cent were unemployed a year later. For humanities only 8.2
per cent were jobless.
Engineering graduates buck the trend among scientists - particularly those
with specific skills needed by industry. The average starting salary for
engineers last year was Pounds 12,374, higher than the norm for all
graduates, and their unemployment rate after 12 months was below average at
8.5 per cent.
Although the overall picture suggests that employers are not unduly worried
about the lack of science graduates, Ms Margaret Murray, head of the CBI's
education unit, said encouraging science is still essential to Britain's
industrial competitiveness. The CBI and the IoD argue scientists have skills
that industry needs, such as problem-solving experience and confidence with
numbers.
Ms Murray seized on the shortages of engineers as particularly worrisome.
The US trains nearly twice as many engineers per head as the UK, and Japan
nearly three times as many, she said.
Her concern, however, is not sufficient to overcome a bias against science
among children - probably caused as much by a popular perception that the
subject is dull as by the status of scientists in the job market. Dr Ann
Robinson, the IoD's head of policy, diagnosed a cultural problem. Education
has been 'too child-centred and too student-led'. When pupils find a course
either difficult or boring schools and universities have been too willing to
withdraw it.
Reinforcing her point is research by the Association for Science Education,
showing the number of students taking science A-levels falls when schools
introduce arts courses which children believe are more interesting - such as
media studies.
Professor Alan Smithers, of Manchester University education department, said
the quality of teaching also discourages possible scientists. Below 16,
science is usually taught as a set of facts, with little or no element of
discovery. Only at A-level do students discover that hard and fast rules
learnt by rote are not always correct.
The quality of lessons is not helped by the poorer degrees held by science
teachers. University Council for the Education of Teachers' figures show
that in 1991 almost 40 per cent of physics teachers had a third class degree
or lower, compared with 5 per cent for history teachers. Professor Smithers
believed there is a vicious spiral: 'Too few science graduates, too few
teachers, poor teaching, too few students.'
At the same time, constraints of the A-level system itself can act also as a
deterrent for scientists. Most university science courses still require
three A-levels in related subjects, forcing pupils to abandon arts courses
at 16.
Such weaknesses in school science have prompted calls for the abolition of
A-levels. These have remained untouched since the Conservatives came to
power in 1979 even though they follow on uneasily from a new national
curriculum which requires studying a breadth of subjects to GCSE level.
The government 'refuses to recognise the barrier to improving the science
base is its insistence on retaining A-levels in their current form,' said Mr
Roger Young, of the Institute of Management. The IM wants a six subject
curriculum for 16-18-year-olds, with all pupils following at least one arts
subject and one science.
Mr Patten's analysis this week was that selling science 'is a marketing
problem, trying to persuade children that science is interesting and
rewarding'. But attracting more students into science may require more
sweeping changes to Britain's further and higher education systems.

FT  28 AUG 93 / New flights of fantasy: George Graham on Nasa's future after
the loss of Mars Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 980m Mars Observer was supposed to bring back the first new
pictures in nearly 20 years of the planet Mars. Instead, it is lost in space
without a radio. At best, the spacecraft may have swerved automatically into
an orbit around Mars, and there is an outside chance it may re-establish
contact with earth. At worst, it may have exploded.
'I'm betting it blew up on Saturday,' said Mr John Pike, a space specialist
at the Federation of American Scientists. 'If it was a big explosion, it's
in little bitty pieces.'
Nasa scientists suspect a faulty transistor and acknowledge they probably
face a 'non-recoverable situation'.
Back on earth, the Mars Observer's problems translate easily into an
uncomfortable metaphor about the once-proud National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
Nasa has suffered a series of mishaps on its programmes. Flawed mirrors have
hobbled the Hubble space telescope. Jammed antenna are hampering the Galileo
probe to Jupiter. And there have been delays and cancellations for space
shuttle launches - although these last-minute cancellations are preferable
to the kind of disaster that destroyed the Challenger shuttle in 1986.
Nasa officials say that even the glorious era of the Apollo moon missions
was not free of problems.
'We had glitches and failures back then in the heydays. We had engine
shutdowns on the pad - the very same kind of things that are happening
(today),' says Mr Wes Huntress, Nasa's associate administrator for space
science.
'We have established some very tough goals for ourselves in the space
programme. If they were easy to meet, anybody could meet them,' adds Mr
William Piotrowski, acting director of its solar system exploration
division.
But the space agency's reputation for being able to manage a budget
disappeared in smoke years ago. The General Accounting Office, the audit arm
of the US Congress, reported this year that Nasa underestimated costs on 25
out of 29 big projects. The recent technical setbacks have dealt further
blows to what remains of its image.
Mr John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington
University in Washington, says Nasa's recent setbacks are not merely
problems of the kind that can afflict even the best-run organisation; they
reflect the reality that Nasa lost its technical and managerial excellence
in the 1970s and 1980s.
Not even Nasa's critics - and they are many and varied - are rubbing their
hands at the Mars Observer's apparent failure. From the protesters who claim
Nasa is hiding evidence of intelligent life on Mars to the space analysts
who say the agency spends too much money on the costly shuttle to the
detriment of unmanned missions that could bring more knowledge, all had high
hopes from Mars Observer.
The disappointment is acute for those who had hoped that breathtaking
photographs of the surface of the red planet, the first since Viking in
1976, could help to rekindle the public imagination in a way that the
shuttle astronauts, who have turned into little more than space hauliers,
have not.
After its days of glory, Nasa became overweight. Whereas in 1972, when the
Apollo era ended with the last manned moon landing, Nasa and its contractors
employed 138,800 people, today they employ 100,000 more.
Mr Timothy Ferris, a science writer at the University of California at
Berkeley and adviser to several Nasa space exploration missions, says many
employees have fallen into a attitude where their main concern is justifying
their jobs. In the old days, however, 'people at Nasa worried about getting
to the moon'.
Where once President John F Kennedy sparked Nasa to excellence by
challenging it to put a man on the moon, such political leadership as Nasa
received in the 1970s and 1980s degenerated into prodding from members of
Congress anxious to ensure that the agency diverted work to their
constituencies.
The agency became a master of the art of extracting money from congressional
appropriations committees, by distributing largesse to as many supporters as
possible. When lobbying last year to save the space station Freedom from the
budget axe, Nasa circulated maps showing that the station generated jobs in
37 of 50 states and 151 of 435 congressional districts.
'Nasa sees its primary mission as the securing of appropriations from
Congress. Congress in turn understands the importance of big aerospace
programmes in maintaining jobs in the aerospace industry,' says Mr Ferris.
But Mr Daniel Goldin, who became Nasa's administrator 18 months ago, has won
some acclaim outside the agency for beginning to change all this.
When appointed, Mr Goldin was viewed with some suspicion by Nasa and
Congress, who resented the ousting of his predecessor, the former astronaut
Admiral Richard Truly. Some saw Mr Goldin as a cat's paw for Vice-president
Dan Quayle, who took the lead on space issues for the Bush administration.
Mr Al Gore, who was chairman of the Senate Science, Technology and Space
Subcommittee before he replaced Mr Quayle as Vice-president, was one of the
most vocal in questioning Mr Goldin's independence.
After some hesitation, President Bill Clinton kept Mr Goldin, with 25 years
of private sector experience at the TRW engineering group's space division,
to spearhead the assault on Nasa's bureaucracy.
Mr Goldin won more favour with the president for the alacrity with which he
took up Mr Clinton's challenge to redesign the space station, a permanently
manned orbiter Nasa plans to launch by 2001, so that it would cost less and
do more.
The new scaled-down station will include elements from the original Freedom
design, but should cost Dollars 8bn to Dollars 9bn less to build than
Freedom by its projected launch date and perhaps Dollars 18bn less to
operate over a 10-year life span.
Mr Goldin has also drafted a budget that cuts Nasa's five-year spending plan
by Dollars 15bn to Dollars 80.4bn. Although he has fought hard to keep the
space station alive, he is Nasa's fiercest critic, lambasting its 'appalling
management structures'.
'I personally am tired of Apollo stories. It's time we started writing
history and not reading it,' he told a meeting of space scientists recently.
Mr Goldin himself may not write much history. His task is more to shape Nasa
into the kind of entrepreneurial organisation that will once again do so.
Outsiders in the scientific community believe Mr Goldin has already done
much to shake out Nasa's bureaucratic stuffiness, though much remains to be
done.
Writing history, however, will require more than managerial excellence. Nasa
needs a new sense of mission to replace the urge to compete with the Soviet
Union that spurred earlier space probes.
Mr Clinton and Mr Gore offer Nasa an opportunity, by seeking to swing the
pendulum back to civilian pursuits and away from the Star Wars and military
projects that dominated space programmes under Presidents Reagan and Bush.
But they also want Nasa to spend more time and money on aeronautics research
with practical dividends for civil aviation. Manned missions to explore the
planets, they have warned, are a long way in the future.
Practical dividends have recently come to dominate other considerations, to
the extent that supporters of the space station conduct their annual battle
to preserve its budget by inventing ever more farcical claims that
everything from Aids to arthritis could be cured if only scientists could
experiment in zero gravity.
But a vital part of Nasa has always been the dream of pushing back the
boundaries of space. That dream has also been important to public support
for the agency and its budget.
Nasa may not be lost in space without a radio. Without that dream, however,
it might turn into little more than an earthbound technology agency.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Russian women have right to fair
debate on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LOUIS BAQUERIZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the right of abortion in Russia was disappointing
('Russia's woman face a new reign of fear', August 21/22 1993).
To assume, as Lore Cidylo does, that abortion is a 'fundamental right' is to
miss the point of the debate: to determine whether such right does exist or
not.
Unsubstantiated statements more at home with a political pamphlet than the
FT ('for women, democracy has turned out to be a painful disappointment',
'Russian women say they will put up a vociferous legislative fight') are not
useful to the debate.
And to suggest that democracy may 'spell a setback to women's rights'
reminds me of many a dictator.
Abortion is an extremely serious issue that deserves to be discussed both
deeply and objectively and not in a sectarian way.

<TEXT>
Sir, While the mail order industry is absorbing Mr Price's richly deserved
criticism, perhaps it will explain why some goods are available only on the
UK mainland.
The postage is a notional sum, including packing, and must be similar, and
we in the Channel Islands are not necessarily asking for relief from VAT. We
pay extra anyway for most things, as half the traders leave VAT on and call
it freight charges. We are not a foreign country, and we should have the
opportunity to acquire goods that are on sale nationally but not readily
available in our shops. P Cranford Smith,

<TEXT>
Sir, Further to Mr Jonathan Price's letter ('Why is mail order so slow?',
August 21/22), one explanation could be that some companies enjoy using Mr
Price's money for 28 days or longer. Also, they may await orders before
ordering stock from suppliers, thus passing on much of their business risk
to the manufacturers, who then have to wait for their money.
Mail order houses must weigh the danger of being over-dependent on suppliers
far away. Shipping in urgent stock by air is risky and costly.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Fishy deals all in a roe: Caviar may lose its cachet if
producers do not act to control supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In smoke-filled rooms in the Iranian port of Bandar Anzali this week, the
talk between officials from Iran and four former Soviet republics was not
about oil or arms, but of fish roe. Carving up the caviar market has become
a political issue.
The sturgeon may seem an unlikely subject for Opec-style negotiations, but
when a large sturgeon can contain caviar equivalent in value to two
Rolls-Royces, caviar-producing countries have decided they need to determine
how much each is allowed to fish.
The shiny black eggs tinged with gold, once the preserve of shahs and tsars,
are still surrounded by mystique, prized not only for their delicate flavour
but for their supposedly aphrodisiac qualities.
Western importers fear, however, that caviar may be about to lose its
cachet. Former Soviet republics, keen to earn hard currency, are threatening
to increase their exports, thus flooding the market. An increase in
smuggling has led to an influx of often substandard caviar into Europe.
Officials from the five countries bordering the Caspian Sea - home to 90 per
cent of the world's sturgeon - met this week to discuss the problem,
although a report from Irna, the Iranian News Agency, that they had agreed
to form a caviar 'cartel', seems to have been premature.
Mr Rasoul Pousti, European representative of Shilat, the Iranian national
fisheries company, in Frankfurt, said the results of the meeting were yet to
be announced. Its aim was not to set up a cartel, but to co-ordinate
marketing and deal with such problems as smuggling, over-fishing and
pollution of the Caspian.
But European dealers say some kind of agreement is urgently needed.
'The market is pretty much in disarray,' says Mr John Stas, managing
director of WG White, the only UK agent for Russian caviar. 'A cartel
agreement might at least mean we could source caviar from reliable people at
sensible prices.'
Two years ago, the Soviet Union and Iran, the only two countries bordering
the Caspian, had an effective duopoly in the caviar market. The Soviet Union
produced about 700 tonnes a year, much of it ending up on the tables of the
Communist party elite or on sandwiches sold for a couple of roubles at
venues such as the Bolshoi Theatre. Less than 100 tonnes were exported, all
through Sovrybflot, the Soviet state fisheries agency. Iran produced 200
tonnes a year, exporting about 150 tonnes through the fisheries company,
Shilat.
The Soviet Union and Iran held informal negotiations each year to adjust the
price, usually based on the dollar exchange rate.
The break-up of the Soviet Union, however, means that five countries now
border the Caspian, with the newly independent republics of Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan joining Iran and Russia.
The end of centralised control means fishing has become a free-for-all. The
new republics are no longer content to sell caviar to Moscow for roubles.
They want to market it themselves. The problem, however, is that if they all
fulfilled their desired export amounts, the total would be about 300 tonnes
 -bigger than the entire western market.
Because the new republics have little experience of controlling fishing and
regulating trade, large quantities of caviar are finding their way onto the
Russian black market. From there it travels to Europe in the suitcases of
eastern European tourists anxious to earn hard cash. French customs officers
who stopped one coachload of Russian tourists last year found 200kg of
caviar - market value roughly Dollars 80,000.
'The problem is wider than just people coming over with a little suitcase,'
says Mr Pousti. 'People are trying to deal in caviar with no experience.'
Spotting an opportunity, western entrepreneurs have also brought supplies
into Europe, sometimes obtained from producers and other licensed exporters,
sometimes from Russian gangsters. Many have found it difficult to resell the
caviar.
Mr Peter Rebeiz, president of Caviar House in Geneva, which imports about a
third of the caviar sold in the west, says retailers and restaurants will
only buy from trusted suppliers.
'There are about 65 tonnes of unsold caviar lying around between Amsterdam
and Hamburg,' says Mr Rebeiz. 'Much of it is arriving in non-refrigerated
trucks. By the time it gets here it practically walks by itself.'
Caviar House has stopped importing caviar from the former Soviet republics,
demanding that they agree export quotas, as well as take steps to regulate
fishing and protect the environment in the Caspian, before it will buy more.
Ironically, some of those still dealing with the new republics have
difficulty obtaining caviar. WG White says that since the demise of
Sovrybflot, the Russian authorities have issued export licences not to
caviar producers, but to intermediary companies, which are often unable to
guarantee supplies of the required quality. They are also quoting prices 30
to 50 per cent higher than last year.
Mr Rebeiz believes, however, that the end of the Soviet monopoly may provide
opportunities for the new republics. The three main types of caviar -
Beluga, Sevruga and Osetrova - have subtle variations in taste and texture,
according to the depth and temperature of the water the sturgeon inhabit.
The emergence of the republics may lead to the development of a range of
caviar brands from different parts of the Caspian, he says.
It may take the republics several years to develop the marketing expertise,
but there is money to be made in the west from the Caspian Sea's other form
of black gold.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK depends heavily on scientific
endeavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN C L COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, find it astounding that throughout the recent debate on science
education I have heard no forthright declaration that a dwindling interest
in the sciences is against the interests of society. Equally astonishing is
the lack of recognition of the inconsistency this represents in a society so
heavily dependent on the fruits of scientific endeavour.
More young people than ever before are rejecting science education at
A-level. Consequently, fewer are opting for science degrees unless obliged
to do so by the unavailability of places on arts courses.
Much of the solution lies in how science is presented to young people. The
quality of science teaching must be improved, and the portrayal of the role
of science in society must be heightened to inspire young people to rise to
its exciting challenges. Health, hunger, protecting the environment and
employment are just some of the issues to which science holds the key.
The chemicals industry is a major wealth creator that depends on a supply of
top-quality scientists. But other sectors, too, are major employers of
science graduates.
Above all, a wider awareness of science will create better informed
consumers which, in turn, will spur UK science-based industry to even
greater achievements.

Sir, Rupert Morris's article on good business writing ('Clearly, concisely

Answering a question on whether his branch could maintain a central registry
of relationships (customers) for an American Banking Group, the manager
started to say 'we can'. He managed to stop four-fifths of the way through
this clear answer and said instead 'it is within the limitations of our
defined capability'. Fortunately, I had got the gist of his reply from his

FT  28 AUG 93 / Dangerous times for Pepsi and Jackson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE pop star Michael Jackson has intensified south-east Asia's cola wars and
raised doubts that he will be able to hang on to his lucrative contract with
Pepsi-Cola, which is sponsoring his world tour.
Pepsi says its sales in Thailand have risen 16 per cent following two months
of promotions associated with the singer-dancer's visit to Bangkok this
week. Pepsi has a slight edge over Coca-Cola in the Dollars 500m (Pounds
338m) Thai soft drinks market.
But Pepsi executives were left biting their nails when US police launched an
investigation into child abuse allegations against Mr Jackson, which his
lawyers denied. Reuters yesterday reported authorities as saying they had no
evidence to support the allegations.
Mr Jackson finally gave his second concert in Thailand to great acclaim
yesterday after two postponements, which had infuriated fans. His doctor
said he was dehydrated after his first - and typically energetic - concert
on Tuesday in Bangkok's sweltering heat.
Coca-Cola pounced, hurriedly buying space in the English-language newspapers
favoured by Thai yuppies. 'Dehydrated?' the advertisements asked yesterday.
' ..There's always Coke.'
Pepsi, whose Thai office switchboards play Michael Jackson hits to callers
on hold, yesterday put a brave face on the dehydration saga. 'When you're
number two, I guess you to try to do everything,' said Mr Tony Illsley,
president of Pepsi-Cola International in the Asia-Pacific region.
However, a Pepsi spokesman in the US yesterday struck a more ominous note:
'Because of the seriousness of the allegations and all the sensitivities
involved, we're proceeding responsibly. We are following the investigation
closely and our plans will depend on how it evolves.'
Jackson's advertisements of the early 1980s are considered the most
successful soft drink commercials ever made.
The bad publicity will also further depress executives at Sony, disappointed
with sales of Jackson's latest album, Dangerous, which was released as part
of the estimated Dollars 65m contract he signed with the Japanese
entertainment and electronics group in 1991. US sales have fallen short of
expectations.
US advertisers tend to shy away from scandal. Pepsi dropped its 'Like a
Prayer' commercials in the US after Madonna, the singer, created a furore
with the video of the song of the same name. Similarly, the Florida Orange
Citrus Commission decided to pull its advertisements featuring Burt Reynolds
after the film star filed for divorce, and Earvin 'Magic' Johnson lost his
Converse athletic shoes spot and other endorsements after he announced he
had been infected with the virus that causes Aids.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Boost for spending on south Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government is to accelerate about L10,000bn (Pounds 4.22bn) of
spending on public works to create jobs and limit rising unemployment
because of the recession. More than a third of the investments will go to
the depressed south, where unemployment exceeds 21 per cent.
Although the spending has been welcomed, it largely represents money which
has already been allocated in existing budget plans.
With fears of at least 200,000 more job losses by the end of the year, which
would take average unemployment to more than 12 per cent, some economists
fear that the latest steps may not be enough to fight the recession.
Most of the money will go on transport infrastructure and new buildings.
About L5,000bn a year will be invested in improving rail services in 1993
and 1994. Ministers hope work on the new high-speed train project can begin
by December.
Construction for the network, which will eventually link Italy's biggest
cities, will begin with the Rome-Naples stretch to provide jobs in a region
of high unemployment.
In all, the six-year scheme, which will cost almost L24,000bn, is expected
to create about 50,000 jobs.
Meanwhile, L7,500bn has been allocated to improve and update the motorway
network over the next five years. The bulk will go on a new highway to take
pressure off the overcrowded stretch between Florence and Bologna. The
projects should create about 14,000 jobs.

211m) in assets each against five former executives, and against the heirs
of Mr Raul Gardini, the group's former chairman, who killed himself last
month.
The group's new management, imposed by creditor banks this year, may try to
extend the legal action against other former managers if shareholders in
Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary agree at a meeting next Monday.
The case revealed a deepening split within the Ferruzzi family, which
controls the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, and Mr Gardini's
heirs. While family members blamed the irregularities in group accounts
largely on him, his heirs claim the difficulties arose after he left in
1991.
On Tuesday, Ferfin shareholders will vote on plans to slash the nominal
value of shares to L5 from L1,000. It is then proposed the shares be
consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to restore the nominal value.
The first top legal figure to be probed in Italy's graft scandal has been
formally warned he faces investigation over alleged abuse of office,
judicial sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Milan
The notification was sent to Diego Curto, vice-president of Milan's civil
court and head of its commercial division, by magistrates in the
neighbouring northern city of Brescia.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Bonn plays down Kohl doubts over farm deal

GERMAN officials spent yesterday back-tracking on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
apparent endorsement this week of French demands that a hard-fought US-EC
farm trade agreement finalised late last year should be renegotiated.
But French officials welcomed what they described as a turning point in
Germany's stance on agricultural exports. They said it could end France's
isolation in international trade negotiations.
Both governments confirmed talks would be held between senior trade
officials next week in Paris to seek a common position on farm trade
exports.
In Washington, trade officials found it hard to believe the German
government had genuinely shifted its position. Mr Dean Kleckner, president
of the American Farm Bureau, commented: 'If this is really true, it could
mean the end of the Gatt talks. But there is apparently disagreement about
what he (Mr Kohl) meant.'
After meeting French prime minister Edouard Balladur on Thursday, Mr Kohl
said that, like France, Germany had 'problems with the agricultural part of
negotiations, with the Blair House agreement', and needed to find 'a
compromise acceptable for everyone'.
France, under pressure from a powerful agricultural lobby, has strongly
opposed last year's EC-US Blair House agreement aimed at paving the way for
a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of international trade talks.
French officials said they were convinced Germany was prepared to reopen
negotiations on the agreement to avert a European crisis on the issue. 'It
is a significant shift,' said one official.
But Mr Norbert Schafer, the German government spokesman, insisted Germany
was not calling for formal renegotiation of the Blair House agreement. The
chancellor's office said the coming talks would bring clarity on demands
made on the French side.
However, senior officials in the Bonn Agriculture Ministry reiterated Mr
Kohl's words that Germany had a few problems with the Blair House agreement.
They said Germany would not oppose renegotiations between the European
Commission and the US on some specific issues. However, the whole agreement
was not put into question, they said.
The Commission, which negotiated the Blair House deal on behalf of the EC,
had no official response to Mr Kohl's remarks. But nor, unofficially, was
Brussels prepared to interpret them as a real shift in Germany's position.
France's principal objection is to the agreement's provision for a 21 per
cent cut in subsidised food exports over six years, which it says will
cripple its lucrative cereals trade.
Mr Kohl last October backed French calls for a strong 'rebalancing' clause
in any farm trade agreement - meaning restraints on US cereals substitutes
equal to cuts in EC cereals subsidies and exports. Yet it is difficult for
Bonn to pursue this now, since its proposed alternative draft was inserted
verbatim into the Blair House deal.
In Washington, a senior US trade official said: 'It is unclear to us at this
time whether these statements mean that the EC is considering a change in
its support for Blair House, but obviously this would cause grave concerns.
'The EC must recognise that Blair House was itself a painful compromise, and
that many US farm groups would like even deeper cuts in EC subsidies,
Reopening this issue poses the serious risk of unraveling the Uruguay Round
and reviving the oilseeds dispute. We feel certain the EC will live up to
its agreements.'

FT  28 AUG 93 / Spain to open up airport services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN has countered accusations by leading airlines of monopoly practices at
its national airports by telling the European Commission it will deregulate
the ground-handling services that lie at the centre of the controversy.
Aena, the Madrid-based airport authority, said yesterday it had told the EC
Directorate-General for Competition of a programme, to start next year, that
will loosen the current control that the state-owned airline Iberia
exercises over passenger, ramp and cargo handling at domestic airports.
In a parallel letter to the EC, Iberia rejected allegations of 'abusive
behaviour' in its provision of ground services. A group of European
airlines, including British Airways, KLM and SAS, had earlier complained to
the Commission that Spain's national carrier levied excessively high
tariffs, discriminated in favour of domestic airlines, discouraged other
airlines from self-handling and provided inadequate services.
The complaints of high handling costs, also levelled against Milan and
Frankfurt airports, come against a background of unprecedented losses among
European carriers in the wake of the EC's 'open skies' policies.
Aena has informed the EC that it will appoint second ground handling agents
at the airports of Las Palmas and Tenerife in the Canary Islands next year,
and at Madrid's international airport as soon as new cargo facilities there
are completed. The national airport authority added that additional agents
would be appointed by 1997 at all domestic airports handling more than 1m
passengers a year.
Rejecting the complaints made by fellow European carriers, Iberia said the
existing tariff structure for ground services at domestic airports was laid
down by Aena and it was the airport authority, not Iberia, which authorised
other airlines to provide their own handling services.
The Spanish airline claimed the tariffs were cost-justified and did not
imply excessive profits. Iberia said the complaints of a deficient service
were based on events in 1991 when the airline suffered a series of big
industrial disputes and an overhaul of Spain's air traffic control network.

<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, yesterday added the Canary Islands to a list of
eight export markets where it is recalling beer bottles, but it removed
Prince Edward Island in Canada, saying the suspect bottles had not been
shipped there.
The brewer announced on Thursday night that it was recalling more than 3m of
its famous green beer bottles from a small number of export markets,
including Britain, because of fears that a fault in the neck of the bottles
could cause small glass chips to fall into the beer.
Other affected countries are Austria, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel
and Sweden.
Heineken, which exports to 150 countries, said the 3m bottles were part of a
17m batch of potentially flawed 33cl bottles produced by Dutch bottle maker
Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, majority-owned by the French food group BSN.
It said some of the bottles might have already been bought by customers.
A second Dutch brewer, United Dutch Breweries, said yesterday it was also
recalling 200,000 bottles of beer after reports of splinters in some
batches. It said all stocks of Royal Dutch Post Horn imported lager in 25-ml
bottles were being withdrawn in Britain, the only country where it is sold.
The company's bottles are also made by Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, which said
it had warned one other customer of the risk of defects.
Heineken said it held the bottle maker responsible for the problem and would
seek damages to cover the costs of the recall operation.
A Heineken spokeswoman said the extent of the damages claim was not yet
known: 'Our priority now is warning consumers in the countries to which the
beer was shipped.'
Heineken said tests showed that the problem of glass slivers could arise in
roughly 1 per cent of the bottles produced in the batch of 17m bottles over
the past two weeks.
Heineken's shares dropped by 3 per cent when trading began in Amsterdam
yesterday but closed slightly higher.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND has devalued the zloty by 8 per cent against a basket of currencies
of trading partners, in an attempt to boost exports. This represents a 7.5
per cent devaluation against the dollar and 8.5 per cent against the D-Mark,
Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw.
The move comes as convertible currency reserves held by the central bank
have slipped from Dollars 4.3bn at the beginning of the year to Dollars
3.5bn (Pounds 2.4bn) at present, as the trade deficit in the first six
months of the year has grown to Dollars 1.1bn.
The monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation rate first introduced in October 1991
is also to be reduced from a monthly 1.8 per cent to 1.6 per cent.
Poland's last big devaluation was in February 1992.

FT  28 AUG 93 / World Bank approves greater transparency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD Bank executive directors have approved a new information policy that
will make many more of its documents available to the public.
Project appraisal reports, summaries of internal evaluations, country
economic reports and sectoral policy papers will in most cases be published,
usually only with the consent of the country involved and after the bank's
board has acted on them.
Critics of the Washington-based international development bank, especially
environmental groups which have long criticised it for financing projects
such as dams and power stations in the developing world, still have vigorous
complaints about the new policy, especially as it steps back in some regards
from a draft circulated a few weeks earlier. 'It's totally inadequate,' said
Ms Lori Udall, of the Environmental Defence Fund.
Bank officials insist, however, that the policy is a genuine attempt to
achieve greater transparency. A senior official said: 'We are doing more
than any international organisation has ever done to open up. We asked the
question, not what can we get away with, but what should be properly do.'
Many environmentalists agree that it will, in fact, take transparency a step
further. 'It is clearly better than nothing,' acknowledged one persistent
critic.
Intentionally and unintentionally, the World Bank is already far less
secretive than the International Monetary Fund, its sister institution; even
supposedly confidential documents circulate widely in Washington.
One significant step in the new policy is the creation of a public
information centre, to open next January, which will greatly ease public
access in the borrowing countries, where information is most scarce.
Critics of the new policy say too many documents will only be published
after the bank has taken its decision, too late for the public to influence
the debate.
Environmentalists are particularly harsh about the Project Information
Document, a new summary intended to give early information on loans the Bank
is considering. A sample PID circulated this month did not even disclose
where the shrimp fisheries it discussed were to be located, although this
was rectified in an embarrassed addendum last week.
It will not be clear for several weeks whether the new policy will go far
enough to forestall the US Congress's threat to withhold approval for some
of the US's Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.5bn) contribution to the International
Development Association, the World Bank unit which makes low-interest loans
to the poorest countries.

Most of the 17m bottles were stopped before they left the brewery or reached
export markets, but Heineken wants the return of 3m bottles, some of which
may have already been bought by customers.
Bottles shipped to other markets, including the US, where Heineken is the
leading imported beer and is sold in 35cl bottles, were not affected.
The Dutch brewer said it held the bottle maker responsible for the problem
and would seek damages to cover the costs of the recall operation.
A Heineken spokeswoman said the extent of the damages claim was not yet

Heineken said tests showed that the problem of glass slivers could arise in
roughly 1 per cent of the bottles produced in the batch of 17m bottles over
the past two weeks. If glass slivers were ingested, only 1 to 2 per cent of
beer drinkers would develop stomach problems, Heineken said, basing its
estimate on medical advice which it had received.
Heineken's shares dropped by 3 per cent when trading began in Amsterdam
yesterday but closed slightly higher.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Fyodorov sacking demanded: Piqued Russian parliament
overturns Yeltsin's budget veto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday called for the head of President Boris
Yeltsin's radical finance minister, Mr Boris Fyodorov, and overturned the
Russian leader's veto of its inflationary budget.
A resolution demanding the removal of one of the main architects of Mr
Yeltsin's economic reforms was passed in a fit of parliamentary pique after
Mr Fyodorov failed to reappear in parliament after the deputies'
lunch-break.
'We need to remove Fyodorov and appoint instead a person who really cares
about Russia's national interests,' said Mr Veniamin Sokolov, the
conservative parliamentary leader who tabled the non-binding resolution for
his removal.
Earlier, Mr Fyodorov had asked them to drop their alternative budget, which
would double, with 'catastrophic consequences', the deficit planned by the
government to more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product. 'History and
the people will not forgive us if such a budget is approved,' he had told
deputies, warning that their free-spending recipes had already failed in
neighbouring Ukraine.
Mr Yeltsin has already said he will instruct the government to ignore
parliament's budget plans. 'Everything will depend on a political decision
by the president - whether we follow what they have planned here,' Mr
Fyodorov said as he left parliament. Although Mr Yeltsin managed to trick
deputies into altering the title of the budget law, lawyers in parliament
said it was uncertain that this would give him a constitutional right to
veto it a second time as a different piece of legislation.
Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for
foreign economic relations, said Russia was unlikely to meet its October 1
deadline for agreeing a standby agreement with the International Monetary
Fund. This in turn could complicate the continuation of a debt rescheduling
agreement, which stipulated that such an agreement should be reached without
specifying what would happen if it was not.
However, the parliament and president enjoyed a rare meeting of minds after
he endorsed parliamentary amendments outlawing 'foreign missionary activity'
in Russia. The law means that foreign evangelists such as Billy Graham and
various religious sects will be unable to advertise, or publicly seek
converts, after complaints from the Russian Orthodox Church and others that
the population is too vulnerable to material inducements for joining such
organisations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday told his war-time assembly
that the Geneva peace plan should be rejected in its current form but left
the door open for a settlement by adding that the proposal could serve as a
basis for further negotiations.
The announcement came as Bosnian Serb leaders sought to persuade their own
assembly to accept the peace plan, ahead of a resumption of the peace talks,
scheduled to start in Geneva on Monday.
As members of the Moslem-led Bosnian parliament, army and community gathered
in Sarajevo's shell-scarred Holiday Inn, Mr Izetbegovic said he wished to
continue the Geneva talks, but he reiterated opposition to the plan's
failure to reverse 'ethnic cleansing'.
Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, insisted that his land-locked republic must
receive access to Neum, a fishing village on the Adriatic coast currently
under Croat control, adding that his government would also need strong
guarantees of international support before fully endorsing the plan.
The map, put forward last week by international mediators Lord Owen and
Thorvald Stoltenberg, gives the Serbs much of eastern Bosnia, which was
mostly Moslem before the war, leaving the government control over three
enclaves proclaimed UN 'safe areas'.
The Bosnian assembly announced it would postpone its vote until today,
apparently waiting for the results of the Serb 'parliament' meeting just 10
miles away in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold.
In an aim to push the plan through their assembly, Bosnian Serb leaders held
their second day of closed meetings. They were expected to respond with a
provisional 'yes'.
Bosnian Croat deputies are due to cast their vote today after meetings in
Grude, western Hercegovina, which borders Croatia.
A United Nations aid convoy to the besieged southern Bosnian town of Mostar
remained trapped for a second day yesterday, after Moslem demonstrators
refused to let the convoy leave the city. The Moslems, who had been trapped
in the eastern sections of the city for more than two months by fierce
fighting between the Moslem-led Bosnian army and Croat forces, said they
feared that if the UN left the Croats would launch a new assault on the
town.
Meanwhile, in a bid to keep pace with astronomical inflation, the National
Bank of Yugoslavia yesterday issued a Dinar 1bn banknote - worth a mere
USDollars 3 at the current exchange rate of 330m dinars to the dollar.
Mr Sali Berisha, the president of Albania, yesterday condemned recent
killings along the border of Albania and Macedonia and called on Macedonia
to protect the rights of the ethnic Albanian minorities living there.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Crackdown on easy cash for Japan's big spenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S commercial banks are about to cramp the style of the country's big
spenders by limiting withdrawals from cash dispensers.
The move will be a blow to those who are coy about using credit cards, and
debt-collecting gangsters who generally do not accept them.
The country's leading 11 commercial banks have agreed in principle to impose
a daily limit of Y2m (Pounds 12,900) on their machines, still very large by
international standards.
The proposed new ceiling is a response to rising bank card fraud and concern
that small banks could be threatened if customers continue to enjoy
unlimited access to cash.
In contrast to the standard Pounds 200 withdrawal limit from British cash
machines, at present the only limit on the largesse of Japanese dispensers
is often the size of your bank account, or your overdraft facility. Some
banks currently have a daily limit of Y5m, while others have no limit.
The Y2m ceiling will be an inconvenience in a country that runs on
large-denomination notes. When a provincial governor was arrested several
weeks ago for alleged bribe-taking, prosecutors claimed he was given Y30m
cash in a shopping bag.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather of Japanese politics now on trial for
alleged tax evasion, has said he often received large amounts of cash from
construction companies or 'loyal supporters'. Prosecutors found millions of
yen in his bedroom.
Police believe bank dispenser machines are used by companies giving
politicians large donations because they do not have to deal directly with
bank staff.
Japanese bankers fear that a bank failure could prompt depositors to rush to
another institution's automated teller to withdraw funds. Banks bruised by
the sharp fall in asset values in Japan over the past three years are
increasingly fragile because of the continuing downturn in the economy,
particularly in regional areas.
Regional banks are linked to a 90,000-machine automated teller system, which
has a day-after settlement policy exposing all banks to a run on a weaker
bank. One Japanese bank said: 'We want people to have enough cash, but we
also trying to improve our risk management.'
The Ministry of Finance says no bank will fail. However, without
intervention by the ministry and the Bank of Japan, three small institutions
would have collapsed in the past year. The new limits indicate that even
Japanese banks are conceding that the country's banking system is vulnerable
to failure.
The move to limit withdrawals is also in response to a 44.7 per cent rise in
reported offences involving cards, credit and cash in the past two years.
'We don't want to inconvenience people who like cash, but changes in
Japanese society and in the banking system have made it necessary for us to
think about new limits,' a bank manager said.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Bugatti buys Lotus group in Pounds 30m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUGATTI INTERNATIONAL is to take over Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker
and automotive engineering group, bringing together two of the most famous
racing marques of the European motor industry.
The Bugatti holding company, registered in Luxembourg after being formed in
the late 1980s to revive the Bugatti marque, is understood to be paying
about Pounds 30m to acquire Group Lotus from General Motors of the US.
Bugatti International's main operating company is Bugatti Automobili, which
started production in Italy last year of a L550m (Pounds 232,000) supercar,
the EB110, the first Bugatti to be made since the early 1950s.
The Bugatti name was made in the 1920s with a string of racing victories,
and the design of many classic cars, including the Bugatti Royale. One 1931
Royale fetched a then record car auction price of Pounds 5.5m in November
1987 at Christie's in London.
Group Lotus, founded in the early 1950s by Colin Chapman, one of the most
creative post-war designers of racing cars, made its name in the 1960s and
1970s winning six drivers' and seven constructors' world championships.
Group Lotus was acquired by GM in 1986 for Pounds 22.7m. It has run up heavy
losses in recent years and the US carmaker has been searching for a buyer
for months after the breakdown of talks on a management buy-out.
Group Lotus suffered its biggest setback last year when it was forced by
rapidly mounting losses to end production of the Elan sports car after less
than 2 1/2 years. The Elan cost Lotus a write-off of Pounds 24.4m.
The company acquired yesterday by Bugatti has no connection with Team Lotus,
the Formula One motor racing operation.
Bugatti is taking over the entire Group Lotus business including its
engineering consulting and car production operations based at Hethel, near
Norwich, as well as Lotus's assets in the US, where it sells through a
network of 59 dealers.
Mr Romano Artioli, president of Bugatti Automobili, said Lotus engineering
would be used to accelerate development of Bugatti's planned EB112 sports
saloon, due to be launched in 1995.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets surge to new peaks: FT-SE 100 breaks 3,100 as
European equities defy Bundesbank rates stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON SHARES joined other European stock markets yesterday in soaring to
record levels, in defiance of the Bundesbank's refusal on Thursday to cut
interest rates.
In London the FT-SE 100 index broke through 3,100, closing 21.4 points
higher at 3,100.6, two weeks after breaking through the 3,000 barrier for
the first time.
The Paris CAC-40 index closed at a record 2,183.88, up 10.27 points. The
Madrid and Lisbon bourses both reached their high points for the year. The
German DAX index closed 3.45 points up at 1,904.60, only 4 per cent short of
the peak reached in April 1990 in the euphoria following the fall of the
Berlin Wall.
Sterling closed at DM2.50, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day and down 3 3/4
pfennigs on the week. In late New York trading sterling was trading at
DM2.4999.
In London, analysts attributed the performance of equities to confidence in
UK economic recovery, encouraged by the Confederation of British Industry
which raised to 3 per cent its growth forecast for gross domestic product
next year.
Equities were also driven by strong gains in domestic bond markets, as
investors remained confident that inflation would stay low and falling
interest rates in continental Europe would allow UK rates to be cut further.
'It would take something very negative and totally unexpected to push this
market down and hold it there,' said Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse
Tilney.
'We're seeing increasing confirmation of recovery. The rally will continue,'
he added.
'Interest rates are coming down across Europe, and the only question is the
timing,' said Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm
of Societe Generale.
Analysts said the UK market may have already factored into share prices a
possible reduction in UK base rates to 5 per cent from the present 6 per
cent. Some suggested that rates could be cut to 4 per cent, perhaps by the
year-end.
Trading volume in UK equities has risen this month to record daily levels
for 1993, with US investors particularly heavy buyers this week.
The new record underscores a remarkable revival in the City's fortunes. This
year, as a result of rising equity markets and turbulent foreign exchange
markets, London's trading houses have enjoyed record profits.
This month BZW, the broking and investment arm of Barclays Bank, announced
half-year profits almost doubled at Pounds 234m. Union Bank of Switzerland,
which owns the leading London stockbrokers UBS Phillips and Drew, reported
that half-year profits from trading were up 144 per cent at SFr1.55bn
(Pounds 700m).
'I think there is a mood change in the City,' said one market strategist.
But relief is mixed with sobriety. There is little suggestion that London's
dealers are about to resume the spending spree on which many embarked in the
mid-1980s.
Porsche's largest UK distributor, in Chiswick, west London, might be
recording a five-fold increase in car sales this August over last, but there
is a much more cautious mood.
The management of the Altruist champagne bar in the City's Bow Lane said
that this August had been better than last, but attributed this mainly to
the weather.
Nearby at the Bow Lane Colony Wine bar, manager Gill Owen said there was
less talk of recession, but people were still ordering house wine at parties
instead of champagne.
'It used to be that as long as it was cold and fizzy people would drink
champagne by the case,' she said.
The more sombre mood is blamed on the fear of unemployment. Stockbrokers
said there had been redundancies in their industry as recently as three
months ago. Last month the Institute of Management and Research, the body
representing Britain's 3,100 investment analysts, said it would defer its
Pounds 81 annual subscription fee for unemployed members.
There is little evidence so far that employment in the City is recovering.
Mr Peter Rees, City planning officer at the Corporation of London, estimated
that five years ago some 320,000 people worked in the financial district.
Now, he said, the figure was approaching 250,000. The recession and the
introduction of new technologies were to blame.
Personnel executives at City broking houses reported a slight increase in
movement of staff between firms.
However, most institutions are expected to be cautious about repeating their
mistake of the 1980s in increasing overheads that could prove difficult to
sustain.
'Institutions will be a lot more wary about handing out ridiculous sums of
money,' a personnel manager said.

FT  28 AUG 93 / Founder of Homes Assured is found guilty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUNDER of Homes Assured, the company set up to help council house
tenants buy their homes under the government's right to buy legislation, was
found guilty yesterday of two charges of deception.
A Southwark Crown Court jury, sitting in an annexe of the Old Bailey,
returned guilty verdicts on two charges of procuring execution of a security
by deception against Mr Anthony Dobson, the company's 60-year-old founder
and former board director.
Mr Keith Woodward, another board member, was convicted on one charge of
furnishing false information. The jury is continuing its deliberations today
on joint charges of fraudulent trading against Mr Dobson, Mr Woodward and Mr
Michael Robinson, the former managing director of Homes Assured.
More than 100 witnesses were called by the Crown in its case against the
three directors on charges which arose out of the company's collapse four
years ago with debts of Pounds 10.7m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Courtaulds Dollars 75m lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 28th August 1993) appended to this article.
COURTAULDS, the textiles group, said that the Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.6m)
lawsuit filed by Flamemaster Corporation, of the US, is 'without foundation'
and that it was 'not aware of any circumstances which could rise to the
claims allegedly being advanced by Flamemaster'.
Courtaulds Aerospace, a subsidiary and the subject of the lawsuit had '
fully performed all its duties pursuant to its agreements with Flamemaster'.
Flamemaster said it had filed the lawsuit for alleged breach of contract,
unfair trade practices and fraud. It alleges that Courtaulds attempted to
and actually monopolised interstate and export trade and commerce in the
production, distribution and sale of high adhesion compounds.
CORRECTION
Courtaulds, the chemicals group, is being sued by Flamemaster Corp. of the
US for Dollars 75m. Courtaulds has said the suit was 'without foundation'.
Yesterday's edition reported incorrectly that Courtaulds Textiles was the
defendant.

first-time contribution

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHINDLER Holding, the world's second largest elevator manufacturer, said
its operating revenues in the first half were up 4.3 per cent to SFr2.2bn
(Dollars 1.48bn) due mainly to the inclusion for the first time of its Also
computing trading subsidiary.
The group said operating profit in the full year was likely to be similar to
last year's SFr154.9m, in spite of continuing unfavourable market
conditions.
Net income would be significantly higher because of financial earnings.
Revenues from elevators and escalators were down 1.1 per cent to SFr1.9bn,
while rolling stock sales were flat at SFr137m. Also contributed SFr114m to
revenues.
Leu Holding, a private banking unit of the CS Holding financial services
group built around Credit Suisse, has reported more than doubled
consolidated net income of SFr92m in the first half.
Leu said all divisions contributed to the jump, with profits from trading
soaring 89 per cent to SFr89m. Commission income advanced 26 per cent to
SFr123m and net interest income rose 17 per cent to SFr134m.
Expenses were up 7 per cent to SFr182m, with the result that pre-tax profits
advanced 60 per cent to SFr170m. Leu said the number of borrowers in
difficulty was still rising, so it raised its bad loan provisions by 20 per
cent to SFr36m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Uncertainty on return of Shonekan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE triumph of hope over experience may be the kindest assessment of Chief
Ernest Shonekan's decision to accept the job as leader of Nigeria's interim
government. The 57-year-old former industrialist and lawyer took on much the
same duties when sworn in last January as chairman of the country's
transitional administration, promising to revive Nigeria's lapsed structural
adjustment programme.
Eight months later the economy is deep in crisis and few if any of the
promises were implemented.
Mr Shonekan, one of the country's most respected businessmen, had been
seconded from the chairmanship of United Africa Company Nigeria, the
Unilever subsidiary, and drew heavily on the advice of the business
community. The result was the 1993 budget - a ringing reaffirmation of the
necessity of reform and the overriding need for prudent management.
'We must make some hard choices now to preserve the gains of the structural
adjustment programme and restore some good measure of stability to the
economy,' said Mr Shonekan. But his administration failed to tackle
fundamental issues notably managing the exchange rate, reducing the budget
deficit and cutting subsidies on domestic petrol.
Hopes that Nigeria would reach an agreement with the IMF by August, which
would allow rescheduling of the country's Dollars 34bn external debt proved
to be wishful thinking.
Within weeks it became apparent that he lacked the authority to implement
tough decisions. Senior officials complained that power continued to lie in
the hands of President Ibrahim Babangida and the military.
Today, as in January, the challenge facing the new administration remains
that of budgetary reform, and reducing a fiscal deficit averaging 7.7 per
cent of GDP since the structural adjustment programme was launched seven
years ago.
The new administration will also have to tackle what is perhaps the most
sensitive issue of all: monitoring the export earnings of nearly 2m barrels
of oil a day. As much as 200,000 barrels a day are not properly accounted
for. Some of the proceeds are diverted into special accounts for military
expenditure, the Ajaokuta steel project or spending on the yet to be
completed federal capital of Abuja, and an undisclosed amount used as
patronage.
Will the soldiers back the chief this time round? Mr Shonekan can point to
one encouraging indicator: the decision earlier this week to raise domestic
fuel prices ten-fold. But the government will be expected to put the budget
blueprint into practice before agreement with the IMF can be reached. Such a
track record would require at least six months before credibility is
established. By then Nigeria, would be preparing for the re-run of
presidential elections. At a time when continuity in policymaking is
essential, Nigeria seems set for a further period of uncertainty.

FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and the Lopez espionage affair: VW dossier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen's
headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary
day in the history of the German car industry. Officials in Bonn did not
hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage
which could ensue from the battle 'between two great German car
companies'.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one
German judge said could be 'potentially the biggest-ever case of
industrial espionage'.
JOSE IGNACIO LOPEZ DE ARRIORTUA
VW production director
The metamorphosis of Lopez into Superlopez, as he is known in his native
Basque country, started in 1980 when he left Firestone to join General
Motors in Spain. At 39, the workaholic engineer was able to test what has
become the core tenet in his management philosophy: the systematic
elimination from manufacturing of all processes which did not add value.
In 1986, as purchasing director for GM Spain, he decided that in-house
cost-saving methods should also be applied to parts suppliers. He would go
into their factories and offer them advice.
As one was to note: 'When Lopez tells us he will offer us a hand, I always
think of my throat.' His transformation into 'the strangler' and his rapid
rise through GM were under way.
He joined Adam Opel's main board in Germany in 1987, was appointed central
purchasing chief for GM Europe a year later, and moved to the parent board
in Detroit in January, 1992.
In the meantime, he was combining all his accumulated knowledge and
experience in Plateau 6, his planned 'dream' super-lean production plant, in
which cars would be assembled from modules in less than half the time taken
in the best Japanese works.
He even had a site and outside funding for Plateau 6 in his birthplace in
Amorebieta. GM demurred and lost Superlopez to Volkswagen.
*****
FERDINAND PIECH
VW chairman
'I was born a domesticated pig but live the life of a wild boar,' Piech says
of himself. It is his way of saying that, despite his birthright of
privilege and immense wealth, he live like a normal man: 'High living holds
no joy for me.'
He is the grandson of VW 'Beetle' inventor Ferdinand Porsche, and started
his career in the family luxury sports car company, of which he owns 10 per
cent.
The 56-year-old engineer is father of 12 children. But he reserves his
pride, in public at least, for his technical achievements.
Refused the chairmanship of Porsche, he joined Audi, the VW subsidiary, in
1972 as head of special development projects. He was responsible for the
brand's innovative integrated passenger security system, Procon-ten, and the
development of permanent four-wheel drive.
Piech became Audi chairman in 1988 and raised the profile of the marque to
match that of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. He also made a reputation as a loner
and a hard cost-cutter. Audi's return on sales rose from almost nil to 6 per
cent, and the company became VW's most profitable subsidiary.
In charge of the group since January this year, he claims already to have
DM8.7bn-worth of cost-savings 'in my pocket'. He says DM700m of that is due
to the work of Lopez 'my soul mate.'
*****
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND BRIEFING
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1992, NOVEMBER      Piech meets Lopez, recently-appointed vice-president
                 for procurement for GM in Detroit and former head
           of purchasing at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
       Piech tries to persuade Lopez to join him at VW.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, JANUARY       GM 'puts on ice' Lopez's plan to build 'dream
          factory' in his Basque homeland,
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FEBRUARY            Lopez meets a VW director to discuss 'possible'
            employment terms. Lower Saxony government, which
     owns a stake in VW, says Lopez will join VW next
month; he denies this.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH               Lopez signs VW contract and flies to inform GM in
              Detriot. VW announces appointment, but, after
    discussions with GM, Lopez agrees to stay on there.
GM wants Lopez to sign five-year contract, but,
according to a VW executive, he is 'very unhappy'.                     He
flies to a meeting with Piech, is taken to a VW                     board
meeting and formally appointed. In Detroit, GM                     searches
the offices of Lopez, and a close                     colleague's; GM
executive signs affidavit saying                     none of the secret and
confidential documents GM                     believes are in the men's
possession was found. Six                     GM/Opel executives also jump
ship, turning up at VW                     without, according to Lopez,
contracts or job                     offers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
APRIL               GM writes to Lopez seeking unequivocal statement on
                GM/Opel documents it says are missing. Lopez replies
             that neither he nor colleagues took any secret
    documents nor had any now.                     Opel asks public
prosecutors to investigate possible                     theft and industrial
espionage.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY
                Lopez denies bringing any secret documents to VW,
          but prosecutors say they have enough information to
      launch a criminal investigation.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JULY                US Justice Department starts own investigation.
            Lopez appears to contradict earlier claim he never
       took any documents but tells board any such
documents were destroyed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUGUST              Opel welcomes 'belated' admission documents had been
                 destroyed but points out that investigations also
           involve allegations of theft, fraud and perjury.
    German economics minister Rexrodt holds a series of
meetings with heads of Opel and VW, but says this is                     for
information, and not mediation.                     VW appoints auditors to
carry out investigation.                     Police raid eight locations,
including VW HQ at                     Wolfsburg, in search of evidence over
industrial                     espionage allegations.

FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: M&amp;S advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mixed performance in the stores sector saw shares in Kingfisher battling
and Marks and Spencer gathering plaudits. Kingfisher lost 4 at 665p after
fighting back from a day's low of 660p.
Some market-watchers blamed fallout from recurring DIY fears after Do It
All's recent reported performance, but others saw the stock embarking on a
rocky rebalancing act at the end of a good run. Interest rate disappointment
in Europe, especially concerning Kingfisher's French interests, cannot have
helped the stock.
M&amp;S proved favourite of the sector, and was said to have attracted
significant US interest in a turnover of 4.6m. The shares climbed 8 to 373p.
One analyst said the squeeze in M&amp;S shares added to their strength. Another
put some of their performance down to the fact that the stock often acts as
a proxy for the sector, and if investors want to increase their exposure to
stores then M&amp;S is often the recipient of their money.
The oil majors were again among the FT-SE 100's best performers, with the
recent upsurge of interest in the oil sector once more being focused on the
two biggest of the oil stocks, BP and Shell.
Dealers said US institutions returned in force to buy the two stocks, in
spite of the early uncertainty displayed by Wall Street. Goldman Sachs was
said to have been among the most aggressive buyers of the oils, which were
additionally boosted by an acute stock shortage.
UK oil analysts said the main thrust of the US buying argument for the UK
oil stocks was that they look cheap on a cash flow basis compared with their
US counterparts.
BP moved up 3 1/2 more to 321p on continuing heavy turnover of 9.8m shares.
The stock has risen from 298p since the start of the week. Shell put on 2
1/2 at 674p on 2.9m traded, with oil specialists noting large-scale
switching into Shell from Royal Dutch, citing the yield argument.
Enterprise Oil continued to move ahead, adding 3 at 451p. Lasmo came under
pressure at the outset, slipping to 142p in the wake of some determined
profit-taking, but began to edge forward later in the session, eventually
standing a net penny ahead at 146p. Turnover in the stock was 2.8m shares,
well down from recent levels.
Calor Group, a strong market all week following a buy note issued by Hoare
Govett, ended 9 higher at 274p, its best level since June 1990. Hardy Oil
appreciated 7 to 171p, still boosted by recent broker visits and buy
recommendations.
Among the second-liners, exploration hopes lifted Pict Petroleum by 8 to
126p.
The utilities areas of the market made good progress early in the session,
with institutions said to have chased the regional electricity stocks,
generators and water issues higher amid hopes that any early cuts in
European interest rates would continue to focus investors' minds on the high
yields available in those areas.
The absence of a cut in German rates, however, was the trigger for a
widespread bout of profit-taking in the utilities, which generally closed
with losses on the day.
Severn Trent was one of the water sector's most prominent performers early
in the session, the shares moving up to 553p at one point after a strong buy
recommendation issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. CLL's Mr
Robert Giles said: 'The high quality of the underlying businesses and robust
financial position make Severn Trent the best value of the major water
stocks.'
The stock turned tail later with the rest of the market and closed unaltered
at 541p after good turnover of 1.5m. The other water issues in the FT-SE 100
ended down on the day, with Thames 3 off at 539p, North West 5 lower at 515p
and Anglian 2 easier at 527p.
The leading drug stocks were among the market's laggards, suffering from
sustained selling pressure on both sides of the Atlantic after their recent
strong gains.
Glaxo, heavily traded in both the stock market and the traded options
market, fell 10 to 573p, with turnover of 3.3m accompanied by the equivalent
of 3.3m traded in the options.
Yield seeking investors once again went shopping for BICC, which improved 6
to 408p.
The shortage of stock in Smiths Industries continued and the shares advanced
another 5 to 385p. Babcock International was strongly traded. Volume rose to
a hefty 14m. The day's total included a block of 4.5m done at 44p, and
another of 5.3m at 43 1/2 p. The shares closed  1/2 lighter at 45p.
One of the day's biggest falls was recorded in Glasgow-based pumps and
valves manufacturer Weir Group, which disappointed the market with a 10 per
cent decline in interim figures. Profits were Pounds 16.8m, against Pounds
18.4m a year earlier. The shares dropped by 9 per cent, ending 30 weaker at
318p, as brokers reduced full-year forecasts by about Pounds 4m to around
Pounds 39m.
The availability of stock, together with general profit-taking, once again
exacted a toll on engineering group Siebe. The shares slipped 10 to 527p.
General investment support was seen for Westland Group, which closed 6
better at 236p.
Business services company Rentokil Group pleased the market when it reported
figures above analysts' expectations. The shares gained 9 at 219p in trade
of 3.3m.
Profits downgrades at US rival Philip Morris were said to have been
responsible for softness in tobacco to insurance group BAT Industries. The
shares eased 4 to 475p.
A broker's visit to Rank Organisation's Haven Warner operations on the south
coast of England on Wednesday cheered analysts, boosting the shares
yesterday. They hardened 3 to 777p.
The departure of Owners Abroad managing director Mr Roger Allard saw the
share price climb 4 to 84p in hefty turnover of 5.5m. But an analyst said
the market was finding it hard to make predictions for Owners. Mr Hamish
Dickson of Hoare Govett said: 'We have suspended our forecasts for the time
being. We feel so much in the dark.'
Ladbroke felt the force of pre-interims nerves with its share price losing 3
to 202p.
US buying interest was said to have continued in Vodafone Group, which was
lifted 8 to 578p. A squeeze was reported in Transfer Technology shares,
which forged ahead 19 to 489p. Kleinwort Benson recommended the stock
earlier in the week.
HSBC jumped 13 1/2 to 730p following a sharp rise in the Hong Kong market.
There were no surprises in interim results from Guardian Royal Exchange,
whose shares settled a penny easier at 213p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid rumours surrounding Allied-Lyons found some voice again on the market
and saw the stock price move up 8 to 628p in a reasonable turnover of 4.1m
shares.
While many analysts felt there was more speculation than substance in the
rumour, Allied is enjoying positive sentiment at present and consensus grows
that the stock is cheap and worthy of investment. Smith New Court issued a
buy note, saying the shares had emerging value and looked a good bet for
long-term growth.
One broker was urging caution on the larger brewing stocks, citing one cause
for concern as possible tax increases in the November Budget.

FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bought deal in ACT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER software and services group ACT was the most heavily traded stock
in the market after Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, sold its 10.3
per cent stake in the company, via a bought deal.
The stake, some 19.1m, was sold by Singer &amp; Friedlander to Credit Lyonnais
Laing, the stockbroker, at 161 1/2 p and subsequently placed with a number
of institutions at 163p a share. The placing was oversubscribed, according
to dealers.
ACT retreated to 172p as the market picked up the scent of a large placing,
but quickly stabilised and then rallied to finish the day just a penny down
at 175p. Turnover reached 39.5m shares.

FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: London shrugs off Bundesbank news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market benefited yesterday from its unwillingness to
believe the rumours that key interest rates would be cut in Germany. Share
prices fell sharply at first as optimism faded ahead of the Bundesbank's
decision to leave rates unchanged, but professional marketmakers were only
too happy to buy stock. The early fall of 20.6 on the FT-SE Index was
recaptured later and by the close the Index had regained its all-time
closing peak of 3,079.2 to show no change on the the session.
The US buyers who pushed the Footsie to its latest peak on Wednesday, when
the day's retail value soared to a 1993 peak of Pounds 2.3bn, were content
to leave the UK market to its own devices yesterday. However, Goldman Sachs,
the US investment bank, having already discounted suggestions of an
immediate cut in German discount rate, reiterated the optimistic view of the
UK market from the other side of the Atlantic.
Goldman, rejecting widespread fears that global stock markets are
overheated, maintained that the 'most likely' scenario is for global
equities to be the best-performing financial asset over the next 6 - 12
months.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall commented that; 'a wall of US money' is
driving UK equities ahead. Optimism is also high on the domestic front,
where Mr Michael Hicks of Strauss Turnbull said that UK markets evidently
believe that 'low inflation is here to stay'.
The recovery in UK stocks was boosted from the stock index futures sector
where the September contract on the Footsie moved above the 3,100 mark after
the close of official trading. However, a sizeable trading programme in the
equity market yesterday morning appeared to reflect genuine portfolio
investment rather than futures-hedging.
The fall in the US dollar after the Bundesbank's decision took the heart out
of the international stocks, although selling pressure was light. However,
the oil stocks, which have headed the US move into the UK market this week,
found buyers again after Wall Street opened.
Interest rate-orientated stocks, which were the most closely-linked to the
hints of a rate cut in Germany, held up well. Among the retail issues, Marks
&amp; Spencer, the high street jewel, closed firmly.
Banking stocks, which are expected to benefit strongly from early cuts in
interest rates because these would ease the pressures on loan books from
difficult, or underperforming loans, also recouped early falls. The sector
was boosted by hints that a large cross-border takeover move was in the
offing.
Overall, the UK market closed last night nearly 1 per cent higher than on
Friday, when the hopes for a cut in Bundesbank discount rate first began to
circulate in global markets. London remains convinced that interest rates
are on the way down throughout Europe, that UK rates will be trimmed this
autumn and that hopes of economic recovery will continue to bring overseas
investors to the UK stock market.
However, there are still worries for the near term over the high ratings now
standing on UK equities. SG Warburg remains relatively cautious and other
London securities firms appear reluctant to increase year-end forecasts.

FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES trading trod a cautious path ahead of yesterday morning's
Bundesbank policy council meeting, with uncertainty over interest rate cuts
holding volume in check, Christine Buckley writes.
Some profit-taking in equity futures depressed the level of the September
contract on the FT-SE 100 in morning trading and it fell to the day's low
just before the Bundesbank's news.
But once Germany stemmed speculation with a decision to stand firm on its
rates, more action moved into the market, taking the September future on a
rally that did not turn back. The contract also received added impetus from
a squeeze. With short positions boosting the performance, it closed at 3,097
with 11,740 contracts traded, a rise of 6 points on the day.
Given the lack of German action on interest rates and a fairly lacklustre
trade in short sterling and gilts, the fact that the contract moved upwards
was a measure of its underlying strength, traders believed. It finished the
session 12 points ahead of its fair value premium to the cash market, the
measure of carrying costs and dividend payments on the underlying contract.
A significant amount of switching between futures and cash was also seen, as
well as some large block deals.
Traded options had less fire with 24,269 lots traded. The Footsie option
weighed in with 7,098 contracts and the highest stock was Glaxo at 3,774.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Corporate recovery supports NZ equities
 -The economic outlook also looks good ahead of the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soaring confidence in the economic outlook and unexpectedly strong corporate
profits have led to a rally in New Zealand equities.
The NZSE-40 capital index is bubbling around the 2,000 to 2,030 level that
it last achieved in January 1990. However, it is still well below the 3,800
mark set in 1987, and for much of the current year, until June when the
present rally began, traded within 100 points of its January low of 1,495.
Since Monday, when the index registered a 3 1/2 -year high of 2,027.37, it
has fluctuated, closing yesterday at 1,993.58.
Earlier this year the main activity on the market was being generated from
overseas, with steady buying in the larger companies, particularly Brierley
Investments, and Fletcher Challenge, the forestry and energy group. As a
result an estimated 40 per cent of the shares in these companies are now
held offshore.
At the same time, locally based institutions tended to be aggressive sellers
of local stocks as they deliberately sought to increase their overseas
exposure.
However, sentiment changed sharply from June following a series of economic
stories which showed unexpectedly strong growth in the domestic economy and
good export growth leading to a continuing strong balance of payments
surplus. Sharp falls in interest rates saw local investors seeking
alternative investments, and higher yielding equities began to look
underpriced.
Manufacturers, which had been strong critics of government reform policies
over the past eight years, reported that, because of low inflation -
currently around 2 per cent - and falling debt and wage costs, they were
finding it possible to cope with the rising strength of the New Zealand
dollar.
Opinion polls also showed a strong rise in support for the pro-business
National government, which now expects confidently to win the November
general election on the promise of offering consistent policies. Ms Ruth
Richardson, the finance minister, was able to portray the July budget, with
its forecast reductions in the deficit and continuing economic growth, as a
vindication of her determination to stick with often unpopular measures in
the national interest.
In August, she introduced a new tax regime to encourage overseas equity
investment which, brokers say, has spurred US interest in New Zealand. US
investment has risen sharply following publicity there about the successes
New Zealand has had in implementing policies favoured by the so-called
Chicago monetarist school of economists.
Bell Atlantic and Ameritech now control Telecom Corporation, International
Paper manages Carter Holt Harvey, the largest forestry company, Wisconsin
Central owns the national railway, New Zealand Rail, and other US companies
have substantial investments in plantation forestry, and manufacturing.
Brokers have reported the return of many investors who had sworn that they
would never touch a share again after the 1987 crash. Those returning have
found that the stock exchange has reformed itself, with prompt settlement
procedures and tougher listing requirements.
Returning investors have also found most companies in strong financial
shape. Many have low debt and strong cash flows, such as Telecom, or no debt
at all, such as Ceramco and Steel and Tube, and are reporting strong profits
rises. Telecom's surprisingly strong profits recovery has seen it add
NZDollars 1.20 in under a month, closing yesterday at NZDollars 3.98.
The drive to cut debt extended to Fletcher Challenge, which has been the
second major stock to lead the rally, the first being Telecom. Fletcher
Challenge's apparent reluctance to sell assets saw its price marked back
last year from NZDollars 3.80 to below NZDollars 1.60 by October.
The group has since worked hard to re-establish itself, and cut its debt.
Last week it reported better than expected results. This saw its shares
bounce back to above NZDollars 3.83, although it has eased back recently on
profit-taking, to close yesterday at NZDollars 3.68.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips from peak despite
strong bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AMID profit-taking, US stock markets either remained flat or eased off their
record highs, in spite of a further sharp rise for bond prices, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.91 at 3,648.18,
although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.91 firmer at a record 461.04.
For the second consecutive day the Nasdaq composite underperformed the rest
of the markets, relinquishing 2.27 to 731.39. Trading volume on the New York
SE was 254m shares.
After posting a 46-point Dow advance over the previous two trading days,
no-one was surprised yesterday when the equity markets failed to build on
those gains. All year so far, profit-takers have been ready to move in every
time stocks have reached all-time highs.
The day's economic news - an 8,000 rise in weekly initial jobless claims -
had little impact on the markets. Prices remained subdued throughout the
day, apart from a brief surge mid-afternoon sparked by program buying. For
once, higher bond prices, which pushed long-dated yields to new record lows,
failed to stimulate across-the-board buying interest in equities. Buyers
sought certain sectors, and continued to rotate between cyclical, consumer,
car, pharmaceutical, technology, transportation and oil issues.
Drug shares were among the leaders. Pfizer climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
63 1/2 , Bristol Myers-Squibb put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 55 5/8 ,
Schering Plough added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 60 7/8 and Merck rose Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 32 5/8 .
Selected oil stocks were also in demand. Exxon firmed Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 66 3/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 1/8 , Mobil Dollars 5/8
to Dollars 78 1/2 and British Petroleum ADRs Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8
.
Cyclical shares eased with the wider market. Caterpillar shed Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 82 3/8 , International Paper Dollars 1 to Dollars 66 7/8 and General
Electric Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 98 3/4 . Car manufacturers, however, were
firmer, led by General Motors, which rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 .
Certain technology stocks were out of favour, although all ended above the
day's lows: Compaq lost Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 52 1/2 , Motorola Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 94 3/8 and Texas Instruments Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 80 3/8
.
Disappointment that Philip Morris did not raise its dividend continued to
hurt the stock, which fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Novell dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 in
reaction to Wednesday's late news of a third-quarter loss (which included a
charge) and several downgrades from broking houses.
Other leading technology issues also ran into heavy selling, with Microsoft
retreating Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 and Apple Dollars 3/8 to Dollars
26 7/8 . Intel, however, rallied after an early decline to end a net Dollars
 7/8 up at Dollars 63 3/8 .
Canada
TORONTO retreated a little after setting a record high in the previous
session. The TSE 300 index slipped 7.3 to close at 4,115.6, although
advances just outscored declines by 362 to 360. Volume was 57.6m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices ended higher, including energy and
financial services, although there were no significant gains. The golds
index lost 3.09 per cent as the bullion price fell USDollars 4.50 an ounce
in New York.
Hudson's Bay, up CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 35, reported sharply higher
second-quarter and six-month earnings.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin features a
clutch of new record highs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in bond yields and lower short-term rates in the afternoon prompted
late index-linked buying, and share prices firmed on purchases by
arbitrageurs and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 70.31 at 20,591.76 after a day's high of 20,594.56
and low of 20,482.95. The index moved within a narrow range on light
profit-taking and technical buying, as most investors waited for the auction
results for East Japan Railway, announced after the close.
Volume, on the last trading day for August delivery, shrank to 190m shares
from 213m. Advances outscored declines by 597 to 341, with 213 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.09 at
1,654.36 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.17 to 1,262.85.
The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark fell 6.5 basis points to 4.075 per
cent. Traders said equity prices were supported by underlying speculation of
a cut in the official discount rate next month. On the other hand, the bleak
outlook for imminent economic prospects and an upturn in corporate profits
was preventing investors from committing their funds.
In the oil sector, Cosmo Oil forged ahead Y41 to Y940. The government's new
policy to promote the use of solar power generators among domestic
households pushed up Daido Hoxan, a solar battery manufacturer, by Y17 to
Y742.
Drug issues were firm, led by Tanabe Seiyaku which gained Y70 at Y1,130 on
recommendations from a Japanese broker. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical and Sankyo
both rose Y20 to Y2,400 and Y2,450 respectively.
Hopes of government deregulation of the transportation industry supported
warehouses: Mitsubishi Warehouse and Transportation appreciated Y60 to
Y1,890 while Mitusi Soko advanced Y15 to Y950.
Telecommunications-related issues posted further gains on hopes of
government assistance for the country's telecom infrastructure. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone climbed Y5,000 to Y943,000 and Fujitsu, the day's
most active stock, rose Y6 to Y797.
Insurers were subjected to profit-taking: Tokio Marine &amp; Fire dipped Y10 to
Y1,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 50.29 at 22,509.56 in volume of 55.6m
shares.
Roundup
THREE NEW highs, and a recovery in Hong Kong, adorned a strong region.
HONG KONG's turnover was still thin, down from HKDollars 3.73bn to HKDollars
3.36bn, as the Hang Seng index improved 183.50 to 7,449.08 after a fall of
some 300 points from its record close a week earlier.
HSBC, weakened in recent days by disappointing results from its Hang Seng
Bank subsidiary, topped the actives list and recovered HKDollars 3 to
HKDollars 83.50. Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 55.50.
After the close, Swire Pacific reported a drop in interim profits. This took
the market down about 70 points in London, but it ended only 25 lower after
news of a land reclamation project.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index finished 34.10 up at a record
high of 2,010.19, driven by institutional buying of index-linked stocks.
Volume here rose from 263.06m to 277.28m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR peaked for the same reason, the KLSE composite index closing
6.06 ahead at 811.78 for its second consecutive 1993 high.
JAKARTA soared to a new peak, the JKSE index ending 7.07 stronger at 405.56.
Astra International led the rise, climbing Rp1,500 to Rp17,500 in moderate
volume on bullish speculation about its results, and on rights issue
rumours.
AUSTRALIA decided that it liked Wednesday's News Corp results after all, and
the shares rose 33 cents to ADollars 9.65 as the All Ordinaries index
advanced 18.9 to 1,941.5. Turnover was ADollars 478.2m. Market leader BHP
moved up 20 cents to ADollars 15.78.
BANGKOK saw active buying of banks as interest shifted from speculative
towards fundamental attractions. The SET index put on 9.44 at 961.77 in
turnover of just under BT8bn.
KARACHI declined on news of US sanctions against Pakistan and China over
alleged arms-control violations, the KSE index finishing 10.39 lower at
1,315.65, after touching 1,308.81.
SEOUL moved against the trend with its fourth consecutive loss, the
composite index weakening 9.36 to 695.74 in an atmosphere of depressed
inertia. Turnover dropped from Won252.8bn to Won212.2bn.

FT  27 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Conflicting reactions to Buba
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates gave bourses one reason
to backtrack yesterday, although Paris and Madrid managed to ignore it,
writes Our Markets Staff.
In parallel, there was a note from Kleinwort Benson which, this year, has
heavily overweighted continental Europe at the expense of the US. Yesterday
KB's chief strategist, Mr Albert Edwards, raised his US weighting from 23 to
30 per cent, and dropped continental Europe by seven percentage points to 16
per cent.
Since the beginning of the year, noted Mr Edwards, shares on the continent
have risen by 25 per cent, against 5 per cent for the US. However, he said,
US earnings are already some 25 per cent off their lows; earnings surprises
so far in 1993 have been on the upside; and, on KB's valuation ratios, US
equities now look cheap to fair value.
FRANKFURT weakened both during market hours, losing hope about interest
rates as the DAX index closed 16.63 lower at 1,901.15, and in the
post-bourse where the Ibis indicated DAX dropped another 10.50 to 1,890.65.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM6.8bn. Prominent losers in share price terms
included the bourse's top three stocks, Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens,
and the three blue chips which put out interim reports yesterday, BASF,
Bayer and Volkswagen.
Five of those six, noted Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, were
major exporters, and vulnerable to weakness in the dollar promoted by German
interest rate policy. The interim reports, although grim, were much as
expected; Volkswagen, down DM3.70 to DM367.30 on the session and
accelerating with a DM6.80 drop to DM360.50 in the post-bourse, seemed to
suffer more from cynicism about its recovery prospects.
Siemens fell DM9.60 to DM666.40 on the session and by DM6.90 to DM659.50 in
London after hours. It had been relatively strong recently, and seemed to
attract forward selling from the DTB.
ZURICH ended lower as profit-taking evident earlier in the session increased
slightly after the Buba decision. UBS bearers, SFr9 lower at SFr1,184,
topped the active list and Nestle fell SFr16 to SFr1,101 as the blue-chip,
SMI index dropped 27.2 to 2,475.2.
PARIS shrugged off the news from Germany, only falling slightly in an
immediate reaction, before climbing steadily during afternoon trading.
The CAC-40 index closed up 14.30 at 2,173.61, a new high for the year, after
a high of 2,180.98 and a low of 2,144.17. Turnover remained good at
FFr4.1bn.
Brokers at the Paris office of James Capel reported a growing belief that
the French authorities would now act quickly to bring domestic interest
rates down, particularly as the franc again came under pressure in the
currency exchanges. A decision could come as soon as the weekend, they
added, noting that the 5-10 day rate was another candidate for trimming from
its present 10 per cent level to about 7.75 per cent.
Among individual issues Peugeot was one of the few losers on the day, down
lost FFr8 to FFr680 in reaction to disappointing results from Renault.
AMSTERDAM fell back by over 1 per cent but dealers were not excessively
worried that interest rates had been left unchanged. A weaker dollar also
contributed to declines in those stocks with a heavy US exposure.
The CBS Tendency index slipped 1.5 to 127.5, but off the day's low of 127.3.
Unilever dropped Fl 3.30 to Fl 195.90 in reaction, some brokers said, to
news that Philip Morris of the US had failed to increase its dividend.
Among the day's half year results, Internatio-Muller, the trading and
transport group, added Fl 5.50 to Fl 68.50 following good figures, while
Hagemeyer, the trading group, gained Fl 2.30 to Fl 98.80 after it saw a 20
per cent rise over the period.
KNP BT, the paper group, put on 40 cents to Fl 36.80 as its first half
results also exceeded expectations.
MADRID tried to apply the brakes, the general index losing nearly three
points early in the day; but its momentum reasserted itself and the index
actually closed 1.71 higher at its third consecutive 1993 high of 299.52.
STOCKHOLM lost ground in spite of better-than-expected interim results from
Volvo and Skanska. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 14.3 to 1,251.0 in
turnover of SKr2.0bn.
Volvo B shares rose SKr8 to SKr454 and Skanska SKr4 to SKr152.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar declines on rate news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR and European currencies weakened against the D-Mark in European
trading yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised dealers by keeping its
official interest rates unchanged, writes James Blitz.
Expectations had been for a cut of up to  1/2 percentage point in the
discount rate, which sets the floor for all German money market rates.
The decision not to cut led to a firming in the D-Mark's value against most
currencies in thin trading. But there was a strong impression that European
currencies could start to show a clearer trend against the D-Mark when
foreign exchange volumes pick up at the start of next week.
In Europe, the Bundesbank announcement pushed the franc below the FFr3.50
level to the D-Mark in mid-afternoon after it had closed on Wednesday at
FFr3.4720. It ended yesterday at FFr3.502. An analyst said France's
unemployment figures for July, due out on Monday, would be important in
determining how much pressure the currency market must put on the Bank of
France to reduce rates.
The Danish krone was also weaker, finishing at DKr4.125 per D-Mark, well
below the previous close of DKr4.085. Sterling was 1 1/4 pfennigs higher at
DM2.5150. It was the Belgian franc which, of all European currencies, caused
most concern: it slid to a low of BFr21.35 per D-Mark from Wednesday's close
of BFr21.12.
The announcement by a group of Flemish economists earlier this week that the
Belgian currency should sever its link with the D-Mark was the cause of the
currency's slide. 'The Belgian franc is the European currency we worry about
more than any other,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking
Corporation in London.
However, Mr O'Neill believes that it is the performance of the dollar/D-Mark
currency pair that will dominate the foreign exchange market's attention
over the next few weeks.
Yesterday the dollar declined against the German currency, closing 2
pfennigs down on the day at DM1.6680, a nine-week low. Mr O'Neill thinks
this trend could continue as dealers gradually turn their attention away
from the newly relaxed ERM. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.6652.
Poor US economic data, a large budget deficit and German intransigence
continue to hang over the dollar. 'A move down to DM1.60 is certainly
possible over the next three months,' said Mr O'Neill. 'And I have to say
that I do not rule out the possibility of the dollar hitting new historic
lows.'
The Japanese authorities continued to take full advantage of the upswing in
the dollar/yen rate, heavily intervening to support the US currency in Asian
trading. The intervention helped the dollar to get back above the Y105
level, but Japanese intervention was ineffective in a thin market, and the
dollar closed at Y104.40 from a previous Y104.90. It ended in New York at
Y104.35.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank again surprised European money market dealers yesterday by
refusing to lower its official interest rates when there had been strong
expectations that policy would be eased, writes James Blitz.
The German central bank left its discount rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent
and made no announcement on next week's repo. Market expectations had been
for a cut in the discount rate of up to  1/2 percentage point, in the belief
that inflationary pressures in Germany had eased.
There was no formal explanation of why the Bundesbank had left policy
unchanged. Analysts said the central bank was concerned by M3 monetary
growth after the intervention to support the French franc. The central bank
might also have found it difficult to explain why it was cutting rates in
August, when the failure to ease policy in July had brought the demise of
the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Bundesbank's move was followed by announcements of no change in rates
from Austria and the Netherlands. France had announced before the council
meeting that its intervention rate was unchanged. Portugal trimmed its
emergency lending rate at the start of the day from 12.500 per cent to
12.375 per cent.
Yesterday's Bundesbank move took many dealers by surprise, especially in the
German cash market. There had been strong expectations of lower borrowing
through the discount window. When these were dashed, banks tried to raise
funds in the cash market, pushing call money above 7 per cent. One London
dealer expected to see some Lombard borrowing next week at 7.75 per cent.
Euromark futures also fell back. The September contract closed at 93.50,
down 7 basis points on the day, and the December contract retreated 4 basis
points to 94.07. French franc futures were also depressed, in the belief
that France's policy easing might come more slowly than dealers had
expected. September Pibor weakened 17 basis points to end at 92.99.
Sterling markets were depressed by yesterday's Bundesbank move. The December
contract declined 5 basis points to close at 94.54. In the cash market,
three-month money was fractionally higher at 5 7/8 per cent on the bid side
and 5 13/16 per cent offered. There was a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply concerns lift coffee
prices to fresh peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBUSTA COFFEE prices renewed their uptrend at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday as traders followed through on Wednesday's late rally.
Although the export retention scheme agreed by both Latin American and
African producing countries earlier this month continued to underpin market
sentiment, traders thought the latest upsurge, which took prices to the
highest levels since the dollar contract was launched in March 1991, was
mainly due to technical factors.
Second-position November futures closed Dollars 23 up at Dollars 1,263 a
tonne, after touching Dollars 1,273 a tonne at one stage. But the concern
about nearby supply tightness that traders said was fuelling the rise was
reflected in the fact that the prompt September position was up Dollars 36
at Dollars 1,308 a tonne.
The second position price has risen by Dollars 61 so far this week and is
now Dollars 444 above the low reached four and a half months ago.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that there appeared to be fairly limited
nearby supplies available and with the uncovered position on the futures
market declining only very slowly and remaining above 9,000 lots some of the
holders of short positions were getting nervous and looking to take cover.
They said the next upside technical target was in the Dollars 1,325 to
Dollars 1,350 a tonne area for the November position, but some thought the
market had become overbought and were looking for a downside correction
first.
Cocoa prices also saw fresh peaks early in the day, but fell back after
running into profit-taking.
The rise, which took the December futures position up to a 22-month high of
Pounds 824 a tonne at one point, was seen by traders as a resumption of the
recent technically-based uptrend, which had been interrupted on Wednesday.
They said bullish chart patterns coupled with concern about supply tightness
against a background of an expected further drawdown from world stocks was
keeping sellers at bay.
But resistance built up as the price moved towards the Pounds 830-a-tonne
mark and the December price drifted back to close at Pounds 810 a tonne, up
just Pounds 5 on the day.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market price range 'close to
equilibrium'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOLD price range of between Dollars 370 and Dollars 400 a troy ounce 'is
probably not far out of line with the prevailing equilibrium price,'
suggests the Gold Fields Mineral Services consultancy group in a new report
on the global gold market.
Although there is a danger the same investment funds that helped to drive up
the gold price earlier this year might become sellers instead, GFMS says it
is also possible to see a number of developments that would lead to a
further upward movement.
These include a return of stronger physical demand as the market moves out
of the present time of seasonal weakness and as dealer, fabricator and
retail stocks return to normal from high levels built up by the end of the
first quarter of 1992.
Also, 'the lowering of European interest rates should offer support to the
gold price in the medium-term by reducing the opportunity cost of holding
gold as well as boosting consumption and possibly inflation in the longer
term'.
GFMS makes these comments in the first of a new series of interim reports
that will update information contained it its annual survey, which is
released in May each year.
The latest report forecasts that higher prices will cut global gold demand
from jewellery makers this year by about 7 per cent from the 1992 level to
2,492 tonnes. This would still be well above global mine production of gold,
predicted to rise by 2 per cent to 2,274 tonnes.
The biggest supply/demand component changes forecast by GFMS include an 87
per cent drop to only 20 tonnes in supply from forward sales by producers
and a 37 per cent fall in sales by central banks and other official
organisations to only 368 tonnes. The recent steep price rise has encouraged
more investment in physical gold and GFMS predicts this will rise by 530 per
cent to 63 tonnes - still comparatively low given that demand from this
source was 213 tonnes in 1990.
Bar hoarding, also feeling the impact of higher prices, is forecast to fall
by 29.5 per cent to 203 tonnes.
GFMS suggests that in the short term it will be developments in the gold
market itself that will determine the price. If central banks sales and
forward sales by producers stay low, there may be further investment
interest in the metal.
If physical gold sales pick up, this will reassure investors 'that the risks
of a major down-side correction are low enough and the possibility of
longer-term gain high enough to justify continued exposure to gold within
diversified portfolios.
'On the other hand, if physical demand remains weak, then, in the absence of
external factors such as renewed turmoil on foreign exchanges, additional
liquidation of long positions, accompanied by a further period of price
weakness, would seem likely.'

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat council raises world crop
estimate by 11m tonnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has raised its forecast for world wheat
production in 1993-94 by 11m tonnes from the level it was projecting last
month. In the latest issue of its monthly Grain Market Report, published
yesterday, it puts the crop at 573m tonnes, which would also be 11m tonnes
up from actual output in 1992-93, and second only to the 1990 record of 592m
tonnes.
The increase from last months report chiefly reflects higher projections for
China (up 5m tonnes at 102m) and the Russian Federation (up 4m tonnes at
47m).
The report cautions, however, that although prospects for Russian grain
crops are reported to be generally favourable 'some commentators have drawn
attention to the possibility of heavy losses during, as well as after,
harvesting'. Shortages of equipment and fuel are reported to be severe in
some regions, it says, and 'storage facilities remain inadequate'.
Other countries for which estimates have been increased significantly since
publication of the July report include the US (up 1m tonnes at 69m),
Argentina (up 1.5m tonnes at 10.5m) and Canada (up 1.2m tonnes at 29m).
However, the IWC's Canadian forecast is 1.3m tonnes below an estimate
published this week by Statistics Canada.
The IWC's forecast for the European Community is reduced from 83.9m to 83m
tonnes, which would be 2.2m down from 1992-93.
While overall availability of wheat is expected to more than adequate, the
IWC warns that there may be a problem with quality as 'unfavourable
harvesting conditions have prevailed in many parts of the northern
hemisphere'. It suggests therefore that demand for good quality wheat may
have to be met to some extent out of stocks carried over from earlier crops.
The lower quality wheat from the current crop may, in turn, help to redress
the balance in the coarse grains sector as it competes with maize in the
livestock feed market. The report puts world course grain production in
1993-94 at 810m tonnes, down just 1m from last month's forecast but 49m
tonnes below 1992-93 output.
The fall from last year is almost entirely due to the effect of the Midwest
floods on US maize prospects. US coarse grains output is now projected to
reach only 222.4m tonnes, down from 229m tonnes in the July report and
277.7m tonnes in 1992-93. But the latest cut in the US estimate has been
compensated by increases indicated for the EC (by 1.4m tonnes to 82.1m),
Kazakhstan (by 1.2m tonnes to 11.6m), the Russian Federation (by 2.6m tonnes
to 53.7m) and Canada (by 1.6m tonnes to 24.1m).

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China tries to avert cotton
price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH COTTON prices rising on shortages in key provinces, China is releasing
500,000 tonnes from national reserves in a desperate effort to cool the
market and avert a cotton war, reports Reuter from Beijing.
Vice Premier Li Lanqing made the announcement this week at a meeting here to
discuss the cotton crisis, the Farmers Daily reported.
He said that, with the crop due to fall this year, the extra stocks were
being released to stabilise the market and encourage the proper purchase of
cotton from farmers - in other words, to stop them from going to the black
market.
An agriculture ministry official said it was too early to say by how much
the crop will fall. He blamed the drop on unusually severe pests and
flooding in production areas.
Cotton, a vital raw material for the textile industry, one of China's
biggest export earners, has caused some of the worst headaches for central
planners since reforms began in 1978, with wild fluctuations in production.
Output nearly tripled from 2.17m tonnes in 1978 to a record 6.26m in 1984,
causing a glut and leaving stocks rotting on the roadside. Output plunged to
3.54m tonnes in 1986. Then the cycle began again, with output rising to
5.68m tonnes in 1991 and falling 20 per cent to 4.53m last year.
Cotton remains one of the few crops still entirely under state control, with
farmers supposed to sell only to authorised buyers. But at times of shortage
a black market develops.
On Tuesday, the government announced that it was raising the purchase price
from Yn300 (Pounds 34) a dan (50 kg) to Yn330, with a promise of a further
increase next year.
Mr Li told the meeting that cotton should in the end become a free market
commodity but the moment was not yet ripe, so the government had to increase
its control over the crop.
'We need to set up a national warehousing system specially for cotton,
similar to what we have for grain,' he said.
Reports from the provinces, in official newspapers, indicate that the
government may have moved too late.
In Hebei, an important producer, the shortage this year will be 100,000
tonnes and in Shandong it will be 50,000 tonnes short. Prices have already
started to rise, the newspapers said.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Small New York Exchanges to
merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Stock Exchange is about to spin off its tiny 14-year-old
futures arm, the New York Futures Exchange, to the New York Cotton Exchange,
according to sources close to the talks in New York.
The two exchanges share trading floors in New York's World Trade Centre.
The deal, which could be completed as early as September 2, would be small
in comparison to the merger plan under way between two other New York
futures exchanges, the New York Mercantile, and the Commodity Exchange
(Comex).
However, the Nyfe could prove a useful addition to the 100-year-old cotton
exchange. The cotton exchange trades futures and options contracts in cotton
and frozen concentrated orange juice and, through its subsidiary, the
Financial Instruments Exchanges, it offers dollar index futures, futures on
European currency units, and a treasury note contract.
The Nyfe is best-known for its futures on the Commodity Research Bureau
index. Its 500 members also trade futures on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index. As stepchild of the giant stock exchange, the Nyfe never
fully developed as a futures exchange. Its memberships trade for Dollars
100. Seats at the Cotton Exchange, in contrast, sell for about Dollars
40,000.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cut in sugar stocks forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR stocks are expected to decline next season by another 1.81m
tonnes, according to London trader C. Czarnikow's initial forecast for
1993-94.
In its latest Sugar Review, Czarnikow estimates that world production will
rise in 1993-94 by 1.34m tonnes to 112.55m, while consumption growth will
continue - albeit at a slower rate than in recent years - taking the world
total up from 1992-93's 112.22m tonnes to 113.76m. The projected fall in
stocks allows for the 'disappearance' factor.
'The overall totals might suggest that, with world stocks now returned to a
mid-range figure, price movements may prove rather neutral in the coming
months,' the review says.
'However, there are contrasts in the outlook as some producers seek to
recover from weather related problems last season while several of the
larger individual countrioes have balances that are moving into deficit.
'Supplies appear to be plenttiful over the remaining months of this calendar
year,' Czarnikow notes, 'but there are already signs of localised supply
difficulties which are likely to make an impact in the market next year.'
The review cites India as a case in point. 'Generous stocks were available
in 1992-93 to bridge the gap between a sharply lower crop and steadily
rising demand,' it says. 'There was even sufficient to meet some export
commitments but, in all, 2m tonnes were needed (from stocks) to assure a
balance. With stocks depleted to that extent, there are not the reserves to
repeat the exercise.'
Czarnikow also reports uncertainty about the situation in China, where
government policy has concentrated on encouraging sugar consumption. This,
together with sharply higher exports - mainly to Russia - has helped to
reduce the internal surplus from the record 1991-92 crop, the review says.
Meanwhile, as a delayed reaction develops to the increased use last year of
IOUs to pay farmers, the area planted to sugar has slipped back.
Russia's 1993 sugar beet harvest will be between 24.2m and 26.65m tonnes,
little changed from last year's 25.5m, but below the five-year average of
30.2m tonnes, Interfax news agency said, reports Reuter from Moscow.

London Metal Exchange traders said COPPER was yesterday struggling to hold
the Dollars 1,950-a-tonne level for September delivery, after recently
threatening to bring September Dollars 2,000 buying options into the money.
A burst of commission house buying took the three months position up from
Dollars 1,910 to Dollars 1,929 a tonne but with the New York market sluggish
and the cash/three months premium easing to around Dollars 30, the buying
dried-up and the price ended the afternoon kerb at Dollars 1,917 a tonne,
down Dollars 16 on the day. ALUMINIUM found buying interest around the
Dollars 1,160 a tonne level which underpinned a later rise to Dollars 1,168,
up Dollars 6 a tonne from Tuesday. ZINC also benefited from buyers tempted
by the recent dip to almost Dollars 880 and three months rallied to Dollars
887, down Dollars 2. Hedge selling, liquidation and stop-loss selling pushed
TIN and NICKEL to 20-year and six-year lows of Dollars 4,720 and Dollars
4,535 respectively against their background of ample availability of refined
supplies. The LEAD market was quiet and traded narrowly before ending at
Dollars 396.50 a tonne in the three months position, unchanged on the day.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators drive gold price
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD PLUNGED through Dollars 370 a troy ounce in late trading yesterday as
New York speculators made a concerted effort to drive the price down.
Their efforts triggered more selling orders from investement funds that use
computer programmes to limit their losses. The gold price closed in London
down Dollars 3.75 at Dollars 367.50 an ounce.
'This is a very quiet time for the market and there is not much physical
demand, so the market is being driven by technical factors - and the
technicals look horrible,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp;
Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group.
He suggested that, if gold fell below Dollars 360 an ounce, the next level
of technical support was Dollars 330. On the other hand, the price needed to
stay above Dollars 380 for a day or two if the present downward trend was to
be reversed.
Gold has risen from a seven-year low of Dollars 327 an ounce in January to
touch Dollars 409 in early August, its highest level since the outbreak of
the Gulf war in January, 1991.
Mr Bielski said that fundamentally gold was still looking good with
jewellery demand still outpacing output from the world's mines. Also, the
central bank selling which had bedevilled the market last year, had
virtually dried up.
Palladium's price continued to fall sharply yesterday as the investment
funds that helped drive the metal up from Dollars 90 an ounce in late-1992
to a four-year peak of Dollars 146 in July turned into sellers at a time of
seasonally weak physical demand. Palladium was fixed in London at Dollars
122.50 an ounce, down about Dollars 6.25 from Wednesday.
The metal is used mainly for anti-pollution car catalysts and by the
electronics and dental industries. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of Johnson
Matthey's platinum group metals market surveys, said physical supply of
palladium was tight and JM still expected a supply deficit this year. He
suspected that the Japanese had been hoarding physical metal because 'the
yen price has been pretty low'.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Prices ease as Germans stand firm on
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets eased following Germany's decision to leave
its key rates unchanged yesterday. However, the falls reflected token
selling rather than investor panic.
The general view among investors was that the German Bundesbank would cut
rates; whether it does so now or at the next council meeting in two weeks'
time is academic.
However, Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, argued that yesterday
may have been the last chance before November for a cut in German rates.
The Bundesbank has said it would not ease if money supply was high.
The money supply number for August is likely to be inflated by the heavy
foreign exchange intervention seen earlier in the month. Thereafter, there
could be delays in policy decisions until Mr Hans Tietmeyer has taken over
as the new Bundesbank head.
UK economists had anticipated a quarter-point cut in the discount rate, and
on Wednesday there were reports that leading German economists expected a
half-point reduction.
However, suspicion developed early yesterday that the Bundesbank might stand
firm. Market-makers had taken a more cautious line than before the last
council meeting and, as yesterday's meeting dragged on, more and more
traders adjusted their books and pushed government bond markets lower.
By the time a decision was announced - just before 1pm London time - the
consensus had shifted and positions were fully hedged.
Bund futures for September on Liffe closed only 11 basis points lower, at
97.44, with turnover of only 82,000 contracts, no higher than average.
FRENCH debt prices sagged around midday, but recovered later and the yield
on 10-year French paper remained some 5 basis points below its German
counterpart.
Some economists argued that Germany's decision to leave rates unchanged was
a gesture of support for France.
The refusal to shift monetary policy at the end of July intensified the
heavy French franc selling and led, a few days later, to the crisis within
the ERM. To ease yesterday when the French currency had a margin of more
than than 30 centimes over its ERM limits could have been construed as a
political snub.
The Bank of France left its 6.75 per cent intervention rate unchanged at
yesterday's securities repurchase tender.
Investors, preferring the low inflation prospects signalled by the long end
of the yield curve rather than the rate prospects reflected by the short
end, bought 10-year maturities. In spite of a slide in the currency, OAT
futures traded on the Matif rose 4 basis points to 122.98 by the official
close. The contract traded lower after official dealing.
In London, long-dated government bonds slipped slightly before recovering
later to close flat on balance. Long gilt futures for September were  9/32
off at one stage, but closed marginally weaker.
US TREASURY prices posted sharp gains at the long end yesterday, pushing the
30-year yield close to 6 per cent.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 102
1/32 , yielding 6.099 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was only
slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 3/32 , to yield 3.809 per cent.
The day's economic news - an 8,000 increase in weekly initial jobless claims
 -had little impact on market sentiment. Consequently, prices only edged
higher at the opening, and the only area of activity in the morning was from
buyers picking up securities as part of interest-rate swap business, and
from holders of mortgage-backed securities. Prices were also supported in
early trading by the lack of supply.
In the afternoon, however, the long end took off amid reports of heavy
buying by commodity and mutual funds, short covering by dealers, and strong
futures-related demand. There was also speculation that the Brazilian
government was buying bonds to back its debt plan.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe rethinks bono trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) may
relaunch its unsuccessful Spanish government bond (bonos) contract this
autumn, with a designated market-maker system to boost liquidity, according
to traders.
Such a system obliges firms to keep a presence in the pit.
Three weeks ago, Liffe suspended the December contract due to lack of
volume, and began reviewing the contract. The September contract, which was
not suspended, traded 17 contracts last month, while a rival contract on
Meff, the Spanish futures exchange, trades more than 10,000 daily.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), which in June became the first Spanish bank to
obtain a seat on Liffe, may become one of a small group of market-makers in
the contract.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling sees first Mexican
offering in two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurosterling bond market yesterday saw its first Mexican offering for
two years when Bancomext, the state-owned import and export bank, raised
Pounds 75m through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 200
basis points above the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000.
This represents a price improvement of 25 basis points for a Mexican
state-owned entity in the Eurosterling market. When United Mexican States
raised Pounds 100m through a seven-year issue two years ago, it paid 225
basis points over the underlying gilt. Although the spread has since
tightened to 215 basis points, the price has risen to a large premium to par
and the bonds have become illiquid.
Syndicate managers said yesterday's deal indicated Mexico had bowed to
market pressure regarding the pricing of its Eurobonds, at least for now.
In recent months, Mexico has been pushing for a spread of less than 200
basis points. Investors, however, are unwilling to buy its Eurobonds below
this threshold until the country has achieved an investment grade rating.
The lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said Bancomext was seeking to diversify
its funding base by issuing in sterling. When the bonds were freed to trade,
the spread narrowed slightly.
Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a
speculative grade rating of BB- to Argentina's dollar-denominated foreign
debt. The S&amp;P rating is one notch above Argentina's B1 rating assigned by
Moody's.
S&amp;P said although the rating was supported by Argentina's economic
transformation, it was constrained by the country's large foreign debt
burden relative to exports.
Argentina's net external debt, estimated at 205 per cent of exports, is the
highest among sovereigns rated in S&amp;P's BB category.
'Strict fiscal discipline will be essential for some time to come to secure
recent improvements in credit-worthiness, given the country's past record of
economic and political instability,' S&amp;P said.
Elsewhere, Tchibo Holding, the German chain of high street coffee shops,
made its debut in the international bond market with a DM300m offering of
10-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 43
basis points over underlying bunds. The spread tightened rapidly to 35 basis
points, reflecting the strong demand from domestic retail investors for this
household name. The yield pick-up of Tchibo's issue over other Eurobond
issues with the same maturity also contributed to the success of the deal.
For example, Volkswagen's 10-year Eurobonds were trading at a spread of
around 33 basis points over bunds.
Tchibo, which is unrated, said proceeds from the issue would be used to
improve the balance sheet. It said Tchibo had wanted to take advantage of
the favourable market conditions, but that it had no further plans to tap
the international bond market.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian groups return to tap
global investors

INDIAN companies are returning to international capital markets following an
easing of investors' concerns about last year's financial scandal in Bombay
and this year's sectarian disturbances.
Indian businesses see international capital issues as a vital source of
funds for modernising industry, in the wake of the economic reforms started
two years ago by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister.
Two companies tapped the Euromarkets last month for a combined total of
about Dollars 150m. At least six further companies plan to raise more than
Dollars 400m by the end of the year.
The offerings come amid signs of growing interest in India among
international fund managers. Foreign investors have put about Dollars 450m
into the Indian stock market in the past six weeks, contributing to a strong
surge in share prices.
Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Creditcapital Finance Corporation, a merchant
bank part-owned by Lazard Brothers, the UK investment bank, said yesterday
international investors were becoming interested in India because the rush
to invest in Latin America and China was slowing.
The first Indian issuer to tap the international markets was Reliance
Industries, the flagship company of Reliance, a chemicals and textiles
group. It raised Dollars 150m in May 1992. Other companies wanting to follow
Reliance were forced to postpone their plans because of the securities
market scandal among banks and brokers in the Bombay bond market.
It was not until November that the second issue was launched - by Grasim
Industries, a textiles maker belonging to a grouping headed by Mr Aditya
Birla, a leading entrepreneur. The destruction of the Ayodhya mosque on
December 6, which sparked riots and concern about India's stability, forced
other issuers to shelve plans once more.
Indian companies finally returned to the market last month. They were led by
Hindalco, an aluminium maker also controlled by Mr Aditya Birla, and Essar
Gujarat, a diversified group with interests in steel, shipping and trading.
Each raised about Dollars 75m.
Next in line is Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corporation, a
Madras-based petrochemicals group, with a Dollars 60m to Dollars 75m issue
of global depository receipts next month. This will be followed by a Dollars
100m convertible bond issue from the Shipping Credit and Investment
Corporation of India, a shipping finance group, and a Dollars 75m to Dollars
100m convertible bond issue from ITC, a tobacco and hotels company in which
BAT of the UK has a stake.
This week Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, a vehicle maker, announced plans for a
Dollars 75m bond offering.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Bank of Canada reports a strong recovery for the third quarter and
nine months following a good performance by its stockbroking offshoot, tight
control of costs and lower loan loss provisions.
For the three months ended July, net profit was CDollars 47.3m (USDollars
36.90), or 27 cents a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 117.5m, or
CDollars 1 a year earlier. Second-quarter net profit was to CDollars 40m or
23 cents.
Third-quarter provisions were CDollars 75m, down from CDollars 358m a year
earlier when the bank wrote off key bad loans. Return on average assets was
0.48 per cent, against a negative 1.16 per cent.
Profit for the nine months totalled CDollars 132.4m or 78 cents a share,
against a loss of CDollars 37.9m or 52 cents a year earlier.
Return on average assets was 0.46 per cent against a negative 0.13 per cent.
Total assets at end-July were CDollars 39bn.
A CDollars 14m gain on the sale of Brazil bonds was offset by securities
trading losses and provisions. Most of the 14 per cent gain in other income
came from the brokerage unit.
Canada's fifth-biggest charter bank, Toronto-Dominion, said further
provisions against investments kept a third-quarter gain in net profit to 1
per cent.
Earnings for the three months ended July 31 were CDollars 102m, or 32 cents
a share, against CDollars 101m, or 31 cents, a year earlier.
Mr Richard Thomson, chairman, noted strong growth in net interest income,
good asset growth and better brokerage results. But the bank set aside an
additional CDollars 27m, bringing the nine months provision to CDollars 86m,
and an estimated CDollars 113m for the full fiscal year.
But non performing loans dipped CDollars 274m in the latest quarter to
CDollars 1.29bn, the lowest in two years. Fiscal 1993 loan losses are
estimated at CDollars 600m.
Nine-month net profit before a restructuring charge for acquisition of
Central Guaranty Trust loans, deposits and branches, was CDollars 272m, or
83 cents a share, against CDollars 295m, or 90 cents, a year earlier. After
the charge, earnings were CDollars 193m, or 57 cents.

<TEXT>
MACMILLAN, a US offshoot of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), has
agreed to sell its 50 per cent stake in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School
Publishing Company to McGraw-Hill, the US-based publishing group, for
Dollars 337.5m.
The news ended speculation that Paramount Communications or Walt Disney
might bid for Macmillan's share in the company, which is a leading publisher
of elementary and secondary educational materials in the US.
MCC filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code in 1991. Macmillan has been operating while co-ordinating
important decisions with UK court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell
empire. The letter of intent for the latest sale was signed by Price
Waterhouse, the joint administrator of MCC.
In March, Price Waterhouse said it planned to put Macmillan up for sale.
McGraw-Hill's share in the joint venture's second-quarter profits rose 72.4
per cent to Dollars 11.2m. According to bankruptcy court documents,
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing had 1992 net profits of Dollars
19.1m on operating revenues of Dollars 504.9m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: NEC cuts year's pre-tax profits
forecast to Y30bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the electronics group, has downgraded forecasts for pre-tax profits
this year, cutting its estimate for the year ending next March to Y30bn
(Dollars 283m) from Y50bn.
NEC said the main cause was the prolonged weakness of the Japanese economy.
The expected recovery in demand for personal computers had not materialised,
and the slump in business activity had kept demand for communications
equipment weak.
Semiconductors were seeing buoyant demand from the US and Asia, but NEC was
not experiencing the growth in the Japanese semiconductor market it had
expected.
The high value of the yen was also a factor behind the downward revision.
NEC was not, however, as badly affected by the yen as some other exporting
companies since it was dependent on only about 18 per cent of total sales on
overseas markets.
Sales in the year ending March are forecast at Y2,960bn compared with the
previous forecast of Y3,030. Net income is forecast to be Y16bn rather than
Y28bn expected earlier.
On a consolidated basis, sales are expected to be Y3,630bn compared with a
previous forecast of Y3,700bn, but consolidated pre-tax profits and net
income estimates are unchanged at Y40bn and Y10bn respectively, largely as a
result of strong demand for semiconductors in overseas markets and
cost-cutting measures by the company.

REYNOLDS METALS, the US integrated aluminium manufacturer, is to buy Miller
Brewing's aluminium beverage can manufacturing operations.
The deal will make Reynolds the third-largest aluminium can producer in the
world.
The transaction will increase Reynold's US aluminium can capacity by nearly
50 per cent, according to Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds' chairman.
The acquisition is part of the company's strategy to expand its value-added
aluminium businesses.
A spokesman for Miller, which is part of Philip Morris, the US food and
tobacco group, said the company was divesting the can properties because it

PHILIP MORRIS, the US food, cigarette and drinks group, is considering the
sale of Breyers, America's top-selling ice cream brand.
General Foods USA, part of Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods unit and the
country's largest producer of ice cream, yesterday said it had entered talks
with 'a limited number of qualified buyers' on the possible disposal of its
frozen dessert business, which brought in nearly Dollars 500m in sales last
year. General Foods, which also markets Sealtest, Light N' Lively and
Knudsen frozen desserts, is the country's largest producer of ice cream.
The company said it had not initiated the talks but had been approached by
an interested buyer. 'The nature of the offer' warranted further
exploration, a spokesperson added. It declined to disclose the names of the
interested parties or the number of companies involved in the talks.
General Foods said a sale would not involve its cultured or frozen topping
products, including those marketed under the Sealtest and Light N' Lively
labels.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bayer predicts sharp decline in
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the German-based chemicals group, expects earnings to drop 20 per
cent to around DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn) this year, following a similar decline
in the first half, and despite expected cost savings of almost DM1bn.
There is no prospect of an economic recovery in Europe, source of 62 per
cent of sales, and the favourable effects of current US dollar and yen
exchange rates will not compensate for adverse shifts in European
currencies, the company said yesterday.
Pre-tax earnings fell DM344m to DM1.4bn on sales down 5 per cent at DM21bn
in the first half, according to an interim report. The effects of an 11 per
cent drop in European turnover were partly alleviated by a 4 per cent
improvement in north America and 10 per cent elsewhere.
Sales in the healthcare divisions, the group's main protection against
recession, were stable at DM4.6bn, while all other sectors showed declines.
Polymers and industrial products were worst hit, with sales down 10 per
cent.
Healthcare performed relatively well, despite prescription limits and other
medical service reforms in Germany, and due in part to growth in
self-medication products.
Turnover at Bayer AG, the German parent, fell 12 per cent to DM8.6bn, mainly
because of lower volumes.
In agrochemicals, where sales were down 2.6 per cent, turnover improved in
the second quarter after a 9 per cent drop in the first three months of the
year.
The results, towards the top end of analysts' expectations, followed a 16
per cent drop in pre-tax profits from DM3.2bn to DM2.7bn for the whole of
1992, which led to the first cut in the group's dividend in a decade.
Last year's payout was cut DM2 to DM11, although the group made no mention
of 1993 prospects in yesterday's interim report.
Workforce reductions and other rationalisation measures appear to have been
accelerated. The group said costs were reduced by around DM500m in the first
half, and further savings of several hundred million D-Marks were expected
in the remainder of the year.
In the period under review the group shed 2,700 employees, out of the 3,000
planned to go in the full year. Personnel expenses excluding pensions fell
as a result - by 4 per cent to DM6.5bn in the group and by 8 per cent to
DM2.7bn at the parent.

TRANS WORLD Airlines, the US carrier which expects to emerge soon from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday unveiled a second-quarter net
loss of Dollars 52.3m compared with a deficit of Dollars 88.9m a year
earlier.
During the three months to June 30, the company's operating loss narrowed to
Dollars 31mm from Dollars 107.2m. This was partly offset by a Dollars 49.7m
reduction in gains from asset dispositions.
Revenues in the quarter fell to Dollars 792.9m from Dollars 964m. The
company's cost-saving measures implemented at the end of 1992, including
flight schedule reductions, resulted in a substantial decline in capacity
and traffic.
TWA said its load factor fell to 63.7 per cent from 67.3 per cent a year
earlier.
For the first six months, TWA had a net loss of Dollars 355.9m, including
extra ordinary gains of Dollars 172.9m on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn. This
compared with losses of Dollars 175.7m on revenues of Dollars 1.88bn last
year.

<TEXT>
SWIRE PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group,
reports a 17 per cent decline in first-half profit, primarily because of the
sharply reduced contribution from 51 per cent-owned airline Cathay Pacific.
The group posted profit attributable to shareholders of HKDollars 1.8bn
(USDollars 232.3m) for the six months ended June, down from HKDollars 2.18bn
in 1992.
The dividend is being held at 29 cents per A share and 5.8 cents per B
share.
Last year's interim profits were boosted by the sale of an office tower to
Hong Kong Telecom, which contributed HK630m profit.
However, Swire will book profits from the sale of its stake in the Lee
Gardens Hotel and from sales of residential units in Robinson Place during
the second half of 1993.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'The outlook for the aviation industry
continues to be uncertain.' But he predicted a stronger performance for the
remainder of the group's businesses.
Swire continues to expand its property investment portfolio, following the
recent HKDollars 2.85bn site purchase with Citic Pacific. Net rental income
from the existing portfolio - primarily Pacific Place and City Plaza -
increased by 29 per cent to HKDollars 1.03bn in the half-year.
Property development earnings will be strong up to 1995, due to further
contributions from Robinson Place, and from the joint venture redevelopment
of the former China Motor Bus depot.
The industrial division reported first-half growth, primarily due to strong
performances from soft drinks bottling in the US and Hong Kong, and from
Swire Technologies. But the trading division recorded a decline in earnings.
Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the Kadoorie family company which owns the
Peninsula hotel group, posted a 12 per cent increase in net profit for the
first half of 1993 to HKDollars 178m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: NEC cuts year's pre-tax profits
forecast to Y30bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the electronics group, has downgraded forecasts for pre-tax profits
this year, cutting its estimate for the year ending next March to Y30bn
(Dollars 283m) from Y50bn.
NEC said the main cause was the prolonged weakness of the Japanese economy.
The expected recovery in demand for personal computers had not materialised,
and the slump in business activity had kept demand for communications
equipment weak.
Although semiconductors were seeing buoyant demand from the US and Asia, NEC
was not experiencing the kind of growth in the Japanese semiconductor market
that it had expected.
The high value of the yen was also a factor behind the downward revision.
NEC was not, however, as badly affected by the yen as some other exporting
companies since it was dependent on only about 18 per cent of total sales on
overseas markets.
Sales in the year ending March are forecast at Y2,960bn compared with the
previous forecast of Y3,030. Net income is forecast to be Y16bn rather than
Y28bn expected earlier.
On a consolidated basis, sales are expected to be Y3,630bn compared with a
previous forecast of Y3,700bn, but consolidated pre-tax profits and net
income estimates are unchanged at Y40bn and Y10bn respectively, largely as a
result of strong demand for semiconductors in overseas markets and
cost-cutting measures by the company.
It is of 'paramount importance that the company make a profit this year', an
NEC spokesman said.
The company is implementing wide-ranging cost-cutting measures in an effort
to avoid making a second consecutive loss.
One area where the company is charging ahead, however, is the overseas
semiconductor business. NEC has revised its capital spending forecast for
the year for semiconductor operations on the strength of buoyant demand for
memory chips in the US and Asia. It will increase capital spending by about
Y10bn to Y80bn, the company said.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hollinger profits sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A poor performance for Canadian newspapers plus negative currency factors
pulled first-half profits sharply lower at Hollinger, the Canadian holding
company headed by Mr Conrad Black.
Despite continuing strength at the Daily Telegraph newspaper in the UK, the
company's net profit was CDollars 24.6m, or 36 cents a share, for the first
half of 1993, down from CDollars 54.1m, or 87 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped slightly to CDollars 433.5m.
Mr Black said operating profit was CDollars 45.5m, against CDollars 40.7m.
The steeper decline in after-tax earnings was due to smaller capital gains
and the weakness of sterling.

SWEDBANK, the newly-merged Swedish savings bank group, yesterday reported a
sharp contraction in first-half losses and said it was working on a plan
that would avoid it having to call on government support,
The bank did not disclose details of its proposals, and said further
information would not be available until the middle of November at the
earliest.
Last week's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank,
withdrew its request for state aid.
Swedbank said its first-half operating deficit fell to SKr1.59bn (Dollars
197m) from SKr5.88bn.
This followed an increase in operating income before loan losses to
SKr4.20bn from SKr3.38bn plus reduced credit losses of SKr5.80bn against
SKr9.25bn.
The bank said a 15 per cent reduction in costs helped explain its improved
result.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio has weakened to 8.8 per cent from 9.3 per
cent at the end of last year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: BASF dives 51% in second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at BASF, the German chemicals group, fell by 51 per cent in the
second quarter of this year to DM245m (Dollars 142.4m). This matched the 50
per cent fall in the first quarter.
Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, said the third quarter should not show any
further fall from the year before. However, he noted that last year's third
quarter had been 'very unsatisfactory'.
The fall in profits came on a 6 per cent drop in sales to DM10.39m. Mr
Strube said business was still characterised by 'low demand combined with a
surplus of supply, resulting in unrelenting pressure on prices'.
In the first half of the year, he said, BASF had been continuously in loss
at the operating level in plastics and fibres, and also in magnetic tapes.
Mr Strube said 'the principal cause of the drop in sales was the soft demand
in Germany and other European countries'. By contrast, some businesses in
North and South America had done better than last year.
The magnetic tape business remained difficult, he said. Prices in the first
half of the year were 10 per cent lower than last year, and the company had
shut down production at sites in the US, France and Germany.
'We expect BASF Magnetics to make a loss again in 1993, but we are aiming to
break even in 1994', he said.
In pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, he said, business has suffered
significantly from state intervention. 'I need only mention the German
Health Care Reform Act and the EC agricultural policy reforms,' he said.
The group's drug sales in Germany were down 13 per cent in the half-year, as
the result of lower prices in former East Germany and lower volume in West
Germany.
Mr Strube said that by the end of 1993, BASF would have shed nearly 20,000
jobs since 1989, partly through divesting businesses. In 1994, he said, the
group planned to shed more than 4,000 jobs, the majority in Germany.
'An increase in personnel costs in Germany is not acceptable in the next few
years, as the revaluation of the D-Mark has further accentuated the existing
cost disadvantages in international competition,' he declared.
In the first half, group sales were down 7 per cent from DM23.6bn to
DM22.0bn. Group profit before tax was DM483m, compared with DM972m. Sales of
plastics and fibres were down 12 per cent at DM4.83bn, in dyestuffs down 5
per cent at DM3.75bn and in chemicals 5 per cent at DM2.73bn. Sales in
agricultural products were down 13 per cent at DM2.47bn, and in oil and gas
were up 4 per cent at DM2.31bn.
European sales were down 11 per cent at DM13.35bn. Sales in North America
were up 3 per cent at DM4.29bn. Sales in Asia, Australia and Africa were
down 6 per cent at DM2.03bn, and in Latin America up 9 per cent at DM1.17bn.

ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, has raised its annual dividend
despite dipping into the red in the second half following heavy asset write
downs.
Reporting yesterday for the first time as part of the of Campbells Soup, the
US food company, Arnotts announced an 18 per cent net profit rise to
ADollars 47.2m (USDollars 31.8m) for the year ended June on a 4 per cent
sales slide to ADollars 662.1m.
The company made a loss of ADollars 6.6m in the second half of the year
compared with a profit of ADollars 17.2m last time. However, the annual
dividend is going up from 23.5 cents a share to 29 cents.
The year's result included abnormal losses of ADollars 32.9m (ADollars 18.7m
loss previously), mainly reflecting a ADollars 47.9m assets write-down.
Mr Paul Bourke, managing director, said the company had now completed most
of its programme to divest non-core activities and focus on biscuit making.
'We are now in great shape to concentrate on our three key strategies for
the remainder of the 1990s,' he said.

<TEXT>
REYNOLDS METALS, the US integrated aluminium manufacturer, is to buy Miller
Brewing's aluminium beverage can manufacturing operations.
The deal will make Reynolds the third-largest aluminium can producer in the
world.
The transaction will increase Reynold's US aluminium can capacity by nearly
50 per cent, according to Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds' chairman.
The acquisition is part of the company's strategy to expand its value-added
aluminium businesses.
Commodity aluminium prices are very weak, and Reynolds recently announced
plans to shut significant portions of its US primary aluminium
manufacturing.
A spokesman for Miller, which is part of Philip Morris, the US food and
tobacco group, said the company was divesting the can properties because it
wished to focus on its core business of brewing beer.
Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but Reynolds said the deal would be
financed through short-term borrowing against existing lines of credit.
Once the purchase is finalised, the companies will enter a long-term
agreement where Reynolds will supply Miller with 'substantially all' of its
beverage can requirements.
Miller's can plants, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Fulton, New York, Fort
Worth, Texas, Reidsville, North Carolina, and Moultrie, Georgia, have a
combined capacity of 5bn beverage cans per year, and employ more than 800
people.

<TEXT>
RENAULT, the state-controlled French car group, yesterday announced a fall
of almost 90 per cent in first-half pre-tax profits and said that it saw no
sign of an improvement in the depressed European vehicles industry.
The company said that pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1993 were
FFr730m (Dollars 123.93m) compared with FFr5.44bn in the same period last
year. Sales fell by about 8.4 per cent to FFr87.11bn.
Car analysts said that Renault's results were slightly better than expected.
'They represent a good performance in the context of the European market,'
said Mr Christopher Moore, car industry analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Renault said that its shareholdings in the Swedish car group Volvo had
reduced its profits by about FFr277m in the first half. But only FFr39m of
this negative contribution came in the second quarter and the first half
figure as a whole was an improvement over the same period in 1992.
In the cars division, which represented about 83 per cent of the group's
commercial and industrial turnover, sales fell from FFr79.7bn to FFr72.1bn
in the first half.
The figures were buoyed by the successful introduction of the Twingo small
car, but the particularly steep decline in car sales in southern Europe,
where Renault has a large presence, meant that the company's overall share
of the European car market slipped from 10.4 per cent to 10.3 per cent.
In the industrial vehicles division, including buses and trucks, Renault
increased its share of the European market from 9.2 per cent in the first
half of last year to 9.5 per cent this year. Sales in the division were
fairly stable at FFr12.63bn.
Renault said that the company planned to reduce production to respond to the
continued weakness of demand in the car and industrial vehicles market.
The company added that it would also intensify its efforts to reduce costs
and financial charges and increase productivity.
But it added that sales and profits 'would suffer, despite these efforts,
from the strongly negative impact of the economic environment'.

CONTINENTAL, the German tyre manufacturing company, saw earnings slide for
the first six months of the current year. Net profits sunk to DM31.3m
(Dollars 18.5m) compared with DM118.7m in the first half of last year, on
turnover down nearly 8 per cent to DM4.52bn.
The Hanover-based group said the profits outcome was worse than anticipated,
attributing the result to strong pressure on prices in the 'heavily
declining' European vehicle industry as well as problems in other
recession-stricken sectors such as machine construction, mining and military
engineering.
The crisis in the German vehicle market - down 25 per cent in production
terms from its 1992 peak - has led to overcapacity in the tyre market,
unleashing what Continental called 'fierce price wars'. Continental said it
had also lost sales volumes to manufacturers in the UK, Spain and Italy,
countries whose currencies have depreciated against the D-Mark over the past
year.
Continental said it was not expecting business conditions to be any worse in
the second half of the year than in the first, although a revival in the
German economy was not to be expected before next year.
It saw no reason to change the forecast that the group would be in the black
for the year as a whole. Last year, the group made profits of DM133m after a
loss of DM128.2m in 1991.
The group said that it would step up the cost-cutting measures in order to
combat a 'far-reaching crisis' in its core markets. The number of employees
in the group has been cut by 5,000 over the past three years, a process
which is set to continue in the second half.
It has also taken further rationalisation measures, for example reducing the
complexity of production plants, improving the efficiency of logistics and
distribution systems and relocating manufacturing facilities to less
expensive production sites.
Continental predicted that sales for the full year would be slightly less
than the DM9.6bn achieved in 1992.
It said that the number of employees at the end of June was 51,448, about 1
per cent higher than a year before. But for the effect of acquisitions,
employee numbers would however have been down by 3,500 or 7 per cent.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Europe results disappoint Aegon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG results in the US and the Netherlands helped lift net profit at
Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurance company, to Fl 497m (Dollars 255m)
in the first half of 1993, a 7.3 per cent rise on the same period of 1992.
Aegon did not give a geographic breakdown, but results in Europe outside the
Netherlands did not meet expectations, largely due to setbacks on the
British non-life market. However, turnover in Europe showed a small rise in
spite of the negative effect of recent currency movements and the disposal
of shares in a joint venture in Greece.
Group turnover rose by 10.6 per cent to Fl 8.88bn. In the US, sales and
operating profit showed a strong rise. Dutch results were also good, despite
heightened competition.
Aegon said it planned to raise its 1993 interim dividend to Fl 1.15 in cash
from Fl 1.10 last year. For the first time, shareholders will have the
option of receiving an interim payment in shares. The dividend payments will
be worth 2 to 5 per cent less than the cash dividend but are generally more
attractive for tax reasons.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: VW unlikely to break even this
year - Results from European carmakers reflect the turmoil in the industry

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN is unlikely to meet its goal of break-even in the current year
without the help of extraordinary income, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chairman
of the group's managing board, has told a German newspaper.
In the interview in today's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
Mr Ferdinand Piech added that there is a possibility that the group will
omit a dividend on its ordinary shares in 1993. Last year's dividend was DM2
per share, cut from DM11 in 1991.
The Volkswagen senior management has for several months confidently forecast
the group would be back in the black by the year end.
The group lost DM1.6bn (Dollars 940m) in the first six months of 1993, a
DM2bn reversal from the profit of DM445m made in the first half of last
year. Turnover for the half-year was DM38.4bn against DM43.75bn in the
comparable period.
Volkswagen said the result represented a considerable reduction in losses in
the second quarter. In the first quarter of the year the group lost
DM1.25bn: losses for April to June were by comparison a modest DM350m.
The board said it was working hard to achieve the 'turning point' in
profitability in the second half.
The group made a small profit in July and Volkswagen said it would strive to
achieve further monthly profits, but it stopped short of saying that the
group would break even for the the year as a whole.
A letter to shareholders praised Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's
purchasing chief who joined the German group from arch rival General Motors
earlier this year, for his role in helping to reduce losses despite the
disastrous economic environment.
Volkswagen said that worldwide production dropped 19 per cent to 1.5m
vehicles in the six month period, whilst deliveries to customers dropped 13
per cent to 1.61m units.
For the Volkswagen marque, deliveries to customers fell 11.1 per cent;
deliveries of the luxury Audi marque dropped 27.3 per cent and SEAT by 22.7
per cent. The only marque to increase sales was the Czech-based Skoda
division where unit sales rose by 23.1 per cent.
VW predicted that it would sell 3.2m vehicles for the year as a whole.
Capital investments in the group for the six months fell by 38 per cent to
DM2.68bn. The loss for the Volkswagen parent company in the first half was
DM946m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish construction groups rise
sharply

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANSKA and NCC, the two leading Swedish construction and real estate
groups, yesterday reported sharply improved first-half figures. However,
they relied on gains from divestments and the absence of write-downs to
compensate for the continued deterioration in market conditions.
The companies predicted they would make a profit before property write-downs
for the full year, although Skanska took the gloss off its forecast of a
SKr2.2bn (Dollars 272m) profit by saying it was set to make further
'substantial' write-downs again this year. Both groups made big losses in
1992 because of huge property write-downs.
Skanska saw first-half pre-tax profits rise to SKr1.38bn from SKr813m, while
NCC returned a SKr304m profit, against a SKr7m loss for the same 1992
period. Skanska recorded capital gains from divestments of SKr366m and NCC
gains of SKr476m.
The continuing downturn in the Swedish construction market was largely
responsible for cutting Skanska's first-half revenues to SKr14.0bn from
SKr15.2bn and for its prediction of a 12 per cent fall in full-year revenues
to SKr28.2bn.
However, the group's operating profit before financial items rose to
SK1.50bn from SKr1.30bn, and its performance benefited further from a
reduction in financial costs to SKr128m from SKr488m. Full-year financial
expenses should be SKr1bn less than last year at around SKr700m.
The group said real estate markets in Sweden, Europe and the US remained
weak.
Reduced Swedish building activity also explained the drop in NCC's revenues
to SKr8.6bn from SKr10.4bn. Profits in the group's main unit, NCC Bygg, fell
to SKr288m from SKr378m. Excluding capital gains and losses from associated
companies, the group made a SKr108m first-half loss, compared with a SKr218m
profit.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dutch paper group swings into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group created out of a big domestic
merger earlier this year, swung into a net loss of Fl 16m (Dollars 8.2m) in
the first half of 1993 from a pro forma net profit of Fl 161m a year
earlier.
The company said it would be taking an extraordinary charge of Fl 300m to
pay for projects aimed at boosting profits and integrating businesses
previously owned by the three merger partners KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and
VRG.
It blamed the downturn on a decline in sales and on lower selling prices.
Turmoil in European exchange rates was a contributing factor.
KNP BT warned in May that it had fallen into losses and that it would be
making reorganisation provisions. Yesterday, the company - which is 17 per
cent owned by the Canadian forestry group MacMillan Bloedel - repeated its
forecast that it would be difficult to post a net profit before
extraordinary items for the full year.
All four of the group's business sectors - paper merchanting, graphic
systems, packaging and paper production - posted lower operating results in
the first half, with graphic systems and paper production showing small
operating losses. Group sales were down nearly 10 per cent to Fl 5.9bn.
The graphic systems sector was hit by a decline in sales in Europe as well
as by the devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira.
In paper production, industry-wide overcapacity put KNP BT's margins under
pressure, in spite of a decline in raw material prices.
Part of the Fl 300m charge will be used towards the divestment of four
graphic distribution companies in Europe and Asia, in line with an agreement
made with the EC's merger authorities.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Volvo back in the black despite
fall in sales
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle manufacturer, yesterday confounded market
expectations by announcing a return to profit in the first half despite a
further fall in its sales of cars and trucks.
A rebound to an operating profit of SKr166m (Dollars 20.5m) from a loss of
SKr835m last year pushed Volvo to a profit after financial items of SKr380m,
compared to a deficit in the first half of 1992 of SKr103m.
The surprise result, which contrasted with expectations of losses up to
SKr550m, sparked a sharp rise in its shares on an otherwise weak Stockholm
stock market. The most-traded A shares closed up SKr11 at SKr454.
Volvo said a change in the accounting of some tool costs had bolstered
operating income by about SKr400m. The dramatic fall in the value of the
Swedish krona compared to the first half of 1992 had also increased
operating profits by about SKr200m. But it said that the turnaround was
mainly driven by rationalisation measures, cost-cutting and lower research
and development costs.
Two out of three Swedish car assembly plants are being shut and the number
of employees in the group has fallen to 56,400 - a drop of 13,000 since
1990.
Sales rose to SKr48.8bn from SKr41.4bn, but Volvo said there was a decline
of 2 per cent when exchange rate changes were excluded.
The number of cars sold fell to 156,400 in the first half from 160,100 a
year earlier, including a tumble of more than 20 per cent in Europe. Sales
of medium-heavy and heavy trucks were bolstered by sharply higher demand in
North America, but still fell by 3 per cent to 23,600.
However, although details were not given, Volvo said both the truck and car
groups reported operating profits, as did the Volvo Penta marine engine
group and the aero engine group.
Volvo's share of Renault's income stemming from its cross-shareholdings in
the French group fell sharply to SKr220m from SKr852m. But income from
Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group, more than doubled to
SKr1.04bn.
Net interest expenses rose to SKr565m from SKr315m, but net debt was down
slightly from the end of 1992 at SKr12.9bn and interest charges fell off in
the second quarter.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Consumer credit boost for Cattle's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING strong demand for consumer credit lifted interim profits at
Cattle's Holdings.
The pre-tax outcome amounted to Pounds 6.9m, compared with Pounds 6.66m.
However, under FRS 3, last year's figure was restated from the originally
reported Pounds 5.2m before an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.4m from profits
on the flotation of a 55 per cent stake in Roseby's, the curtain and linen
stores group.
Turnover from continuing operations rose to Pounds 98.7m, up from Pounds
94.8m.
Turnover for the consumer credit division, led by Shopacheck, the
door-to-door weekly credit business, rose to Pounds 77.8m from Pounds 72.4m.
Profits rose 32 per cent from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 6.8m.
Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, described the consumer credit division's
performance as exceptionally good. He attributed the profit rise to control
of bad debt, containment of costs, interest rate cuts and an increased
customer base.
The corporate services sector, with turnover of Pounds 7.05m (Pounds 8.12m),
reduced losses from Pounds 265,000 to Pounds 19,000. Mr Cran predicted that
the problems caused by recession were coming to an end, and that the
division would return to the black by the end of the year.
The insurance services division reported a steep fall in profit to Pounds
182,000 (Pounds 330,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.9m). Mr Cran
said the division had lost clients to direct line insurers. While the group
was confident of winning clients back, it forecast the results of this
division to be below expectations for the year as a whole.
Earnings per share were 4.25p, compared with a revised 4.26p under FRS 3.
Last time's earnings were originally 3.16p.
The interim dividend goes up to 1.9p (1.6p).

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine deficit widens to Pounds
2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFRED McAlpine, the UK construction and building materials group, suffered
an increased pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.5m for the six months to April 30
1993.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 71,000 for the corresponding
period.
Mr Oliver Whitehead, who was appointed chief executive in May, warned that
large areas of the UK construction market remained deeply depressed.
Reports of a recovery had been greatly overstated, he said. Even if
increased spending on infrastructure was approved now by government and
private sector utilities, it would take several years for projects to come
to fruition.
Mr Whitehead said that ministers had recently announced ambitious plans for
widening motorways and improving railways but had so far not indicated where
the money was coming from.
Group turnover in the first half had fallen from Pounds 250m to Pounds
241.3m. After all deductions the group incurred losses per share of 3.3p,
compared with earnings of 0.2p at the corresponding stage last year. The
company, however, opted to pay a maintained interim dividend of 3p.
There were some bright spots, directors said. The UK housing market had
begun to recover, while construction activity was increasing in North and
South Carolina, where McAlpine's US interests are mainly based.
Pre-tax profit in the US during the first half fell from Pounds 528,000 to
Pounds 85,000 due to a wet winter and losses on two contracts. Profits, but
for these two contracts, would have been about the same level as the
previous year, said Mr Whitehead.
He expected US profits to be higher for the full year.
UK housing profits were also expected to rise after a sharply-reduced first
half loss, down from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 254,000. The number of house
sales rose from 469 to 593 while operating margins rose from 3.3 per cent to
4.7 per cent.
On the UK construction side, which in last year's first half made a Pounds
2.02m profit, losses of Pounds 486,000 reflected the difficult trading
conditions and a Pounds 750,000 exceptional loss on disposals.
UK aggregates incurred a loss of Pounds 161,000 compared to a Pounds 490,000
profit.
COMMENT
McAlpine's share price has outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by more
than 70 per cent since January 1. A 2p fall to 213p, after yesterday's
announcement, still left the shares just short of their high for the year of
218p. The efforts of Mr Whiteheads's predecessor Mr Graeme Odgers, now
chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in reducing costs has
left the company well placed to take advantage of a recovery. The businesses
and the balance sheet, with gearing of only 22 per cent, are soundly placed.
Pre-tax profits this year could reach Pounds 6m, producing earnings just
sufficient to cover a maintained total dividend for the year of 6.5p. It is
difficult, however, to envisage the share price continuing to outperform
while the UK housing recovery shows little sign of spreading to other areas
of construction.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Church more than doubled at Pounds 565,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHURCH &amp; Co, the shoe maker and retailer, more than doubled pre-tax profits
from Pounds 244,000 to Pounds 565,000 in the six months to June 30 on sales
up 11 per cent to Pounds 33.1m.
The company attributed the advance to a sharply improved performance at
Church Footwear and Joseph Cheaney, the UK manufacturing subsidiaries and at
A Jones, which operates all the Church and Jones shops in the UK.
The situation overseas, however, continued to be difficult. The US and
Canadian companies sustained losses in highly competitive trading conditions
and moves were under way to strengthen Canadian management.
Profits from Belgium were marginally lower and the French retail company
incurred a small loss.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3p on earnings per share of 2.8p
(1.9p).
A Jones benefited from improved trading conditions for UK shoe retailing and
achieved a turnround from losses of Pounds 26,000 to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 279,000. Sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 14.8m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: US costs knock Pentland to Pounds 6.7m -
Reduced interest receipts add to effect of closing lossmaking operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES AND closure costs at its US trade finance business and lower interest
receipts hit Pentland Group in the six months to June 30.
After bearing costs of Pounds 9.5m connected with the US operation, the
consumer brands company was left with reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds
6.7m, against Pounds 19.7m, on an FRS 3 basis.
The share price fell 7p to 106p.
However, the underlying improvement in operating profits from continuing
businesses and associates was 14 per cent and the interim dividend is raised
to 1.16p (1.04p).
This follows a 12p special dividend paid in April from the profit on the
sale of Pentland's 20 per cent stake in Adidas, the sports goods company,
realised last autumn.
Mr Stephen Rubin, chairman, said the results were 'clearly disappointing.'
Finchside, the US trade finance subsidiary which financed imports to the US,
had been hit by bad debts. It lost Pounds 2.2m in 1992, of which Pounds 2m
was in the second half.
Mr Rubin said: 'After careful consideration we have discontinued this
activity as it was not central to our strategy and we were no longer
satisfied with the risk-reward ratio in the business.'
In the half year under review it suffered trading losses of Pounds 2.8m and
made a Pounds 6.7m provision for closure costs.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said the business had been set up more
than three years ago and made profits in the early stages. But US recession
had hit importers, losses escalated and Pentland decided to 'bite the
bullet.'
He said: 'With the benefit of hindsight, we made an error of judgment.'
Group turnover increased 32 per cent to Pounds 198.4m, with acquisitions
chipping in Pounds 28.2m and continuing operations increasing their
contribution by 13 per cent to Pounds 168.1m.
Operating profits from continuing businesses fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds
3.4m. Growth from the Speedo swimwear business was offset by weakness in the
footwear and international trade services divisions.
Mr Farrant said shifts in fashion had turned against trainers, although
Kickers, another of its footwear brands, had fared well.
Acquisitions, notably Woods Wire, a US electrical goods group, and Berghaus,
the UK specialist outdoor clothing company, contributed Pounds 1.6m.
Associate profits, from the 26 per cent stake in Authentic Fitness, the
quoted US distributor for the Speedo swimwear brand in North and Central
America, were Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.5m).
Interest receivable fell from Pounds 14m to Pounds 9.5m, largely because of
lower interest rates on its Pounds 252.9m cash pile.
The tax rate rose sharply, because of the US losses, and after the special
dividend there was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 46m (profit Pounds
9.5m).
Earnings per share were 0.41p (3.69p) or 2.27p adjusting for the closure
provisions.
At the year end the group had net cash of Pounds 347.3m, but this had fallen
to Pounds 252.9m by the period end after the Pounds 43.3m cost of the
special dividend and Pounds 42m spent on acquisitions, including two US
footwear companies.
Mr Rubin said the group was seeking 'further suitable acquisitions.'

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Cantab poised for listing in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the UK bio-pharmaceutical company quoted on Nasdaq
in the US, is to come to the London market through a placing or open offer
likely to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m.
In July last year the company sold 1m shares at Dollars 10 (670p) in an
initial public offering, since when the stock has slipped to about Dollars 8
in line with a fall that has hit much of the US bio-technology sector.
The company also raised Dollars 5m through a private placing in the US
earlier this year.
Mr Paul Hancock, chief executive, said it had always been the group's
intention to raise money in its home market.
Like many of the bio-technology companies that have come to the market,
Cantab is some way from developing a marketable drug. The candidate drug it
currently believes most likely to make it to market is LM-CD45, a white
blood cell modulator which it is developing in collaboration with Baxter
Healthcare, the large US corporation.
The drug, if successfully developed, would be used to prevent rejection of
kidneys after transplant operations and could replace the use of
immuno-suppressive drugs. The product is currently in stage 2 clinical
trials which means that at the earliest it will make it to market in 1997.
The three other products Cantab expects to go into clinical trials shortly
would not be on the market before 1998.
The group was co-founded in 1989 by Mr Alan Munro, former head of immunology
at Cambridge University. It is pursuing research in organ transplant
rejection, cervical cancer, genital herpes, genital warts and inflammatory
bowel disease.
In the six months to June 30 1993, Cantab lost Pounds 1.2m, compared with a
deficit of Pounds 1.4m in the year to end-December. It has cash of about
Pounds 8.1m.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is adviser to the issue. A prospectus is expected
within the next two weeks.

EFT Group, the provider of asset finance, lifted pre-tax profits by 25 per
cent in the six months to June 30.
Revenue fell slightly to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds 3.7m) but the pre-tax result
came out at Pounds 881,000 against Pounds 706,000.
Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said that trading since June 30 had continued
at the buoyant levels achieved in the first half. He expected the new
commercial vehicle contract hire and truck rental division to make a small
contribution to second half profits.
Earnings rose from 1.49p to 1.79p and the interim dividend is raised to
0.46p (0.4p).

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind 26% advance to Pounds 1m
at Bostrom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSTROM, the vehicle seating and specialist engineering group, lifted
pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 1m in the six months to June 30
thanks to the acquisition in February of AJW Holdings and the turnround to
profits of its joint venture.
The improvement, from Pounds 796,000, was struck on turnover of Pounds 24.2m
(Pounds 17.1m) of which AJW, a fellow automotive components maker acquired
for an initial Pounds 1.79m, contributed Pounds 3.66m. Operating profits
were flat, though AJW chipped in Pounds 135,000.
Interest payable rose to Pounds 231,000 (Pounds 201,000) because of the
Pounds 2m debt that AJW carried, but Bostrom benefited from a Pounds 160,000
profits (deficit Pounds 73,000) contribution from BFA UK, the joint venture
making seating frames and components for Jaguar.
Mr Colin Howell, managing director, said the group had seen higher sales to
both Jaguar - 'admittedly from a very low base' - and Land Rover, where the
Discovery had greatly increased volumes. Volumes were also up at Rover and
Honda and, even though they fell at Ford, Bostrom lifted its market share
there.
Continental Europe was 'hurting the seating division, but this was
compensated for by Japan, Australia and the improved UK market,' said Mr
Howell.
Mr Howell said that current order books were 'much stronger' than they had
been a year ago.
Earnings per share rose to 5.1p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.5p.

FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Irish Life lifts premium income
by 9% to IPounds 340m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH LIFE, the largest funds manager in the life and pensions market in
Ireland, reported a 9 per cent upturn in premium income to IPounds 340.2m
(Pounds 318.8m) for the six months to June 30 1993.
Investment income improved 32 per cent to IPounds 154.6m (Pounds 144.8m).
The main growth in business occurred in the US through the Interstate
subsidiary, where premium income almost doubled from IPounds 32.5m to
IPounds 62.3m.
Mr David Kingston, group managing director, said new recurring premium
business in the core Irish market had declined slightly 'because of the
taxation situation in Ireland, which benefits short-term savings at the
expense of long-term investments and a general lack of buoyancy in the
savings market'.
He said a marked capital appreciation of IPounds 446.8m on linked
investments was a result of strong advances in equity prices since
devaluation of the punt last January, while the sharp drop in interest rates
which had paralleled this development had improved the perspectives for new
single premium business.
The cashing-in of single premium policies was a significant source of the
downturn in premium income in the full year accounts to the end of 1992, and
according to Mr Kingston, continued to be 'a major problem in January' prior
to the devaluation.
Claims and the cashing-in of policies, which have grown sharply from IPounds
305m to IPounds 425m in the first half this year, 'are now running back at
historic levels', he said.
Group total assets have increased by IPounds 713m to IPounds 4.95bn since
the end of 1992. No embedded value figure was given with the interim
results.

VIRGIN Communications, the holding company for Virgin Group's entertainment,
broadcasting, publishing and production interests, yesterday said it would
sell a 15 per cent stake in a subsidiary for about Dollars 25m (Pounds
16.8m) to Hasbro, the US toy company.
The subsidiary, Virgin Interactive Entertainment, develops and publishes
interactive entertainment games for Nintendo, Sega and several computer
platforms. The company has licensed a number of Hasbro products in the last
five years including the Monopoly and Risk board games.
Virgin and Hasbro have also agreed to form a joint venture within Virgin
Interactive to develop and market Hasbro's existing products and other
properties.
The Hasbro stake in Virgin Interactive, which is subject to regulatory
approval, will dilute the holding of Mr Richard Branson, who controls the
company.
Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Interactive and Mr Branson's
brother-in-law, said: 'The proceeds from Hasbro's investment will provide
VIE with increased financial flexibility as strategic opportunities arise to
expand the business.' The two companies plan to work together in product
development, marketing and acquisitions.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Wolseley in Pounds 51m US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLSELEY, the heating and plumbing distributor, has turned its sights back
to the US after several continental European acquisitions.
It is paying up to Pounds 51.5m for Erb Lumber, a distributor of lumber and
associated products with 47 leased branches in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.
With Wolseley raising more than Pounds 100m through share placings with a
wide range of institutions yesterday, further acquisitions are expected
soon.
The group is financing the Erb acquisition through a vendor placing of 8.1m
new ordinary shares at 632p each. The shares closed yesterday unchanged at
654p.
At the same time Wolseley placed another 8.7m shares raising a further
Pounds 55m. The 16.8m shares represent about 6.8 per cent of the equity. The
placings were separated to comply with Stock Exchange requirements.
Mr Richard Ireland, finance director, said yesterday that it seemed sensible
to make a cash placing at the same time as the Erb placing as discussions
were under way on further possible purchases. He declined, however, to give
any details.
Erb Lumber, an 80 year old company, returned pre-tax profits of Dollars
12.1m (Pounds 8m) last year on turnover of Dollars 271.3m.
Wolseley said the acquisition would substantially boost its US lumber
business and more than double annual sales of Carolina Builders Corporation
of Raleigh, North Carolina, a wholly owned subsidiary. Total US turnover for
Wolseley last year was Pounds 997m.
The group will pay Pounds 46.3m, about 90 per cent of the total price, on
completion. The balance will be paid in two further instalments based on
Erb's net asset value on August 31.
In March, Wolseley reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits of
Pounds 47.6m for the six months to end-January on turnover of Pounds 1.1bn.
Analysts are looking for a full-year outcome of Pounds 110m or more when the
results appear in October.

Two directors of Hodder Headline, the independent publishing company,
resigned yesterday. Mr Patrick Wright and Mr Tom Biggs-Davison were leaving
by mutual agreement, said Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of the
group which was formed in June when his Headline company took over Hodder &amp;
Stoughton.
Mr Brian Steven, managing director of the education division, and Mr Richard
Stileman, managing director of Edward Arnold (Academic and Professional
Division), will be appointed directors from September 1.
Mr Hely Hutchinson said the board changes contributed to the group's
overhead reduction programme and clarified the management structure. Earlier
this month Hodder made 72 staff redundant following the merger. Further
redundancies will follow when Hodder's distribution centre near Sevenoaks is
closed.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil dispels growth concern with rise
to Pounds 67m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company that recently
bought Securiguard for Pounds 75.7m after a hostile takeover battle,
yesterday went a long way towards dispelling concern that growth in its
existing businesses was running out of steam.
The group reported a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 67.1m for
the six months to end-June on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 252.4m, and a
near-30 per cent increase in earnings per share to 4.39p.
The interim dividend is increased by 31 per cent to 0.84p.
'We are pleased that the UK, North America and Asia have performed well
against a background of difficulties in continental Europe,' said Mr Clive
Thompson, chief executive.
Rentokil's bid for Securiguard, which has cleaning and personnel businesses
as well as the manned property guarding business, alarmed some analysts who
believed the group was diversifying into low margin businesses and that the
limits of organic growth were being reached in the existing businesses.
Mr Thompson said the types of businesses the group had acquired were low
margin for some people but not for Rentokil who could charge people who
wanted a quality product.
The group pushed up margins in the UK, where an 8 per cent increase in sales
to Pounds 93.3m produced profits up nearly 20 per cent at Pounds 26.6m.
Healthcare, pest control and hygiene showed steady growth and tropical
plants had grown very quickly. Property care, hit by the slowdown in the
rate at which people have been moving house, had also showed some benefit
from the improvements in the improving economy.
Continental European sales rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 77.2m with profits
up 32 per cent to Pounds 18.8m. France, Switzerland and Sweden had grown
strongly while there had been some slowdown in Belgium and Germany.
Profits in North America rose 50 per cent to Pounds 5.2m on sales up a third
at Pounds 29.2m, while Asia Pacific and Africa increased turnover by 30 per
cent to Pounds 52.7m and profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 14.2m
Net cash at the end of the period was Pounds 73.3m.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Slough Estates drops to Pounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOUGH ESTATES, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday
announced a 14.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 28.8m for the
six months ended June 30.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the group's
prospects, saying that there had been a 'significant' increase in inquiries
for space.
'As economic recovery becomes more evident and business confidence returns,
so I become more optimistic of the medium-term prospects of the group for
both improved property occupancy and values,' he said.
The profit decline mainly reflected a reduction in the amount of interest
capitalised. Profit before interest and tax rose 18 per cent to Pounds
57.2m.
FRS 3, the new accounting standard on reporting financial performance,
required Slough to recognise Pounds 2m of profit from investment property
sales.
The standard defines profits on disposal of investment properties in the
profit and loss account as the difference between the net proceeds of the
sale and the prior year-end book value.
At June 30, the group had net borrowings of Pounds 663m and shareholders'
equity, based on December 1992 valuations, of about Pounds 1.07bn. Net
gearing was 62 per cent, compared with 83 per cent at end-1992. The Pounds
147m rights issue in March was 87 per cent taken up.
Earnings per share fell from 6.5p to 4.4p. The interim dividend is unchanged
at 3.1p.
COMMENT
Slough Estate's share price, which closed 1p down at 241p, has nearly
tripled in value over the past year, reflecting a sea change in sentiment
towards the sector. A year ago, Slough was cutting its dividend and worrying
about the dim prospects for any short-term improvement in the property
market. Yesterday, it was pointing to a sustained improvement in business
confidence and a significant increase in inquiries for space, making it
sufficiently optimistic to plan a new speculative development on its Slough
trading estate. Nonetheless, anyone looking for hard evidence of an
improvement in the underlying property market in yesterday's results would
be disappointed. In the UK, occupancy rates actually fell as success in
letting new buildings was offset by tenant failures and lease expiries. The
likelihood of slow, if steady, progress on the letting front will restrict
Slough's scope to increase its dividend for several years. That leaves
potential investors with a solid, but unexciting, prospect of a near-average
yield for the sector and a share price that is at a slight discount to the
company's likely year-end net asset value.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Labsystems helps Life Sciences to 22%
advance at Pounds 10.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer,
increased pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 8.48m to Pounds 10.3m
in the six months to June 30, helped by the May acquisition of Labsystems,
the Helsinki-based instruments group.
However, Mr Simon Constantine, acquisitions and finance director, pointed
out that about half of Labsystems' Pounds 1.54m trading profit contribution
derived from a one-off shipment of about Pounds 1.1m to its equipment
distributor in the US, on which few expenses devolved to the enlarged group.
Trading profits of continuing operations expanded to Pounds 8.64m, compared
with Pounds 7.83m, with which Mr Constantine was 'content', although he said
that the group had had 'no help from the market, especially in the first
quarter'.
But he said that the acquisition of Labsystems - for Pounds 33.5m funded by
equity (Pounds 12m) and debt - had created a platform for the medium-term
growth of the group.
Before the purchase, 67 per cent of Life Sciences' business was in North
America and 23 per cent in Europe.
After the acquisition Labsystems' European bias had shifted the percentages
to 56 and 35 per cent respectively.
As well as geographical balance, the acquisition also complemented Life
Sciences' range of products, increasing consumables from 5 to 20 per cent of
the product whole.
Since the end of the period the group has also acquired Alko Diagnostic, a
maker of consumables, for Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 4.4m) and Memphis Biomedical
Services for up to Dollars 1.5m.
Consequently. group debt has risen to Pounds 30.9m, giving gearing of about
70 per cent.
Mr Constantine conceded that the balance sheet was 'a bit stretched'.
The interim dividend is lifted by 17 per cent to 1.4p compared with 1.2p,
payable from fully diluted earnings per share of 4.3p against 3.8p.

Mallett, the antiques dealer, returned to profit in the first half of 1993,
making Pounds 409,000 pre-tax. Last time the loss was Pounds 485,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5.13m as business gradually improved
over the period with a very good result in June. Margins were not as high as
the company would have liked but that was the result of selling a number of
items on commission.
The directors stated sales in the second half have so far held up well.
Earnings per share were 1.98p (losses 3.51p). Interim dividends are restored

Earnings of 2.5p compared with previous losses of 1.2p.

Interest costs fell from Pounds 213,000 to Pounds 74,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PEGASUS Group, the USM-quoted producer and distributor of accounting
software, trebled pre-tax profits in the first half of 1993 to Pounds 1.02m.
For the 1992 period to July 31 the figure was Pounds 335,000.
Revenue was boosted by the introduction of Version 6 of the mainstream
Pegasus Senior product and statutory upgrades, said Mr Jonathan
Hubbard-Ford, chief executive.
The impact of those upgrades would not recur in the second half and software
sales would continue at reduced levels despite the introduction of Pegasus
Opera in the final quarter.
The benefit of integrating the Pegasus Supply business with Stockforms had
become increasingly evident.
The group was in a period of transition as resources were increasingly
committed to the development and marketing of Pegasus Opera, Mr Hubbard-Ford
emphasised.
An interim dividend of 2p is declared, payable from earnings per share of
9.4p. That compared with 3.5p from 3.8p last time, which was part of a 17
months accounting period.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hambro Country back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PICK-UP in activity in the housing market restored the profitability of
Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and financial services chain, which
yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m for the half-year ended
June 30, compared with an adjusted loss of Pounds 3.87m for the same period
in 1992.
The return to profitability was accompanied by the restoration of an interim
dividend of 0.5p.
The turnround in the company's fortunes was attributed to the improvement in
the housing market, particularly in the first four months of the year,
together with a higher market share by its estate agency chain and an
improved contribution from Wright Oliphant and the Hambro Countrywide
Relocation's asset management activities.
The results included a gain of Pounds 11.4m from the sale of its remaining
stake in Hambro Legal Protection to Hambro Insurance Service Group.
At the end of June, the group had 452 estate agency office, which sold
23,263 houses in the first six months, a 17 per cent increase over last
year. The average price of houses sold fell by 5.9 per cent to Pounds
61,750.
The estate agency base financial consultants arranged 8,093 mortgages worth
Pounds 364m and 9,458 life assurance policies.
Hambro said it was keen to expand its network of estate agencies, which it
believed could be profitable in its own right and an effective distribution
channel for financial services.
It said it expected the Treasury's recent decision about the disclose of
commissions and other charges in the life assurance industry to be neutral
on Hambro Guardian's competitive position.
Earnings per share were 3.77p, compared to adjusted losses per share of
1.26p in 1992. The interim dividend compared with a total payment of 0.05p
last year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional redundancy costs leave Weir
down 10% at Pounds 16.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEIR GROUP, the engineering company with about 60 per cent of its sales
overseas, reported a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year
to July 2.
The decline from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 16.7m was after an exceptional item
of Pounds 2.43m covering redundancy and reorganisation costs.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.6m).
All but Pounds 400,000 of the exceptional charge related to severance pay
for the loss of 200 employees, reducing the workforce to 6,700. The scale of
the job cuts surprised analysts. The group said there were unlikely to be
further reductions in the second half.
Turnover rose to Pounds 223.5m (Pounds 194.8m.) Earnings fell to 7.4p
(8.2p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.925p (1.75p).
Lord Weir, chairman, said the company had a flat half, but was confident
that orders would pick up in the UK.
The level of inquiries remained encouraging, although a fall in spare part
orders and bookings would affect the second half.
The outlook on the Continent was worse than expected. 'The cut in prices has
more than swallowed up our exporting advantage since the UK left the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism last year.'
The period ended with Pounds 67m net cash, against Pounds 52m at the end of
1992.
Lord Weir said he was pleased with the recent acquisition of Darchem, and
the group was looking at further acquisitions.
COMMENT
For a company as predictable as Weir, its announcement of a Pounds 2.4m
redundancy and reorganisation charge took the market by surprise. But the
lay-off of 200 employees appears to have more to do with productivity gains
than a serious downturn in the group's markets. The built-in strength of
long-term contracts has enabled the group to largely buck the recession
which has affected many of its competitors. The profit fall is
disappointing, but was mainly because of the exceptional charge. It would
also be unfair to forget that last year's performance was particularly good
even by Weir's standards. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
37.5m the shares - down 30p to 318p - are fairly priced on a prospective
multiple of 19.

FT  27 AUG 93 / BASF and Bayer see no European recovery this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Europe's biggest chemical companies warned yesterday that there was
no prospect of economic recovery in Europe this year.
BASF of Germany, reporting a halving of profits for the first half of the
year, said: 'We do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the
second half of 1993.'
Bayer of Germany, reporting a 25 per cent profits fall for the same period,
said: 'There is no prospect of an economic recovery in Europe.'
BASF said that in Germany, it was unlikely the recession would bottom out
before the middle of next year. Worldwide, said Dr Jurgen Strube, BASF
chairman, 'we do not expect any cyclical recovery of business in the second
half of 1993'. However, he said, there should be a slow upturn in the US.
'Following the United Kingdom, the economy in other western countries will
also improve gradually in 1994,' he said. 'From 1994 onwards, slowly at
first, we expect business to revive.'
He warned of continuing job losses. 'We will continue to reduce employment
by around 4 or 5 per cent a year in the group, and by more in Germany.'
Productivity at the group's main German complex at Ludwigshafen had risen 13
per cent in the past three years. However, this had been largely eroded by
the rise in the D-Mark. 'Increases in wage costs in Germany cannot be
accepted,' said Dr Strube.
On a day when the Bundesbank defied expectations by refusing to relax
interest rates, Dr Strube defended German monetary policy.
'There is a need for additional financial discipline in Germany,' he said.
'Germany requires capital to invest in eastern Germany, and has to finance a
growing burden of public debt. The Bundesbank has little room for
manoeuvre.'
Referring to the overcapacity of Europe's petrochemicals industry, Dr Strube
said BASF had less need to reduce capacity than others.
He defended the group's decision to build a large new ethylene cracker at
Antwerp, saying its output would be largely used within BASF itself.
He expected ethylene plants to be shut in Italy and the UK early next year.

FT  27 AUG 93 / GRE rises to Pounds 65m at half-year on higher premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, yesterday provided further
evidence of the recovery in the general insurance sector.
Rises in premium rates and a fall in claims on UK motor insurance and other
policies helped it post pre-tax profits of Pounds 65m for the first six
months of 1993,
The figures compared with a loss of Pounds 39m at the same stage last year.
After investment gains, which GRE included in its profit figures for the
first time in line with prospective European reporting requirements, pre-tax
profits were Pounds 307m, an improvement of Pounds 299m.
The interim dividend was increased to 2.65p (from 2.5p).
Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the figures 'demonstrated a strong
recovery' and showed that the business had responded 'positively to a series
of firm corrective measures introduced during the last two years'. Because
of its efforts to reduce exposure in sectors where it believes pricing is
inadequate, GRE has sacrificed share in some markets. It now insures about
700,000 UK motorists compared with 1.25m at the end of the 1980s, for
example.
Explaining the group's decision to change its accounting treatment of
investment gains, Mr James Morley, finance director, said: 'Investment is
such an integral part of wealth generation for an insurance company that it
is entirely misleading to leave it out of pre-tax figures.'
GRE's improvement has been based on a turnround in the UK with underwriting
losses falling from Pounds 125m in 1992 to Pounds 40m in 1993. GRE reported
a Pounds 7m underwriting profit on its householders and private motor
business, compared with a Pounds 40m loss last year.
Overall worldwide written non-life premiums increased to Pounds 1.36bn (from
Pounds 1.14bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 85m from a loss of Pounds
178m. Investment income amounted to Pounds 165m (from Pounds 154m) and
realised and unrealised gains were Pounds 242m (from Pounds 47m). Interest
expenses and investment expenses were Pounds 16m (against Pounds 18m),
leaving total gains of Pounds 391m of which Pounds 253 was attributed to the
group's non-life operations and Pounds 128m to corporate investment.
Net assets rose to Pounds 1.4bn by June 30 from Pounds 878m. The group's
solvency ratio (net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was 55 per
cent at end-June.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Drama follows figures from fantasyland: The entertainment
value of EuroDisneyland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney entertainment group,
this week told the Los Angeles Times about his company's latest 'creative
smash' he was not talking about a new movie or cartoon, but about
EuroDisneyland, its theme park in northern France.
'It's as good a piece of entertainment as we've ever delivered anywhere in
the world,' said Mr Eisner. The children whizzing around the park's
attractions may well agree.
But unfortunately for the Disney chairman, EuroDisneyland is also providing
another form of entertainment: the spectacle of its trials and tribulations
in the financial world.
Euro Disney has for the past fortnight been beset by speculation about
everything from the departure of its vice-chairman (which it confirmed) to a
secret plan to close the park for the winter (which it denied). Its shares
have fluctuated daily as investors have digested each new twist in the plot.
Yet the real drama is being enacted behind the scenes as Euro Disney's
executives struggle to find a way of defusing the group's financial problems
by securing a fresh influx of capital.
Euro Disney is in deep trouble. It lost FFr1bn (Pounds 114m) in its last
financial year to September 30 and is on course for another loss of FFr1.8bn
this year. Its net debt has already risen from FFr18.5bn to FFr21bn since
the year began and is set to rise further in the slack winter months. Unless
it secures new capital, Euro Disney will stay trapped in a vicious cycle of
rising debt, spiralling financial costs and mounting losses.
It will also run out of money. Euro Disney announced last month that Walt
Disney, which owns 49 per cent of its shares, had promised to meet its
working capital and short-term investment requirements until March, when it
hopes to have completed its restructuring.
Euro Disney says that, so far, it has not had to ask Walt Disney for
support. Analysts suspect the crunch will come in late November, when
attendance is expected to fall sharply and Euro Disney could run out of
cash. Euro Disney would then be technically bankrupt and its US parent would
have to help.
The critical question is whether Euro Disney will be able to complete its
restructuring by the March deadline. One option is to renegotiate the terms
of its existing loans to try to benefit from recent reductions in French
interest rates. At present it pays half its debt at fixed interest rates.
However Euro Disney failed earlier this year to persuade its banks to revise
the loans. Even if it succeeds this time, a new agreement would only provide
a partial solution. What the company really needs is an influx of cash to
reduce its existing debt and to trim its interest bill.
If Euro Disney was an ordinary company it would stand little chance of
raising cash in the traditional way: by attracting an external investor,
securing a loan extension from its banks, or persuading them to underwrite a
right issue. But the protective presence of Walt Disney, one of the largest
and most profitable entertainment groups in the US, should ensure its
survival.
'There's no way that Walt Disney is going to allow any business bearing the
Disney name to go under,' said one analyst. 'It's got enough cash and enough
clout with the banks to help Euro Disney if it wants to.'
Even Walt Disney's influence is unlikely to enable Euro Disney to attract
external investment. Walt Disney this week played down US press reports that
it was considering this option. It could afford to raise its own 49 per cent
holding in Euro Disney. However the medium-term losses would be so high that
this would scarcely be an appealing prospect for Mr Eisner and his
shareholders.
Loan extensions also seem unlikely. Walt Disney would be expected to resist
demands from the banks that it guaranteed the loans as a quid pro quo for
extending them. Higher debt could also imperil Euro Disney's attempts to
crawl out of the red by burdening it with an even higher interest bill.
The consensus among analysts is that a rights issue is the likely solution.
Walt Disney would doubtless take up its full rights of 49 per cent, which
might make Euro Disney's banks feel more comfortable about underwriting the
rest. The hitch is that the size of the issue would be restricted by the
recent fall in Euro Disney's shares which closed at FFr58.35, up FFr0.85
yesterday against FFr164 at their peak before the park's opening.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London,
suspects the Euro Disney could stage a one-for-two issue at FFr50 a share,
compared with the original offer price of FFr72 in 1989, to raise FFr4.25bn.
If the proceeds were used partly to reduce long-term debt and partly to help
finance the construction of a second park on the Euro Disney site, she
calculated that Euro Disney would finally come out of the red in the 1999
financial year with a net profit of FFr88m.
However Euro Disney might decide to plough all its extra capital into debt
reduction and leave the plans for the second park on ice. This might make
sense in the short term, but in the long term Euro Disney needs a second
site to attract more visitors and encourage them to stay longer, thereby
boosting park revenues and hotel occupancy levels.
Mr Eisner said this week that Euro Disney was 'like a movie that starts off
slow'. The problem is that it may take a very long time for the action to
begin and until then, the production budget will get higher and higher.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Investors flock to Reuters buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Reuters, the international news and information group, have
flocked to take advantage of the company's special Pounds 350m share
buy-back offer.
Around 38.65 per cent of the company's shares were tendered under the offer,
although Reuters plans to buy back only 5.84 per cent of its capital.
The deal proved so attractive because a large proportion of the payout is
being treated as a distribution by the Inland Revenue.
Gross funds such as UK pension funds will accordingly be entitled to a tax
credit on top of the purchase price of Pounds 14 per share, pushing their
total receipts up to Pounds 17.21.
Reuters shares closed at Pounds 15.24 per share. The deal was less
attractive for US shareholders, who own around 35 per cent of Reuters'
equity. Their tax credit is limited to around 80p so the buy-back was
unprofitable once the Reuters price passed Pounds 15.
The number of shares tendered in the form of ADSs (American Depositary
Shares) was accordingly just 1.92m, out of a total tender of 164.3m shares;
the company is offering to buy back 25m shares.
Reuters proposed the buy-back as a means of returning its cash pile, Pounds
710m at the end of 1992, to shareholders. Sir Christopher Hogg, Reuters'
chairman, said: 'The board believes that all shareholders will benefit from
the repurchase since it should lead to an increase in Reuters' earnings per
share.'
Shareholders who have submitted valid tenders will have their shares
purchased in full, up to a maximum of 5.84 per cent of their holdings as of
August 25. Additional shares will be purchased pro rata.

FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and Renault in sharp falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN and Renault, two of Europe's leading volume carmakers, yesterday
announced a dramatic deterioration in their financial performances under the
impact of the steep fall in west European new car sales this year.
Volvo of Sweden, which is expected soon to complete a full merger with
Renault, achieved a modest return to profit, however, after suffering heavy
net losses in 1990 and 1992 and operating losses in 1991 and 1992.
Renault, the French state-controlled car and commercial vehicle maker said
that its pre-tax profits had plunged by almost 90 per cent in the first six
months this year to only FFr730m (Pounds 84m) from FFr5.4bn in the same
period a year ago.
It warned that it saw 'no sign of recovery in the European market for cars
and commercial vehicles,' and would cut production in the second half.
Volkswagen, the beleaguered leader of the European car industry, confirmed
that it had lost DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) in the first six months of 1993, a
DM2bn reversal from the profit of DM445m in the first half of last year.
The scale of VW's losses was reduced considerably in the second quarter,
however, and the company, which is in the midst of drastic restructuring,
said it was working hard to achieve the 'turning point' in profitability in
the second half.
Renault, which is in the process of extending its alliance with Volvo into a
full merger, declined to comment on the state of its negotiations with the
Swedish vehicle maker.
Sources in the French government, which is keen for the merger to be
completed to clear the way for Renault's privatisation, believe that a final
agreement could be completed within weeks.
Swedish financial analysts, who had predicted losses of up to SKr550m
(Pounds 46m) at Volvo for the first six months, said the group's
better-than-expected result could strengthen its hand in the merger
negotiations with Renault, which are expected to reach a conclusion next
month.
Volvo said the results from both companies would not affect the substance of
the negotiations, however.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said that Renault's first-half result
was better than the performance of many of its competitors and was
commendable given the sharp decline in the European car market.

FT  27 AUG 93 / City watchdog will review trading rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
is to look into the way professionals in the securities industry trade to
see if tougher rules are needed to prevent market manipulation.
The SIB said yesterday that Mr Jonathan Agnew, former chief executive at
Kleinwort Benson, is to act as a temporary adviser heading the review of
wholesale market regulation.
The SIB also announced the departure of two of its longest-serving
officials, Ms Colette Bowe and Mr Martin Vile, as part of an internal
shake-up by Mr Andrew Large, chairman, aimed at tightening controls over the
self-regulatory bodies which it oversees.
The SIB is searching for a head of a newly formed securities division and
has established three other divisions; enforcement, policy and legal affairs
and operations. Under the new structure, the roles of the heads of the
retail and wholesale market supervision were abolished. Ms Bowe and Mr Vile,
who headed those divisions respectively, 'will be making a career change'.
Aside from activities such as insider dealing, current regulations are vague
on the trading practices which are genuinely manipulative. Businesses can
manipulate the market by selling blocks of shares ahead of flotation to
drive share prices down and then buy these more cheaply.
The absence of guidance led recently to a well-publicised row over the
government's auction of the third British Telecom stake.
Mr Large, in his review released in May, targeted the development of
derivative products and their increasing integration with cash markets as a
matter which might need further regulatory review. A derivative is
effectively a futures contract to sell or deliver a future share at an
agreed price.
In particular, the SIB has been concerned about whether all market users get
to see the price at which a security was last traded in order to ensure that
the price of derivatives accurately reflects the underlying price of
securities.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Kohl hints he may back France over trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN an extraordinary gesture of Franco-German solidarity, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl yesterday hinted strongly that he was prepared to back France in
seeking new concessions from the US on farm exports.
His words were immediately welcomed by French officials as a vital move to
break the deadlock on farm trade in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade negotiations.
However, this caused alarm and confusion in several German ministries. A
senior official in the chancellor's own office insisted that he was not
calling for formal renegotiation of last year's crucial EC-US agreement on
dismantling farm trade subsidies.
Mr Kohl declared his support for a compromise on the so-called Blair House
agreement on farm trade as part of a passionate restatement of his
commitment to the Franco-German alliance as the driving force of European
integration.
Speaking after two hours of talks with Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, the German chancellor said both sides were committed to giving
Europe a new impetus and both were committed to the timetable for eventual
economic and monetary union.
The meeting is the first at the top level since the currency upheavals of
July caused the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism, prompting harsh
words from Paris blaming Germany in general, and the strict monetary policy
of the Bundesbank in particular, for the crisis.
There were no harsh words yesterday, with both Mr Kohl and Mr Balladur
declaring their closest possible co-operation as beyond doubt or possible
disruption. Yet no one had expected Mr Kohl to go further in support of
France's determined opposition to the EC-US farm trade deal.
'We have also got problems with the agricultural part of the negotiations,
with the Blair House agreement,' Mr Kohl declared. Pressed to explain if he
was calling for renegotiation, Mr Kohl said: 'We must find a compromise
acceptable for everyone. The Blair House agreement as it stands has some
problem areas for us as well . . . It is in the interests of Germany to
arrive rapidly at an agreement, and naturally a reasonable agreement.'
Any suggestion of a renegotiation of that painful compromise is likely to
cause consternation in Brussels and Washington, as well as in the German
foreign and economics ministries.
The German agriculture ministry confirmed two longstanding problems with the
deal: that there was no ceiling on US exports of cereal substitutes to the
EC, and that the EC acreage to be taken out of oil seed production was too
high. Yet a senior official admitted that no one expected a renegotiation to
produce a better deal, in the light of US political opposition.
Mr Balladur said he would submit two papers to Mr Kohl on Monday and Tuesday
next week: the first on proposals for reform of the Blair House agreement,
and the second on a new EC trade instrument to give greater protection to EC
manufacturers. Germany and France would seek to agree a common position on
both issues, he said.
The second French proposal faces furious opposition in the free trade ranks
of Bonn, both in the chancellor's office and the economics ministry.

FT  27 AUG 93 / German refusal to cut rates disappoints markets

<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday stood firmly by its monetary policy, refusing to
cut its key interest rates in spite of expectations by the financial
markets.
In a renewed demonstration of its determination to take a long-term view of
inflation prospects and the growth of money supply in the German economy,
the central bank council declined to react to the latest slight easing in
the inflation rate. It left its discount rate at 6.75 per cent, and the
Lombard rate at 7.75 per cent.
Economists in Paris said the decision could delay reductions in French
interest rates. But they said France would still pursue its policy of step
by step cuts in borrowing costs.
'There might be a tactical wait before the next move', said Mr Christopher
Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, 'but French rates will
continue to head downwards and the momentum of falling money market rates
should be maintained.'
Speculation about a cut in German rates centred on a statement by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the vice-president of the Bundesbank, that further appreciation
of the D-Mark was 'undesirable', and on a reduction in the inflation rates
for three of the largest federal states.
However, the latest money supply figure showed a growth rate well above the
upper limit of the bank's target range.
The decision not to move on interest rates came as a disappointment to
dealers in financial markets and to the German government, which is looking
for a steady reduction to help revive the German economy.
The French franc and other European currencies came under pressure after the
Bundesbank meeting.
The franc closed at FFr3.502 to the D-Mark, nearly 3 centimes down on the
day, while the Belgian franc fell particularly sharply, undermined by a
declaration from a group of Flemish economists earlier this week that the
currency should break its long-standing link with the D-Mark. In New York,
it ended the day marginally higher against the D-Mark at FFr3.496.
The Bundesbank council meeting was the first since late July, when its
refusal to cut its discount rate then precipitated currency turmoil within
the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result, EC finance ministers
agreed to abandon the narrow fluctuation bands in the ERM on August 2.

Reuters' successful share buy-back is less astonishing when one considers
the tax advantage to UK pension funds whose receipts are gross of income
tax. Since the accompanying tax credit effectively gives them Pounds 17.20 a
share, it was worth selling to the company at Pounds 14 even though the
market price was around Pounds 15. The question is whether the lucky winners
will use the proceeds to replenish their holdings of Reuters or spread them
liberally round the rest of the market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen's half year figures suggest that profits are now haemorrhaging
more slowly, but the improvement is not fast enough to meet the company's
target of breaking even by the year end. VW has now admitted as much, though
given that the aim always looked optimistic, that is scarcely a surprise.
More worrying is the likely weakness of any rebound in the market next year,
reinforcing the need for the long-term cost reduction programme started by
Mr Piech and Mr Lopez.
Their troubles with GM are doubtless absorbing a great deal of management
time and may yet cost one, or even both, their jobs. Shareholders can hardly
be amused by full-scale police raids on the company. Senior departures -
particularly of Mr Piech - would badly hinder the reform effort.
Restructuring the high-cost Wolfsburg plant is a complex and difficult task,
which will take time and a clear sense of purpose. Yet once the strategy has
been laid out the task can be completed by others. Besides, around
two-thirds of costs are attributable to suppliers: it is there that the
greatest savings can be made easily. Yet VW will still have to turn its
traditional trick of producing cars which can command a premium in the
market if manufacturing at Wolfsburg is to have a long-term future.

FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So much for worries about Rentokil's ability to keep earnings growing by 20
per cent a year. Thanks to some impressive work on margins in the first
half, it remains comfortably within that target, even after stripping out
exchange rate effects. That should keep the faithful satisfied for a while.
Its growth ambitions are growing harder to satisfy just the same.
UK margins approaching 30 per cent simply cannot be pushed much higher.
Rentokil thus has to rely on volume growth. Its recent purchase of
Securiguard could help. But it is still likely to need a steady diet of
further acquisitions. Although Securiguard has eaten up the Pounds 74m net
cash on its books at the half year, Rentokil could easily accumulate a
further Pounds 100m by the end of next year.
Yet with net assets low in proportion to its business, Rentokil cannot
afford to write off much goodwill. Any large acquisitions might therefore
have to be accompanied by a share issue, for much the same reason as
MB-Caradon launched a rights issue to help pay for its purchase of Pillar
from RTZ. The difference is that, unlike Caradon, Rentokil has a large
single shareholder: Denmark's Sophus Berendsen owns nearly 56 per cent.
Rentokil must hope that, if the need does arise, Berendsen will put its
money on the table. Its failure to do so would be a clear signal that others
should sell.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All credit to Guardian Royal Exchange for grasping the nettle of new
European accounting rules by including investment gains in profit. The old
format, under which only investment income flows through the profit and
loss, makes an arbitrary distinction between yield and capital gain. If the
accounting change focuses attention on how insurance companies invest
shareholders' funds, so much the better. Yesterday's figures demonstrate
that investment performance often matters more than underwriting.
GRE's net assets have risen by more than half over the last year despite net
underwriting losses. There is room to doubt the company's claim that such
returns are the result of deliberate strategy. The Pounds 40m gain from
Irish gilts, for example, looks fortunate. Whether such returns justify the
degree of investment risk is an open question. Until insurers improve the
quality of disclosure on their distribution of investments it will remain
so.
One might also wonder whether large investment gains are compatible with
underwriting profits other than in the short term. Having restored insurance
profits by shedding business, GRE would doubtless relish the opportunity to
take the initiative. With a solvency ratio of 55 per cent, the best in the
sector, it can afford to do so. Yet GRE's record of picking the right route
for expansion is less than comforting. That amounts to an argument for
caution even if that means returning surplus capital to shareholders,
however enticing the investment returns might seem.

FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: The Bundesbank sticks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken financial markets a long time to understand that the collapse
of the ERM also gave Germany freedom over monetary policy. Yesterday's
Bundesbank decision to leave official interest rates unchanged means that,
unlike its partners, it is using that freedom. France would still like lower
German rates so that it can follow suit without jeopardising the franc, but
Germany is now concentrating on purely domestic considerations. The rate of
money supply growth, in particular, does not currently warrant lower rates.
If that was true yesterday, it will almost certainly be true in two weeks'
time. So those who think the Bundesbank was simply deferring any decision
until its next meeting could end up disappointed. Indeed the bank's
readiness yesterday to deny itself any additional room to manipulate money
market rates lower suggests it is in no hurry at all. It may now be several
weeks before a further cut can be expected.
That puts countries like France, Denmark and Belgium in a spot. The best
practical solution might be concerted interest cuts of their own which would
limit the exchange rate uncertainty. Given the pressures, they will have to
find some way of lowering rates, which may explain why bond and equity
markets remain so relaxed. The Bundesbank's behaviour, though, makes the
recent strength of Frankfurt equities look distinctly odd.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank stays tough
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S interest rate cut that did not happen was as revealing as the
dog that did not bark. The Bundesbank is trying to tell the world something.
Others should listen carefully and respond sensibly.
It sometimes seems a pity that analysis of financial markets is dominated by
les Anglo-Saxons. They are right when recognising the limits on the ability
of governments to override markets. But it seems almost impossible for
non-German analysts or even non-German politicians to understand what the
Bundesbank is about.
Surely, they have been saying, the Bundesbank would not persist with its
tired monetarism, especially when monetary growth is a mere one per cent
above its target range. Would it really impose a savage recession in order
to push inflation from 4 to below 2 per cent, when higher administered
prices explain much of the inflation? Would the Germans tolerate such
severity when they are struggling with unification? And what about Mr Kohl,
slayer of Bundesbank inhibitions on German monetary union, would he allow
the ERM to be put to the sword?
The answer to all these questions, we now know, is yes. The Bundesbank does
believe in monetary targeting. Enough of the Germans who matter will not
merely put up with its policy, but support it. And as for Mr Kohl, he
neither can nor will do anything to halt it.
Interest rates are a decision for the Bundesbank, said Mr Kohl yesterday
during his summit meeting with the French prime minister, Edouard Balladur.
This did not prevent the German chancellor from reiterating his desire to
see Europe's economic and monetary union implemented on schedule, with the
familiar proviso that participants should first meet the Maastricht Treaty
criteria. Since this is precisely what the Bundesbank has made difficult to
achieve, Mr Kohl might be accused of wanting to have his cake and eat it.
D-Mark appreciation
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president designate, is another open to
the same accusation. He wants to be free of the costs but still enjoy the
benefits of the ERM, by arguing that a substantial appreciation of the
D-Mark would be undesirable. Since yesterday's decision not to cut the
discount rate also rules out further reductions in market rates, which are
close to their floor, he is telling other European countries not to lower
their rates of interest more than modestly. Presumably he is feeling the
pressure from worried German exporters.
In other ways, Mr Tietmeyer is a liberated man. He is freed from worry about
his promotion, while the institution he is about to head is freed from
day-to-day worries about the ERM. Even though the trend in German short-term
interest rates is downwards, that decline is now likely to be slow and the
disinflationary pressure persistent.
Lower rates
One reason for this is the Bundesbank's determination to restore the D-Mark
to the ranks of the world's low inflation currencies. In addition, it needs
to sterilise the exchange market intervention that accompanied the ERM
crisis. Moreover, to have failed to lower rates in July, when that might
have saved the ERM, only to do so now would pour petrol on the flames of
resentment.
Whether the Bundesbank is right to remain so hawkish, though an
intellectually important question, is beside the point in practical terms.
What is not beside the point is whether other European countries, notably
France, are right to go on shadowing the D-Mark when the exchange rate link
is broken. What is the point of having flexibility if the authorities will
not exploit it?
France is worried about the effects on European monetary co-operation of
uncoupling its interest rates from those in Germany. It is worried too about
its own disinflationary credibility. Both concerns are overdone. It was not
French, but German policy that undermined the ERM. It is not French, but
German insouciance that threatens the achievement of Emu. It is not the
French, but the German economy that suffers from stubborn inflationary
pressures. France and the other European countries afflicted by unnecessary
recessions should exploit their freedom of manoeuvre. If they do not do so
now, they will be forced to do so later.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Deadly delays as winter approaches: Is this the last chance
for Bosnia's warring factions to reach an agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Bosnian parliament meets in Sarajevo's battle-scarred Holiday Inn
hotel today to debate the latest peace plan drawn up in Geneva, it does so
to the sound of an international ultimatum.
If western negotiators are to be believed, today's meeting represents the
last chance for the Bosnian government to agree a settlement - either it
must accept the plan to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states, before
returning to the negotiating table in Geneva on Monday or, inevitably, it
must face further bloodshed.
Such an ultimatum is unlikely to have much effect, however. Although the
Serbs and Croats seem likely to accept the deal when their own parliaments
meet today, the Bosnia government seems set to demand revisions for as long
as it believes it can force a better deal either by stepping up the threat
of western military intervention or by continuing the onslaught in central
Bosnia.
An attempt by the country's weak, multi-ethnic government to stall would be
understandable. Both alternatives on offer - agreement or further fighting -
are undesirable. If the Moslem-dominated leadership says 'yes' to the plan,
they will be accepting a 'solution' that not only legitimises the
dismemberment of Bosnia and with it their military defeat, but which also
seems unworkable.
The new map of Bosnia would give the Serbs a geographically contiguous
republic covering 54 per cent of Bosnia, and borders with Serbia and
Croatia; the Croats would have 17 per cent of the territory, divided into
two parts, one of which touches Croatia; the Moslems, who formed 43 per cent
of the population before the outbreak of war, would be scattered between
four disjointed chunks of land, wedged between two hostile states. 'Bosnia'
would be little more than a name on a map.
Vital questions would remain: where would ethnically mixed Bosnians live;
who would govern the capital Sarajevo and the southern town of Mostar after
the proposed two years of United Nations and European Community
administration; how could the Moslems be guaranteed access to economic
supply lines via the Adriatic Sea and River Sava in the north?
A senior American official in Washington commented: 'That anyone could even
think this map would be workable shows how desperate the situation is. This
is really the end of the Moslems.'
And yet, as the international mediators, Lord Owen for the EC, and Thorvald
Stoltenberg for the UN, have repeatedly stressed, if the Moslems reject the
plan today, they face intensified aggression.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has warned that a rejection by
the Moslems would trigger an all-out assault by the Serb armed forces, who
now control 70 per cent of Bosnia in an arc of territory in the north and
east - almost all their military aims.
The Bosnian Croats, smarting from a series of recent Moslem victories in
central Bosnia, seem even more ready to continue the fight. Some Moslem
commanders believe that they could sustain further Croat assaults, and want
to expand the land they have wrested back in the past four months.
But if the two options facing the Moslems seem to provide enough motivation
for them to stall, either potential outcome of today's meeting threatens
fresh diplomatic embarrassment for the west. The US and its European allies
are still far from ready to police a partition. They remain even more
divided about what course to pursue if the Moslems reject the agreement.
Earlier this week, Lord Owen admitted that without Nato backing, and a
peacekeeping force larger than any seen in the United Nation's history, the
agreement stood little chance of being signed, let alone implemented. How
many peacekeeping troops would be needed is unclear. Mr Stoltenberg has
suggested 40,000, in addition to the 10,000 on the ground in Bosnia. Most
military experts believe this is an optimistic assessment.
However, given the UN's current financial crisis, and indecision at Nato's
highest levels, finding even 40,000 troops would require considerable
diplomatic effort. UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday
indicated that it was unlikely that the UN could provide such a force. The
British and French governments insist that the political will in Europe to
deploy peacekeeping troops is still there. But, symptomatic of the
footdragging, they say that without a settlement, they cannot give
assurances about how many troops might be deployed, or when.
In practice, though, the main stumbling block to deployment is a lack of
firm commitment from the US. America's unwillingnes to deploy ground troops
 -while pushing for air strikes that might endanger the European ground
troops already deployed - has rankled European leaders and fuelled
transatlantic tensions.
Most European allies insist that the bulk of a peacekeeping force must come,
at least initially, from the US. But though US administration officials say
their earlier commitment to assist in implementing a peace agreement stands,
they have avoided any specific discussion of the size or type of
involvement.
But if a peace agreement poses a policing quandary for the west, the
possibility that the Moslems will reject the plan poses almost insupperable
uncertainties. After a year of stop-start negotiations, many western
diplomats view the prospect of more peace talks in Geneva with dismay.
One British diplomatic official said this week: 'We cannot start the
negotiations from scratch again. If Lord Owen asked for more negotiations
then we would support him, but we can't have the negotiations all over
again.'
One factor influencing diplomats may be the suspicion that the two mediators
are increasingly acting out on a limb - a view that grew this week after
reports that they had not consulted European governments before suggesting
that Mostar should be run by the EC.
But if the latest peace plan crumbles, the alternatives for the western
allies - that they should either withdraw their humanitarian efforts from
Bosnia completely or intervene with a large-scale military force to make the
Serbs relinquish land - remain, European diplomats say, almost unthinkable.
The US has, in the past, embraced the idea of tougher action against the
Serbs. However, calls for air strikes earlier this year were greeted with
deep reluctance in Europe. So far, there is no sign that the British and
French governments have changed their opposition.
A few lone voices can still be heard in Washington, demanding a lifting of
the arms embargo against the Bosnians. But in spite of the deep moral
distaste felt throughout Europe at the apparent abandonment of the Bosnian
Moslems, the European allies have shown no sign of accepting either a
lifting of the embargo, or a full-scale military intervention.
Though German officials - and the press - continue to grumble with
frustration at British reservations about becoming embroiled in the
conflict, there is no sign that they are prepared to do more than seek fresh
humanitarian initiatives, and to bring their diplomatic influence to bear on
a recalcitant Croatia. Some American officials have also turned their
attention back to Croatia, suggesting that if the Croats continue their
blockade of Mostar they could face economic sanctions.
In the UK, the government has mainly confined itself to trumpeting the
extent of its aid commitment to Bosnia. Although it has set up a high-level
military command to control its operations in the region, military officials
admit that its main task so far has been drawing up plans for emergency
withdrawal of troops if the three warring factions turn their guns on the
allies.
But as western dithering continues, winter is approaching. With aid agencies
warning that the suffering this winter could be worse than anything so far
in the 17-month conflict, the fear remains that if President Alija
Izetbegovic, the Moslem leader, stalls, and fighting grows more ruthless, by
next spring there may not be a Holiday Inn left standing in Sarajevo - or
even a Bosnian leadership left to meet in it.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Personal View: US should go softly, softly on China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM A MUNDELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has made a tough choice in imposing trade sanctions
against China for apparent violations of international arms controls.
Sanctions may have been an effective weapon against China in the past, but
the emerging global realignments make their efficacy more questionable and
the risks higher.
The US move - especially if followed by further sanctions directed against
China's repressive internal regime - could drive the Chinese, and ultimately
the members of the Commonwealth of Indepen-dent States, away from the west.
Until the break-up of the Soviet Union, China was regarded by the west as an
important counter-weight to Soviet power; it is now thought to have little
strategic importance. But the west should recognise that China is almost
guaranteed to become an economic superpower and that it could easily grow to
dominate and influence the economies of the CIS countries.
The CIS countries are currently determining whether to seek long-term
strategies of economic integration with the west or whether to turn inward.
While the US is pouring billions of dollars into those countries in the hope
of persuading them to integrate with the west and adopt democratic
institutions, it is virtually ignoring the profound implications of the
emerging Sino-CIS rapprochement.
The risk of the CIS turning away from the west is great despite its
short-term dependence on aid.
When President Boris Yeltsin visited China late last year he signed 24
agreements that he said gave the Chinese a head start over the west in
developing links with Russia. With Dollars 6bn in bilateral trade, China is
the only country that is expanding trade with Russia. Official border trade
has exploded from less than Dollars 100m in 1987 to Dollars 2bn in 1992.
The actual trade volume is substantially higher, as indicated by the more
than 3,000 arrests along the frontier for smuggling offences last year.
There is an undeniable degree of economic complementarity between China and
the CIS, with China's consumer goods being traded for CIS raw materials and
heavy industrial technology. What is more alarming is that many of the
central Asian republics are adopting the 'Chinese model' in which autocratic
rule coexists with economic liberalisation.
It is the success of this autocratic regime in countries like China,
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea that makes extracting internal political
concessions so difficult, even though the cost could be losing most favoured
nation status.
Many Asian business leaders believe that economic growth has priority over
political freedom and that without the strong hand of government such growth
may be doomed. They point to Taiwan and South Korea as examples of where
patience with the authoritarian ways of government has led not only to a
stronger economy but ultimately to increasing political freedom. And they
cite Russia as an example of where pushing political freedom too quickly can
make it impossible to achieve economic growth.
This is a point not lost with the governing elites in Moscow.
Against this backdrop, any efforts by Mr Clinton's to force China to make
internal reforms are likely to have at best a cosmetic impact on freedom.
For example, the Chinese may agree that no prison labour is to be used on
products exported to the US. But that does not stop them from diverting
prison labour for domestic uses and/or exports to other nations.
In the meantime, China does not stand still. Where possible it is
diversifying its export base away from the west. Despite a rapid expansion
of total trade, China is no more dependent on the US and European Community
than it was in 1989.
Apart from the CIS it has dramatically expanded trade with former foe Japan
and opened ties with another former foe, South Korea.
If, through protracted economic failure, the CIS develops along the same
lines as China, and China continues to diversify its export base, then both
could become gradually isolated from the west. At that point the US would no
longer be so cavalier about its position towards China.
In order to hedge against this risk, US foreign policy must now draw China's
economy further towards the west. If it is successful, then even if the CIS
does go the way of China, it is still be likely to become integrated with
the west. That would help preserve peace and freedom.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Big trouble at Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS GERMANS yesterday witnessed the astonishing sight of police officers
swooping upon the premises of Volkswagen and the homes of VW executives,
they must be reflecting that nothing the German car-maker has done this year
has been in character.
Witness the decision to bring in as chairman the hard-driving Austrian, Mr
Ferdinand Piech, with a remit to jolt VW from its losses and lethargy; the
recruitment from General Motors of the flamboyant Basque, Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, as VW's production director; and finally, the mix of
scorn, bluster and diplomacy with which VW responded to charges that Mr
Lopez's value to his new employer had been augmented by an unspecified
quantity of information and material stolen from GM. It is as if a portly
middle-aged man, after a lifetime of grey suits and regular habits, had
taken to designer sports-wear and dark glasses.
Such changes in regime are always dangerous; indeed they sometimes lead to
heart attacks. That does not mean they can be avoided; it means they must be
properly planned and carefully supervised.
The case for ambitious change at VW was and is beyond argument. Its costs
are too high and its speed of reaction too slow. When those weaknesses were
tested by a recession in the company's domestic market, the result was a
collapse in profits. Mr Piech seemed like the man to meet the challenge. He
has vision and a track record in managing change.
Serious mistakes
It is time, however, for him to acknowledge that he has made serious
mistakes. Whatever the basis of the allegations against Mr Lopez, he was
unwise to place such heavy reliance upon the talents of a single individual
to effect a cultural transformation in the way VW makes cars and deals with
suppliers. Mr Lopez may be a star, or a 'change agent' in the business
school jargon, but change on this scale requires consent, which cannot be
produced only by force. It also goes without saying that in demanding
painful change, the proponents have to be unimpeachable in terms of their
own integrity. If not, they will be exposed, quite possibly by those whose
interests are threatened.
Mr Piech's other big error has been the way he has dealt with GM's
allegations. The right thing for companies to do in these circumstances is
to remain calm and to announce that such grave charges will be fully
investigated. Instead, Mr Piech responded first with counter-allegation
(that GM had planted documents on VW), with intemperate words and finally
with an attempt to mend fences, using the good offices of Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
the economics minister. VW's public relations, veering wildly between surly
silence and noisy expostulation, has been a disaster.
Deep gloom
Mr Rexrodt himself cannot survey the affair with anything but the deepest
gloom. His mediation has had no effect and should not have been attempted in
the first place. His motive, to prevent further damage to the image of
German industry, and especially to VW, which is in part a state-owned
company, is understandable, but it is not the job of government ministers to
intervene when a serious criminal investigation is in prospect. The
modernisation of German industry, which must include increased transparency
in the way that companies are governed, requires that ministers play a more
restrained role.
Probably the most encouraging aspect of yesterday's events is that they show
the state prosecution system, initially sluggish in its response to GM's
allegations, to be somewhat zestful in its determination to get to the
bottom of the Lopez affair. It is now in the interests of VW, German
industry and Germany itself that this process be completed as speedily and
effectively as possible.
It cannot yet be predicted what that means for Mr Lopez or for Mr Piech; the
VW board will have to judge where the best interest of the shareholders
lies. For the company's suppliers, whose excessively high costs were to be
the target of the Piech-Lopez onslaught, it is a time to marvel at the chaos
and to remember that when this particular battle is over, someone from
Wolfsburg will be back, with a demand that they cut their prices, or else.

Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotels group, has just provided a
splendid modern example of the ancient Roman principle of memento mori. At
yesterday's annual meeting of Queens Moat, in the resplendent surroundings
of the New Connaught Rooms, shareholders were distracted by the sight of a
balloon, presumably left over from the debauches of the night before,
bobbing against the ornamental ceiling.
As the lately appointed managing director Andrew Coppel went through his
address, the balloon descended gently to hover behind his head. The message
printed on it? 'Enjoy retirement.'

FT  27 AUG 93 / Observer: Pool tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As any white South African will tell you, having your own swimming pool is
more trouble than it's worth. Pool-owners spend hours fiddling with chemical
testing kits, 'backwashing' the filter system, and dumping in alternate
amounts of chlorine and acid.
Now, as though life were not tough enough already, an official of the Cosatu
union, the ANC's closest ally, has said a future government would tax
swimming pools. One caller to a Johannesburg radio station yesterday said it
was the last straw; he had decided to emigrate.
Given that a senior ANC official recently promised to confiscate half of
every South African's assets as a sort of guilt tax for apartheid, it is
probably not worth worrying about a pool tax. It will be far easier to fill
in the wretched hole than persuade the exchange control authorities to let
you send half your capital abroad.

Three years ago, Observer predicted that the new, thrice-yearly Treasury
Bulletin, the slim azure paperback of austere articles about monetary
targeting and other economic arcana, would soon become a collector's item.
Yesterday, the prediction came true. The Treasury confessed that the latest
volume was the last edition of a publication whose cover price has risen
almost as fast as interest in its contents has dropped. When it comes to
value for money, the Treasury has never been able to match the Bank of
England quarterly bulletin.
For Pounds 7.50 the Treasury offers 65 pages, whereas the Bank provides 120
pages for the same price. A bigger problem, though, was content. Treasury
economists dreaded being told to write for the publication, and their turgid
style soon produced such disappointing circulation figures that even HMSO,
the publisher, became concerned. When circulation dropped below 500,
compared with the quarterly bulletin's 5,500 copies, the Treasury had little
choice but to admit yet another mistake and scrap the venture.

The stuffier fans of The Archers, BBC Radio's rural soap opera, hate the
realistic notes creeping into their beloved programme. Only yesterday
Baroness von Twickel wrote to The Times complaining that the sheer noise of
recent programmes has nearly driven her to apostasy.
Her letter was triggered by this week's high point - the re-enactment of a
real English Civil war battle 350 years ago. The Sealed Knot, one of the
main real-life societies which mounts 'living history' re-stagings of
battles, sieges and occupations was even given a walk-on part.
But, here again, The Archers is not a patch on reality. A fortnight ago, in
what was supposedly a peaceful restaging of Royalist life in Stokesay castle
in rural Shropshire, all hell broke loose when a female member of The Sealed
Knot showed up (in male 17th century dress) at an event staged by the
arch-rival English Civil War Society for English Heritage.
Flanked by their imposing pikemen, officials of the society barred her way
into the castle, even though she had paid her entrance fee. After much
cursing and swearing, during which the audience realised only gradually that
the confrontation was for real, she was forced to leave.
Behind the confrontation lies not only the fact that the society considers
itself far more purist than The Sealed Knot, from which it broke away some
years ago, but that living history is becoming almost as big business for
societies which mount such events in Britain as it already is in America.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Showdown at the palazzo: Rifts at the world's oldest bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The whiff of scandal has penetrated the thick stone walls of Monte dei
Paschi di Siena, the world's oldest bank. In five centuries of lending,
through the bloody wars between the city states of Florence and Siena and
the unification of Italy, its reputation has never faced such attack.
Two members of its board were arrested earlier this year after allegedly
receiving kickbacks for granting loans. They have been bailed pending trial.
Soon afterwards, Mr Carlo Zini, managing director, stepped down, after being
told by magistrates that he was under investigation on similar allegations.
The inquiries - against the background of Italy's 18-month political
corruption scandal - caused a tremor along the Gothic corridors of Monte dei
Paschi. Located in a fortress-like palazzo and founded in 1472, it is
Italy's second biggest banking group after Banca di Roma in terms of
branches.
At stake are more than Monte dei Paschi's image and the careers of a few
individuals. Concerns prompted by Italy's corruption scandals will also have
an impact on a long-running debate in Siena: whether to break the shackles
which have bound the bank and city council for centuries.
There is no suggestion that the council has been involved in corruption. But
investigations across Italy into links between politicians and business
could tip the balance in a debate about whether Monte dei Paschi has to
change to compete in Italy's increasingly aggressive banking sector.
With the Italian government keen to encourage competition, Monte dei
Paschi's structure, which dates from its origins as Siena's municipal
pawnshop, was looking outdated even before Italy's corruption scandals
erupted.
Controlled by the city council via a charitable foundation, the bank has
neither the freedom of a quoted company to raise capital nor the discipline
imposed by a wider shareholder base. The bank's board consists of just four
members of the council and four bank representatives.
Adding to the pressure for a rethink on Monte dei Paschi's future has been a
steep fall in its profits. The recession has forced the bank, like many
others in Italy, to increase provisions against bad debt. Last year net
earnings fell to just L8bn (Pounds 3.3m) from L238bn in 1991.
Monte dei Paschi is now the only big bank left in Italy tied so closely to
its historical roots. In January, Turin's Istituto San Paolo, which also
started as a pawnshop, was floated on the stock market, allowing it to tap
shareholders for money and reducing suspicions that it is susceptible to
political influence.
Transforming Monte dei Paschi into a limited company is the battle cry for
younger managers and some in the banking world outside Siena calling for
radical changes at the bank. Such a move would bring tax breaks under
legislation meant to encourage banks to move from charitable status and
eventually to flotation.
'Executives know the bank must turn into a limited company if it is to
remain competitive with other big banks, such as San Paolo, which have
already made the change,' says one manager. 'But they can't force the issue.
Public opinion in Siena could block any changes that might compromise local
control.'
Resistance to change has come from the city council, dominated by the former
Communist party, which is reluctant to relinquish local government control
and sees little necessity for reform of the bank.
Mr Pierluigi Piccini, Siena's mayor and the most prominent of the
anti-reformers, says: 'Not all successful banks are limited companies. There
are plenty of financial institutions in the UK, France and Germany which do
very well under municipal control.'
He believes there is a close 'moral bond' between the city and the bank,
which has, under its charitable status, to offer half its profits to the
community. 'We have traditionally refused to take the full proportion of
profits we are entitled to, prefering to leave the remainder to the bank to
help finance its growth,' says Mr Piccini.
The Siennese have traditionally defended the bond between city and the bank
as tenaciously as they once fought to remain independent of Florence. In a
city famous for its fierce internal rivalry, which finds expression in the
twice-yearly Palio horse race, the bank is a symbol of unity.
Trying, discreetly, to steer a course between the radical reformers and
opponents of change are Mr Vincenzo Pennarola, who took over last month as
managing director, and Mr Giovanni Grottanelli de Santi, Monte dei Paschi's
chairman, appointed last December. They are keen to take advantage of
opportunities for regional and international expansion - Bank of Italy
controls on territorial expansion by banks were relaxed in 1990. But Mr
Grottanelli de Santi and Mr Pennarola are reluctant to sacrifice the links
with the city which, they acknowledge, have ensured the bank's stability
since its foundation.
They deny reports that they are determined to take the bank public,
stressing instead that Monte dei Paschi must streamline its cumbersome
structure.
The group comprises six, partly overlapping, banks. The parent company has
669 branches, while Banca Toscana, the biggest subsidiary, has a 259-branch
network, much of it in the same Tuscan towns as its parent. Last year,
regional duplication increased when the bank bought a municipally-controlled
savings bank in Prato, also in Tuscany. In northern Italy, Credito
Commerciale and Credito Lombardo, the group's two Milan-based banks, also
overlap.
'Monte dei Paschi is a very unusual bank,' says Mr Pennarola. 'We have to
decide on a future structure and are now preparing various options to put to
the board within the next two months.' But with local passions running high,
Mr Grottanelli de Santi says steps on restructuring would not necessarily
foreshadow the bank becoming a limited company. Conscious of the sensitivity
of the issue, he goes out of his way to avoid a public confrontation with
the city council. 'We welcome the city's participation on our board,' he
says. 'Find me another bank where the managing director or chairman are
stopped in the street by old schoolfriends, or even strangers, and
buttonholed about yesterday's decisions.'
But Mr Grottanelli de Santi's carefully-chosen words cannot hide the debate
over the bank's future. This year's corruption scandals have not helped the
bank's image over the short term. If public opinion shifts in favour of
creating greater barriers between politicians and business, it will test the
relationship between the Siena council and reformers such as Mr Grottanelli
de Santi and Mr Pennarola.

FT  27 AUG 93 / On the bandwagon: Privatisation need not mean price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the cynical consumer, the pattern looks familiar. With the government
intent on privatising British Rail, leaked BR documents suggest passengers
on the south-east lines face fare rises of up to 16 per cent.
The move is seen as the inevitable fattening up process before BR is
auctioned off. The expectation is of further, stinging fare increases.
But the widely held perception that, whatever happens to the quality of
service, privatisation spells bigger bills, can be wide of the mark.
The debate rages over excessive profits and executive rewards in privatised
utilities, the first of which, BT, has been free of the state for nearly 10
years. But the evidence suggests consumers have few grounds to complain on
prices.
Whether or not privatisation is responsible, businesses like BT, British Gas
and, for some customers, the regional electricity companies can boast large
real price reductions. Low inflation, rising competition and tough
regulatory controls have played a part.
The price performances of some privatised businesses may look unduly
flattering, since they are being compared with large price rises in the
run-up to flotation.
It is impossible to say with certainty what prices would have been if
suppliers had remained in state ownership, though some observers believe
they would have offered a better deal to customers.
The post-privatisation picture is not all wine and roses for the consumer.
The most obvious bad tidings have come from the water industry, where
demands for improved quality have imposed high cost burdens, likely to total
Pounds 45bn, which are being passed to consumers.
Many electricity users, too, have faced significant price rises, although
domestic bills this year have been reduced. But UK householders' bills still
compare well with others' in Europe.
Of the privatised utilities, British Gas seems best at trumpet-blowing, some
claim unjustifiably. It claims prices to its 18m domestic consumers have
fallen by 20 per cent in real terms since privatisation in 1986, making them
the cheapest in Europe. Even with the planned 17.5 per cent value-added tax
rate applied, they will be at the lower end of European prices.
For industrial gas users in general, the record is even better - with real
reductions averaging 25 per cent since 1986.
Not everyone, however, is prepared to hand a bouquet to British Gas. Mr
George Yarrow, of the Regulatory Policy Research Centre, says the real fall
in domestic gas prices is almost entirely due to lower prices on arrival on
the beach-head.
He stresses electricity prices, which rose sharply prior to privatisation in
1990, have not fallen in real terms since the sell-off. He suggests that
average electricity prices were up to 25 per cent higher for domestic
customers by 1992 and 19 per cent higher for industrial consumers than they
would have been if earlier price trends had continued.
But Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, says the
arrival of competition in 1990 led to big price falls for industrial users;
despite rises since then, many prices remain lower in real terms than before
privatisation.
Big customers on interruptible gas contracts - they pay less and run the
risk of having supplies temporarily cut off - benefit from some of the
lowest comparable prices in Europe. Yet some, like ICI, British Steel and
Blue Circle Industries are fighting to scale down price rises. Since
privatisation, they have had to buy supplies daily on the spot market,
whereas before they could strike their own deals with the old Central
Electricity Generating Board.
For BT, which in 1984 led the privatisation bandwagon, criticism of some
high call charges has obscured the overall real fall in bills.
But then the Post Office, too, has done well since it split away from BT in
1984. Postal tariffs will rise in November after a two-year freeze, but
average letter prices have fallen by 10 per cent in real terms in the past
decade.
BT rates for local calls - covering a wider range than in many other
countries - remain among the most costly in Europe and North America. But
international call charges - subject to increasing competition from Mercury
 -are among the cheapest. Transatlantic call costs are down more than 40 per
cent since the BT sale.
Oftel, the industry watchdog which regulates BT by monitoring a basket of
its services, says overall prices have fallen in real terms by at least 25
per cent since privatisation.
Domestic subscribers with 'medium-sized' bills - an average Pounds 44 a
quarter - have seen a 5 per cent average reduction since 1989.
Significantly, higher line rental charges - up by about 40 per cent since
1988 - have partially offset lower call charges.
The water and sewerage industry has had no good news on prices since
privatisation in 1989. But it claims to have to correct decades of
under-investment. Average household water bills have risen by almost 37 per
cent more than the RPI in the past five years.
Consumer surveys by Anglian Water and Welsh Water have found that consumers
will accept still higher bills to help pay for water improvement programmes.
If the privatised businesses have a mixed record on prices, their future
performance seems as likely to depend on the disciplines imposed by their
respective regulators as on the varying degrees of marketplace competition
they face.
As for passengers of a privatised railway system, the expectation is that to
help revive a loss-making industry in long-term decline, prices will have to
rise before and after privatisation.
The government says privatisation will offer more and better trains at
attractive fares. In the grand tradition of railway passengers, they will
have to wait to find out.

Sir, Malcolm Bacchus is right to complain at the government's miserable
failure to deal with the enormous and unnecessary burdens of the tax and
accounting regulations ('Companies still weighed down by burden of tax
regulations', August 24).
For example, why does the Companies Act need to take more than 50 pages on
'Form and Content of Company Accounts'? Why not just have a single brief
section? It could say: 'The accounts of companies, and of groups of
companies where appropriate, should give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company or group as at the end of the financial year, and
of the profit or loss for the financial year.'
If one wanted to elaborate, there could be a second sentence spelling out
what is currently implied: 'It would normally be expected that a set of
accounts would need to comply with current accounting standards in order to
give a true and fair view, though this might not be so in exceptional
circumstances.'
That would not only save much needless verbiage, it would eliminate the
existing contradictions between company law and accounting standards, for
example with respect to stock valuation, development costs, depreciation,
research, deferred taxation and pensions.
As for tax, hundreds, probably thousands, of the most intelligent people in
the country waste their time trying to interpret tax rules. May I ask how
many civil servants are employed full-time on trying to find ways to
simplify the rules?

FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local authority contracts threatened
by transfer rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRIAN HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One interpretation of the recent employment appeal tribunal decision in
Wren versus Eastbourne Borough Council could be that the contracting out of
local authority services will be caught by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations.
If the local authority work is judged to be a transfer of an undertaking
under the regulations, council employees who had previously carried out the
work are automatically transferred to the contractor on their existing terms
and conditions of service.
Such an interpretation would have profound implications for contractors in
areas such as building maintenance, and is, in my confederation's view,
absolutely wrong.
The tribunal's decision in the Eastbourne case simply emphasises the need to
take into account the various European cases on the Acquired Rights
Directive, from which the TUPE regulations are derived. Whether a
transaction constitutes a transfer must be determined in accordance with the
circumstances of each case.
Both of these principles are already part of the legal framework of the TUPE
regulations.
Even if, the industrial tribunal currently reviewing the Eastbourne case
finds that there was a transfer, such a decision is unlikely to mean that
contracts for building maintenance work are any more likely to be caught by
the regulations. This is because there are two important points of
distinction between this case and the circumstances that apply to most
building maintenance contracts: the contractor in the Eastbourne case
employed over half the council's staff and took over its premises and
vehicles.
A transfer of employees and a transfer of assets are two of the most
important factors pointing towards a transfer within the meaning of both the
TUPE regulations and the Acquired Rights Directive. So it would not be
surprising if the industrial tribunal concluded that a transfer had
occurred.
In any event, this case does not remove the serious concerns felt within the
construction industry about the effect of the TUPE regulations on the
government's compulsory competitive tendering policy. As things stand, far
from protecting employment the TUPE regulations are having the effect of
inhibiting contractors from taking on public sector work. This, in turn, is
resulting in higher jobless figures in the construction industry.
What is needed is the amendment of the European Acquired Rights Directive to
make it clear that these regulations do not apply either to the contracting
out of work by councils or to the taking over of contracts from insolvent
companies.
My confederation strongly welcomes government support for such an amendment
and wishes to see early action by the European Commission to achieve this
objective. Sir Brian Hill,
president,

FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economists cannot price environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMEL-PFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader writer's recommendation that the environment should have a
price tag on it in the same way that other goods have, and that
environmental policy should be based on such a price, is highly questionable
('Valuing the environment', August 19).
At the same time it sets the very same trap that Prof Lawrence Summers, the
World Bank's chief economist, walked into with his infamous leaked World
Bank memo last year (see 'Save planet earth from economists', February 10
1992). Prices do nothing but reflect both people's (marginal) willingness to
pay and their ability to pay.
However, as ability to pay obviously depends on income, willingness to pay
depends on the prevailing income distribution.
To place environmental policy on such a footing provides a perfect
justification for, say, South America to cut down its rainforests and Europe
to export its waste and, thus, pollution, to Africa. It is perfectly
efficient, isn't it?
If that is what economics is actually about, then economists had better
renounce their claim to being responsible policy advisers.
I doubt whether you are really serious about these implications.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK should set example on equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ONESIMO ALVAREZ-MORO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder how many women the FT has on its editorial team? Not many,
judging by the leader 'Equal pay for women' (August 25). In censuring the
Equal Opportunities Commission's move to take the government to the European
authorities, the FT is caught with its equality pants down.
It is absurd to suggest that women should be satisfied with their lot just
because they have found it easier than men to get jobs. They have had to
accept more precarious, part-time and less remunerative jobs (even for the
same work done). Should they be grateful for the favour?
It does not lessen the farce that we have narrowed the wage differentials to
80 per cent. We are still a long way from equality, regardless of what other
countries are doing.
It is true that other countries need to do much more, but let us teach by
example.
As for Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, he need not fear.
European court actions unfortunately take a long time. All Mr Hunt need do
is eliminate the inequalities in order to stop any action in its tracks. The
ball is in his court.
While we continue to consider women as a minority - even though they make up
over 50 per cent of the population in the UK - their unjustifiable treatment
can be expected to persist.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: When anatomy classes paid off - Scottish figurative
painting alive and well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious students of contemporary Scottish painting are enjoying an aestas
mirabilis. North of the border, there are two important retrospectives, of
Peter Howson at the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow (reviewed by Mary Rose
Beaumont in July) and of Steven Campbell at the Talbot Rice Gallery in
Edinburgh. The festival city, despite its official disdain for the visual
arts, also offers non-representational work by Scottish artists at the
College of Art.
Those confined to London may take comfort, however. The Angela Flowers
Gallery has organised an excellent survey of Scottish painting which fills
both its East End branches until September. The strength of the show lies in
the range of work, which goes beyond the generation which broke through to
fame in the 1980s, to include work from both older and younger graduates of
the four Scottish art schools, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, and
some of their teachers.
As a student at Edinburgh College of Art I often found its academic
discipline - life, still life and anatomy classes were compulsory - and the
unquestioning acceptance of painting for painting's sake hard to bear.
Eventually, however, I came to love the life class, and the absorbing
struggle with that endlessly difficult task, the representation of the human
figure.
Many of the artists in this exhibition continue in this tradition, and their
confident use of the figure is striking at a time when it is widely assumed
to have ceased to be part of the contemporary artistic vocabulary. Also
notable is the wide range of expressive purposes the figure is made to
serve.
John Bellany, father of the present generation of Scottish magical realists,
fills large, semi-autobiographical, semi-mythical canvases like 'Bounteous
Sea,' 1993, with a cast of sloe-eyed beauties both real and imaginary.
Steven Campbell invents an impossible yet strangely familiar story-book
world in work such as 'The Sadness of Swiss Peasants on the Rhine,' 1989,
where some sinister meaning lurks close to the deceivingly light-hearted
surface.
The tradition of realism, drawing from the life, permits Jock McFadyen and
Henry Kondracki to explore the city streets, capturing their inhabitants
with humour and painterly dash. Peter Howson also uses his studies of street
life as a basis for his enormous mythological canvases. Margaret Hunter and
Gwen Hardie, who both studied with Georg Baselitz after their training in
Scotland, make close examination of the figure central to their work. While
in 'Woman with Apron,' 1992, Hunter's figure is stripped down to a primitive
essence at its centre, Hardie moves ever closer to the body (usually her
own), until in 'Unto Me,' 1992, details - in this case about three quarters
of a face - become huge abstract forms rendered in blobs of paint applied
with sponge or fingers. For June Redfern, in canvases such as 'Two Songs
II,' 1992, large, usually female, figures articulate a psychological or
spiritual space, brought alive by those other Scottish preoccupations, the
importance of colour and the handling of paint.
'Painterly' was a term of praise in my time and must remain so, for there
are few works here which do not merit it. Even those artists who have moved
away from direct rendition of image on canvas to use their skills for
different ends - the explorations of natural processes such as 'HDE 226868'
by Glen Onwin, for example, or 'Symbol Stone,' 1983, by Kate Whiteford,
reveal both their skill at and pleasure in mark making and textural
richness. The purely abstract works are perhaps the weakest in the show, not
quite far enough removed from their inspiration in landscape in the case of
Buchan and Shanks or rigorous enough in their presentation of colour
(Colombo, Maclean) to travel far from the merely decorative. Their handling
of paint, however, as should be expected from the heirs of Peploe, McTaggart
and Gillies, is unfailingly impressive. Alan Davie shows the usefulness of
image to anchor abstraction, even though the eclecticism of his magpie hoard
of symbols ultimately weakens their effect.
Scottish painting is far from perfect. I still find myself baulking at its
self-centredness, the narrow path from sketchbook to canvas, the reliance on
a limited vocabulary of images - some drawn from the glorification of a
brutal culture - and their repetition to the point of cliche. But these are
generalisations, and this is a show of individuals, each of whose work
demands attention, and the culmination of whose efforts over the last 30
years has led to the development of a body of work which grows ever more
impressive with the passage of time.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: Dr Faustus Lights the Lights - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How curious to find that Gertrude Stein, the American in Paris and pioneer
of avant-garde wordplay, wrote Dr Faustus Lights the Lights with Britain in
mind - as an operatic sequel to A Wedding Bouquet (the choral ballet, still
extant in repertory today, which Lord Berners had created from her play They
Must. Be Wedded. To Their Wife.) Now Robert Wilson, another American pioneer
and leading creator of new-wave theatre since the 1960s, has collaborated on
a new production with the German sound artist Hans Peter Kuhn. The result,
brought by the Hebbel-Theater, Berlin, is arresting, bizarre, ironic, droll,
absorbing, fascinating.
At surface level, Stein's text is a post-Lewis Carroll-array of rhyming
nonsense jokes. Because Marlowe had his Faustus fall for Helen of Troy,
whereas Goethe's Faust falls for Marguerite, Stein's Faustus falls for a
heroine who is called 'Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel'. And because
Faustus chooses to go to Hell, Stein deliberately confuses her story with
that of Eurydice (who was killed by a viper) and Orpheus (who went to Hell
to retrieve her), and makes Mr Viper a recurrent theme in her tale-no-tale
of Doctor Faustus and Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel. (At the start of
Act Two, someone asks 'Would the viper have stung her if she had only had
one name?'). Faustus, like Julia in A Wedding Bouquet, has a dog played by a
girl.
Beneath this entertaining absurdist facade, you can sense Stein the
dissident feminist. She rewrites Faustus's story to make him a scientist; he
has created electric light, he is hellbent on going to Hell, and, when he
rejuvenates himself, he loses Marguerite Ida and Helena Annabel forever -
because she no longer recognises him. The feeling of hero and heroine for
each other is constantly ambivalent; and you feel Stein's resentment of the
role traditionally played by Marguerite as Faustus's ideal and victim and
saviour.
Wilson's staging, at every stage elegant and incisive, goes for every
bizarrerie and irony in Stein's text and compounds them with others. Three
Faustuses; three Marguerite Idas; two Mephistos. A nine-foot-tall
countrywoman played by a man on stilts beneath his skirts. Image after image
strikes you with the same ironic visual force that keeps bubbling up in the
text. Devils hover aloft; Faustuses lean out sideways from the proscenium
arch. Light and dark are contrasted in one way after another; abstract forms
and hues catch and intensify meanings in the text.
At one point, Wilson catches all the ambiguities of the Faustus-Marguerite
love-death victim-viper-killer nexus, by making one Faustus advance to plant
his snarling mouth on one Marguerite's neck like some vampire snake, only to
find that in so doing he impales himself on the blade that she impassively
holds in her hand. Meanwhile, another Marguerite, wandering with a candle,
at last unites its light with the electric light that has hung over Faustus.
In an earlier treatment of the viper bite, as we hear all three Marguerites
scream, a gash of red suddenly cleaves the black sky, like a rising red
poker.
Kuhn's music is in post-Satie vein, full of sub-vaudeville tunes and muted
oompah rhythms that almost become tangos. The German cast speak their
English with utter clarity, though with even more staccato emphasis than
appropriate. The fact that Stein was turning language into music is made
beautifully clear, and every metre is pointed deliciously - but Kuhn's music
and the actors' delivery could profit from a bit more legato and dynamic
variety. But if this staging falters in its handling of the fourth dimension
(time), Stein's text keeps it lively. And it is always clear that the three
dimensions of space (and light) are being handled by a master.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: MacMillan's operatic issues - The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The festival prospectus promised us a 'double bill of operas'. Whatever else
they may be, Busqueda and Visitatio sepulchri by James MacMillan are not
that and the evening devoted to them at the King's Theatre on Wednesday left
impressions that were anything but operatic.
This was the most substantial offering of Edinburgh's in-depth survey of
MacMillan's work. For those not familiar with the composer, a brief
biography may be helpful. MacMillan is Scottish, at 34 still young in
today's terms, his homeland's leading voice in new music. He has taken up a
decisive stance on political and religious issues. Of these two works, both
are steeped in the Catholic faith and one also recalls a recent case of
political mass injustice, beliefs on MacMillan's part which give this music
added purpose.
Visitatio sepulchri is less an opera, more a celebration of faith. It sets a
14th-century liturgical drama that would have been enacted at Notre Dame in
Paris on Easter Sunday. First the crucifixion, then the resurrection as
recounted by three angels to three women, and finally a 'Te Deum', its
culmination in a hymn of praise.
The intention is to portray the events in as objective a manner as possible,
so MacMillan effectively de-personalises his music, having the text chanted
or sung in ensemble wherever possible; no individual emotional response is
allowed. Much of the central section is spare, as though wanting to convey
an antiquity of tone, resonating down the centuries. The 'Te Deum' starts
with a lot of unconvincing agitation from the orchestra, too angst-filled to
be appropriate to the words, but rises at the end to glorification.
None of this is easy to bring off and Francisco Negrin's stage production
tipped the piece well over the edge into pretentiousness. Wafted on a cloud
of incense, three semi-naked dancers pose half way up the wall, while the
women and angels play spot the symbolism, flicking water at each other and
ripping pages out of books with very meaningful looks. Next time I would
like to see a simple re-enactment of the drama.
For Busqueda, even that is unnecessary. MacMillan's theme here is the lost
sons of Argentina, a subject already memorably captured on film. An opera is
words through music, but this work is decidedly words with music. What he
gives us is a collage, in which poems written by the mothers of 'the
disappeared' are read or sometimes chanted, interspersed with sections of
the Latin Mass.
There is little singing; indeed little music imposes at all. As an
accompaniment to the poetry, the score is sparse, generally expressing an
elegiac mood of grief, as filtered through years of waiting. I found its
response to the poems mostly simple and moving. The narrator was Juliet
Stevenson and Ivor Bolton conducted the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, seated
on stage, where there was thankfully no production to distract our
attention.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: The Oslo Philharmonic - Promenade concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the past seven years or so, the Oslo Philharmonic has earned
unstinting admiration over here. Undoubtedly it owes much to its conductor
Mariss Jansons (not a Norwegian), but the playing - strong, musicianly,
vitally responsive - speaks for itself.
Yet for the Prom concerts on Monday and Tuesday, it took care to have
international soloists as draws: first the Japanese phenomenon Midori in
Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, and then Yuri Bashmet in the concerto Bartok
was writing when he died. The orchestra need not have been so modest, being
itself a grade-A draw. Still, Bashmet's extraordinary account of the Bartok
was marvellous to hear.
Aspersions are often cast upon Tibor Serly's posthumous 'completion' of the
concerto. It has won a place in the repertoire only because violists
desperately need something substantial by some major composer after Mozart,
Berlioz and Walton. But if this 'Bartok' concerto cannot pretend to be just
what the composer would have written had he lived, it is nonetheless a
substantial piece. Serly's many Bartok arrangements prove him to be a
scrupulous disciple; more important, the viola concerto has its own pungent,
introspective consistency of tone, echt-Bartokian and yet distinct from any
of his previous music. The piece can seem wan, fitful and episodic; not,
however, in Bashmet's hands.
He is a magnificent brooder. Even single notes may have a smouldering
density. That is not a matter of throbbing timbre, but rather of expressive
sense relentlessly pursued. Here, Bashmet's tempi were uncommonly
deliberate, the better to fathom the world-weary gentleness of this last
Bartok score. Without histrionics or overt virtuosity he gave it the
scathing candour of an unedited testament.
The OPO also played Stravinsky's 1919 Firebird suite, where Jansons
engineered quite original balances - we heard some bold harmonic relations
as if for the first time; and Dvorak's G major Symphony, darker and tauter
than usual. It had begun with Ragnar Soderlind's Trauermusik, composed a
quarter-century ago in response to the crushing of the Prague Spring: tough
and terse (just 8 minutes long) but laden with complex feeling, rendered in
sure orchestral strokes. Though Soderlind is no modernist, he sounds like a
real composer whom we should know better.
*****
On Monday the orchestra made Strauss's Alpine Symphony a continuously
gripping and enjoyable experience, bursting with colour and energy - and
this in spite of two handicaps that in other circumstances could well have
proved onerous, or even insupportable.
The first, of course, is that the work itself is twaddle virtually from
beginning to end. The second is that the Oslo Philharmonic is not a 'native'
Strauss orchestra. Yet so brightly enthusiastic was the Oslo attack, so
unflagging the players' appetite, that even your reviewer, the most erratic
of Straussians, was won over.
The concert, which was televised live on BBC-2 and broadcast on Radio 3,
opened with Alfred Schnittke's (K)ein Sommernachtstraum of 1983, a rather
strenuous comic squib in the manner of Charles Ives. It then offered the
Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Midori, the Japanese Wunderkind, making
her Proms debut. In the reflective passages she was lyrical, tender,
velvety, exquisite; in the bravura ones rather effortful, unsparkling, as
though diligently repeating a lesson carefully learned but incompletely
absorbed.

At midnight every British terrestrial television channel will be showing an
old Hollywood movie. Oldest of the four is The Boogie Man Will Get You (C4)
of which the late Leslie Halliwell said, in his Film Guide, 'Desper ately
unfunny spoof notable only for the fact that it was attempted with these
players at that time'. The main players are Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre,
the time 1944. Karloff tries to build supermen out of travelling salesmen.
The Fountainhead, (BBC2) made by King Vidor in 1949, stars Gary Cooper and
Patricia Neal. The Time Out Film Guide says 'Most bizarre movie in both
Vidor's and Cooper's filmographies, this adaptation of Ayn Rand's first
novel mutes Ms Rand's neo-Nietzschean philosophy of 'objectivism' but lays
on the expressionist symbolism with a free enterprise trowel.'
Tarzan The Ape Man (11.05 BBC1) is the 1981 film in which Bo Derek plays
Jane as a 'Miss Wet Tee Shirt' contestant. Best of the four is Chinatown
made by Roman Polanski in 1974 as a pastiche of forties' film noir. Jack
Nicholson plays the Chandler style detective in 1930s Los Angeles.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: It's comic time (again) on the Fringe - Antony
Thorncroft checks out the Perrier short list but finds that wiser comedians
come with more packaging / The Edinburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an awful lot of (awful) comedy infesting the Fringe this year which
forced the poor Perrier judges, looking for the best comedian, to check out
over 100 shows. They have come up with a short list of seven, one of whom
receives on Saturday night a smallish cheque and, on past experience, a nice
television contract.
Corky and the Juice Pigs is a high energy Canadian comedy band. The rest are
stand ups. Lee Evans is the Norman Wisdom of our age; Phil Kay is Scots and
calls up strangers on the phone to pad out his act; Greg Proops is American
and features in crisp commercials; Parrot is bleakly tough and naturally
another Scot; Johnny Meres was once Johnny Immaterial; and Donna McPhail is
not Scots but a woman and the likely winner.
A lot of fuss, much of it from McPhail herself, has been made of the fact
that she chose her Edinburgh show to come out as a lesbian, although she is
quick to add 'I'm not a proper lesbian; I don't fancy KD Lang.' Sexuality
forms a good chunk of her act at the Gilded Balloon (after all this is the
Fringe) but then so do other favourite topics for routines, like women's
changing rooms and long train journeys. McPhail is confident; masterful in a
Head Girly sort of way; and funny.
Asking 'Why 'Grease, the Musical'? Do we imagine it is 'Grease, the
Lubricant'?' she adds, 'Still there are people prepared to pay to watch a
ton of lard - it's called opera.' She also asks the perennial question:
'What do lesbians do in bed?' And answers it 'Try and get some sleep, but
its difficult with so many people watching through the window.'
The Perrier Award perpetuates stand-ups, but many comedians, and even more
paying punters, have lost interest in anal fixated anecdotes about the
performer's childhood, or oddball monologues about contact lenses and bodily
fluids. The wiser comedians come up with some packaging these days. For
Arthur Smith it is writing witty plays. His brilliant An Evening with Gary
Lineker seems destined to haunt Edinburgh for ever. His latest, Sod, (at the
Pleasance) will quickly disappear again underground.
We are just not interested why Frank decides to bury himself in his back
garden for four months. It is immaterial to the real play, which is Smith's
memories, conveyed through Frank's ten year old son, of the summer holidays
of childhood 'when it was always boiling hot and every pop song was a
classic.' This is a sketch too far, with slight whimsical charm.
Other comedians develop a character. Last year Graham Fellows turned up as
John Shuttleworth, a former security guard at a Rotherham sweet factory who
entertained the old folks on his Yamaha and was only too happy to pass on
tips on a career in show business. Shuttleworth is now more rounded and much
more pathetic. He somehow manages to re-incarnate John Major, the cabaret
artist, if he had not stumbled on politics.
There are more awful songs which become worryingly catchy, like 'Up and down
like a bride's nightie', but the sadness of the eternal optimist who only
has unemployment, a bored wife, and trips to Texas Home Stores to look
forward to, is achingly conveyed. Shuttleworth captures the limited concerns
of the common man and in spite of all the banality, is very sympathetic. And
Fellows is very funny.
The other favoured form of comedy is the sketch show, taken to extremes by
Stewart Lee and Richard Herring in Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World. This
is a case of comic regression. Most fringe performers spend the next year
regurgitating their material on the radio; Lee and Herring's act has already
been aired on Radio 4.
They attempt to answer the Big Ones: do ghosts exist?; are monsters real?;
and although they are as unstructured as student humorists they are
extremely amusing, not least in the running gag on Herring's sexual
inexperience. The climax, when Lee re-writes the Dead Sea Exercise Book, in
which the future is ordained, is as nicely argued a piece of comic
surrealism as you will find anywhere.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Technology: Epilepsy drugs enter a new era - The size of the
anti-convulsant drugs market is about to double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of drugs to treat epilepsy is set to transform the
anti-convulsant market and the lives of the 53m people afflicted with the
condition worldwide.
After nearly 15 years without new treatment, four drugs are being launched
for the condition which affects about 3m people in Europe, a similar number
in Japan and 2.5m in the US.
Analysts at Merrill Lynch, the US investment house, believe the new
medicines will, within the next few years, double the size of the worldwide
anti-epileptic market. At present the sector is small, worth only Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 857m) in 1992. Most existing treatments are off-patent and are
therefore cheap.
The four new drugs expected to drive market growth are: Felbatol, developed
by Carter-Wallace of the US and marketed outside America by Schering-Plough;
Neurontin developed by Warner-Lambert, the US group; Lamictal, discovered by
Wellcome of the UK; and Sabril, developed by US Marion Merrell Dow.
Additional compounds in development include Trileptal from Ciba of
Switzerland.
The new treatments are expected to be more effective than existing therapies
at controlling epileptic seizures and to have fewer side effects. The
established medicines include Warner-Lambert's Dilantin which has more than
50 per cent of the US market, Ciba's Tegretol, with 24 per cent of the
market, and Abbott's Depakote.
Existing treatments unfortunately do not prevent seizures in about 30 per
cent of patients, and all epileptics taking them risk side-effects.
The drugs' effectiveness is dose related - the higher the dose the more
effective they become. But as patients' intakes are increased to improve the
control of their epilepsy, so they tend to suffer more side-effects -
drowsiness, depression, weight gain, impaired gait and hair loss. In rare
cases, the medicines prove so toxic they can kill.
The side-effects mean that from 42 per cent to 60 per cent of patients fail
to comply with medication, according to the UK's Office of Health Economics,
a pharmaceutical research organisation.
In failing to take drugs properly, those susceptible increase the risk of
seizures. One study suggests missed doses and lack of sleep accounted for
about 79 per cent of seizures.
Trevor Flannagan, strategic business manager at Wellcome says: 'Epilepsy is
the most serious central nervous system problem confronting us. The
epileptic population is seriously disadvantaged, with a significant
proportion whose lives are significantly affected by seizures or
side-effects or both.'
'We need to have better products on both the safety and efficacy count,'
says Mark Pierce, vice-president clinical research for the central nervous
system at Warner-Lambert.
The established generation of medicines were mostly developed through the
classical method of widespread screening projects in the 1960s or 1970s,
although Dilantin was patented in 1938.
Since the 1970s, however, scientists have been using improved knowledge of
the biochemical process of epilepsy to design compounds. Researchers have
discovered that epilepsy is caused at least in part through the
malfunctioning of naturally occurring amino acids that act as
neurotransmitters.
Normally, the electrical activity in the brain's nerves is regulated by two
classes of amino acids. The first are excitatory amino acids such as
aspartate and glutamate, thought to help stimulate electrical signals from
one nerve to another.
The second class of amino acids is inhibitors, the most important being
gamma aminobutyric acid, known as Gaba. Their function is to stabilise
electrical activity in the brain. To do this, they open certain channels in
the membrane of the nerve ending that are designed to admit negatively
charged ions. Once the negative ions have been let into the nerve ending -
or neuron - it becomes incapable of firing electrical signals. To be able to
fire, the neuron has to be positively charged. The more Gaba available, the
slower the neurons' firing rate.
In most common forms of epilepsy, the normal balance between the excitatory
amino acids and the regulatory ones breaks down. The result is the brain's
nerve endings start firing electrical signals out of control, triggering
neighbouring neurons until a seizure takes place.
The earlier drugs, Dilantin and Tegretol, worked by preventing the excessive
signals being triggered. Scientists are unsure of exactly how the prevention
mechanism worked. Some believe it blocked certain channels in the neurons'
membrane that allow positively charged ions such as sodium to pass into the
neuron. Once the neurons are positively charged they have greater potential
to trigger excessive electrical signals.
More recently, researchers have been following two main theoretical routes.
The first is to discourage the production or action of the excitatory amino
acids. This would prevent the seizure spreading through the brain. The
second route is to enhance levels of Gaba, the regulatory substance, and so
stop the seizure by stabilising the neurons.
The first of the new medicines to be given a licence in the US by the Food
and Drug Administration is Carter Wallace's Felbatol, which gained approval
this month.
Peder Jensen, vice-president for clinical research at Schering Plough
Research Institute, says the drug was discovered through traditional
techniques rather than rational drug design, following a mass-screening
programme by the US National Institutes of Health at the beginning of the
1980s.
Scientists are still struggling to find out how it works, admits Jensen. One
study of patients whose previous medication was ineffective, showed a 34 per
cent reduction in seizure frequency compared with a 9 per cent fall among
those on placebo. The drug also has low toxicity, allowing for safe higher
dosing.
Felbatol's main drawback is that it interacts with existing medications such
as Dilantin. This is important because few patients are willing to swap
medications, and at best will only add to their regimen - the majority,
whose seizures are under control, have little incentive to switch to an
unknown medication. Jensen says the interactions are predictable and can be
avoided.
Warner-Lambert's Neurontin was designed with the knowledge of at least some
of the biochemical processes of epilepsy. The drug is an analogue of an
amino acid and is supposed to emulate Gaba.
Elizabeth Garofalo, associate director of clinical research at the company,
says that although the compound was synthesised to mimic Gaba, it does not
appear to do so. It does reduce seizures, however. One theory is it affects
aspartate and glutamate, the excitatory amino acids. It does not interact
with other drugs.
Marion Merrell Dow's Sabril was also designed with knowledge of the
biochemical processes. Its unique mechanism is that it inhibits the
production of an enzyme that breaks down Gaba and so increases Gaba levels
in the brain.
Wellcome's Lamictal appears to work by preventing the excessive release of
glutamate. It probably does this by blocking the sodium channels.
Ciba's Trileptal also interferes with the sodium channels in the membrane of
the neuron, although it may also open potassium channels, according to
Markus Schmutz, head of the company's pre-clinical epilepsy project.
Most of the new drugs are being recommended as add-on therapies because
there have been few trials testing them as single treatments.
'They are all in their infancy. We are at the start of a very long process
as we start the long-term comparative trials,' says Pierce.
It is too early to know which drugs will win commercially. With luck, the
winners will be those coping with epilepsy on a day-to-day basis.
The series will continue next month with an article on diabetes.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Property: Back to the basics - Investment funds have reached
a new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUSSELL SCHILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property investment market turned up decisively in May, bringing the
first good news in four years to a depressed sector. There was a change of
mood, and with it a feeling that values had hit bottom and the decline was
over.
Yields have come down, even for central London offices. Although rents are
still dropping, the fall in yields is enough to nudge values up. The reason
for the change is not hard to identify: the amount of money available for
investment in property is the highest for more than 10 years.
Hillier Parker, the surveyor, has compiled a list of 145 buyers, each with
at least Pounds 10m to spend and with aggregate available funds of Pounds
7.25bn.
The contrast with the late-1980s period of heady development activity is
best illustrated by the experience of insurance companies, whose annual net
flow of investment into property barely topped Pounds 2bn in any one year in
the 1980s. The 29 insurance companies on the Hillier Parker list alone now
have a total of Pounds 2.7bn to spend.
Most buyers are competing for a fairly narrow band of property where the
quality of the tenant's covenant - financial strength - is of prime
importance. There is a shortage of property in this band, so unless
insurance companies relax their requirements, they will fail to find a home
for their billions.
Now the market has turned, the nub of the problem for investors is the
mismatch of supply and demand. There is plenty of property to buy, much of
it held by the banks, but with empty space still a problem, buyers have not
yet been prepared to offer attractive prices unless the conditions of a
first-class covenant are relaxed.
A few brave souls bought in 1992, encouraged to do so by three main factors.
First, in the short term they gambled on yields coming down when the
investing herd followed them into the market. This would protect them
against the continuing slide in rents.
Second, if the covenant was good, which it usually was, they would gain a
secure medium-term income at little risk and with better returns than gilts.
Finally, in the longer term, there might be a faint prospect of genuine
rental growth. In summary, the short, medium and long-term grounds for
buying could add up to a combination of good capital growth and a
high-yielding income stream.
The position today is less attractive for investors wishing to buy
properties with good covenants. This is because the opportunity for
anticipating the turn in the market has passed. Yields could fall further,
driven by the volume of money available for investment and greater
confidence in the economy, but it is already too late to gain the full
benefit from falling yields.
The next stage of recovery in the investment market is dependent, in part,
on a relaxation of the demanding definition of good covenant.
Reliance on covenant was a natural haven during the recession. It led to
preference being given to a poor property with a good tenant compared with a
good property occupied by an insecure tenant. The normal property criteria
of modern specification and accessible location leading to healthy tenant
demand were given less weight than certainty of income.
Eventually the balance between covenant strength and a property's
fundamental attractions seems certain to tip in favour of the latter.
Recovery will lead first to a reduction in the danger of a tenant defaulting
on the rent. Next will come a pick-up in tenant demand, and finally empty
space will start to be filled.
This will all take time, and the naturally cautious institutional buyers
will be reluctant to relax their desire for secure income until they are
sure it is safe to do so. The effect will be to give opportunities for
bolder investors to get into the market ahead of them, as happened in 1992
and the early part of this year.
As the property market slowly returns to being a growth investment there
will be an increasing distinction between 'prime' and 'secondary'
properties.
Property will be rated according to its size, specification and location,
and to the extent it satisfies the needs of the market and can generate
rental growth. Having a good tenant is only part of the criteria; if the
property specifics are good a departing tenant can be replaced.
Describing pre-recession prime property stills feels a bit like indulging in
nostalgia. The past four years have left deep scars which will leave
investors sceptical about property for years to come. Despite this, the
focus on covenant is starting to recede and property investment is coming
back to basics.

The concept of a single personal telephone number, that follows the consumer
from home to work and into the car, may seem alluring. But the technology
research company Ovum is cautious about whether UPT (universal personal
telecommunications) will gain widespread acceptance.
In its report, 'Personal Numbering Services: the Business Opportunities for
UPT', Ovum forecasts that only 132m European customers will subscribe to the
service within the next 10 years and 156m in the US. This will result in
projected revenues of Dollars 6.8bn (Pounds 4.56bn) per annum in Europe and

Biometric security devices - retina scanning, for example - rely on complex

device developed by Visage, of Buckinghamshire, relies on one person
recognising another, and could be sold for as little as Pounds 20.
The Visage system flashes a matrix of several faces on to the screen. The
users have previously scanned into the computer photos of people they know -
partner or sibling, say - who resemble each other. They then pick the three
pictures from a dozen on the screen. The user then taps in the numbers of
the sequence in which the faces appeared.
The faces cannot be forgotten. Nor can the user write down the 'answer' as

FT  27 AUG 93 / Property: Market stabilises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property market continued to recover in July as yields fell
for the fifth consecutive month, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group, writes Vanessa Houlder.
The aggregate equivalent yield fell by 0.09 points to 9.7 per cent. Capital
growth and total returns remained at 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent,
indicating a stabilising market. Although rental values are still falling,
the rate of decline is slower at 0.7 per cent, compared with 0.9 per cent in
June.
In the seven months to July 1993, net investment in property averaged Pounds
6.9m a month. This is a turnaround from the average Pounds 5.4m that was
disinvested each month during 1992.
The decline in capital growth slowed by 1 percentage point, from -6.3 per
cent for the year to June, to -5.2 per cent for the year to July. Rental
value growth for the year was more or less unchanged at -10.7 per cent.
The office sector recorded a positive year-on-year return of 0.2 per cent
for the first time in three years. Retail property retained its position as
best performing sector in July, returning 1.4 per cent against 1.5 per cent
in June.

FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Queens Moat picks finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the European hotels chain whose shares have been
suspended since March pending a fundamental restructuring of Pounds 1bn of
debt, has found a new finance director.
Andrew de Poidevin, like the new chief executive, Andrew Coppel, has been
acting as a consultant at Queens Moat since April.
The appointment will bring together the same team that was at the helm when
the mini-conglomerate, Sale Tilney, went into receivership early this year;
the two executives worked together in the corporate finance department at
Morgan Grenfell.
De Poidevin then went to the corporate finance department of Prudential
Bache before spending more than 18 months as finance director at Sale
Tilney. His appointment is understood to have been supported by the creditor
banks.
Coppel announced the appointment at a gloom-laden annual general meeting at
which no additional information was given on the progress of the refinancing
and restructuring, though he said that the process of putting Queens Moat
back on to a sound footing would take up to three years. Shareholders were
almost universally dismayed that John Bairstow, the company founder under
whose chairmanship the company grew rapidly and then crashed, was not
available to face their wrath after his resignation last week.
Coppel said a new UK hotels division had already been formed and would put
much greater marketing focus into UK operations. Business in the hotels had
been hit by the financial problems but stability had been restored;
occupancy rates had begun to pick up.
Shareholders at the AGM - which will be reconvened once the 1992 accounts
are available - approved the increase in Queen's Moat's borrowing limits to
Pounds 2bn, thereby removing the link between debt limit and the shrinking
asset base.
Coppel could not say when the suspension of dealings in Queens Moat shares
would be lifted.

<TEXT>
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry operator which is planning to open one
of the UK's first US-style warehouse clubs, has announced that David Rowley,
deputy chairman, will retire next March. Rowley has been with the company
for 24 years, and became managing director in 1987. He had been deputy
chairman since 1991, overseeing property development, legal matters and
welfare.
N&amp;P says it will not nominate another deputy chairman; it is happy with the
remaining structure of chairman, Richard Fulford, and group managing
director, David Poole.
It is, however, adding another executive director. Alex Rentoul (right), 41,
currently running Sandler Rentoul Associates, joins the board from October,
with responsibility for corporate development, strategic planning and new
business development.
Rentoul qualified as an accountant and has worked previously in strategic
planning and corporate development roles with Imperial Group and Booz Allen
&amp; Hamilton. He knows N&amp;P well; with Sandler Rentoul he carried out strategic
consultancy for N&amp;P, including advising on its warehouse club plans.
N&amp;P is also appointing Roger Strachan, 62, former finance director of Nestle
UK, as a non-executive director.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Management: Need to keep the change machine under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There could hardly be a clearer contrast between a lame management and a
sprightly one than the ways in which Eastman Kodak and ABB are grasping the
cactus of transformational change. Each announced last week that it is
cutting more jobs: Kodak 10,000, ABB 7,000. But there any resemblance ends.
Kodak's action is belated and defensive, as it struggles to save its
crumbling world after decades of inertia in the face of surging competitive
pressure. ABB's move is timely and aggressive: it will help it retain the
lead it seized five years ago in remoulding its global sector, raising its
industry's productivity standards, and accelerating its own business and
management processes. This last objective will also be served by the
streamlining of its international organisation which was unveiled this week.
The two companies' attitudes to the management of change are coincidentally
analogous to the nature of their core businesses: on the one hand, a
specialist in static images, on the other a company which makes flywheels of
power. To Kodak, change has been a stop-start series of isolated,
intermittent initiatives. But to ABB, since its creation in 1988 out of
sprightly Asea and lumbering Brown Boveri, change has been a continuously
evolving process which companies must anticipate and shape before their
rivals do.
There are no prizes for guessing which approach is more necessary or
effective in today's business climate. Companies of all shapes, sizes and
nationalities may, like Kodak, yearn for the comfortable days when change
could be an intermittent process, in which one project or initiative could
be completed before the next began. But all sorts of radical changes now
need to be initiated in quick succession, and run either in parallel or as
an integrated whole.
This point is brought home with a bang by a survey on 'change management'
which is about to be published by KPMG Management Consulting, an arm of KPMG
Peat Marwick*. Most of its corporate respondents are running four or more
different types of cross-functional change programmes. With ample
justification, KPMG doubts whether many of them are being properly
integrated.
The survey, of top executives in 250 medium-sized and large British
companies, comes up with mixed conclusions. On the plus side, the majority
of respondents (85 per cent) intend to persevere over the next three years
with most of the fundamental change programmes that they are already
running, in such areas as total quality management, customer care, culture
change and empowerment. They do not plan to dump or downgrade these existing
initiatives in favour of the latest type of radical programme to hit the
scene, business process redesign (or re-engineering).
The survey was carried out before re-engineering hit the headlines in Europe
early this summer, but an updated mini-poll a month ago shows TQM and
customer care still retaining their popularity in spite of widespread
problems with TQM and a surge in plans to introduce re-engineering.
That is good news for those who feared that, as in the US, re-engineering
would become the sudden, all-consuming flavour of the year. The US mania
contrasts with the good sense of ABB, which has run co-ordinated programmes
on TQM, 'customer focus' (as it calls it), business process redesign,
culture change and employee empowerment almost since its formation and
expects them to continue indefinitely.
Thanks to ABB's careful integration of its programmes, and the restless,
change-minded culture which it has bred, it has suffered less than other
companies from 'change fatigue'. This is almost certainly not the case for
many of the companies in KPMG's sample - over a quarter of the total - which
claim to have undertaken 10 or more change initiatives in the last three
years.
KPMG is remarkably mild about the severe problems that change fatigue can
cause. It warns only of the need to co-ordinate and prioritise 'so that the
change machine does not get out of control'.
A more forceful and appropriate comment was made recently by the rival
Boston Consulting Group. Warning of 'the danger of doing too much', BCG
reported that many large US companies now had up to 15 'process improvement'
initiatives under way, but that these seldom added up to a coherent
programme.
In such cases, warned BCG, employees become so overloaded that they
gravitate towards easily resolvable problems, and avoid the big ones. Tough
cross-functional issues are ignored, and sacred cows continue to fatten.
General managers grow increasingly sceptical, failing to see a link between
all the improvement programmes and the bottom line.
On the last point, KPMG lets its gentlemanly stance slip a bit. It scratches
its head over the fact that only 31 per cent of its respondents thought
their programmes were 'very effective', and is rightly concerned that
managers identified few tangible gauges of effectiveness. As it suggests,
all sorts of measures should be carried out periodically, of staff
attitudes, customer perceptions, and operational efficiency. Plus, of course
wherever it can be identified, the impact of each programme on the 'bottom
line'.
The lesson of all this is not that companies should drop change programmes
which have turned tricky, but that they should put more effort into
preparing, implementing and co-ordinating them - especially as events twist
and turn, as they always will. If companies cannot face that prospect, they
will land themselves in the same mire as Kodak.

FT  27 AUG 93 / People: Rowlands to become double commissioner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gill Rowlands, commissioner for the rights of trade union members, will have
an additional task from the end of the month when she becomes commissioner
for protection against unlawful industrial action.
Admitting that it is 'a very new concept', Rowlands explains: 'I've not had
much notice of this; we have no idea - the legal framework apart - of what
will happen.' Asked how the idea had arisen for the relevant legislation,
the 1993 Trade Union and Employment Rights Act, she replied, honestly
enough: 'I have no idea; I just do the job.'
However, if her first commission is anything to go by, she is unlikely to be
swept off her feet, and her five-man office in Warrington will probably
cope. As friend of unhappy trade union members since 1988, she has fielded
some 1,000 enquiries, 200 of which turned into applications for funding. A
preference for settling out of court means very little is heard of her
actions, nor, of course, are many senior trade union figures involved. 'We
get an awful lot of Jo Bloggses,' says the 63-year-old barrister.
Now, if Bloggs qua member of the public feels he is being deprived of goods
and services because of unlawful industrial action, he can apply to Rowlands
for funds to bring proceedings in the High Court.
Unlawful strikes being a pretty rare event in Britain these days, she
expects most of her work to come from regional instances of secondary
picketing, blacking, and so on.
While she has kept a fairly low profile in her last job, she draws attention
to certain difficulties, notably the fact that 'you mustn't canvas members,
or else you are taken for a union-basher. By now most trade union members
know I exist.' For the new commission, the publicity task will perhaps be a
little more pressing.

FT  27 AUG 93 / Management: Running the show - Puma's new boss is blending
US and German styles / Euromanagers to watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 30 years of age, Jochen Zeitz, the new head of Puma, is so young he even
has a few years' advantage over some of the top athletes sponsored by the
sports shoe and clothing company. By the standards of German business, where
top executives in their 40s are a rarity, he is just out of kindergarten.
Linford Christie, the British sprinter who sped to victory in the men's 100m
at last week's world athletics championships in Stuttgart, is his senior. So
is Merlene Ottey, the Jamaican who won the women's 200m. Both are 33.
Christie paraded his Puma allegiance when warming up for the 100m relay, in
which Britain was beaten by the US team. 'Biggest, baddest, best' was
emblazoned on his T-shirt, which carried his individual sprint time of 9.87
seconds and the Puma logo. Stuttgart was good news for Puma, which needs all
the promotional help it can get. Now owned by Aritmos, the Swedish sports
and leisure group, it has had a rough ride since its non-voting shares were
floated on the German stock market in 1986.
In common with Adidas, its larger rival - both are based in the north
Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach and were founded by members of the Dassler
family - it has suffered from the market onslaught of aggressive US
competitors such as Nike and Reebok. The German companies were slow to react
to changing tastes. Today, Puma is only a bit player in the US market,
though it is rebuilding its position, and is under pressure from its Swedish
owner to put on a stronger financial performance.
Zeitz is the man chosen by Aritmos to do this. He is Puma's fourth chief
executive in two years. A former Colgate-Palmolive marketing employee with
experience in the US and Germany, he was at Puma for four years before his
promotion to the top job. His ascendancy reflects a more aggressive approach
at Aritmos - which yesterday announced a first-half loss of SKr116m (Pounds
9.7m) - under the influence of its new 44 per cent shareholder, the
Proventus investment group with the hands-on management style.
Zeitz admits he was somewhat surprised to be given the job - not so much
because of his age, but because his three predecessors had all come from
outside the company. As marketing director, however, Zeitz made his mark by
shaking up the division and injected US-style methods he had learnt at
Colgate.
'The key points they (Aritmos) were looking for were - experience in the
sports goods sector and international thinking, but also knowledge of German
specifics, which a German understands better than a foreigner. That's why
they decided on me.'
Today, he reckons German companies are not just seeking an international
education, but also experience abroad. 'You have to be able to react
flexibly to different situations. You need wide horizons and you have to
understand different opinions, views and cultures. You can't do this with a
purely German mentality.'
Zeitz, a doctor's son whose business education began at the European
Business School near Wiesbaden, appears every inch the young, clean-cut
German manager.
He believes in fast decision-making, minimal hierarchies, and total
communication with fellow managers. In the past, he says, 'decisions were
handed out by the board whose members kept things very much to themselves.'
Much has changed since the company was run by the Dasslers, and Zeitz is not
the first boss with international experience. After Puma started struggling
in 1986, the family brought in Hans Woitschatzke as chief executive.
Formerly in the pharmaceutical, printing and ski industries, Woitschatzke
had worked in Canada, Venezuela and the US, as well as Germany. He left Puma
in 1991, having returned it to a small profit which then evaporated in 1992.
With much of the world now in recession, including Germany, which accounts
for more than half the company's turnover, Zeitz has had to implement a
rapid restructuring programme. This has involved closure of the shoe plant
in Germany - most supplies already came from the far east - extensive job
cuts, and the creation of profit centres for the international (licensing
and distribution), German, foreign subsidiaries (including other European
markets, Australia and Asia), and Hong Kong-based purchasing activities. He
has cut down on company cars and said all travel should be economy class.
'My aim is to make changes as quickly as possible, so this comprehensive
restructuring was done in two months. The need is not to do things
step-by-step, but deal with problems at once.' Since Puma is by no means a
corporate giant, with turnover of DM513m (Pounds 202m) in 1992, an 11 per
cent drop on 1991 - licence business lifted this to DM1.2bn - such sweeping
changes can be introduced more readily than at a larger group such as
Volkswagen.
With Aritmos, driven by the performance-oriented Proventus, looking over
Zeitz's shoulder, the pressure to perform is even greater. Because of the
restructuring costs, Puma will make an increased loss this year, a return to
profit being the goal for 1995.
Rapid decisions are essential, Zeitz believes. 'Sometimes, it's better to
make an early decision that's not 100 per cent right than none at all,' he
says in a most un-German comment.
He draws two important lessons from his experience of running a German
company with a Swedish shareholder. Firstly, the German consensus-minded way
of doing things, however laudable its long-term strategic aims, is often too
inflexible and laden with compromise in these days of fast-moving markets,
consumer preferences and product innovation.
Secondly, he believes other countries can learn much from Swedish
management. 'There are good things in the German and US management styles,
but the Swedish approach is a good combination. On the one hand, there is
the long-term vision and the sense of continuity, as in Germany. But there
is also the fast pragmatic decision-making which is the positive side of the
US practice.'
For Zeitz this means Puma has to do more than just sell shoes to make money.
It has to put across a convincing image. At Stuttgart, the triumphs of
Christie, Ottey, and Colin Jackson, the world record 110m hurdle champion, -
a mere lad at 26 - helped publicise the Puma name.
'We want people with charisma, not just those who are number one,' Zeitz
stresses. 'The consumer identifies with the image of a brand not just the
product. We've got to communicate what the product stands for.'
